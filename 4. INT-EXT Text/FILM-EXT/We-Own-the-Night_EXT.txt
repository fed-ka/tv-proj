A modern church. A big crowd in front, made up of POLICE.
We HEAR MUSIC. CLOSE SHOT of a black outdoor sign, behind
glass. "OUR LADY, QUEEN OF MARTYRS CHURCH, QUEENS, NY".
TILT DOWN: WHITE PRESS-ON letters CROOKEDLY spelling out
"NYPD PULASKI SOCIETY MTG. - 7 PM". SUPERIMPOSE: "QUEENS".
The camera TILTS UP to an apartment window.
We CUT INSIDE:
Mob scene.
Bobby and Rosario and Louis and the gang enter.
22.
Bobby exits, walks toward the nearby SUBWAY STATION.
SPOTS
BURT, who's waiting for him. Bobby ignores him:
BURT GRUSINSKY
Where you going? I was the one who
got you outta there!
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
BOBBY GREEN
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.
BURT GRUSINSKY
You're a real big shot, aren't you!
You see what happened in there last
night? Hey--I'm talking to you!
Burt grabs his son's arm.
Moves closer:
BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
You know, you and your
girlfriend're only getting off
`cause of your brother. Up to me,
you'd sit in there another couple
days.
Bobby looks around. Nobody's listening. He opens up.
With quiet but real fury, and total sarcasm:
BOBBY GREEN
Okay, I'll go thank him too then.
He comes in, raids the fuckin'
place--now I gotta go beg `em not
to fire me--
BURT GRUSINSKY
Fire you?! From what? Probably
the best thing that ever happened
to you!
BOBBY GREEN
Fuck you, Pop.
Fuck the both of
you's.
Enraged, Burt SLAPS his SON on the side of the head:
BURT GRUSINSKY
Don't EVER speak to me like that
again. You hear me? I'll rap you
right in the mouth!
BOBBY GREEN
You fuckin' touch me!? You gonna
fuckin' touch me?!?
Bobby COCKS HIS FIST. BUT BURT IS READY. A STANDOFF.
Then Bobby decides against it, bolts. On BURT as we GO TO:
Joseph drives up to the house, a working-class part of
Queens. He parks the car.
Joseph drops his keys as he exits. Reaching down for them
on the asphalt, he HEARS a SOUND and LOOKS up and to his
left. A MAN WITH A HOOD OVER HIS HEAD. Looks almost like
an old-time Klansman, with two holes cut into the hood for
his eyes. He's pointing a GUN RIGHT AT JOSEPH. Joseph's
eyes pop, and he lets out a quick gasp--but he has no real
time to react. The man pulls the trigger.
A THUNDERCLAP slaps the silence in the neighborhood:
THE
GUN HAS FIRED. A FLASH OF LIGHT.
A MIST OF BLOOD plumes around Joseph's head. The bullet
hits Joseph in the face, through the CHEEK. HE snaps back
spasmodically.
AN AUTOMOBILE, a MONTE CARLO, pulls up to the scene of the
crime. Another HOODED MAN in the back seat throws what
looks like a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL into Joseph's CAR. The AUTO
starts to BURN. Joseph lies on the sidewalk, bullet in the
head, his blood everywhere. He seems pretty dead to us.
The Monte Carlo SPEEDS OFF.
Joseph, on the ground. The car burns in relative silence.
Dogs barking in the neighborhood. A beat.
Bobby walks briskly to the entrance. MEDIA are all around,
but they aren't paying attention to him. They are
elsewhere, with members of the police, each other, etc....
It's a huge municipal structure.
Bobby bolts inside.
Bobby looks down the hall.
He SEES his father, talking to
a CROWD of UNIFORMED COPS.
Burt sees him, keeps talking.
Bobby touches his arm.
BOBBY GREEN
Pop, I gotta talk to you.
BURT GRUSINSKY
I'm working.
BOBBY GREEN
It's important--I got information.
Bobby pulls his father aside, looks around to be sure the
two of them are out of earshot of others. Forcefully:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
It's about you.
Burt is surprised.
His attention sharpens:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
It's bad.
Burt realizes the severity.
Then we HEAR:
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
MICHAEL SOLO (O.S.)
Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding
me!
Burt and Jack and Michael. Burt is talking to the others
in front of the hospital, but we are in WIDE SHOT, and we
can't HEAR them. Burt shakes their hands, then walks
inside. Mike and Jack walk in the opposite direction...
BOBBY stands inside an abandoned parking kiosk. (He's been
watching from afar.) Jack and Mike approach their parked
car. He tries to obscure himself partially inside the
kiosk. They see him.
BOBBY GREEN
You been up to see my brother...?
MICHAEL SOLO
Yeah. Your father's still with him-
-we were just gonna go back to the
PSA. Try and figure out a tac plan
on Nezhinski.
BOBBY GREEN
...How's that been goin'...?
MICHAEL SOLO
We don't got much yet, but we'll do
our best.
(BEAT)
You all right?
Bobby hesitates, then reveals himself completely:
BOBBY GREEN
Well I... I been thinking...if you
could keep it confidential...?
(BEAT)
I'd make the connection for you.
MICHAEL SOLO
C'MON--BOBBY--
BOBBY GREEN
They trust me--we could go in
large, use my money for the buy,
they won't suspect anything--
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
MICHAEL SOLO
It's too dangerous--you heard your
father.
BOBBY GREEN
(EMOTIONAL)
He don't gotta know anything about
it. Does he?
MICHAEL SOLO
If anything went wrong, he'd never
forgive us.
BOBBY GREEN
I know.
(BEAT)
It's just--I realized...
(strains to utter)
....my father dies `cause of all
this, I couldn't live my life
knowing I coulda done something.
(looks at both men)
I know the same is true for you.
I
know it is.
ANGLE ON MICHAEL, JACK.
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
So please--can we do this...?
Jack, Michael turn to each other.
Then: ANGLE ON BOBBY.
PRELAP a PHONE RINGING:
A MAN #1 stands by a bench, almost floating in the fog. He
is stocky, dressed in a down vest. Bobby enters the frame,
trepidatious; he and the man eye each other for a moment,
then Bobby holds out the beeper. The man takes it.
MAN #1 takes out A KEL DEVICE LISTENING UNIT and its
accessories. Among them, a CIGARETTE LIGHTER. He UNSCREWS
THE LIGHTER. Complex electronic innards.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
MAN #1
Your wire's in here--we're gonna
follow the signal. Find the stash
house and make the deal, you leave
the rest to us.
BOBBY GREEN
You gonna leave me all alone out
there?
MAN #1
(shrugs; then)
I ain't gonna lie to you.
There's
always a risk.
Man #1 hands Bobby the LIGHTER.
He FIRES it.
It works.
MAN #1 (CONT'D)
Your cover's blown, call for help--
don't try and be a hero. Just get
outta the way--place could turn
into a butcher shop. Talk about
pussy--that'll be our signal to
come in early.
BOBBY GREEN
You come up with that one all by
yourself?
MAN #1
(ignores the joke)
Just do the deal and get out. Bear
in mind, your life is in that
lighter. Anything goes wrong, the
department'll get word to your
father.
The Man unceremoniously turns to leave.
Then, suddenly:
MAN #1 (CONT'D)
And oh--G.Q. told me to tell you--
your brother's coming along real
good. They reset his jaw and
sometimes he's awake.
Bobby acknowledges that with a single nod of his head. The
man departs. Bobby grasps the lighter tight, looks at the
man as he virtually disappears back into the fog...
The famous Brighton Beach boardwalk. Bobby stands in the
cold, waiting, holding his bag of money. Alone. Takes out
the LIGHTER, the LISTENING DEVICE. He fires it--it works.
Looks at his watch. In rummaging through his pockets for a
smoke, he finds a little slip of paper with a phone number
on it. He APPROACHES a nearby PHONE BOOTH. Bobby holds
the paper in his hand, dials the number. A voice answers:
MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
Hello?
Bobby says nothing.
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (PHONE FILTER)
Hello...?
Bobby SEES Pavel's CAR DRIVE UP.
Bobby hangs up the phone.
Takes a deep breath. We HEAR:
PAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE (O.S.)
Dude!
Hey, dude!
Bobby approaches the car. Pavel is in the back seat,
calling to him with the window open.
PAVEL LUBYARSKY
Get in!
Bobby approaches the automobile. Pavel is in the back
seat, calling to him with the window open. Another
American sedan behind them. Bobby enters Pavel's.
The Livery Car makes another brutal SHARP LEFT, tires
screeching just slightly.
The Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange
residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere.
Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways
up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns
and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN
IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car.
They pull Bobby out:
68.
Bobby FALLS roughly twenty feet through the air. His body
tumbles upside-down, toward a wrought-iron FENCE that
surrounds the base of the apartment building's side.
Bobby HITS the FENCE. His LEG GETS CAUGHT on one of the
small spikes. He SCREAMS as we GO BACK TO:
74.
Cop cars pull up by the dozen, from EVERYWHERE. Out of one
comes BURT GRUSINSKY, carrying a shotgun. He charges right
into the structure...
Bobby is upside-down, hanging from the fence, but he is
alert. Two members of the EMERGENCY SERVICES UNIT approach
him.
On sheer instinct alone, he starts to PULL his LEG off the
small SPIKE, his teeth clenched. An ARMY of ESU TROOPS and
PARAMEDICS come to BOBBY'S AID...
(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:
BOBBY is being lowered from the fence. An AMBULANCE ZOOMS
UP the STREET, to the alley. Burt rushes to his son.
Jack and Mike come right behind him. Bobby looks at his
father, his face nicked by many small cuts from the glass.
Sheepish, he cannot say a word and averts his father's
gaze.
BURT GRUSINSKY
Jesus.
EMERGENCY SERVICES GUY
He's gonna be okay, Chief.
(to others)
Clear out!
Burt eases when he hears this. They move Bobby toward the
ambulance. Burt turns to Michael. Sotto:
BURT GRUSINSKY
You guys go on a bust like this and
you don't tell me about it? You
think I'm born yesterday?
MICHAEL SOLO
I guess we do.
BURT GRUSINSKY
You're a real comedian! He's gonna
need to be in protection now!
Several POLICE CARS line the block. There are ARMED
OFFICERS perched on rooftops. As PROTECTION. Many of the
houses have "WELCOME HOME" banners hanging from them. The
media are here. NEIGHBORS are on their porches.
It's a cheesy hotel on Queens Boulevard. TWO UNMARKED CARS
pull up. Armed Guards exit the autos first, casing the
area. They're followed by Bobby.
Rosario leads Bobby back toward the ESCORT CAR.
He leans
forward, grabs her arm. Sotto but intense:
BOBBY GREEN
You gotta put everything in
jeopardy? Huh?
ROSARIO DIAZ
No! I was just dancing! I didn't
say nothing!
BOBBY GREEN
You know, I don't think you realize
how serious this is?
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
We gotta ride this out, `til this
fuckin' thing is over. `Til I can
get things back on track.
Looking down at the ground, she exhales. Hits the side of
a nearby car gently with the palm of her hand, frustrated.
ROSARIO DIAZ
Bobby, what do you want from me? I
can't go out, I can't do nothing--
it's like I'm in a jail--
BOBBY GREEN
I know. But I'm workin' on it, I
am.
(looks around; then)
Soon as the trial's over and I get
my money back outta impound--
everything'll get better, you'll
see.
She gets emotional.
Shrugs:
ROSARIO DIAZ
It's just, I feel...I feel like
it's just you and all those cops
all the time. And they look at me
like I'm a piece of shit.
Bobby tries to comfort her, reaches out to her arm.
As
tears come out of her eyes:
BOBBY GREEN
Rosario--once this's done, we'll go
down to Miami... [It'll] be a new
thing for us--a lotta
opportunities...
(BEAT)
I'll talk to Mr. Buzhayev about
working for his brother down there.
We'll get your mother to come too--
I'll even talk to Jumbo about it.
Slight comfort. She nods. Bobby leans over, kisses her.
He tenderly puts his hand on her face. She kisses his
hand. Their GUARDS are WATCHING. She smiles, and that
love returns:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
C'mon... Let's go back--this'll
all be over soon. I promise...
FADE OUT.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED: (2)
FADE IN:
Vadim Nezhinski is being led, in handcuffs, into an
unmarked Chevy. Both JOSEPH and Jack are here. Joseph and
Vadim exchange looks as Vadim is placed into the back seat.
Joe's expression is pure suppressed rage...
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
I'll go in the lead car. You stay
with him `til we get to the
A.D.A.'s.
JACK SHAPIRO
You got it...
Joseph gets in his lead car, also an unmarked Chevy.
Both
vehicles pull away from the curb...
Our characters are leaving the hotel, bags and all. The
RAIN comes down in SHEETS. They pause under the awning,
waiting for the cars to be brought close. Burt stands
under the awning, looking out at houses beyond the parking
lot. Rosario is rummaging through her suitcase as Bobby
stands nearby. Vitt approaches Burt:
VITT THE GUARD
Chief, we got three vehicles coming
around the corner. Backup's on the
way.
Burt nods, Vitt runs off. The sound of RAIN. Bobby is
putting his BULLETPROOF VEST on, SEES Burt STARING OUT.
BOBBY GREEN
You see something out there?
Burt shakes his head, moves to help with the vest:
BURT GRUSINSKY
Nah, we're good. It's just, I just
realized--I know this neighborhood.
I used to come with my father, to
work on the plumbing, for the
houses--brought me along to do the
talking. He only spoke Russian his
whole life...
(BEAT)
Anyway, it's all changed now.
A GUARD approaches:
GUARD
One more minute, Chief.
BURT GRUSINSKY
Arright...
BOBBY GREEN
Pop?
Joe come close this morning?
BURT GRUSINSKY
I don't know... I heard he did
good, though. You know, with
everything that's happened--who
knows? Maybe all this'll bring us
closer together someday.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
Once this is over, you and your
brother, you'll talk, you'll work
things out.
BOBBY GREEN
Yeah, maybe.
But you know the way
he is.
BURT GRUSINSKY
Bobby--your brother, I think he
probably feels a little guilty,
with everything you did, with you
in protection now... But he
appreciates what you've done--I
know he does.
Rosario is right behind them, listening. When Burt stares
at her, she averts his gaze. Burt changes course:
BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
Look, I'm just trying to keep us
together here, that's all. That's
all I want.
BOBBY GREEN
(relents a bit; nods)
I know, Pop.
Burt warms slightly, too. A beat, then the CARS PULL UP.
Bobby looks at his father with real feeling. Burt eyes
him, then touches Bobby's cheek, a truly loving gesture:
BURT GRUSINSKY
(almost to himself)
Okay...
(to an officer)
We'll move `em to Corona. I'll
lead the line.
Bobby takes Rosario's hand as we GO TO:
THREE CARS: Burt in one, heading the route. Behind him is
Bobby and Rosario's car, with guard Vitt behind the wheel
and the two of them in the back seat. A third car has TWO
OFFICERS in it. That vehicle trails the other two. The
CARS DRIVE OFF.
NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS TO BE SHOT IN A MOSTLY
SUBJECTIVE WAY, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON WITNESSING THE ACTION
AS OUR CHARACTERS WOULD.
93.
Through the RAIN, we SEE: a patch of parochial school
children, ASIAN CHILDREN, on the streetcorner.
Bobby's car peels off, away from danger. Burt's car IS
HEADED RIGHT FOR THEM. In what seems like his dazed last
gasp, he SLAMS on the BRAKES. The car skids out, spins.
The motion is DIZZYING...
THE OLDS is uncontrolled. The vehicle moves through a
traffic light, HITTING another car.
STARTS TUMBLING, NOT ON ITS SIDE, BUT HEAD OVER TAIL.
It is one intense image. The car is upside down now. It
slides for tens of feet before stopping. Smoldering...
The rain falls, making an oddly serene sound.
We HEAR
SIRENS. The Police are approaching.
Burt's car stops slowly. He gets out of the car, his face
a mess. He stumbles for a few feet in the rain. BOBBY'S
CAR ARRIVES on the SCENE...
BURT'S EYES ARE RED, filling with blood. His JAW is open.
He gasps for air, a vacant stare on his face. His body
spasms. Then he collapses, on his knees. FALLS. FACE
DOWN. IN A POOL OF BLOOD. The Police are in the
background...
WIDE SHOT of the BLOCK as BOBBY MOVES TO HIS FATHER, WHO IS
LYING ON THE STREET. Bobby bends down, turning his father
over. His father's blood is all over his hands now.
Burt is dead.
Other cops surround them. Bobby looks up at all of them,
they at him. Broken, he pushes the others away. As water
drips off his face:
BOBBY GREEN
Don't fuckin' look at him! I said
don't--back up! Don't look at
him...
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
Bobby eyes his father, spent, crestfallen--but not
histrionic. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN. The BLOOD from BURT'S
BODY flows into the street, along the curb,into the gutter.
DISSOLVE TO:
A LIMOUSINE pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of
tombstones. Emerging are Bobby and Joseph. They are both
wearing dark sunglasses. Rosario and Sandra and the
children get out behind them and are led away by funeral
coordinators to another place in the coming processional.
In the distance, many many people and a long line of cars
move toward the two brothers.
The Undertaker walks away briefly, to direct some traffic.
Bobby slowly puts his arm around Joseph's waist, prompting:
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
Bobby... I'm real glad you're with
me now...
BOBBY GREEN
Course...
Joseph grows more emotional, adjusts his sunglasses.
Leans
to Bobby, clears his throat. Sotto:
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
You know, I was...I was jealous of
you, [for a] long time.
Bobby is surprised to hear this admission, and is taken
aback by the honesty of it--especially in this moment.
Joseph grabs his brother's arm, his voice cracking:
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
...I always did what Pop wanted.
And you were free...
Bobby tears up, his voice breaking too; he shakes his head:
BOBBY GREEN
No.... I did it to hurt him...
I
disappointed him...
Interrupting the moment, the Undertaker approaches:
UNDERTAKER
Gentlemen?
The Undertaker guides the two men toward the procession.
Just as the drums reach a THUNDEROUS VOLUME, we GO TO:
MINUTES LATER.
A line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the HEARSE.
The procession is PHENOMENALLY LONG. The New York skyline
is in the distance.
UNIFORMED POLICE LINE the narrow road. The COFFIN is
removed from the HEARSE, put on WHEELS for the move to the
gravesite. Bobby, Joseph approach. The DRUMS CONTINUE:
BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...
People get out of their cars. Many of them we recognize
from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of
the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and
his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE, KALINA.
The walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph.
Behind them, the Mayor, the Commissioner, all the rank and
file of the Force. The turnout is enormous. Rosario is
here too, though several rows back. She is with the women.
Bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds
of SALUTING COPS, others. AMONG THEM, we SPOT:
LOUIS FALSETTI.
At that moment, BOBBY SEES his old friend, and the two make
EYE CONTACT. Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and
nods subtly to Jumbo. Louis salutes gently, a slight and
sympathetic smile coming across his face...
SIMULTANEOUS: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN, grows more
distraught. He breaks down. Bobby is there to catch him
and does.
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED: (2)
Several WHITE-GLOVED COPS move to help, and then, trying to
recompose himself, he squeezes his brother's forearm for
support. Tries to straighten:
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
...It's all right... I'll be all
right...
Bobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is
momentarily rendered speechless. He tightens his own grasp
around Joseph, leads him on the walk behind the COFFIN.
FURTHER DOWN THE PROCESSIONAL
Rosario. Walking. Eyeing the Cops, the Cop Wives. She
does not fit in. Cops are staring at her. She SEES COP
WIVES looking at her, leaning over to each other and
TALKING ABOUT HER. Though she can't hear what they're
saying, she is made to feel terribly uneasy...
Rosario quickens her pace away from them, and the MARCH
MOVES ON...
The line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the
coffin, which is in the ground. BOBBY and JOSEPH silently
lead the line, shoveling dirt and moving on. Rosario moves
behind them. Bobby SEES: BEYOND THE CEMETARY GROUNDS:
TEENAGERS have climbed the trees. And they're LAUGHING at
the spectacle. Michael stands next to Bobby.
A beat, then Bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied.
Almost as if the words are more for himself than for Mike:
BOBBY GREEN
I can't live like this no more,
Mike... They destroyed my family.
(BEAT)
There's a deal going down, I... I
wanna help...
MICHAEL SOLO
You're a civilian, Bobby. Ain't no
way.
Bobby leans closer, more focused:
BOBBY GREEN
I, I could join you.
Michael turns to him, surprised.
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
My Pop tol' me you pull guys outta
the Academy, guys with special
knowledge, [and] make `em cops?
You could do that.
MICHAEL SOLO
Bobby, come on--you got your own
life to live--
BOBBY GREEN
(INTERRUPTING)
No.
I can't do nothing else now.
A beat, as Mike ponders.
Then:
MICHAEL SOLO
Then you gotta understand--this
ain't something you do just for a
vendetta. You gotta go back to the
Academy when you're done, you gotta
commit yourself.
Bobby looks at his brother, then back to Mike.
BOBBY GREEN
I know.
MICHAEL SOLO
Gimme a couple days--I'll talk to
the P.C.
Bobby again eyes Joseph, who stands over the grave wiping
his eyes with a handkerchief. He WALKS OVER to him, puts
his arm around him. Into his ear:
BOBBY GREEN
Joe, I'm gonna join you. I just
decided...
(BEAT)
Okay?
Joseph looks at him for a moment, nods subtly.
Then he
looks back into the grave.
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
This is where I belong...
ANGLE BACK on Bobby, as he spots ROSARIO, who stares right
back at him. He's GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HER HIS DECISION.
A LINE OF POLICEMEN in white gloves begins to FIRE RIFLES
into the AIR. FIVE SHOTS...
104.
A fairly run-down place, on the way to Kennedy Airport.
An UNMARKED CAR with Bobby inside pulls up to the front.
A
GUARD steps forward to greet, protects him.
Still grabbing Louis's arm, Bobby wrenches him loose.
Louis stumbles and falls to the asphalt. Bobby steps
FORWARD. Something is different about him now. He is
colder than ice, his eyes black saucers of rage.
BOBBY GREEN
Where's Nezhinski?
LOUIS FALSETTI
I don't know--
BOBBY GREEN
Don't play games with me, Louis.
LOUIS FALSETTI
But I don't kn--
BOBBY GREEN
I just said, DO NOT PLAY GAMES WITH
ME!
(BEAT)
Rosario tol' you where we were
staying, didn't she?!? She trusted
you...
Louis begins to crack.
Tears come to his eyes...
(CONTINUED)
118.
CONTINUED:
LOUIS FALSETTI
Bob, we're, we're buddies--we're
like brothers! C'mon!
BOBBY GREEN
You don't mean nothing to me now--
that part of my life is dead.
(beat; for himself)
Today it ended for good...
LOUIS FALSETTI
Bobby I swear--I don't know
nothing!
BOBBY GREEN
You know my father is dead because
of you?
Louis begins to sob quietly, shivering. He brings his hand
to his mouth. Bobby takes a threatening step forward:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
You know I'm on the Force now? And
I could do anything to you?
Louis' eyes widen.
He holds out his hands defensively.
LOUIS FALSETTI
No, wait! Bob, please!
(beat; weakening)
Don't do this to me...
(even softer)
Don't do this to me Bob, please...
BOBBY GREEN
You tell me what you know right now
or I swear to Christ I will make
you disappear.
Louis is crying loudly, like a ten year-old. He falls to
his knees. Shivering in fear, he moves to Bobby's feet:
LOUIS FALSETTI
Bobby, I... I told `em where you
were--but, but it ain't what you
think! I was makin' a buy and
these guys in hoods, they held a
gun to my head--so I tried to give
`em the wrong information!
Bobby clenches his fist.
Louis grabs onto him again:
(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED: (2)
LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)
No, wait, listen! It's true!
Rosario tol' me you moved every
couple days, she said you was gonna
move--I thought you'd be gone by
then! It's the truth, Bobby! I
would never try and hurt you!
Never, swear to God!
Bobby stares at him for a moment, then his teeth grit. He
tries to calm himself but cannot. With a ferocity, he
unleashes a brutal punch across Louis' face with the brunt
of his fist. Louis collapses. In Louis' ear:
BOBBY GREEN
You tell me, right now--
(BEAT)
Where's your fuckin' spot?!?
CUT TO:
THE CAMERA DOLLIES past A SHOOTING GALLERY. ADDICTS, their
inert bodies both crumpled and standing in virtual trances,
wander an ALLEYWAY. They RECOIL from CAR HEADLIGHTS:
An American sedan, a DARK BLUE car, pulls up to the
building. A man gets out--we can't quite tell who it is
yet...
SERIES OF SHOTS of:
1. WIDE SHOT of A MARSH AREA, with tall wheatlike weed
growth that is extremely dense.
2. MEDIUM SHOT of a STRUCTURE, in the middle of this. An
old, small, abandoned stone building, built as a WPA
project in the 1930's. It is a men's/ladies' bathroom,
probably a Robert Moses project, but long since abandoned.
3. WIDE SHOT of the STRUCTURE. The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN, from
high above the STONE BUILDING, and PANS to REVEAL the TALL
WEEDS AROUND IT.
4. MEDIUM SHOT of ELI'S DARK BLUE AUTOMOBILE, arriving.
Eli emerges from the car. A bodyguard behind him, armed
with an AK-47. He prepares to GREET:
AN ARRIVING LIVERY CAR.
Out steps: A HOST of men in suits, grasping suitcases--
presumably filled with money.
THEN ANOTHER TOWN CAR.
And yet ANOTHER.
The men all congregate like it's a legal business
transaction. HANDSHAKES, SMILES.
We PAN AROUND, MOVING THROUGH THE WEEDS NOW. And we SEE:
Bobby and Joseph, as they arrive, MOVE INTO POSITION. The
camera MOVES LATERALLY and we SEE: Michael and Jack and
other COPS, doing much the same. All carrying SHOTGUNS.
One COP POINTS A SHOTGUN MICROPHONE at the ACTIVITY, and
our guys can HEAR perp conversations in their EARPIECES...
(CONTINUED)
123.
CONTINUED:
ANOTHER CAR ARRIVES. APPEARING out of it is VADIM
NEZHINSKI. Joseph bristles at the sight of him. Bobby
grabs his brother's arm, squeezes:
BOBBY GREEN
We're gonna get all of `em today.
JUST AT THAT MOMENT, a WHITE VAN PULLS UP: two men get out.
They open the back, FILLED WITH FURS. They take a number
of coats out of the BACK OF THE VAN, bring them to the
shack...
ALL THE COPS appear confused. What the hell is this?
ANOTHER TOWN CAR. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand around the auto.
Helping someone out of the vehicle. Whoever this is, he's
the EMPEROR...
EMERGING: MARAT BUZHAYEV. Stepping up behind him, Eli,
helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other.
They KISS WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the
devastation. Almost to himself:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
Lookit the two of them...they're so
fuckin' close...
Then the cops spot: TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, sitting in the
back of the car. They do not get out. They seem clueless.
STANDING GUARD over all of this is a LOOKOUT, who is armed
with an AK-47. Several other ARMED MEN take positions
closer to the structure as the FURS ARE BROUGHT IN.
BUSINESSMEN make some banter, then enter the shack--led by
NEZHINSKI. MARAT BUZHAYEV and ELI follow him in. Many
other men pour into the structure, BRIEFCASES in hand.
MICHAEL SOLO
Okay--when they complete the sale,
that's when we move. ESU'll grab
the kids.
A TRANSACTION BEGINS inside the shack, and the COPS are
WATCHING. They SEE the action through BROKEN WINDOWS...
Bobby and Joseph.
Joseph has his earpiece, HEARS.
Then:
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
The deal's closing--let's go!
Bobby gets up, out of the weeds, SHOTGUN aimed:
BOBBY GREEN
You're surrounded by the police!
Come out now, with your hands on
your heads!
The COPS begin the assault, EXPLODING FROM EVERYWHERE.
SIRENS, the whole thing. Bobby and Joseph get up, stand
into a crouch and move slowly toward the structure. A GROUP
OF ESU COPS charge MARAT'S CAR, GOING FOR THE CHILDREN--who
watch this with fear and incomprehension...
(CONTINUED)
125.
CONTINUED:
An ARMED GUARD, standing outside the shack, begins to fire
at the cops. EVERYONE OPENS FIRE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN: A COP, that TOUGH-LOOKING COP we saw at
Joseph's house but a few moments earlier, is HIT by the
Armed Guard's fire. HIT IN THE FACE, he falls down near
Joseph and Bobby. DEAD, his visage a bloodied pulp.
CLOSE SHOT ON JOSEPH. HE FREEZES. We momentarily FLASH
CUT back to his OWN SHOOTING... He cannot bear reliving
the terror of his moment...
As the COPS move in: Bobby spins around to look for his
brother. He finds him still on the ground. Joseph seems
unable to move, holding onto his shotgun for dear life:
BOBBY GREEN
Joe?!
Joseph looks at his brother, shakes his head. Completely
shattered in the moment. STILL. SHOTS RING OUT. Bobby
pushes his brother down on the ground. In his ear:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
Arright, just stay down!
Chaos begins. All of the men inside the small building
have aimed their guns into the WEEDS. But instead of
stopping because of the shooting, Bobby progresses
inexorably toward the structure, his shotgun poised to
fire.
NOW MICHAEL and JACK and OTHER MEMBERS of the NARCOTICS
TEAMS come out of the WEEDS. THEY FIRE their WEAPONS.
MARAT'S GRANDCHILDREN are DRAGGED OUT OF THE CAR, CRYING
LOUDLY...
FIFTY YARDS AWAY
A LINE of UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS forms. They move in
unison. Seems like a hundred men. Bobby and Jack and some
of his men are coming from one side, the line from another.
SIRENS. A GUN BATTLE. The LOOKOUT with the AK-47 is hit--
fatally. Bobby SEES several people FLEEING out a back
entrance toward another section of the weeds. Joseph
remains in the grass, his head down, his hands on his head.
We cannot SEE his face...
BILIOUS CLOUDS OF SMOKE.
BOBBY is MOVING TOWARD THE
BUILDING.
VADIM SCURRIES INTO THE WEEDS... THE SMALL STRUCTURE
REALLY STARTS TO BURN. It is an odd flame, BLUE and
SILENT.
BOBBY RUNS OFF, into THE WEEDS, following VADIM. ELI
CHARGES TOWARD HIS CAR. JACK is RIGHT BEHIND HIM:
JACK SHAPIRO
Stop!
Halt!
Jack ruthlessly pumps Eli full of bullets, and the man
falls down dead. Jack approaches, mercilessly FIRES
ANOTHER SHOT into the corpse...
Bobby raises his shotgun as he RACES THROUGH THE PHRAGMITES
GRASS. The WEEDS PART. It is TRICKY. HEAVY BREATHING.
BOBBY SEES other MEN running through the weeds, but he
can't tell who's who. CONFUSION...
BOBBY STOPS. FEET CRUSHING THE TWIGS... A GUNSHOT, FROM
WHERE, GOD ONLY KNOWS... A RUSH OF IMAGES--SHADOWED
FIGURES, OBSCURED BY THE WEEDS, APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR LIKE
PHANTOMS...
BOBBY'S HEARTBEAT THUMPS ON THE SOUNDTRACK... A MAN
backing up toward him; each man has his back to the
other...
(CONTINUED)
127.
CONTINUED:
BOBBY DOESN'T SEE HIM YET. BUT WE CAN. THE CAMERA ZOOMS
INTO BOBBY, WITH THE FIGURE BEHIND HIM. BOBBY SEES THE
SHADOW ON THE GROUND. He turns, SLOWLY...raises his
weapon, about to FIRE when he realizes:
It's MICHAEL SOLO, who, in profile to Bobby is unaware he's
almost been killed. He stops when he feels the barrel of
Bobby's shotgun against his ribs. SLOWLY TURNING AROUND,
he sees BOBBY. WHISPERED:
MICHAEL SOLO
This's too dangerous. We'll all
wind up killing each other--
BOBBY GREEN
Vadim is in here with us. Radio
our guys, tell `em to get into the
clearing.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, we HEAR, SHOUTED:
MAN'S VOICE
Bobby!
We got the old man!
Bobby looks at Michael, points to his earpiece. Michael
nods, and as we HEAR Mike's words into his radio ("Our
guys, outta the brush!") Bobby starts to back up, toward
the clearing...
Bobby is greeted by the boys. Other POLICE, including
Michael Solo, emerge from the weeds, quietly. Jack
APPROACHES:
JACK SHAPIRO
We got the old man--Buzhayev. Up
by the cars. His grandkids are
safe--they're in the van.
Bobby acknowledges this, turns to another OFFICER:
BOBBY GREEN
Are all our guys out?
The Officer looks, counts.
Then nods.
Bobby looks toward
the weeds and says:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
Burn it.
SEVERAL COPS BREAK FLARES, ROLLING THEM INTO THE WEEDS.
(CONTINUED)
128.
CONTINUED:
All the officers back up--all of them except Bobby. Who
stands, shotgun in hand, waiting for VADIM NEZHINSKI to
emerge from the now-burning brush.
TWO OTHER MEN come out of the fire, coughing. They are
carrying their guns and thus killed by POLICE GUNFIRE. NO
SIGHT OF NEZHINSKI AS BOBBY WAITS. AT LAST, HE DECIDES TO
GO IN.
MICHAEL SOLO
Bobby?
What're you doin'--
BOBBY GREEN
I'm not gonna let him get away...
AS the other POLICE panic around him, Bobby ENTERS THE
FIRE...
BOBBY EMERGES FROM THE FIRE...
HE WALKS TOWARD THE POLICE
CARS. THE POLICE ARE ASSEMBLED
around: MARAT BUZHAYEV.
BOBBY WATCHES HIM FOR A MOMENT,
HIS FACE filled with
CONTROLLED RAGE. BEAT. EACH MAN
STARES AT EACH OTHER. THEN:
MARAT BUZHAYEV
Bobby--I, I didn't know it would be
your family--
BOBBY TAKES A THREATENING STEP FORWARD. Bobby's expression
seems unmatched in its ferocity; Marat sees in Bobby's eyes
a horrible determination, begins to cry... Bobby's
emotions are a CAULDRON:
BOBBY GREEN
Get down!
On the ground!
Marat gets on his knees. WHIMPERING. Bobby puts Marat's
hands on his head, starts PATTING HIM DOWN. CLEAN.
BOBBY PUTS THE SHOTGUN AT MARAT'S TEMPLE.
We HEAR the
DOGS, the FIRE, the WIND, the SIRENS...
The police see the unforgiving expression on Bobby's face
and the reality of the old man in front of them. Bobby
turns to the others, particularly JACK. He looks at him,
dark-eyed. Then he turns away and starts walking, making
eye contact with none of them. He utters a command, to all
of them and none of them in particular:
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
Put him in the fuckin' van...
Don't touch him...
Bobby walks past the small building, which CONTINUES TO
BURN SILENTLY--with that eerie BLUE FLAME... Other cops
watch him with awe and respect. They back away from him.
He proceeds on toward the cars.
HE SEES: Joseph inside one of them, still. Staring at him.
WE DOLLY WITH HIM as he moves to his brother. CROUCHES
DOWN, stays by JOSEPH...
CLOSE SHOT OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT BOARD, SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS:
"ONE P.M.: N.Y.P.D. EVENT - ACADEMY GRADUATION."
