  BATIATUS, bruises not yet completely healed, stands on the 
  balcony addressing the assembled GLADIATORS below. Flanking 
  him are OENOMAUS (in Doctore s newly mended chestplate) and 
  GANNICUS, both weighed by heavy thoughts of recent events.

  LUCRETIA

  stands with GAIA, who eyes Gannicus with hungry 
    appreciation. MELITTA attends in the background, weighed by 
  the guilt of what she was commanded to do with Gannicus in 
  HB2. NAEVIA and DIONA also attend, regarding Gannicus with 
  schoolgirl wonder.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We have won many victories in the 
                        arena. Sent many an unworthy 
                        opponent to the afterlife. Yet self 
                        important men have held us to 
                        lesser matches of the morning, 
                        absent both eyes and prominence. 
                        Such time has found its end! Two 
                        days hence, our champion shall take 
                      to the sands to face another of 
                        Vettius  shit-eating dogs. Not in 
                        the streets, but in the fucking 
                        primus!

  The men ROAR their approval.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Behold the man whose recent 
                        performance inspired good Varus to 
                        return the House of Batiatus to 
                        proper position! Behold, Gannicus!

  Batiatus indicates Gannicus, who hesitantly steps forward as 
  Gladiators CHEER below.

                                        GAIA
                                (whispered, to 
                                  Lucretia)
                      An inspired performance, indeed.

  Melitta stiffens, having caught the comment. Lucretia clocks 
  the reaction, whispers disapprovingly to Gaia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        One not to be repeated.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Gladiators)(
                        A true god of the arena! A man to 
                      be emulated and admired!

  Gannicus  eyes find Oenomaus regarding him with brotherly 
  pride. He adjusts his view, finds Melitta within it. She 
  averts her gaze, riddled with shame.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Gladiators loudly incant praise. BARCA, AUCTUS, GNAEUS, and 
  RHASKOS are in the forefront, leading the charge.

                                          GLADIATORS
                        Gannicus! Gannicus!

  FIND ASHUR and DAGAN in the back, brands still fresh. CRIXUS 
  stands with them, eyeing Gannicus with admiration and 
  regret.

                                        CRIXUS
                        There was a moment... I nearly had 
                        the man.

  Ashur chuckles at Crixus  assessment of the fight.

                                        ASHUR
                        Perhaps one day you will find 
                        chance again, and stand a champion 
                      as Gannicus.
                                  re: brand)(
                        Yet first I suggest you earn the 
                        mark, as we have.

  Crixus frowns at the smug comment.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This is but glorious beginning! 
                        Soon you will litter the sands with 
                        blood and bone of all who present 
                        challenge! Instructed in the ways 
                      of death and glory by a former 
                        champion! One of our very own! I 
                        give you Oenomaus! No longer to 
                        hold that name! No longer a 
                        gladiator! Now and forever, to be 
                        revered as your Doctore!

  The men explode with shouts of approval. Batiatus hands 
  Oenomaus the old Doctore s battered WHIP.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                        This has been wielded with pride by 
                        each before you, since the time of 
                      my grandfather. Bestowed only to 
                        the most loyal and honorable of 
                        men.

  Oenomaus regards it solemnly. An honor tainted by blood.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Your will. My hands.

  Batiatus grabs Oenomaus and Gannicus  arms, thrusts them 
  high in the air. The men ROAR. OFF OENOMAUS AND GANNICUS, 
  uneasy about their newfound positions and how they were 
  obtained...



  WOODEN SWORDS CLACK as a GUARD opens the gate for Oenomaus. 
  He steps out to find the men sparring. He regards the WHIP 
  in his hand with uncertainty.Clenches it tight, the leather 
  CRUNCHING beneath his powerful grip.

  THE MEN PAUSE

  as Oenomaus steps out onto the sand. He glances at Gannicus 
  who looks away, unable to hold the gaze. Oenomaus struggles 
  to find commanding words to begin his life as Doctore. 
  Fails.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Barca. Pair with Crixus. The rest 
                      of you... Continue training.

  The men comply. OFF Oenomaus, far from the formidable 
  Doctore we will come to know him as in season 1...



  CLOSE ON CRIXUS, face straining and beaded with sweat. PULL 
  BACK to REVEAL he s circling the square, alone, carrying a 
  log on his shoulders. The dreaded march, thrust upon all 
  recruits until proven worthy. He passes the gladiator-filled


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    12.

  MESS HALL

  where Barca stands behind the serving table. He slops gruel 
  into the bowls of Ashur and Dagan with a broad grin.

                                        BARCA
                        Eat, brothers! You bear the mark 
                        now. Savor the taste of victory!

  Ashur beams, basking in the moment of having earned the 
  respect of the men as they cross the hall to find a seat. 
  The men smile and nod at them.

                                        ASHUR
                                (to Dagan, in 
                                  Aramaic)

                        us. As one of their own.]

  They pass Auctus, feeding crumbs to one of his pigeons. 
  Ashur and Dagan sit, dig into their gruel -- and immediately 
  spit it out in disgust. The men HOWL with laughter.

                                        BARCA
                        Our piss again finds way to their 
                        mouths!

                                        AUCTUS
                      As if sucked from our cocks!

  The men ROAR in delight. Ashur jumps to his feet.

                                        ASHUR
                      We bear the fucking mark!

                                        AUCTUS
                        Received absent the test. A fucking 
                        goat may carry the brand. It does 
                        not make him a brother.

                                        DAGAN
                                (in Aramaic,

                        are unworthy of the mark.]

  Dagan glowers, starts for Auctus. Ashur stops him.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

                        soon enough.]

  Gannicus passes by, shoots daggers at Ashur. He sits and 
  begins to eat. Oenomaus joins him.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  doesn t look up)(
                        You should not eat with lower men. 
                        You are the Doctore now.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        A title I did not seek. I would not 
                        have events absent my control come 
                        between us.

  Gannicus takes that in, the meaning resonating deeper than 
  Oenomaus knows.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  soft, guilt ridden)(
                        Nor would I.

  CHEERS erupt. Oenomaus turns, shocked to see Titus entering 
  the hall. He s quickly encircled by the men as they 
    enthusiastically greet their old dominus. Batiatus stands at 
  the periphery, observing the admiration and love the men 
  feel towards his father. A feeling never bestowed upon son.

  OENOMAUS

  approaches. Titus lights up at the sight of him, greeting 
  him with a familiar forearm clasp. It s apparent there s a 
  special bond between these two.

                                        TITUS
                        Oenomaus!

                        predecessor. I chose Oenomaus as 
                        replacement, knowing that he --

  Titus waves lengthy discourse away.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

                        Dominus.

  Oenomaus heads out with Titus. OFF Batiatus, feeling the 
  sting of exclusion...



  The blazing SUN stabs down. ADJUST TO FIND Titus on the 
  balcony with his Attending Slave, observing the men as they 
  gather for training. Melitta sets out BREAD and DATES.

                                          MELITTA
                        Your return lifts the heart,

  Titus replies with a warm smile.

                        Only for those who yet possess one.

                        Gratitude.

  Melitta nods, exits back inside. Titus takes a date, chews 
    reflectively as he returns his attention to

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Oenomaus paces, nervously fingering his whip as the men 
  linger about, engaged in jocular conversation.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Attend!

  The men barely pay attention. Oenomaus steels himself, 
  continues with more authority.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Pair up! Crixus, spar with Barca. 
                        Auctus... work the palus until 
                        Gannicus joins us.

  The men casually fall to order, begin to spar with one 
  another. Oenomaus glances to Titus on the balcony, who nods 
  back encouragingly.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

  ON BARCA,

  training as a Hoplomachus (practice spear, shield, small 
  sword in belt). He chuckles as the much smaller Crixus 
  squares off with wooden sword and shield.

                                        BARCA
                        Oenomaus! This one is too small! I 
                        would have something the size of a 
                        man!

  The other men laugh. Crixus burns with humiliation.

                                        TITUS
                        Barca. Do as your Doctore commands.

                        Yes, Dominus.

  Oenomaus bites back his own humiliation. Barca grins at 
  Crixus.

                                          BARCA(cont'd)
                        Come. Let us see what is between 
                        your legs.

  Barca attacks with his spear. Crixus counters. Barca spins, 
  cracking him across the back. Crixus grunts, an angry WELT 
  appearing. Crixus retaliates. Barca deflects. He lands a 
  crushing blow to the stomach, sending Crixus to the sand.

                                        AUCTUS
                                  laughs)(
                        The Gaul winces from spear... as he 
                        would from my cock!

  Barca and the men laugh. Oenomaus glares. Crixus vomits.

                                        BARCA

  Crixus rises, readying himself for more pain. Barca attacks, 
  giving it to him. Auctus howls with laughter.

  A wooden shield smacks Crixus across the face, blood

  Oenomaus watches the sparring session closely as the other 
  men train.

  CRIXUS

  his practice spear. Crixus scrambles to recover, but the 
  spear is instantly at his throat. Barca laughs.

  Barca turns away, joining a laughing Auctus. Crixus looks to

  There s something about his thick-headed countryman that he

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Why do you remain in the streets?

                                        BATIATUS

                                  bruised face)
                        Why do you fucking think!?

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  softening)(
                        I did not mean for his return. I 
                        only sought advice, towards worry 
                        for a man I hold as brother.

  Batiatus sees the sincerity in Solonius eyes, calms.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                        Intentions well-received.

  Batiatus spots Tullius and his father emerging from the 
  shop. Theron and Vettius follow.

                      in favor of more pressing concern.

                        Your patience and reason recalls 
                        joyous times, when business was 
                        conducted by those who shared 
                        respect for it.

                        I am certain you shall outlive us 
                        all, Master Batiatus.

  Solonius presents a well-oiled smile. Titus returns it with 
  pale reflection.

                                        TITUS
                        Solonius. I hardly placed you. The 
                        years weigh heavy on a man, do they 
                        not?

                        Your presence is fortuitous, 
                        striking need to seek you out. 
                        Share walk, and let us review 
                        recent events...

  Solonius nods, shooting Batiatus a worried look as he moves 
  off with Tullius, Vettius, and Theron. Batiatus turns his 
  attentions to his father, tightening with barely contained 
  anger.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Am I allowed voice now?

                        Could the gods halt the sound?

  Titus moves off. Batiatus follows him through the crowd.

                        Whatever Tullius and the boy may 
                        think, I gained the primus on merit 
                      of Gannicus  prowess.

                        Even if true, it is of no matter 
                        now. Gannicus will not appear in 
                        the games.

                        leveling uneven ground with 
                        Tullius. You will make apology to 
                        Varus, relaying Gannicus found 
                        injury in training. And that 
                        Vettius is amply capable of seeing 
                        the primus attended.

                        Then we must choose the men with

                        attempting to maneuver men above 
                        your station. Be thankful it was 
                        not more costly.

  Titus moves off. Batiatus absorbs the sting of his father s 
  words. He heads after him, WIPING US TO --



  TIGHT ON a hunk of half-cooked PIGEON as teeth strip meat 
  from bone. WIDEN TO REVEAL Ashur and Dagan savoring the meal 
  on the edge of the mess hall.

                        You fucking cunts!

  Auctus and Barca are heading for them from the ludus. Dagan 
  and Ashur rise to meet them.

                                        ASHUR
                        You soil our food! Why should we 
                        not make meal of your fucking pets 
                      --

  Auctus roars, tackling Ashur into the

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Dagan turns to help, but is set upon by Barca. Fists and 
  blood fly. Gladiators spill out into the square, SHOUTING 
    encouragement, loving the violence. Ashur spits bloods, 
  calls to Crixus for help.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

  WHAM! Auctus is on him, raining blows. Gannicus glances at 
  Crixus standing next to him.

                        You do not help your friend?

                        This is a fight between brothers. I 
                      do not yet bear the mark, as Ashur 
                      is fond of reminding.

  Oenomaus rushes past, bellows for order.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Have you lost fucking sense?! Stand 
                        down!

  But no one s listening. Oenomaus unfurls his WHIP, rears 
  back and attempts to crack it. Fails. He growls, tossing it 
  aside and wading in to quell the tumult the old fashioned 
  way. He grabs Dagan from behind.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

  DAGAN THROWS AN ELBOW

  without looking, sending Oenomaus crashing to the sand. 
  Gannicus rushes to assist, clocking Dagan. The Gladiators 
  ROAR their approval, laughing and hooting.

                        CALM YOURSELVES!

  Gannicus halts in mid-punch as Titus appears through the 
  gates with Batiatus. The men quiet and part under Titus  
  withering glare. Lucretia, Gaia, and Melitta appear on the 
  balcony, drawn by the commotion.

                                        TITUS
                      Is this what my house has fallen 
                        to? Brother setting upon brother so 
                        far removed from the honor of the 
                        arena, where such contest holds 
                        meaning? This points to reason the 
                        gods have turned from us, stripping 
                        the primus from our hands.

  The men react, stunned and confused.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I do not fight in the games?

                        You do not.

  Gannicus  heart sinks. He glances to Melitta, guilt welling 
  in his eyes. Everything they were forced to do has been for 
  nothing. Batiatus catches the look.

                                        BATIATUS

                        than you bring now to yourselves.

  OFF the proclamation...



  Oenomaus stands near the cliff, looking out across Capua as 
  he practices with his whip. Attempting to crack it. To prove 
  himself worthy. Each attempt ending in failure.

  GANNICUS

  appears behind him, heading for his cell. Oenomaus doesn t 
  notice him. Gannicus pauses. Starts to head for his friend, 
  to offer words of support. But guilt overrides. He turns 
  away and disappears into his cell, the closing door 
    TRANSITIONING US TO --



  SLAVES load a wagon with equipment. Gnaeus, Auctus, Barca 
  forearm clasp their brothers in farewell -- a ritualistic 
  send-off before the games. Ashur and Dagan, bruised from 
  yesterday s altercation, glare from the sidelines. Ashur 
  eyes Auctus and Barca, spits.

  They move off, passing a nervous Crixus as he readies 
  himself for his first fight. Crixus is in even worse shape, 
  the result of Barca s brutal training.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

                        May Auctus fall. And Barca follow.

  Crixus glances at Auctus and Barca, his worry of facing the 
  spear deepening. Gannicus approaches Barca.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Return victorious, brother. For I

  Barca laughs. As they forearm clasp, ANGLE TO --

                        Perhaps some mulsum while you wait, 
                        father. To celebrate your return to

  Lucretia tenses. Titus laughs.

                        You find my weakness. And I would

  Lucretia laughs, hands him his cup.

                        I will join you.

                        Every day.

  A brief flash of sad longing drifts across Titus  face. The 
  sincerity of it catches Batiatus by surprise. Titus pushes 
  it away, his eyes falling on Crixus below.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Your Gaul appears ragged.

                        The result of hard training. In 
                        preparation for the test he has yet

                        You set this in motion, Quintus. By 
                        purchasing the man to gain favor.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Only after gazing into his eyes, 
                        and seeing a spark. As you always 
                        spoke of.

                        opportunity. Auctus, a man forged 
                        beneath my rule, to face Crixus, 
                        forged beneath yours. The outcome 
                      to prove if son has learned 
                        anything of worth from father.

  As Titus takes a sip of his wine, the ROAR of the CROWD 
  PROPELLING US TO --



  Barca (Hoplomachus: spear, shield, small sword in belt) 
  battles Gnaeus (Thraex: curved sword, rectangular shield).                                                                                     43.
  CONTINUED:

  Gnaeus lands a blow, drawing blood. Barca winces, lunges 
  with his spear, driving Gnaeus back. Barca slams Gnaeus with 
  his shield, sending him flying past the CHUTES.



  Auctus HOWLS from inside, delighted by his lover s prowess. 
  PUSH THROUGH the bars and past Auctus to find Crixus sitting 
  alone. Silent and focused, recounting the bruises on his 
  body. And the lessons they imparted. Oenomaus approaches 
  with an old helmet and Murmillo octopus shield (from season 
  1).

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Your time has come.

  Crixus solemnly takes the helmet and shield.

                        Gratitude. For all you have taught

                        will it... die the same.

  Batiatus appears at the entrance.

                        Crixus. A word.

  Crixus rises, crosses over.

                        You have shown great promise. In 
                        practice. In exhibition against 
                        Gannicus. Yet this is the arena. 
                        This is where men become gods. 
                        Legions with far greater training 
                        and skill than you have fallen upon 
                        this sacred ground. Many beneath 
                        Auctus  spear.

  Crixus glances over to Auctus, who roars encouragement to 
  Barca in his fight against Gnaeus.

                        champion. To rival any my father 
                        has ever heralded.

  Batiatus looks deep into his eyes.

                      us both proven worthy.

  Batiatus exits. PUSH IN on Crixus as he steels himself, the 
  ROAR OF THE CROWD thrusting us back to --



  Barca assaults Gnaeus with a series of bone-jarring blows. 
  Gnaeus counters, thrashing wildly with his sword.

  THE STANDS

  Batiatus returns from the chutes, joining Lucretia and Gaia. 
  Melitta and a few other SLAVES attend.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You have set Crixus to purpose?

                        I stoke the flame as best I can. It 
                      is now up to the man to ignite. Or 
                      be forever extinguished.

                                        GAIA
                        A pity it is not Gannicus, nor the 
                        primus. It was well earned.

  Melitta s guilt deepens. Batiatus glances up to

  THE PULVINUS,

  where Titus sits with Varus, Cossutius, Tullius, Vettius, 
  and the other elite.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

  Gaia smiles brightly. The crowd ROARS, drawing their 
  attention to

  THE ARENA,

  where Barca attacks Gnaeus, brutally pummeling him. He 
  blasts Gnaeus across the face with his shield, then sweeps 
  his legs with his spear.

  GNAEUS

  crashes to the ground, spitting blood. Barca rears back with 
  his spear to finish him off. Gnaeus quickly throws up the 
  MISSIO in surrender. Barca laughs, halting the deadly blow 
  to look up to the

  PULVINUS

  for instruction. Varus stands, addressing the crowd.

                                        VARUS

                        gods! In gratitude, we will be 
                        merciful, and grant life!

  The crowd EXPLODES with cheers. Vettius seethes. Titus nods 
  in deference to Varus as he sits.

                                        TITUS
                        You are overly kind.

                                        VARUS
                        Your house has been most 
                          accommodating, and should be 
                        rewarded.

  Varus shares a veiled smile with Cossutius. Titus smiles 
  politely, not sure what to make of that.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  Titus reacts, surprised by the gesture.

                      us move on.

  Titus nods, rises to address the crowd. He is obviously 
  deeply humbled and a bit uncomfortable in the spotlight. The 
  complete opposite of his son, who longs for it.

                                        TITUS

                        Murmillo!

  Crixus steps out of the chutes. Squints against the glare. 
  Disoriented by the noise of the crowd. His eyes find 
  Batiatus in the stands. Batiatus nods. Fucking do it.

                        Auctus! Hoplomachus!

  The crowd ERUPTS as Auctus trots out. Crixus can t help but 
  shrink a bit under the weight of their enthusiasm for his 
  opponent. Auctus looks to Titus, raises his spear and shield 
  in respect. Titus brings his fist down.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Begin!

  Auctus attacks. Crixus defends, narrowly avoiding the deadly 
  spear. Auctus is oiled poetry with the weapon, spinning and 
  thrusting with lethal purpose. Crixus stumbles back, the 
  spear s gleaming tip opening a gash across his chest.

  BATIATUS

  grits his teeth as the crowd ROARS. He shoots a tense glance 
  to Titus up in the pulvinus, who smiles at the performance.

                        The same cannot be said of Crixus. 
                        Perhaps he should have remained a 
                        hauler of stones.

  THE ARENA

  BLOOD RIBBONS through the air as Crixus takes another hit. 
  The crowd CHEERS -- then gasps in surprise as Crixus 
  counters, finally drawing blood. Lucretia clutches Batiatus  
  arm in excitement. Auctus grins at Crixus, then HOWLS to the 
  crowd.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

  AUCTUS CHARGES,

  unleashing lightning blows, driving Crixus back. He whips

  Crixus crashes to the ground, his shield flying from his 
  hands.

  scrambles to retrieve it. Auctus seizes the moment and hurls 
  his spear. Crixus dives for his shield and rolls up with it 
  just as the spear hits. It drives through the wood, halting 
    a millimeter from Crixus  eye.

  AUCTUS  FACE DROPS

  as he realizes he just lost his primary weapon. Crixus 
  tosses his ruined shield aside and attacks. Auctus absorbs 
  the blows with his shield, struggling to counter with his 
  much smaller sword.

  THE CROWD ROARS

  as the men exchange bone-crushing blows. They finally SLAM 
  TOGETHER -- and freeze in a deadly embrace. The crowd GOES 
  QUIET, all eyes straining to see what has happened.

                                        AUCTUS
                                  soft)(
                        Barca has taught you well...

  Auctus grins. Blood trickles from his mouth as the CAMERA 
  CIRCLES around, REVEALING Crixus  sword protruding from 
  Auctus  back. Crixus has run him through. CAMERA COMPLETES 
  ITS CIRCLE as Crixus removes his sword. Auctus falls to his 
  knees, his eyes finding

  BARCA

  at the bars of the chute. Face twisted in anguish. Auctus  
  eyes fill with tears. Not for fear of death, but in regret 
  of parting this life absent his love. He smiles sadly as the 
  life fades from his eyes. He crumples to the sand, dead.

  THE CROWD ERUPTS

  Batiatus surges to his feet, overjoyed. Varus laughs up in 
  the pulvinus, delighted.

                                        VARUS
                        A fine showing, Batiatus! With 
                        unexpected conclusion!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

                                        TITUS
                        Indeed it was.

  His eyes find his son in the crowd. Batiatus grins up at 
  him, vindicated.

  CRIXUS

  stands over Auctus  body. He absorbs the CHEERING crowd. 
  Tears fill his eyes as he raises his arms to the heavens, 
  having achieved his own vindication.

                                        CRIXUS (V.O.)
                        ... I swear to be burned, chained, 
                        beaten, or die by the sword. In 
                        pursuit of honor in the arena.



  TIGHT ON Crixus  FOREARM as a red-hot iron sears the Mark of 
  the Brotherhood into his flesh. REVEAL Batiatus as he 
  removes the iron, Oenomaus at his side. Gannicus, Ashur, 
  Dagan, Gnaeus, Rhaskos, and other Gladiators watch from the 
  periphery.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Welcome to the brotherhood.

  Crixus beams with pride. Batiatus looks up to

  TITUS,

  standing on the balcony outside of the office. Titus holds 
  his son s gaze for a moment then disappears inside the 
  office, giving nothing away. Batiatus frowns in 
  disappointment.

  GAIA

  eyes Crixus like a fine cut of meat further down the 
  balcony, Lucretia beside her.

                                        GAIA
                        Crixus proves himself. Perhaps even 
                      as match for Gannicus one day. In 
                        and out of the arena.

  Lucretia takes Crixus in with dawning appreciation as he is 
  loudly greeted by his new brothers. Crixus  mirth falters as 
  Barca approaches, his face unreadable. The Gladiators go 
  quiet. A tense beat.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

                                        BARCA
                                  softly)(
                        You fought well. Brother.

  Barca walks away, heartbroken. OFF Crixus, knowing his 
  victory came at a great cost to the man...
