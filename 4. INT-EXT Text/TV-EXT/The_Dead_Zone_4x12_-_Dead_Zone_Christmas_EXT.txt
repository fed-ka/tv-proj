  3232VISION - CITY STREET - DAY - (CIRCA 1980'S)

          A blind man with dark glasses and a tin cup waits near a
          building entrance, the occasional PEDESTRIAN dropping in
          a coin.  A particularly fetching WOMAN walks past, and
          the blind man sneaks a peek over the top of his glasses,
            revealing himself to be our "SANTA".  Just as he resumes
          character, an ARMORED CAR pulls up and parks right in
          front of him.

          Johnny and Alex watch as the ARMED GUARD jumps out of the
          armored car and runs into the building.  A short beat
          later he returns with the money bag, knocking on the back
          door for the driver to let him into the truck.  As soon
          as the back door is open, "Santa" makes his move, pulling
          a gun from his coat as he knocks out the guard and forces
          his way into the armored car.  We hear a SCUFFLE inside,
          then Santa appears with the money bag and runs off down
          the sidewalk with the Guards FIRING at him as he runs. 
          Johnny and Alex who MATCH-MOVE-MORPH out of the vision,

          Johnny and Alex pull up in front of a rundown tract home. 
          They get out and approach the house.  They stop on the*

          Without taking her eyes off the front porch where she's
          looking, she extends a hand out for Johnny to take.

          He reaches out and takes her hand, suddenly able to see
          what she's looking at.

          THE DARK SHADOW of a sad but beautiful woman stands on
          the porch, crying quietly, looking out past Alex and
          Johnny, as if she's waiting for somebody.  She's dressed*
          all in black and wears a thin black veil over her face. *
          Her gaze suddenly shifts to Alex -- it's unnerving that*

          to emerge from the alley, the BLAST OF A SIREN and flashing
          police lights, sends the boys to cover.

                                        END ACT THREEDEAD ZONE: "A Very DZ Christmas" - ACT FOUR - 6/23/05 - PINK-2    40.


                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:


          After a beat, the police car suddenly lights up, firing
          up the siren as he police-overdrives out of there.



          SLOW MOTION.  As everyone plays in the snow, tossing
            snowballs at each other.  The SHOT FREEZES on a perfect
          portrait of Christmas in New England...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
