      closer we see they are the washed up bodies of drowned black 
      MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN, some chained together, face down.

      A coach rattles through the English countryside. Alone.

                                                              CUT TO:


      FOUR COACH PASSENGERS, including GARROW, at the point of a 
      pistol aimed at them as they warily, fearfully even, remove 
      their valuables and hand them over. We open out to see the 
      HIGHWAYMAN, impatiently gesturing with the pistol to hurry them 
      along. As he takes their valuables, the HIGHWAYMAN stops, pulls 
      down his mask and enquires:

                                  HIGHWAYMAN
                    MrGarrow...?

                                  GARROW
                    You know me?

    The HIGHWAYMAN s tone suddenly friendly, convivial.

                                  HIGHWAYMAN
                    Know you?  Why I d know you even if 
                    you was boiled up in soup!

      GARROW smiles awkwardly at the scrutiny of the other PASSENGERS.

                                  HIGHWAYMAN
                    You was for me at the Bailey.  Highway 
                    robbery and not guilty.   You do not 
                    remember?

                                  GARROW
                    The memory is all too vivid now.

    The HIGHWAYMAN, delighted, hands him back his valuables.

                                  HIGHWAYMAN
                    I paid you out before and I am 
                    grateful once again. Lord bless you 
                    and save you!                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  1A.


    The HIGHWAYMAN withdraws. GARROW acutely aware of the  other 
      PASSENGERS looking at him. They are put out. They didn t get 
      their valuables back.

      LADY SARAH makes her way from a carriage with a retinue in her

      clothes and belongings.

      SOUTHOUSE is travelling in a carriage with two men - the 
      GILBERTS. PETER GILBERT more tentative, diplomatic, drier. HUGH, 
      unapologetic, to the point. They give the impression of being 
      busy with little time to waste.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    Ship called the Zong. The owners claimed for 
                    the value of their..of their cargo.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    133 slaves thrown overboard. On the 
                    grounds of necessity.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    The Captain deemed they were running 
                    out of water supplies. The action 
                      purportedly taken to save the ship.                            GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  9.


                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Purportedly.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    We honoured the loss.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Thirty pounds each Negro. Three 
                    thousand nine hundred and ninety 
                    pounds.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    As we undertook the risk of loss, 
                    capture and death of the slaves or any 
                    other unavoidable accident to them.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And now you dispute the claim?

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    We do more than that. We challenge 
                    fraud.

      HUGH GILBERT hands him a journal.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    The ship masters log?

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    No, that was apparently lost.

      HUGH, recriminatory to PETER:

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Its loss should have been a 
                      disqualifying clause in the policy and 
                    we would have been discharged by it.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    Well now we are here to remedy it!(to 
                    SOUTHOUSE) This is a diary written by 
                    the only passenger on board the ship. 
                    Robert Stubbs. It contradicts the 
                    captains account.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And has only since come to light?

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    Mr Stubbs almost succumbed to the 
                    fever that gripped him aboard ship.

                                  PETER GILBERT (cont'd)
                    He was in no position to co-operate in 
                    our assessment of the claim but now 
                      recovering, saw fit to forward the 
                      documentation.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  10.


                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Well Gentlemen I am very happy to 
                    accept the case. Grateful in fact.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Your engagement is conditional on you 
                      instructing Mr Garrow.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I see.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    We are underwriters averse to risk Mr 
                    Southouse. And in Mr Garrow we see 
                    fewer. Goodbye.

    The coach has stopped and HUGH GILBERT opens the door to let 
      SOUTHOUSE out. He s a little dismayed by his abrupt dismissal.

      VASSA making his way to see GARROW. He passes a BLACK SLAVE in 
    the street, his neck fastened with an iron collar. The BLACK 
      SLAVE stops to look at VASSA with a curiosity as acute as 
      VASSA s discomfort at the sight of a fellow  Guineaman . With a 
    nod of acknowledgement VASSA turns and walks on.

                    He would go no further but that there 
                    had been some disagreement.

                                  GARROW
                    If the blood was bad between Kelsall 
                    and Collingwood we shall have it out 
                    in court.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And Stubbs?

                                  GARROW
                    Determined to convince a Jury.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And with yourself to take him through 
                    his evidence, certainly!                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  26.


      Approaching them from the opposite direction is SARAH and MARY 
      with SAMUEL. SOUTHOUSE looks to GARROW. GARROW looks 
      uncomfortable, troubled.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Lady Sarah.

                                  SARAH
                    Mr Southouse. And my child Samuel to

                    A healthy boy. A cement to conjugal affection!

      Pause.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I mean a further cement.

      SARAH, teasing:

                                  SARAH
                    Mr Garrow - you are mute as a 
                    mackerel. You are not taken with this 
                    infant?

                                  GARROW (LIGHT)
                    I stand back merely in order not to 
                    distress it.

                                  SARAH
                    Or it to distress you?

                                  GARROW
                    It is your child Lady Sarah - how 
                    could that ever be?

    The baggage is not lost on a discomfited SOUTHOUSE. Both parties 
      withdraw. GARROW aware of SOUTHOUSE s scrutiny.

                                  GARROW
                    You think I would engineer an 
                      assignation involving an Attorney, a 
                    nurse maid and a baby?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I said nothing.

                                  GARROW
                    I have long since relinquished all 
                    such feelings in the matter.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  26A.

      SOUTHOUSE looking at GARROW a little sheepishly.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I thought it suitably...maritime.

                                  GARROW
                          (As he begins to walk)
                    I shall not tell you what I thought it.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    They are clients to us both.

                                  GARROW
                    Cargo, negro, our fellow creatures- it 
                    is mere noise to them. Profit is their 
                    trumpet blast and I am to blow it for 
                    them. Is this what it means to act as 
                    counsel for the prosecution? That I do 
                    enrich those who do engage me in it?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And you think I would not wish a brief 
                    more deserving of our service! I am 
                    merely grateful that preparation for 
                    the case helps restore me to my 
                    previous humour. As for the Gilberts 
                    intention I hold my nose to it! 
                    (PAUSE) Will, does not the meddling of 
                    the Admiralty show that it is about 
                    more than mere insurance?

                                  GARROW
                    I should make it so.

      SOUTHOUSE not quite sure what this means.

                                  GARROW
                    I had not thought that we would come 
                    to be in each others company again. Or 
                    that you might wish it and request it.

                                  SARAH
                    You object to the cause of friendship?

                                  GARROW (LIGHT, TEASING)
                    I cannot object. It is a favour you 
                    bestow on me and I am truly grateful.

                                  SARAH (RESPONDING)
                    And that you find time to indulge me I 
                    am also thankful. You are the scourge

                                  GARROW
                    It is a criminal trial. A slave ship 
                    threw its captives overboard. They 
                    claim out of necessity. I must prove 
                      negligence.

                    There is evidence?

                                  GARROW
                    Southouse is assiduous.

                                  SARAH
                    Enough to prove the claim false?

                                  GARROW
                    You are curious.

    He looks at her and smiles. She is troubled by her intent. 

                                  SARAH
                    Forgive me. We shall not talk of it. I 
                    have been too long out of society and 
                    stilted in conversation.

                                  GARROW
                    As for me I am not listening very well.

      GARROW says this lightly but looks at her for longer than he 
      should. They both know it.

                                  GARROW
                    The case presses me. I must go.

                                  SARAH
                    I wish you well.

                                                              CUT TO:


    As SARAH leaves the house she finds herself confronted by FARMER 
    and an OFFICER. He sees immediately that there is something 
      threatening about their stance.

                                  FARMER
                    Lady Sarah Hill?

                                  SARAH
                    You have identified me. May I ask the 
                    same of you?

    The OFFICER steps forward and hands her a document.

                                  FARMER
                    You are served with a citation from 
                    the Court of Doctors Commons.

    She takes the document, nonplussed, wondering. We see HILL 
      watching from a window.

                                                              CUT TO:                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  40.



    As SARAH is about to leave, MARY approaches.

                                  MARY CHRISTIE
                    Ma am...?

                                  SARAH
                    I shall find a hotel...

                                  MARY CHRISTIE
                    And Samuel? And myself?

                                  SARAH
                    We shall be reunited yet.


      GARROW walks in the rain. He looks at the sky, a realization. 
    The rain no longer an inconvenience. GARROW smiles. It s a 
       eureka  moment.
