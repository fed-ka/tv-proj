EAST RIVER - (AERIAL) - NIGHT
... Becoming a darkness pricked with light, as WE FLOAT
over the reflective river, MOVING WEST TOWARD AND OVER THE
CITY.
MANHATTAN - (AERIAL CONTINUED) - NIGHT
The fabled city, the ultimate object of man's desire and
fulfillment, Oz, the city unfolding itself before and
beneath us, till DAZZLING SHAFTS OF LIGHT sizzling up --
KLEIG LIGHTS -- stab our eyes and bring us down into their
BLINDING BRIGHTNESS...
CLUB - MIDTOWN - NIGHT
A nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the
hottest thing in town.
PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and
ARRIVALS.
There is a public line, and from it the young,
hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at
the formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at
the private line.
A glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala
is in progress tonight.
The club's private entrance looks
like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and
the joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving
through the X-rated doorway.
THE CLUB - NIGHT
as a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window
rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.
The MANAGER of the
club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the
invitees.
MANAGER
(a dilemma)
I'm sorry, Mr. Venza...
VENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning
rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of
the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the
CORNER.
WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - CLUB - NIGHT
A uniformed COP guarding the door as MIKE approaches,
flashing his shield.
COP
Quit playing with yourself, Keegan.
I know who you are.
MIKE
(grinning)
A Detective's supposed to identify
himself.
CUT TO:
BACK OF MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY
ELLIE IS SEEN unloading groceries from the rear of a small
hatchback...
MANHATTAN - FIFTH AVENUE - EARLY EVENING
Mike emerges from the subway alongside the park.
FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDINGS - EARLY EVENING
Out front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's
children returning from music lessons.
Across the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly
tenants stroll in the company of their nurse:
a nanny
pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.
This
is one of New York's most exclusive co-ops.
Distilled
civilization and quiet wealth.
A world away from Queens
or anything else.
MIKE arrives on foot.
LOBBY - EVENING
A notice behind the locked front door informs:
"ALL
VISITORS MUST BE ANNOUNCED".
MIKE displays his shield to
the DOORMAN through the glass.
The DOORMAN opens, taking
the time to inspect his credentials before returning them,
then STEPS ASIDE, allowing ENTRY.
MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS
The neighborhood still asleep in the predawn hour; MIKE
picks up the newspaper... glancing at it, he opens it,
sees an article and photograph of CLAIRE on the second
page.
He heads inwards...
CUT TO:
MIKE'S BACKYARD - DAY
ELLIE and TOMMY visible only as fragments as they work on
MIKE'S car.
ELLIE IS SEEN as a rear-end in blue jeans,
the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to TOMMY to
"try it again".
It looks like no one's behind the wheel;
but the very top of his head CAN BE SEEN as he strains to
reach the accelerator.
ANGLE ON MIKE:
appearing at the door, in a freshly
pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand.
He walks
across the lawn towards them.
MIKE
Hey!
What the hell're you doin' to
my car?
ELLIE emerges from underneath the hood, flushed.
ELLIE
Changing the sparks.
They showed it
on TV.
What d'you think?
MIKE
I think television's a dangerous
thing.
ELLIE
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Slamming the hood.
TOMMY revs the engine ELLIE moving
down the steps towards MIKE.
ELLIE
Enough, Tommy!
C'mon.
Get out of
there!
ELLIE moving towards MIKE, she slipping her hand into his
underpants:
Their eyes meet, lovingly.
She laughs.
MIKE
Hey.
The neighbors.
ELLIE
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
She retrieves her cold coffee cup from the POTTING TABLE,
checks out the picture of CLAIRE in the newspaper, he's
left there.
MIKE adjusts his tie.
It's very colorful.
ELLIE
I read the article.
You didn't tell
me she was so beautiful.
MIKE
(Mister Honest)
Well, actually, she looks better
than that.
ELLIE playfully makes a move, JABBING AT HIM, MIKE stops
her, ending WITH A HUG.
MIKE
I've got to go.
MIKE kisses her.
ELLIE holds MIKE'S face with her gloved
hand.
MIKE
See you Tommy.
ANGLE ON ELLIE:
as TOMMY comes up and leans against his
mom:
both watching MIKE primp, they share on the joke.
MIKE turns, his face with grease on it.
MIKE
Okay?
ELLIE
Unbelievably handsome.
You look
fantastic in a suit.
TOMMY
Nice threads Dad.
MIKE
Yeah, I think so.
MIKE leaves.
CLAIRE'S BUILDING - SAME - NIGHT
The JOGGER first out the door, taking off with fierce
determination, followed by MIKE, who nervously checks the
street, then opens the limo door and checks inside, then,
finally, MOTIONS CLAIRE OUT.
She moves smoothly into the
limo; MIKE checks traffic behind them, then gets in,
after.
CUT TO:
5TH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT
The limo pulling up, MIKE hopping expertly out before it
stops moving.
It's parked in a red zone, with tow-away signs everywhere;
a PATROLMAN notices from the curb.
MIKE
(to the driver)
Don't move it.
He flashes his shield at the PATROLMAN, takes a firm grip
on CLAIRE'S elbow, guiding her in.
ANGLE - AT THE ENTRANCE DOORS
MIKE stiff-arms the revolving door, stopping outgoing
shoppers to clear the way for CLAIRE; hops over to the
fixed door, opening it quickly for her, hustling her
effortlessly in, zip.
ANGLE:
CLAIRE, taken by it, but not displeased.
GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT
Clearly a "big deal," with Kleig lights and heavy
LIMOUSINE and TAXI traffic being directed into place by
COPS, some of whom we recognize.
ANGLE ON A PAIR OF COPS, using flashlights to guide
traffic -- spotting CLAIRE'S LIMOUSINE with the BLACK-AND-
WHITE PATROL CAR following it, and signaling it into
place.
TRAFFIC COP
(re: Claire's limo)
Bring it in, close.
The COP OPENS THE DOOR -- stunned to see MIKE STEP OUT, in
suit and new tie -- looking like he belongs there.
COP
Jesus Christ.
MIKE
I'm on duty.
COP
What kind of work?
Gigolo?
CLAIRE steps out, utterly elegant, taking MIKE'S arm --
the traffic COPS now joined by those from the BLACK-AND-
WHITE, as MIKE and CLAIRE head INWARD.
The COPS wolf-
whistle MIKE and razz him as they go, some beginning the
STRAINS of "Just a Gigolo"...
MIKE GIVES THEM THE FINGER behind his back.
CUT TO:
GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT
MIKE EXITS the BUILDING bewildered; lost him... RUNS
BLINDLY amidst PEDESTRIANS -- SPOTS VENZA AHEAD.
ANGLE ON VENZA reaching someone MIKE CAN'T SEE.
MIKE puts
his hand in his jacket for his gun.
MIKE
Venza!
VENZA HEARS and SLOWS, but DOESN'T TURN.
ONLOOKERS turn.
VENZA is talking to someone, taking his time.
ANGLE ON VENZA:
untroubled, turning; raising his arms,
and SMILING.
ANGLE ON MIKE:
confused -- seeing that the man VENZA
stopped to talk to is a PATROLMAN, he'd stopped to give
himself up.
CLOSE ON MIKE:
breathless as he moves toward VENZA.
MIKE
frisks VENZA as he turns, SMILING at MIKE.
CUT TO:
TRACT HOME - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - AFTERNOON
A tree-lined neighborhood.
The house has a FOR SALE sign
in front; MIKE is standing in front of a cab, he's dressed
for work -- he looks around.
The cab pulls out, he heads
for the front door.
FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT
CLAIRE and MIKE walking; her arm looped in his -- the
BLACK-AND-WHITE keeping pace alongside them -- their
conversation animated, clearly enjoying one another's
company.
CLAIRE
(laughing)
You mean to tell me, a mugger would
stay away from someone because they
walked a certain way?
MIKE
Absolutely.
Look at this.
He demonstrates a peculiar walk; arms and legs moving in
ridiculous awkwardness.
CLAIRE
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
MIKE
(indignant)
No, no seriously!
There's a study
done on this, you walk this way, the
muggers are gonna single you out.
CLAIRE
And die laughing, because you're
walking so stupid!
MIKE
(mock anger)
Hey.
This is my business.
Do I
tell you your business.
CLAIRE
Okay.
Let's just see if a mugger
gets me.
She takes off down the street; walking stupidly, worse
than he did -- he's LAUGHING as he WATCHES HER GO.
CUT TO:
CITY STREET - NIGHT
The PATROL CAR keeping pace as the two walk home; the COPS
in the BLACK-AND-WHITE exchange a look at what they are
seeing.
MIKE is holding her arm, she's huddled up; she is
cold and he removes his topcoat and puts it around her
shoulders.
CUT TO:
CLAIRE'S BUILDING - NIGHT
The PATROL CAR comes to a STOP as MIKE and CLAIRE ENTER.
ANGLE ON THE TWO COPS AGAIN:
watching them go.
CUT TO:
CLAIRE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING
ANGLE on MIKE:
as he rounds a corner ALMOST BUMPING INTO
the JOGGER from CLAIRE'S BUILDING; MIKE hurries,
sidestepping him, HEADING toward the ENTRANCE.
ANGLE FROM HIS POV:
CLAIRE'S FRONT ENTRANCE; extra
SECURITY -- A SQUAD CAR PARKED IN FRONT now.
ANGLE ON MIKE:
SPRINTING INWARD.
CUT TO:
MIKE'S STREET - SAME
As MIKE rounds the corner and looks up.
His breath
catches.
His heart starts to pound.
AHEAD, lights ablaze.
ONE COP CAR is in front of his
HOUSE, and a JEEP (Belonging to SCOTTY).
MIKE BREAKS INTO
A RUN.
RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
She weaves toward the car.
MIKE goes after her.
MIKE
Let me drive...
ELLIE
Get away from me... get away!
She
means that much to you, you stay
with her.
But you come back, you
come back for me.
Not for Tommy,
not for your mother, or your fucking
job, but for me.
MIKE
(tortured)
El?
I'm sorry.
I do love you.
(with difficulty)
And you are a lady.
I have so much
respect...
She TURNS and SWINGS AT HIM, catching him SQUARE IN THE
NOSE; he's stunned and bleeding.
ELLIE
(through her tears;
screaming)
You fucker!
Don't tell me how much
respect you have!
You dumb mother
fucking FUCKER!
Now get off this
case or don't come home!!
She RUNS to her car, BURNING RUBBER as she PEELS out of
the PARKING LOT -- leaving MIKE, distraught, gazing after
her.
CUT TO:
PHONE BOOTH - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - EVENING
TRAFFIC ROARING BY -- revealing MIKE, upset, on a pay
phone, a finger in one ear, waiting for the phone to
answer.
MIKE
Hey, T.J.?
Yeah, listen, I need a
huge favor from you, man.
I know
Helen doesn't like you to miss
dinner, but I need you to switch
shifts with me tonight.
(a beat)
Just "personal".
I don't know what
the hell I'm doin', I need some time
to think.
(angered)
Look, do it or don't do it, but
spare me the fuckin' lecture, all
right?
He HANGS UP:
miserable.
CUT TO:
CLAIRE'S BUILDING - EVENING
A SQUAD CAR parked in front, CAMERA PANNING to the DOORS,
as the JOGGER (MR. SPARKS) EXITS, dressed in his usual
outfit, POUNDING DETERMINEDLY across the street.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
as he LOPES INTO THE PARK.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
as he REACHES a STOPLIGHT CROSSING that's
"RED"; he waits to cross, jogging in place; crosses into
the park.
A sinister lone black LIMO approaches, slowing
to a stop behind him, its back door slowly swinging open,
engulfing our sight of him...
CUT TO:
CLAIRE'S BUILDING - LATER
The "JOGGER" returning, obscuring his identity from the
parked PATROL CAR, by wiping his face with a towel.
Before heading to the door, where a DOORMAN stands guard,
he delays as though WAITING FOR SOMETHING.
It's happening:
A dainty teenage VIETNAMESE GIRL,
distracts the DOORMAN at his post, getting enough of his
attention SELLING FLOWERS, and SPOUTING VIETNAMESE, for
the "JOGGER" to SLIP BY, making it inside.
DOORMAN
I know sweetheart... we have enough
flowers here.
ANGLE:
VIETNAMESE GIRL, still spouting.
DOORMAN
No, no, sweetheart... not here...
get going... Okay.
ANGLE: VIETNAMESE GIRL, backing off, seeing the JOGGER
slip by and her mission accomplished.
VIETNAMESE GIRL
(sweetly, to Doorman)
Have a nice day.
THE GIRL:
slyly cursing the DOORMAN in Vietnamese as she
skips off.
CUT TO:
CITY STREET - FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT
Active with nightlife; CAMERA PANNING to a lone figure
walking in the night.
It's MIKE; his collar turned up
against the cold, his face grim and pensive.
He passes an
art gallery and PAUSES to gaze in, his eyes refocusing on
his own reflection staring back at him.
CUT TO:
CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
Outside and far below, the GLOW from the tip of a
CIGARETTE REDDENS the darkness with an inhalation.
VENZA:
He stands, impervious to the cold, looking up at
the windows of CLAIRE'S apartment.
ANGLE UP TO CLAIRE:
SILHOUETTED in the distant window.
VENZA:
finishes his butt, flicks it, satisfied, getting
into HIS CAR curbside and driving away.
CUT TO:
QUEENS - SAME - DAY
CAMERA PANNING TO REVEAL MIKE, leaning on a CAR, under the
"El" waiting.
HE SPOTS TOMMY, coming around the corner
with his SKATEBOARD under his arm, going into a grocery
store.
MIKE crosses the street as TOMMY comes out of the
store.
MIKE
Tommy!
TOMMY SPOTS HIM:
hesitant -- slowly approaching the car.
MIKE
How are things going, pal?
TOMMY
Okay, I guess.
MIKE
How about dinner tonight?
TOMMY
(evasive)
Mom and I got plans.
MIKE
What "plans?"
You and Mom got
"plans?"
TOMMY
(after a long pause)
She's taking singing lessons.
MIKE
(incredulous)
She's what?
TOMMY
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's
who works for a record company.
He
thinks she's got a great voice.
TOMMY is mum:
something dawns on MIKE that sobers him up.
MIKE
(outraged)
What!
What kind of pathetic line is
that?
TOMMY
(pointing)
We're gonna pass the street.
MIKE stops.
His goat is gotten.
TOMMY
You coming in?
MIKE
No, I'm not coming in.
And if you'd
rather go to a "singing lesson" than
have dinner with your father...
TOMMY
We're not going to a singing lesson,
she's just gonna start taking
singing lessons.
MIKE
So, what are you doing tonight?
TOMMY
Shooting.
MIKE
Shooting?
TOMMY
Yeah.
She says we gotta get used to
being alone in this neighborhood.
(a long beat;
observing his
father)
'Bye, Dad.
TOMMY starts toward the HOUSE.
He's emotional, but
doesn't know how to express it.
MIKE
Tommy!
(a parting shot)
The guy's a sleaze-bag.
She can't
sing.
TOMMY
(turning back,
smiling)
I don't think she can sing, either.
MIKE
Take care, pal.
HE TURNS AWAY.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
MIKE'S CAR LEAVING.
TOMMY watches it
until it can be seen no longer, then TURNS, going into the
house.
CAMERA PANS SLOWLY -- REVEALING, far down the BLOCK, a
CAR.
VENZA, and ANOTHER MAN (SOSA), are within:
WATCHING.
STREET - NIGHT
MIKE pounds it out running on the darkened street.
He
pauses to look up at his dark, empty house as a PATROL CAR
slows to check him out.
He studies them as they pass.
CLOSE ON MIKE:
he gazes after them, then continues to
jog.
CUT TO:
MILTON GREGORY SCHOOL - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT
MIKE BOUNDING to his car, CLAIRE hot on his heels.
She
JUMPS into the PASSENGER SEAT, pounding the DOOR LOCK
SHUT.
MIKE
(into his car)
Go!
Get outta here!
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 REACHES HER, pulling on the DOOR.
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1
Hey!
MIKE
Get OUT!
CLAIRE
They're assigned to me, they'll have
to go if I come with you!
MIKE HESITATES.
CLAIRE
(screaming)
I'm not getting out!
GO!
MIKE hits the ACCELERATOR -- PEELING OUT, leaving
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 stranded on the curb.
KOONTZ
(calling to him,
emerging)
Adams...!
C'mon, move it!
ANGLE ON COPS:
RACING FOR THEIR CARS -- SCREECHING OUT.
CUT TO:
STREETS OF QUEENS - SAME - NIGHT
MIKE'S CAR tearing down the STREET -- PURSUED by TWO MORE
SQUAD CARS, one of them not knowing better, GIVING VOICE
TO HIS SIREN!
CUT TO:
MIKE'S HOUSE - SAME - NIGHT
As MIKE'S CAR COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT, MIKE RUNNING OUT
as CLAIRE DUCKS DOWN.
The house is COMPLETELY DARKENED,
blending in with the night; the PURSUIT CARS CONVERGE as
MIKE makes it to the DOOR, his HANDS TREMBLING as he
FUMBLES with his KEYS... takes a deep breath... and
ENTERS.
CUT TO:
THE HOUSE - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT
CLAIRE, having shouted from behind a COP CAR:
KOONTZ
grabbing hold of her to keep her in place.
KOONTZ
(a hiss of warning)
Not another word until I tell you.
CUT TO:
THE HOUSE - SAME MOMENT
KOONTZ receiving his "message".
Quickly assessing CLAIRE,
he looks to the COPS around him -- then GRITS HIS TEETH
with DECISION.
CUT TO:
THE HOUSE - SAME
The LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, their
revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small
gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes,
AMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away.
CAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, in
the distant shadows.
It's CLAIRE, still clad in the
police overcoat, and MIKE.
They are together, but
separate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye.
CLOSER ANGLE ON THEM:
not knowing quite what to say.
MIKE
So.
CLAIRE
So.
ANGLE ON BOTH:
their eyes locked into each other's.
MIKE
You still going away?
CLAIRE
I don't know...
MIKE
You don't have to, now.
CLAIRE
I think it's probably still a good
idea.
CLOSE ON MIKE:
getting her message.
MIKE
Yeah...
Both are hurting.
CLAIRE
(heartfelt)
I'll miss you, Mike.
MIKE
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Her eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile.
But he can't quiet manage it.
CLAIRE
(barely able to
speak)
Say goodbye.
He struggles with it; unable.
MIKE
I like your coat.
CLAIRE
(half-laugh, half-cry)
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
MIKE
I do.
Silence now; their eyes adoring.
CLAIRE
Say goodbye, Mike.
MIKE
(thick voiced)
You take care.
MIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY
AWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER.
They meet, spending a long moment in non-communicative
greeting.
MIKE
(finally)
What do you think?
(a beat)
Any chance?
There's nothin' else
I'm any good at, but this.
GARBER
(noncommittal)
Call me next week.
We'll talk about
it.
MIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, beside
a SQUAD CAR, a distance away.
Girding himself, he HEADS
TOWARD.
ANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and stands
beside them.
Not much to say.
Finally he reaches out and
tousles TOMMY'S hair.
MIKE
Good police work, kiddo.
He catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other.
ELLIE
(re: Tommy)
He doesn't want to sleep here.
(a long beat)
Neither do I.
It's not my house
anymore.
MIKE
Me neither.
ANGLE ON ALL:
finding each other's eyes.
MIKE
Let's find some place to start over.
MIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS A
LONG PULLBACK, as ELLIE moves to his side, and the KEEGAN
FAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY.
WE SEE CLAIRE, being helped
into a SQUAD CAR, turning to look back at them as it PULLS
AWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT, in ALL
DIRECTIONS.
From a distance, we HEAR MIKE'S VOICE.
MIKE (V.O.)
(to Ellie)
What this crap about singing
lessons?
FADE OUT.
