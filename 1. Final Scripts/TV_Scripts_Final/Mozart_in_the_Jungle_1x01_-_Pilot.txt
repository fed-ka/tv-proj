                                      Written by

          Alex Timbers, Roman Coppola, and Jason Schwartzman



                    Based on the memoir by Blair Tindall                                  WOMAN (V.O.)
                    It s easier with the lips slightly 
                    wet.


      INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DUSK

      A spectacular view of Central Park.  PULL BACK to REVEAL: we 
      are in an incredibly luxurious Manhattan penthouse.

      EXTREME CLOSE UP of a young woman s lips.  She breathes in 
      gently.

                                  WOMAN (V.O.)
                    ...in through the nose,
                          (exhaling)
                     out through the mouth. 

      EXTREME CLOSE UP: the lips part and exhale sensually.

      Wider to reveal: HAILEY RUTLEDGE, about 24, with short dark 
      hair and good hyper-intelligent eyes which exude a stealth 
      sexuality mixed perhaps with a youthful self-consciousness.

                                  HAILEY
                    Remember, each breath is a bridge 
                    to another breath.  A story is 
                    being formed...

      Hailey raises an oboe to her lips. BZZZT BZZZT.  A text 
      message alert goes off.

      VIEW ON: DUNCAN, Hailey s 12 year old pupil, texting.

                                  DUNCAN
                            (distracted)
                    Uh huh. Each breath is a bridge.

                                  HAILEY
                            (discouraged)
                    Alright. I think that s enough for 
                    today. 

      Hailey leans over to pack her oboe and Duncan stares at her 
      legs.  BZZZT.  Duncan receives another text.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)
                    Duncan, listen to me, OK?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Yes, Miss Rutledge.                                                                                      2.


                                  HAILEY
                      Tomorrow s a really important day, 
                    ok?  For both of us.  Everyone s 
                    coming. So can you do me a big 
                    favor please: try to practice 
                    before bed? Just a little.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I will, certainly.  Oh, my mom left 
                    your check.  Hold on.   

      He darts off.  BZZZT.

      Hailey pauses, then decides to pick up Duncan s phone. 

      INSERT ON TEXT:  My teacher just bent over.   Is she wearing 
      a bra?    Can t tell looks like it   Sucks!   I wish my dick 
      was a woodwind.  

      Hailey rolls her eyes and picks up her oboe case.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 

      CLOSE on TWO ATTRACTIVE MEN shooting the shit.

                                  MAN 1
                    I'm in the car heading back from 
                    Sag Harbor...

                                  MAN 2
                    Some rich bitch gig?

                                  MAN 1 
                    Exactly.  And she's working my 
                    shaft, my balls, my shaft, my balls 
                    and at this point I'm totally 
                    fucking hammered off six glasses  
                    of Riesling from the reception. 
                    Muttering "Oh yeah, oh yeah" but 
                    I'm, like, drifting...

      Man 2 CHUCKLES darkly.  Man 1 takes a dramatic beat.

                                  MAN 1 (CONT'D) 
                    And then I pass out.

                                  MAN 2
                    No! Was it the Lipitor?                                                                                      3.


                                  MAN 1 
                    Perhaps. Anyways, I m out for I 
                    don't know how long, but next thing 
                    I know I'm awoken with a chomp. And 
                    I'm screaming, and she's screaming, 
                    slapping me in the face. "You 
                      motherfucker, this, you 
                      motherfucker that."

                                  MAN 2 
                          (impressed)
                    Sounds like a complete shit show.

                                  MAN 1 
                    Get this.  Miracle is two minutes 
                    later I had her back downstairs 
                    finishing the job.

      Man 2 doubles over with LAUGHTER.  Interrupted by a voice--

                                  STAGE MANAGER (O.S.) 
                    They're ready for you.

      SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal them both clad in tuxes.  Man 1 
      leans over to Man 2, pats him on the back conspiratorially.

                                  MAN 1 
                    To be continued...don t let me 
                    forget to tell you what she asked 
                    me to call her!

      A small stage door behind them swings open.  The two men 
      straighten their jackets, their bow ties, take a breath, then 
      strut through the doors--


      INT. NY SYMPHONY HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

      --onto the stage of a large symphonic hall, where they're 
      greeted with throngs of APPLAUSE and a STANDING OVATION.

      It's clear: classical musicians are totally bad-ass. 

      OPENING CREDITS SEQUENCE: 

      Thrilling CLASSICAL MUSIC played with virtuosity:

      * A violin section bows in perfect unison.

      * Sheet music pages flip past.

      * A conductor s baton stabs the air.                                                                                      4.


      * An intense PERCUSSIONIST holds his mallet, waiting for his 
      cue. Finally he strikes--BONG!

      CREDITS END

      Beethoven s 9th Symphony ends powerfully.  

      The conductor, THOMAS PEMBRIDGE,(60 S) turns and bows to a 
      packed house. He is handsome. An old lion. 

      The mostly elderly audience applauds enthusiastically. Wives 
      help their husbands to their feet. Thomas quiets the crowd: 

                                  THOMAS
                    Thank you for attending this 
                    evening s performance of 
                      Beethoven s 9th and final symphony. 
                    What a perfect ending to another 
                      magnificent season. 

      He pats his forehead with a silk handkerchief.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    As most of you know, tonight s 
                    concert will mark my final 
                      performance as conductor of this 
                      orchestra. 

      Regretful murmurs mix with thankful applause. 

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    Now, just because you won t see me 
                    here, doesn t mean I won t be here. 
                    In fact, quite the opposite. I have 
                      gratefully accepted the newly 
                    minted role of Executive Musical 
                    Director. So I won t be going 
                      anywhere--just yet.

      The audience cheers.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    Before I go, I want to thank some 
                    very special people here tonight. 
                    Actually, they are here every 
                    night; week after week, season 
                    after season; working tirelessly to 
                    bring these great works to life. 
                      Sometimes, we see each other more 
                    often than our own families do. 
                    Sorry.

      Thomas blows a kiss to his wife somewhere in the darkness. 
      The audience laughs.                                                                                      5.


                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    They are my colleagues, my friends, 
                    my family. They are the men and 
                    women of your Philharmonic. 

      He turns and acknowledges the orchestra. They, in turn, tap 
      their instruments as a sign of respect. 

                                    THOMAS(CONT D)
                    And on that rather suspended note,  
                    please welcome the woman behind the 
                    curtain, our board chairperson Mrs. 
                    Gloria Windsor.

      Gloria Windsor (60 s, Glenn Close type) approaches the 
      spotlight. Thomas steps off to the side.  She applauds him.

                                  GLORIA
                    Good evening and thank you Thomas. 
                    For everything. And so, as one 
                    movement ends, another must begin. 
                    It is my honor to introduce you to 
                    someone special. A man who has set 
                    the classical world ablaze.

      Audience members start murmuring with excitement. 

                                  GLORIA (CONT D)
                    We first heard about him when he 
                    headlines as youngest person ever 
                    to claim the Mahler Award For Young 
                      Conductors. He was 12.

      FAST CUTS as the SYMPHONIC MUSIC drowns out any other sounds.

      cobblestone side streets -- arm around a beautiful ballerina.

      -The cover of Rolling Stone. 

      -In an Eastern European town square, an enormous tarp is

      INT. NY SYMPHONY HALL - STAGE


      The audience erupts.

                                  GLORIA
                    Please join me in welcoming a man 
                    who need only be introduced by his 
                    first name: your new conductor and 
                    Musical Director, the spectacularly 
                    talented GUSTAVO!

      She points to the balcony nearest the stage.  A spotlight 
      finds Gustavo, 28, devastatingly handsome, trim, with long 
      curly hair. He stands and waves. He wears designer shades and 
      a black button up shirt with no tie, and a super-thin black 
      leather tuxedo jacket. 

      The orchestra and audience leap to their feet and applaud the 
      young conductor. 

      Gustavo pulls out a baton and taps the banister. The crowd 
      falls silent.  The orchestra, caught off guard, immediately 
      take their seats.                                                                                        7.


      Gustavo, raises his baton as if he is about to begin 
      conducting and MAGICALLY it transforms into a FLOWER.  He 
      offers it to the crowd with a radiant smile.

      The orchestra and audience laugh uproariously.  With this 
      playful gesture, Gustavo has won over the auditorium.  

      SIDE of STAGE: Thomas smiles with teeth gritted tightly, he 
      is covering it well--but inside he burns with jealous anger. 

      The two conductors - Thomas and Gustavo - bow to one another.  

      The torch has been passed.  

      Gloria puts her hand on Thomas  shoulder.

                                  GLORIA (CONT D)
                    See you tonight?

                          (sharply)
                    Gloria, I love you--but don t 
                      underestimate me.


      INT. NY SYMPHONY HALL - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

      MOVING VIEW: Thomas bursts through the stage doors.  A stage 
      manager gives him the thumbs up.

                                  STAGE MANAGER
                    Great performance, maestro!

      Thomas flashes a pained smile.

      His assistant, SHARON, approaches him holding out a folder. 

                                  THOMAS 
                    Not now.

      Thomas peels off his jacket and tosses it to her as he 
      marches off.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    Was he really wearing a leather 
                    tuxedo?

      Thomas exits. 

      On Sharon, stunned by the outburst.  She continues after him, 
      as CAMERA continues past her, through a door--

      TRACKING ACROSS musicians as they wipe down their instruments 
      and pack up.

      --A violinist takes off his clip-on tie and tuxedo jacket, 
      revealing ordinary street clothes beneath.

      --The timpanist and the French horn player make a quick, 
      discrete drug transaction.

      --An attractive woman in her early 50 s, CYNTHIA (think Susan 
      Sarandon) zips up her cello case and WE FOLLOW her as she 
      steps out into:


      EXT. NY SYMPHONY HALL - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT 

      The pouring rain.  Taxis honk and swerve around double-parked 
      town cars.

      Musicians litter the alley, smoking cigarettes, and taking  
      swigs from shared flasks. 

      Cynthia walks up to an older man, BRUNO, who is holding a 
      large upright bass as he manages to flag a taxi.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    Hey sexy, you going downtown?

                                  BRUNO
                    Sorry, I m going up, Cyn.

                    Shit, I gotta be in Times Square in 
                    20 minutes.

                      Two-a-nights.  Ouch!  Here, you 
                    take this one.

      Cynthia gives Bruno a kiss and a hug, then hops in the taxi.

      Bruno admires her perfect body as she hikes up her black 
      evening gown a bit to step into the back with her instrument.

      PAN TO REVEAL Thomas who is also taking a moment to watch 
      Cynthia s sexy ass.  

      Sharon stands impassively behind, holding an umbrella over 
      him.

                                  THOMAS
                    Bruno, she played you beautifully.                                                                                      9.

                            (smiling)
                      Bravissima.

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Thomas, darling--over here!

      But Thomas doesn t notice--he is still staring at Cynthia.  

      Sharon taps Thomas on the shoulder.

                                  SHARON
                    Sir, your wife is trying to get 
                    your attention.

      A matronly woman, 60s, waves a bejewelled hand out the window 
      of a Town Car.  Thomas  face tightens as he gets into the 
      car.  A Chauffeur shuts the door.

      Sharon raps on the tinted window.  Thomas rolls it down.

                                  SHARON (CONT D)
                          (holding out the papers)
                    Mr. Pembridge.  Please.  They will 
                    need a quote from you.

      Thomas snatches it.  The car pulls away, gets about ten feet, 
      screeches to a halt.  He rolls down the window.

                                  THOMAS
                    What s this?!

                                  SHARON
                    The press release is going out

      EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

      The Imperial Theater marquee glows with: 

       STYX s Oedipus Rocks!  

                                                                            Cut to:


      INT. IMPERIAL THEATER STAGE - NIGHT

      Curtain rises to reveal:

      Distressed Grecian columns in front of a cyclorama depicting 
      the Parthenon. A man in a tunic stands downstage, belting--                                                                                    10.

      INT. ORCHESTRA PIT - CONTINUOUS

      CAMERA TRAVELS DOWN: As we discover a conductor with a comb-
      over, lustily swinging his baton.  

      STILL LOWER: To find the cramped orchestra, bored and sawing 
      away.  

      The ensemble is a fusion of rock and classical.  There are 
      about 15 musicians including Hailey.  

      Cynthia enters through a small door and expertly navigates 
      her way through the dimly lit pit.  She takes her place at an 
      empty chair just in front of Hailey.

      Cynthia is very late and the conductor shoots a disapproving 
      look. Clearly not the first time this has happened.

      Cynthia removes her cello, clicks on her lamp--but stumbles 
      to find her place in the sheet music.  

      Hailey reaches forward and flips Cynthia s music to the 
      correct page and Cynthia comes in JUST in time.

      ONSTAGE:

      The Grecian columns rotate to reveal six slutty Vegas-style 
      dancer girls in fishnets and boots.

      INT. ORCHESTRA PIT - NIGHT

      Hailey and Cynthia put away their instruments and sheet 
      music.

      The conductor, BERNARD, approaches.

                                    BERNARD
                    Cynthia, you re killing me.

      Cynthia leads Hailey towards the exit.

                    You re welcome.

      ANGLE ON: Thomas, soaking wet, standing in the doorway 
      brooding. Sharon stands behind him, meekly.

      Thomas surveys the room. A chilled silence. He holds the 
      press release in his fist.

                    Perhaps I should leave.

      Gustavo double-kisses Gloria goodbye.

                                  THOMAS
                    Well? Don t you have anything to

                          (cutting)
                    Say something--in English.

      Gustavo stops at the door.  With his back to the room, he 
      speaks decisively.  

                                    GUSTAVO
                    Your first chair violinist, Emily 
                    Wu, played sharp seventeen times in 
                    the first movement.  French Horns 
                    came in half a bar late in the 
                    adagio, throwing off the bassoons, 
                      ultimately destroying any 
                      possibility of Beethoven s desired 
                    dynamic shift in bars forty-five 
                    through fifty three.  And the 
                    second chair bass, Bruno Cassel, is 
                    so old he can barely hold his bow.  
                      I couldn t tell who you were 
                    torturing more, me or him.

      Long, awful silence.

                                  THOMAS
                    You prick.

      Gustavo turns to face them all.                                                                                     14.


                                    GUSTAVO
                    I m replacing six chairs 
                      immediately.
                          (to Gloria)
                    Gloria, you ve been an exceptional 
                    hostess.

      He drains his glass and turns to Thomas.

                                    GUSTAVO (CONT D)
                          (sincerely)

                    neither you nor the traditions of 
                    this great institution.

      Gustavo walks past Sharon.  She smiles at him, turned on by 
      his charisma. Thomas, for once, is speechless.

                                                                            Cut to:


      INT. JOE ALLEN BAR - NIGHT

      PAN PAST: Rows of framed Broadway posters of famous flops. 
       Capeman,   Carrie,   Dance of the Vampires ...

      This Broadway post-show haunt is a lot dingier and more 
      homespun than the luxe Fiorello s.

      A cute WAITER, 20 s, tall and thin places a pair of tumblers 
      on Cynthia and Hailey s table.

                                  WAITER
                    Two whiskies. Straight up for the 
                    silver fox.

      Hailey watches him walk away.  Cynthia picks up on it.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    Cute ass, right?

                      (embarrassed)
                    Totally.

      Hailey takes a sip of the whiskey, shakes at its strength.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    I bet he s a dancer. They re the

      Cynthia leans in conspiratorially.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    Anecdotal evidence and my personal 
                      scientific research suggests 
                    there s a direct correlation 
                    between what a man DOES for a 
                    living and the way he fucks.

      Hailey almost spits out her drink. 

      Cynthia nods to a nearby table of men. Little black 
      instrument cases hang from their seats:

      A DARK BEDROOM: a WOMAN (with a late 70 s hairstyle) 
      straddles a MAN.  He becomes over-excited and comes 
      instantly.  She rolls off of him in total disappointment.

                    Kind of fun, for about ten minutes. 
                    Good cardio though.

      Hailey laughs and downs the rest of her drink.  She scans the 
      room and spots two men in turtle necks at the bar.                                                                                    16.


                                  HAILEY
                          (playing along)
                    What about them?

                                    CYNTHIA
                    Pianists. Tricky. Typically they ll 
                    fall into two general groups. Jazz 
                    and Classical.  I go for Jazz.

                                  HAILEY
                    Why?

      BATHROOM STALL: Door opens and Cynthia (now with a 90 s 
      hairstyle) tumbles in to the stall with a pianist.  He runs 
      his hands across her body and up her skirt, fingering her.

                                    CYNTHIA
                      Improvisation--they play off YOU. 
                    Also, they re into ensembles.

      She moans in delight.  The stall door opens and they are 
      joined by another woman. 

                                                                          BACK TO:
      BAR: Cynthia considers the memory fondly.


      Hailey grins wide like a Cheshire cat.  It s clear that deep 
      within her lies an untapped sexuality.

                                  HAILEY
                    What about conductors?

      Cynthia downs her whiskey.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    Trust me, too complicated.

      Suddenly, Cynthia fumbles for her phone--

      INSERT: Text message:  Where are you?  Cynthia takes a deep 
      breath, tucks the phone away.  She motions to the waiter.

                                    CYNTHIA (CONT D)
                    Hailey, oboists are a rare 
                    commodity these days.  Strings, on 
                    the other hand? We re like hyenas 
                    fighting over the same dead animal.  
                      (Sincerely)  You re really good.

      Hailey smiles, flattered. The waiter approaches their table. 

                                  WAITER
                    Anything else ladies?                                                                                    17.

                                  WAITER
                          (taken aback, smiles)
                    Joshua. 

      Hailey looks mortified.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    You look like a dancer Joshua, am I 
                    right?

      He laughs, good-natured, self-confident.

                                  JOSHUA
                      Yes--ballet, studying at Juilliard.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    Well then, Joshua, Hailey. Hailey, 
                    Joshua.
                          (to Joshua)
                    Hailey is an oboist from North 
                    Carolina.  (to Hailey) Joshua is a 
                    ballet dancer here in New York.

      She winks at Hailey.

                                  HAILEY
                          (trying not to turn red)
                    Nice to meet you.

                                  JOSHUA
                          (laughs)
                    You too, Hailey.

      He stares at her for a moment, infatuated. Hailey doesn t 
      know whether to swoon or jump out a window.

      Just then, Cynthia s phone vibrates with another text. 

      INSERT:  I need to see you NOW. 

      Cynthia texts back.

                                    CYNTHIA
                          (while typing)
                    Listen, I better be going.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    18.

                                    CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                          (to Joshua)
                    Why don t you sit down and the two 
                    of you chat a while?

      Hailey s eyes widen.  Josh smiles.

                                  HAILEY
                          (panicky, to Cynthia)
                    But... We could share a cab.  

      Cynthia places a hand on Hailey s shoulder as she collects 
      her purse.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    I m not taking a cab.  Give me your 
                    phone number.  Let s stay in touch.

      Hailey pulls out a home printed business card.  Cynthia takes 
      it, throws some cash on the table and leaves.  

      There is an awkward moment between Joshua and Hailey.

                                  HAILEY
                    You don t actually have to stay 
                    here and talk to me.

                                  JOSHUA
                    Well, I was about to take off.  A 
                    bunch of us are going out tonight 
                    if you want to come with?

                                  HAILEY
                    I d love to but I have to get up 
                    early tomorrow.

                                  JOSHUA
                    My loss.   

      Off Hailey. Smitten.


      INT. TOWN CAR/MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

      VIEW THROUGH the tinted window of an idling town car: WE SEE   
      a figure waiting on the sidewalk.  The window rolls down, 
      it s Cynthia.

                                    CYNTHIA
                          (annoyed)
                    This is a hundred and fifty 
                    thousand dollar-priceless cello, 
                    you asshole.                                                                                    19.


                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Just get in.

                    Don t treat me like a hooker.   I 
                    shouldn t have taught you how to 
                    text.  Pop it. 

      The trunk opens.


      INT. TOWN CAR/MANHATTAN - NIGHT

      Cynthia and Thomas ride in silence.  Finally:

                                  THOMAS
                    My world is falling apart.

      He takes a sip of scotch.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    He s good, isn t he?

      Cynthia stares at him, not sure what to say.

                                    THOMAS(CONT D)
                    Would you fuck him?

                                    CYNTHIA
                        (annoyed)
                    Oh please. (beat)
                    Is this the kind of night it s 
                    going to be?
                          (to the driver)
                    Let me out.

                                  THOMAS
                    (to driver)
                    Keep going. 

                                    CYNTHIA
                    If you have to ask the question, 
                    you already know the answer: yes 
                    he s good. He s a monster.

                                  THOMAS
                    He s making cuts.

      He has Cynthia s undivided attention.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    Woodwinds and brass.  For now. 

      Thomas chuckles ruefully, staring out at the night skyline.                                                                                    20.


                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    I was him once.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    You still are. 

      Then with one flick of her hand, Cynthia springs open his 
      belt buckle.  He grabs the back of her head and pulls her 
      close.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. HAILEY S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

      Hailey approaches an industrial looking building in a sketchy 
      neighborhood.


      INT. HAILEY S APARTMENT-CONT D

      A party is going full swing in the tiny apartment.  Forty 
      people smoke, drink and shout over loud classical music. 

      -TWO NERDY GUYS share a bottle of Schnapps and listen 
      intensely as they read along to the sheet music.

                                  GUY #1
                    Listen to that legato!

                                  GUY #2
                          (deeply impressed)
                    I just came.

      -A super stoned girl smokes pot from a bassoon crudely 
      fashioned into a bong. 


      -A hand reaches into a secret compartment inside a violin 
      case and pulls out a baggy of coke and a rolled up bill.

      -A petite and sexy blonde puts on a Georges Bizet LP.  This 
      is LIZZIE, Hailey s gregarious roommate and best friend. 

                                  LIZZIE
                    Let s get Bizet!

      She scratches the record DJ-style.

      Hailey opens the front door and enters.  The look on her face 
      tells us that these parties happen all the time.  She just 
      wishes it wasn t tonight.                                                                                    21.


                                  LIZZIE (CONT D)
                    Ohhh shit--look who s here--the 
                    party s about to get craaazzee!

      People cheer.  Hailey gives a mocking  raise the roof  
      gesture.  She tosses her keys into the bowl.

                                  LIZZIE (CONT D)
                    You gotta see my new invention, try 
                    it.

      PAN TO REVEAL:

      Partygoers crouching around a joint taped to a metronome.  A 
      person takes a hit each time it goes back and forth.

                                  HAILEY
                      Awesome--but I need my lungs 
                    tomorrow morning.  I m going to bed 
                      everybody.

                                  LIZZIE
                    Bed?!  Looks like your bed s taken.

      Lizzie points to a funky brown couch.  A sexy Japanese girl 
      sits with a cello between her legs.  An intense guy with a 
      goatee sits behind, guiding her bow.

                                  HAILEY
                    Ugh.  Then I m sleeping in your 
                    bed.

                                  LIZZIE
                    Just stay up--have a drink, relax, 
                    go nuts.

                                  HAILEY
                          (dry)
                    Relaxing and going nuts are 
                      opposites.  I love you.  Goodnight. 


      INT. BEDROOM

      Hailey stands in her bra and panties brushing her teeth.  

      She applies face cream.  

      She lays out her one nice dress and a pair of shoes for 
      tomorrow s recital.

      She sets her phone alarm, hits the light and gets into bed.  
      She feels something--pulls out some men s briefs and tosses 
      them onto the floor.                                                                                     22.


      Darkness.  The party THUMPS on the background.  

      SUDDENLY, the door swings open.  Light floods in.   


                                  LIZZIE
                    Hot guys are on their way over. 
                    Want me to save one for you?

                                  HAILEY
                    No.

      She shuts the door.  Then comes back in.

                                  LIZZIE
                    There s a flutist out here who 
                    wants to play you in  showdown .  
                    He says he s awesome but I think 
                    you can take him.

                                  HAILEY
                    No.

                                  LIZZIE
                    That s what I told him.

      Hailey puts the pillow over her head.

      A muffled chant from the living room grows louder:

                                  EVERYBODY
                    Hailey! Hailey! Hailey!

      She opens the door, squinting in the bright light.  

                                  HAILEY
                    (a smile cracks)
                    I hate you guys.

                                                                            Cut to:

      Knuckles crack.  A flute is assembled.  Shots are poured. 

      Hailey sits opposite her opponent, a frail yet confident 
      FLUTIST.  They stare each other down as they warm up.

      A Chianti bottle whirls on an old piece of cardboard that has 
      a pie chart indicating an era of music (Romantic, Baroque, 
      20th Century) as well as drinking instructions.

      The bottle lands on  ROMANTIC--2 shots .  Oohs  from the 
      gathered crowd.                                                                                    23.


      The flutist downs the drinks.  He gags and recovers.  The 
      referee passes over some sheet music.  The flutist plays--
      he s very good.  The crowd is rapt.

      Now it s Hailey s turn to spin the bottle.  Lizzie rubs her 
      shoulders like a coach.  

                                  LIZZIE
                    Soon, he ll be begging someone to 
                    pull the flute out of his ass.

      Hailey downs the shots and takes the sheet music.  

      She licks her lips and begins to play.  She is quite 
      incredible and plays flawlessly.    

      The flutist raises his eyebrow:  not bad .

      The bottle spins.  Another shot.  It goes back and forth 
      intensely: the passages are becoming more complex and the 
      alcohol taking effect.  

      The crowd is on the edge of their seats.

      The flutist finishes with a flourish.  Sneers. 

      Now it s Hailey again.  She downs 2 shots.  Amazingly, she is 
      able to play an very elaborate piece with precision.  The 
      crowd all recognize that she is bound to be the winner.

      Lizzie gestures  smack-down!   

      Unbeknownst to Hailey, Josh, The waiter from Joe Allen comes 
      in the door with some friends.  

      He is transfixed as he watches Hailey s fingers.  It is 
      beyond sensual.

                                  JOSHUA
                          (to himself)
                      Incredible...

      Suddenly Hailey notices Josh watching her and sharps a note, 
      badly.  She turns bright red.  Loses focus, stops DEAD.  

      The crowd all hoot and laugh.  The flute nerd pumps his fist!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - LATER

      Hailey, drunk and embarrassed, sits outside on the fire 
      escape.  Lizzie comes out and joins her.                                                                                    24.


                                  LIZZIE
                          (urgently)
                    OMG.  How do I look?  Tranny 
                      trainwreck?

                                  HAILEY
                    You look fine. Totally fine. Why?

                                  LIZZIE
                    Those dancers are here!  One of 
                      them--Joshua Merriweather--my 
                    friend says he s the hottest thing 
                    at Juilliard. 
                          (beat) 
                    I m going to seduce him.

      A knock on the window.  The two girls turn to find Joshua 
      poking his head out the window.  

                                  LIZZIE (CONT D)
                          (trying to cover)
                    ...so yeah, I was like,  It s been 
                    totes hard since my ex-boyfriend 
                    died... 

                                  JOSHUA
                    Mind if I join you?

      Joshua climbs out onto the fire escape.

                                  LIZZIE
                          (seductive)
                    Heya.  I m Lizzie, this is my 
                    place.  That s my roommate...

                                  JOSHUA
                    Hailey.  We met.

      Lizzie, taken aback, is instantly jealous.  

      Just then a drunk boy sticks his head out the window.

                                  DRUNK BOY
                    Lizzie.  You better get in here...
                          (shameful pause)
                    Um, it s kind of an emergency. 
                    Vomit in your victrola.

                                  LIZZIE
                    Fuck, that s an antique!
                          (to Joshua, all flirty)
                    The duties of the host beckon... I 
                    won t be long.                                                                                    25.


      Joshua smiles, watching her go and rolls his eyes to Hailey.  
      He removes a one-hitter from his coat and takes a deep hit.

                                  JOSHUA
                          (exhaling)
                    Want some?

                                  HAILEY
                    No thanks.  Smoke is the enemy.

      Hailey shivers.  Joshua wafts it away.  

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)
                    It s freezing.

                                  JOSHUA
                    Here.

      He unwraps the scarf from his neck and puts it around Hailey.

                                  JOSHUA (CONT D)
                    You play amazingly well.

                                  HAILEY
                    Thanks. 

      Awkward pause. 

                                  JOSHUA
                     North Carolina, huh?

      Hailey nods.  

                                  JOSHUA (CONT D)
                    I m from Nashville.  Kind of close. 
                          (beat)
                    Pretty overwhelming place, huh?

      Hailey looks up.  A kindred spirit.

                                  HAILEY
                          (gently)
                    Totally. I feel like all I do is 
                    spend my time doing is figuring out 
                    how to make money, how to be a good 
                    roommate, a good daughter, a good 
                      girlfriend-- 
                          (a moment between them)
                    Like none of it s about the art. 
                    When I m successful--

      She drifts off.                                                                                    26.


                                  JOSHUA
                    You think it will be easier?

      A beat.  Hailey considers this darkly.

                                  HAILEY
                    It better be.

                                  JOSHUA 
                          (meaningfully)
                    I always wondered, do your lips 
                    hurt after playing like that?

      Hailey is uneasy.  He is clearly hitting on her, but in a 
      very sweet way.  He moves in closer and puts his fingers on 
      her lips.

                                  HAILEY 
                    They used to.  Now they are kind of 
                    used to being used I guess.

      Joshua leans in and kisses Hailey softly.  Then, interrupting 
      the moment, Lizzie sticks her out head the window.  

      Joshua and Hailey pull apart.  Hailey is very embarrassed.

                                  LIZZIE
                          (still jealous)
                    Sorry to break that up, but Hailey,  
                    I think Hank had an accident on 
                    your bed as well. 
                          (to Joshua)
                    My couch.  

      Hailey stands up quickly and bumps her head on the fire 
      escape.

                                  HAILEY
                    Shit!

      She hurriedly gives Joshua back his scarf and goes inside. 
      Lizzie comes out and casually sits next to Joshua.  Close.

                                  LIZZIE 
                          (forced flirtation)
                    It s cold outside of my apartment 
                    huh?
                          (re: the scarf)
                    Mind if I borrow that?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The sound of a ringtone: Pachalbel s Canon.                                                                                    27.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

      Sunlight streaming in through dirty windows.

      Hailey, asleep on the couch, blinks awake.  She fumbles for 
      her ringing cellphone alarm.


      INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

      Her hair is a mess, her eyes are bloodshot.  

      She takes four Advil and splashes water on her face.


      INT. LIVING ROOM

      Hailey, wearing her nice black dress, steps over zonked out 
      musicians and beer bottles as she spots her oboe case beneath 
      a drunk girl s head.  She grabs it.

                                  DRUNK GIRL
                    What the fuck, mom!?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Elevators doors open to REVEAL:

      Hailey wearing huge sunglasses.  She steps out, moving 
      slowly.

      Her POV: moving through the tony apartment (from the opening 
      scene). Chairs are arranged by a little stage in the living 
      room.  Well-dressed guests mill about.


      INT. DUNCAN S ROOM.

      Duncan holds the oboe.

                                  DUNCAN
                      I practiced last night.  Focused on 
                    my breathing--like you said...

                                  HAILEY
                    Duncan, shut up.  (Deliberately)  
                    Get me some water.  I m extremely 
                    hung over and I m not proud of it.  

      A KNOCK on the door.  Duncan gets the water.                                                                                    28.


                                    WOMAN S VOICE
                    (through door, enthusiastic)  
                    Ten minutes till showtime!

      Duncan brings the glass.

      CLOSE ON DUNCAN

                                  DUNCAN
                          (seriously)
                    Each breath is a bridge to another 
                    breath.  Like a story unfolding...

      A message alert BUZZES.  Duncan looks at Hailey, slightly 
      annoyed.

      Hailey plays the message on speakerphone.

                                    CYNTHIA
                             (voice mail)
                    Hailey.  It s Cynthia.  I don t 
                    care what the fuck you are doing 
                    right now, drop it and get over to 
                    the Symphony Hall.  Gustavo is 
                    holding auditions! They are seeing 
                    woodwinds until 11.  You didn t 
                    hear it from me.

      Hailey rubs her temples.

                                  HAILEY
                    I can t fucking believe this is 
                      happening.

      Duncan is pleasantly surprised by her choice of language.  

      She shakes her head, crestfallen.  

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)
                    Ok, where were we?

                                  DUNCAN
                    --You re going to be late.

                                  HAILEY
                      I can t...

                                  DUNCAN
                      Hailey--go.

      Hailey slips her sunglasses back on and grabs her oboe case.                                                                                     29.


                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    You can sneak out through the 
                    service elevator.

                                  HAILEY
                    What about your mom?  

                                  DUNCAN
                    You kidding?  If you get that job 
                    my mom will brag to everybody that 
                    her son takes lessons from the 
                    oboist of the New York Phil.  Get 
                    out of here.

      She kisses him on the cheek and is out the door.  His face 
      turns RED and he instantly reaches for his phone to send a 
      text.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SYMPHONY HALL STAGE - DAY

      A LARGE WHITE SCREEN stands alone on the stage.  

      The SILHOUETTE of an auditioning oboist is cast by a lone 
      spotlight.  (Note: the screen keeps those who are auditioning 
      anonymous.) 


      INT. NY SYMPHONY HALL

      A dim music stand light in the audience illuminates Gustavo 
      and his assistant, Sharon. (Previously Thomas  assistant)   

      Eyes shut, he listens intensely to the music. Suddenly: 

                                    GUSTAVO
                          (to Sharon)
                    NO.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. TAXI

      Hailey checks her watch. 

      She is trying her best to cut a reed for the oboe as the car 
      lurches through the halting traffic. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    30.


      INT. NY SYMPHONY HALL

      Gustavo watches another audition, through fingers folded 
      across his face.  Leans over to Sharon.  

                                    GUSTAVO
                          (insistent)
                    Not perfect. Needs to be perfect.

                                                                            Cut to:


      INT. TAXI - DAY

      Hailey leans forward.

                                  HAILEY
                    Excuse me sir, how much longer?

      The driver, who has been talking on the phone in a foreign 
      language, shouts back:

                                  DRIVER
                    Faster if you walk.

      Hailey urgently shoves a wad of crumpled bills, coins, and a 
      METROCARD through the divider.

                                  HAILEY
                    It s got like five dollars on it-- 
                    sorry!

      She stumbles out the cab door, only a few blocks left to go.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. NY SYMPHONY HALL

      The final audition has ended.  Only the empty chair is in 
      silhouette. 

                                    GUSTAVO
                          (to Sharon)
                    Next?

                                  SHARON
                    It s over, sir.  

      Gustavo takes this in.  Deep, disappointed breath.

      He rises, collects some papers, and leaves.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    31.


      EXT. NY SYMPHONY HALL - FRONT STEPS - DAY

      Hailey races up the steps--two at a clip.  She passes a 
      HOMELESS MUSICIAN playing the violin. The sight stops Hailey 
      for a moment dead in her tracks.  She shakes her head in 
      dismay.

      Then ducks under a canopy and through the stage door.

                                                                            Cut to:


      INT. NY SYMPHONY HALL - CONTINUOUS

      Hailey steps onto the stage and stares at the empty seats. 

      It s over.  Crushed that she has missed her chance, she 
      begins to cry.  

      She starts to walk off the stage--but stops.  

      She slowly walks towards the auditioning chair and sits down.  
      She opens her oboe case. 

      Inside, something surprises her: wrapped around her oboe is 
      Joshua s scarf.  A note written on sheet music reads:

       If found please call Joshua Merriweather at 212 555-6768 

      She smiles as she puts the scarf around her neck. 

      Then, as if it were the audition, she takes in the deepest 
      breath of her life. 

      IN THE DARKNESS behind a curtain of a box seat--Gustavo is 
      pressing his body against Sharon as he works his hand under 
      her shirt.  She breathes heavily.

      Then Hailey begins to play.  

      The sound stops Gustavo dead in his tracks.  He looks up.  

      He sees the lone silhouette of Hailey playing.  

      Gustavo leaves Sharon standing there.  He sits down.  Closes 
      his eyes. 

      He DIMS his reading lamp slowly until it is...

      ...BLACK.

      All we hear is the rapturous melody of the OBOE.
