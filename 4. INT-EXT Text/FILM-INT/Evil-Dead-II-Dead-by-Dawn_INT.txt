TRACKING SHOT
The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
unusual jagged edged weapon.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And then...
The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
illuminating his face.
This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
KNOWBY.
An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
been protecting him from the sand.
He stares at the
Book, awestruck.
Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
Raymond's side and takes his hand.
Immediately behind
her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
old, strong stance and beautiful.
Behind her a
handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.
He
moves to Annie's side.
They exchange excited glances.
The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

The sound of RAYMOND reciting the passages is faded
down AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and
over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
and forward into the light.
As she rocks forward into
the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
eyes have changed to a milky white.
She continues to

RAYMOND
It has only been a few hours since
I've translated and spoke aloud the first
of the demon resurrection passages from
the Book of the Dead.
The sound of heavy footsteps.
Dust drifts down INTO
FRAME.
Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar.
It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
floor above him.
And then, the footsteps halt.
RAYMOND
And now, I fear that my wife has become
host to a Kandarian demon.
May God forgive
me for what I have unleashed onto this
earth.

We rip through this door
and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
and he swings shut in our face.
We rip through to
reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.
We follow him
through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
Hallway.
We round the corner after him and see that
Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
trace of him.
We look about for him, but he is gone.
