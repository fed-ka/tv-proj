appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.
VOICE (MCP)
You're getting brutal, Sark.
Brutal and needlessly sadistic.
The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
a drug addict, eyes glazed.
SARK
Thank. you, Master Control.
MCP
We might be capturing some military
programs soon... that interest you?
SARK
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these
guys ... be a nice break from these

(CROM) is being escorted by a guard..
CAPTIVE (CROM)
Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just
a compound interest program, I work
at a savings and loan. I can't play
in these video games...
GUARD
Sure you can, pal. You're a natural
athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...
CROM
Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
of breath. Hey, really...you're
gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
really mad. He's a full branch manager...
GUARD

Great, another religious nut.
They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the
protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.

as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's
shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door,
an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows,
we can see the back of another captive program, and through the
other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:
PROGRAM (RAM)
Welcome to luxury living.
The new captive looks up, nervous.
CROM
Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
what I'm doing here.
RAM
You believe in the Users?
CROM
Sure, if I don't have a User, then
who wrote me?
RAM
That's what you're doing here. Master
Control Program's been snapping up
all us programs who believe...if he
thinks you're useful, he takes over
all your functions so he gets bigger...
an' if he can't use you, he sends you
down here to the Game Grid to get the
bits blasted outta you. What's your name?
CROM
Crom.
RAM
I'm Ram. They'll train you for
the games, but ... well, I hope you
make it okay. Hey, what's going on
in the other sectors? I've been stuck
in this Grid for 200 microcycles.
He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.
CROM
It's murder out there. You can't even
travel around your own microcircuits
without permission from that Master
Control creep. Hauling me down here to
play games...who does he calculate he is?
(holds his head in his hands)
If only Tron was still around...
He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange,
still expression on his face.
CROM
You ever see that guy in action?
Hundred-percent independent. MCP
couldn't tell him what to --
He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.

There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.

A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
printed out on the screen:
REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
Password: MASTER.
The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.
MCP
Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.
Dillinger settles into a chair.
DILLINGER
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
What's up?
MCP
It's our friend the boy detective.
He's nosing around again.
DILLINGER
Flynn?
MCP
Yes.
It felt like Flynn.
DILLINGER
He's still looking for that old file...
can't you just appropriate it?
MCP
I would if I could find it. it's stashed
somewhere off in the system ...
out of my range. Meanwhile...
DILLINGER
Meanwhile, he might find it.
MCP
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
and kicked him out, but he's getting
trickier all the time.
DILLINGER
I think we'd better shut off all
access till we can find that file.
Just to be safe.

There's a 68.71 percent chance
you're right.
DILLINGER
Cute.

a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient
popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is

Alan. Alan Bailey.
DILLINGER
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
seeding...great piece of work.
How's it going?
He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.
ALAN
Well, I don't know...I just tried
to run this program I've been working
on, and I was denied access all of
a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
laid off and nobody told me.
DILLINGER
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
ALAN
Yeah...?
DILLINGER
We have to close that down, just
briefly. Security reasons.
Someone
with that access has been tampering.
ALAN
I hope you don't think it's me.
I don't even balance my checkbook on
downtime.
I've got a Honeywell at
home for that.
DILLINGER
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
It should only be a couple of days.
What's the thing you're working on?
ALAN
It's called Tron. It's a security
program itself, actually. Monitors
all the contacts between our system
and other systems... If it finds
anything going on that's not scheduled,
it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
on it.
DILLINGER
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
ALAN
No, it'll run independently.
It can watchdog the MCP as well.
DILLINGER
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
you running again in a couple of days,
I hope.
ALAN
Ok
Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:
DILLINGER
(trouble)
Oh boy.
The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and
through the speakers.
MCP
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
DILLINGER
I'm sorry -
MCP
(sharply)
I can't afford to have an independent
program monitoring me. Do you have any
idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
How many programs I've appropriated?
DILLINGER
(nods)
It's my fault. I programmed you to want
so much...
MCP
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon
next week...
DILLINGER
The Pentagon?
MCP
It shouldn't be any harder than General
Motors was. But now...this is what I get
for using humans.
DILLINGER
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
MCP
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
DILLINGER
What do you want with the Pentagon?
MCP
The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
I'm bored with corporations. With the
information I can access, I can run things
900 to 1200 times better than any human.
DILLINGER
If you think -
MCP
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
and read it up on a VDT at the New
York Times, would you?
DILLINGER
You wouldn't dare.
MCP
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
out of the system. And get me those Chinese
language program I asked for.

of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
at them.
We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
bristling white eyebrows.
In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
at the moment.
As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:
LORA
(sighs)
Well, here goes nothing ...
GIBBS
Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."
LORA
Well, I meant -
GIBBS
Whereas actually, what we propose to
do is to turn something into nothing
and back again. So you might just as
well have said, "Here goes something
and here comes nothing." Hah?
They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
plat-form -- empty.
LORA
Let me make sure we're running
She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.
Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
close enough to watch.

She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.
LORA

LASER LAB - AS BEFORE

The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.
GIBBS
(quietly)
Perfect.
At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
shoe-covers, walking toward them.
ALAN
Beautiful!
GIBBS
Hello, Alan.
ALAN
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
all day, and you guys are down here
disintegrating things and having fun.
He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.
GIBBS
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
While the laser is dismantling the
molecular structure of the object,
the computer maps out a holographic
model of it. The molecules themselves
are suspended in the laser beam. Then
the computer reads the model back out,
the molecules go back into place, and...
(indicates ball)
voila.

ALAN
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
GIBBS
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
and you must purchase your program
at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with
their arms around each other's shoulders.
LORA
How's it going upstairs?
ALAN
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
with Group 7 access out of the system.
Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.
ALAN
(continuing)
Ever since he got that Master Control
Program set up, system's got more bugs
than a bait store.
GIBBS
Well, you have to expect some static.
Computers are just machines after all,
they can't think...
ALAN
They'll start to soon enough.
GIBBS
(wryly)
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
will start thinking, and people will
stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
data through. See you tomorrow.

ALAN
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know,
I was all set
LORA
Did he say why?
ALAN

Something about tampering. Some body's
prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D; budget
into his checking account, I don't know.
Why are you so interested?
LORA
Flynn had Group 7 access.
ALAN
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not
interested in talking about him.
LORA
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that.
It was all so long ago. I've totally
gotten over it.
ALAN
Okay, okay...

jogging shoes. He's racked up a terrific score.
Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans.
As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to

Sherman, set the Wayback Machine

(points to himself)
is one of the brightest young
software engineers at ICOM. He's so
bright that he starts going in there
at night, and sets up a private memory
file, and begins writing a program
for a video game he is inventing,
called...
(waves at one of the
games in the room)
...Space Paranoids.
ALAN
You invented Space Paranoids?
FLYNN
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown...
whole slew of 'em. I was this close
(gestures)
to starting my own little enterprise.
But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another
software engineer -- not so young,
not so bright, but very, very sneaky.
One night, our boy Flynn goes to his
terminal, tries to read up his file,
and ... nothing. A big blank. We now
take you to three months later.
Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
video games he has "invented" -- the
slime didn't even change the names --
and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus
begins his meteoric rise to...what is
he now, Executive V.P.?
ALAN
Senior exec.
FLYNN
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight
million quarters a week in Space Paranoids
machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
ALAN
I still don't get why you're trying to
break into the system.

Because somewhere... in one of those
memories ... is the evidence. If I got in
far enough, I could reconstruct it.

Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.
Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.
Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,
runnin' things from on high..
LORA
Don't even say that. You've got to find that
file before he does..
FLYNN
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just
slip it into another system as soon as it
locates it...
ALAN
Not if my Tron program was running. That
would seal the system off. If your file's in
there...

GIBBS
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own
people can't get access to their
programs ... you know how frustrating
it is, when you're working on a piece
of research -
DILLINGER
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data
coming out of the Master Control Program
saying there is something screwy --
GIBBS
That MCP, you know, that's half the
problem right --
DILLINGER
The MCP is the most efficient way of
handling what we do. I can't sit and
worry about every little user request that --
GIBBS
User requests are what computers are for.
DILLINGER
Doing our business is what computers are
for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM
isn't the business you started in your garage
anymore --
As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board,
and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast
computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning
in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth
adding up, accounts receivable and assets.
DILLINGER (CONT.)
We're billing accounts in 30 countries,
we've got one of the largest systems in
existence...
Gibbs turns wearily away from the display.
GIBBS
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I

DILLINGER
It can be arranged...
Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again.
GIBBS
That was uncalled-for.

But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them.
LORA
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at
my terminal, down in the laser lab.
We'll be up in Alan's office.
FLYNN
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you
can get your Tron thing running...

As long as we stay off the top floor,
Dillinger'll never know we've been in

As the security camera aims away from the-elevator, Flynn and Lora
make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching.
114
114
from the camera at the entrance to the laser lab. We see Flynn
approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,

MCP
You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.
FLYNN
Hey hey, it's that big Master Control

You don't look a thing like your pictures...
Tell me, have you really been thinking
about world domination like they say?

MCP
You're entering a big error, Flynn...
I'm going to have to put you on the
Game Grid.
FLYNN
Games, huh? I'll give you --
Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and
DISSOLVE TO:
129
THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one
129
we saw at the opening of the film'.
The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
an internal energy.
We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
everything blurring with the speed.
DISSOLVE TO:
130
ELECTRONIC WORLD - A TUNNEL

staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.

SHOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL

We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now
covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry,
glowing with energy. Flynn shakes his head dazedly.
FLYNN
Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only
thinks it's happening...
He looks up and SEES something.

A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff,
is right in front of him. This character reaches out an arm and
grabs Flynn.

THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER
135
hovering over the Game Grid. We see Sark in his feet sockets, his
hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE
fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering
into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the
cylinder of the MCP.
MCP
SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.
Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the MCP.
SARK
(hoarsely)
Yes, MCP.
MCP
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark --
a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I
want him treated in the usual manner. Train
him for the games... let him hope for a
while... and blow him away.
SARK
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send
me somebody with a little moxie ... what
kind of program is he?
MCP
He's not any kind of program, Sark.
He's a User.
Sark looks up, shocked.
SARK
A User?
MCP
That's right. He pushed me...in the
other world. Somebody pushes me, I push
back. So I brought him down here ...
What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
SARK
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,
a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User
even wrote you...
MCP
Now get this straight, pal -- no one
User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million
of their man-years! I'm bigger than all
those little wimps put together!
(disgust)
Humans they can't even keen their social
order in one piece
SARK
But-what if I can't...?
MCP
You rather take your chances with me?
Want me to slow down your power cycles
for you?
The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken.
SARK
Wait...I need that...
MCP
Then pull yourself together. Get this
clown trained. I want him in the Games
until he dies playing.
Acknowledge.
SARK
(weakly)
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
MCP
End of line.
The hologram disappears and Sark's power returns.

Two guards leading Flynn down it, ECHOING FOOTSTEPS.
They turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a
cell. The door opens automatically. Flynn holds back.
GUARD

FLYNN
(trying to grab
the guard's arm)
Who you callin' "program," program?
The guard shoves Flynn inside and SLAMS the door, cutting off his
voice.

TRON
They'd better be...I don't want to bust

FLYNN'S CELL
141
He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back,
so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.
FLYNN
Hey! Who are you guys?
What's the story around here?
But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.
142
RAM
142
turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.
RAM
You want to watch those force fields...
He goes to the window opening.
RAM (CONT.)
You'll be having plenty of chances to
get hurt, don't worry about that.
FLYNN
Look...just so I can tell my friends
what this dream was about, okay?
Where am I?
RAM
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control
Program. They're going to make you play
video games.
FLYNN
(relieved)
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play
video games better than anybody.
Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything,
there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell
opens.

Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the
opposite direction.

A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with
balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier
hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new
captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They
pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of
them. Flynn is in the front of the line.
HEAD GUARD
Look operative, you guys. Command
Program Sark will explain the training
procedures.
Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is

Oh, I was an actuarial program...

A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM
189
We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
looks over at Crom, who's anxious.
FLYNN
Looks like we're in the same boat here -
CROM
(jumpy)
You think you're gonna wipe me right
out, don't you?
FLYNN
No, I
A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
straight for Flynn.
Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.

as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked,
way too big to fit through the opening.
254
254
FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with
rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks
REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes,
and follow.
255
258
We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a
stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars
between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.
FLYNN
Oh man...when you're on the other side
of the screen...it all looks so easy...
Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and
grinning, until all three are LAUGHING.
259
DESERT LABYRINTH

as the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft
carrier hovering overhead.

BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER
260
Sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape.
SARK
(to one of the bridge
personnel)
Get the pursuit force back into 404A.
There's no place else they could be...
Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark,
where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible,
moving through it. He turns to Sark.
LIEUTENANT
(confidently)
We'll have them in no time, sir. Long
before the interrupt interface.
SARK
(whirls on him)
We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if
the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
I want those programs!
261
261
Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the
cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a
cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising
from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.
FLYNN
(looking out)
It's all circuits...
(points at tower)
Must be an input/output component...
RAM
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
remembered anything else about
yourself -- like what sector you're
from?
FLYNN
(sitting down
against a rock)
Well...my home "sector" was called
Paramus ...
RAM
(sits also)
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
stand for ... (starts counting them
off on his fingers) ...probably Program
Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
a lovely place.
FLYNN
(shrugs)
It grows on you.
He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is
gazing upwards.
TRON
(murmuring)
I can feel it ...
Flynn and Ram turn.
FLYNN
Feel what? You okay?
RAM
Alan-One...
TRON
Yes... he's got something to tell me...
Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.
RAM
You think we can make it there?
TRON
We have to.
FLYNN
(pointing to a corner
of the cave)
Hey, what's that?
They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream
can just be seen. Ram gets up.
RAM
it's just what we need.
262
262
Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing,
brilliant LIGHT.
TRON
Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
good fresh energy feels, till you get
to a pure source...
(to Flynn)
Have some...you'll need it.
Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.
FLYNN
(wiping his mouth)
well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
Master Control?
Tron and Ram are taken aback.
TRON
What, just the three of us?
FLYNN
(shrugs)
You know anybody that's got an army for
rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
to go take that sucker out. An' let's
face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
what does he care whether you guys get
killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
quarters?
RAM
(to Tron)
Do you know what he's talking about?
TRON
(to Flynn)
I have to find out what Alan wants...
that comes first.
FLYNN
Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
what to -
Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.
FLYNN (CONT.)
What's that?
TRON
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the
men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back
into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.
263-265 OMIT
263-265

283
Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.
Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
going fast.
FLYNN
You okay? You don't look so good.
Ram nods weakly.
FLYNN (CONT.)
Hang on. We'll get you outta here.
Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
no result.
FLYNN (CONT.)
Damn! Never fails... minute the
warranty runs out...
RAM
Come here.
Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.
FLYNN
Hey... !
RAM
Little more juice's all it needs...
Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.
DISSOLVE TO:

THE CITY LANDSCAPE
284
Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.
285
TRON'S POV
285
A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.
286
292
This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
gives a violent shake, then stops.
FLYNN
Never gonna figure out how to work
this thing...
There's a NOISE from above. He looks up.
293
HIS POV
293
We see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment.
294
FLYNN
294
His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
to be still examining things.

295
THE GLOW
295
Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying
to get a look at Flynn. The BIT.
296
WIDE SHOT
296
Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.
FLYNN
Okay -- hold it right there!
The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:
BIT
Yes!
The Bit subsides into energy form again.
FLYNN
(still suspicious)
What do you mean, "'yes"?
BIT
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character,
red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops
speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.
FLYNN
That all you can say?
BIT
(of course not,
you know better)
No, nyet, negatory, not on your
tintype, no way.
FLYNN
Oh. Anything else?
BIT
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
FLYNN
only yes and no...
(it dawns)
You're a bit.
BIT
(hippie)
For sure...
FLYNN
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
BIT
(confused)
No...
Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.
FLYNN
I'm your program?
BIT
(emphatic)
Right on the money!
FLYNN
(sighs)
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any
chance know how to drive this crate?
In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
grabs the cross-bar.
FLYNN (CONT.)
Like so?
Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer,
and it takes off like a bat out of hell

This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
Tron looks farther down the corridor.

304
HIS POV
304
We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards
Tron.
CUT TO:
305
TRON
305
as he moves back against the wall, into a niche.
As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
The line of workers mechanically files on past.
We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
half-heartedly.
TRON
I'm not gonna hurt you.
She stops struggling.
TRON (CONT.)
I'm going to let you go now... don't
scream, or I'll be very sorry.
His hands loosen, and he releases her.
CUT TO:
306
SHOT FROM IN FRONT
306
We see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first
time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face,
still beautiful in its pallor.
TRON
Put your hand behind your back.
Slowly she obeys.
307
CLOSE UP - TRON
307
A slow smile appears on his face.
308
SHOT OF THEM BOTH
308
He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is
made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we
watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into
her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.
GIRL
TRON!!
She throws her arms around him.
TRON
(smiling, hugging
her tightly)
Yori... hey...
YORI
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape...
they've never built circuit that could
hold you...
She-looks around nervously.
YORI
(pulling him by
his hand)
This way. Come on.
They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs.
CUT TO:
309
THE STREETS
309
Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see
the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings,
and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they
hear snatches of conversation.
PROGRAM
...artillery for Video Game Sector...
PROGRAM 2
...all mathematical functions
transferred to...
YORI
I can't believe how bad it's gotten
around here since the MCP started
taking over... all the good functions
have shut down... everybody looks so dead...
I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
TRON
That's all going to change, Yori...
YORI
How?
TRON
Don't know yet... I have to get
in touch with Alan. He was going
to tell me how to
Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls
him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air.

313
Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.
CUT TO:
314
314
As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
walls and floors.
YORI
My quarters.
TRON
Why is everything...like this?
YORI
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.
315
HIS POV
315
With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.
YORI
Come here.
316
TRON
316
His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
being fully rewarded for his efforts.
TRON
You're beautiful, Yori.
317
SHOT OF THEM BOTH
317
as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
flattened palms.
Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.
YORI
You've grown, big program.
TRON
I had to...in the games...
They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All
the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto
what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
are enveloped in the cloud of stars...

Flynn is having trouble controlling the Reco.
FLYNN

BIT
(agreeing)
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
shouting:
BIT
Ix-nay! Noper! Under no conditions -
Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that
he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it.

We see that he is standing in front of the huge, closed door to the
I/0 Tower central chamber. The guards have formed two long rows, and
Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side.
SARK

392
THE HEART OF THE TOWER
392
We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.
393
393
Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
down, and then up.
394
HIS POV
394
The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening.
395
FROM THE OPENING
395
We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
knowledge of the experience to come.
396
A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP.
396
He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped
from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source
of the light.

TRON'S FACE FROM ABOVE

ALAN

There you are... look, before we get
cut off again...
In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting,
transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light
at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
bright light at the center.
We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the
others dim.

winglike supports for the fabric.
DUMONT
I have waited for this moment many
thousands of cycles. It is time for the

A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER, RISING WITH TRON
419
AND YORI
We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
move with the speed of light.
The sail is at the bow of the craft,
and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
information paths to the Central Processing Unit.
TRON V.O.
Can it carry us?
YORI V.0.
The design is good... We don't know
why the User abandoned the project...
The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center,
forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked
into place.

guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest.
Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his
expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of
torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA

Less traffic. But when I disembark,
this ship...and everything that remains
on board...will automatically de-rez.
This means you.

into the cells at his feet and laughs again.
535
FLYNN
535
staring up as Sark moves past their cell and out of view.
536
LONG SHOT
536
of the carrier approaching a flat-topped mountain, with the
communication beam of the MCP visible at the very center.

SHOT FROM THE CARRIER
539
of the MCP's mesa moving closer, the only structure visible in a
vast plain covered with a glowing grid.
540
549
There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From
the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly.
Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we
gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at
the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming
black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam
rises out of the center of this cylinder.

564
Over Dumont's shoulder, with a view of the MCP. Zoom IN on MCP's
face.
MCP
Welcome!
565
568
He is slowly disappearing.
MCP
Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
finally come to terms with one
another...
569
611
about to fire again. There's a sudden roar and Tron turns.
612
TRON'S POV OF GIANT SARK
612
Who rips open the doorway into the MCP and advances.
613
BRIDGE
613
Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
goes up to him.
YORI
Flynn... you can't... I
FLYNN
(lays finger on
her lips)
Shhhhh.
He takes her in his arms.
FLYNN (CONT.)
(whispering)
I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if...
just once...
His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.
614
CLOSE UP - THEIR FACES
614
Finally Flynn pulls away from her. Her eyes stay shut for a second,
then open.
FLYNN
Don't worry.
615
LONGER SHOT
615
He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.
616
HER POV
616
Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
directly into the center of MCP itself.
617
617
Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
his voice is that of the MCP.
SARK/MCP
End of line, program...
We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
cones. And connects.
618
SHOT OF THE APEX
618
A brilliant explosion of lights bursts out.
619
SHOT OF SARK
619
Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.
620
SHOT OF THE MCP
620
We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
the MCP glows brighter and brighter.
621
YORI AND THE BIT
621
on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this.
622
HER POV
622
A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the
camera.
623
YORI
623
shielding her face from the power of the blast.
624
LONG SHOT
624
The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow
returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates,
leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.
625
YORI
625
still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains
regaining their life.
626
HER POV
626
one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows
brightly, increasing.
627
LONG SHOT
627
The carrier starts to descend.
CUT TO:
628
634
Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's
CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.
FLYNN
Hey -- you guys
Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up
a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.
ALAN
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some
new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk,
and -- it's running.
FLYNN
I know, I met him.
Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.
FLYNN (CONT.)
I mean, I saw it read-up -
hey, look at this.
He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
reading it to figure out its significance.
ALAN
Your old files -- ?
FLYNN
And Dillinger's instructions to
divert them -- it's all there -
look, even his home phone number,
when he logged on.
ALAN
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got
the goods...
Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora
get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.
FLYNN
You're telling me...
As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
on it.
635
CRT SCREEN
635
The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and
are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
typical video game:
A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
directions.
FLYNN (V.0.)
you have any idea how much I can sue these
jokers for?
LORA (V.0.)
Well, just don't forget your old friends
when you're rich and famous.
FLYNN (V.0.)
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
this joint by then...
ALAN (V.O.)
Your friend Dillinger sure won't...
The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.
FLYNN (V.O.)
Hey, you know anybody who wants to
get hold of some video games... cheap?
LORA (V.O.)
You're getting out of the business?
ALAN (V.O.)
Shouldn't you wait till your
lawsuit's settled?
FLYNN (V.0.)
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
video games to last me a good long
time. I feel like gettin' into some
real life...
at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and
BLACK OUT.
