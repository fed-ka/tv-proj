    The sand is crowded with TOURISTS and SUN WORSHIPPERS who 
      didn t get the memo on skin cancer.  The ocean is inviting, 
    the surf speckled with KIDS on boogie boards.

      GLORIA, 20, crosses on the cement bike path/boardwalk.  She s 
    in a bikini and flip-flops, with a beach bag over her 
      shoulder.  Beautiful.  We follow her.  She heads up an 
      approach path to a big hotel.


      Raylan is leading DALE, 20, a rangy kid.  Two OCALA POLICE 
      OFFICERS watch.

                                  OCALA POLICE OFFICER #1
                    Just you escorting him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Strike team s shorthanded at the 
                    moment.  I believe I ll manage.

      Raylan walks off with Dale.  The officers watch him go.

                                  OCALA POLICE OFFICER #1
                    He believes he ll manage...

                                  OCALA POLICE OFFICER #2
                    Don t you know who that is?  He s 
                    the one the Mafia guy drew on last 
                    week in Miami Beach, the two of 
                    them sitting at the same table.  
                    That marshal shot him dead.  Raylan 
                    Givens.  It was on the news.

                                  OCALA POLICE OFFICER #1
                    I don t care who he is.  How do you 
                    transport a prisoner by yourself?

      I/E. RAYLAN S CAR/STREETS OF OCALA - NIGHT

      Dale drives.  Raylan sits in the passenger seat.

                                  DALE
                    I know who you are.  Saw it on the 
                    news.  Just like the Old West, huh?  
                    A real shoot-out.
                          (noanswer)
                    So.  Marshals drive Caddies now?  
                    Or was this confiscated?
                          (noanswer)
                    I had a Caddy myself one time, till 
                    I sold it for parts and went to 
                    work at Disney s. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    7.

                                  DALE (CONT'D)
                    You know what I tried out for?  
                    Goofy.  Mickey Mouse s friend?  
                    Only you had to water-ski and I 
                    couldn t get the hang of it--

                                  RAYLAN
                    If you re gonnatalk, I ll put you 
                    in the trunk and drive myself.

      Dale nods.  They drive in silence for a bit. 

                                  DALE
                    I don t see why we can t talk some.  
                    Pass the time.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t care to hear any sad 
                    stories, all the bad luck and bum 
                    deals life s handed you.

      Another bit of silence.  Dale can t help himself.

                                  DALE
                    My dad s never been to Palm Beach 
                    or seen the ocean.  Never got 
                      closer nTwenty Mile Bend.  You 
                    believe it?  Spent his whole life 
                    over there around Belle Glade, 
                    Canal Point, Pahokee.
                          (beat)
                    I only mention it,  cause if we was 
                    to get off the turnpike near Stuart 
                    we could take Seventy-six over to 
                    the lake, run on down to Belle 
                    Glade.  Wouldn t be more than a few 
                    miles out of the way and I d get to 
                    see my folks.  What would you say 
                    to that?
                          (waits, gets nothing)
                    Not much, huh?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Your old dad s never been to Palm 
                    Beach or seen the ocean, but he s 
                    been up to Starke, hasn t he?  Seen 
                    the inside of the Florida state 
                    prison.  You have an uncle who came 
                    out of there and another did his time 
                    at Lake Butler.  I think we ll skip 
                    visiting any of your kin this trip.

                                  DALE
                    My uncles reboth dead.                                                                                    8.



                                  RAYLAN
                    By gunshot, huh?  You understand 
                    how I see your people?

      Dale nods.  Then very suddenly he tries to club Raylan in the 
      throat with his fist.  Raylan deflects the blow and kicks 
      Dale in the face with the heel of his cowboy boot.  Dale 
      swerves off the road.  A second later, Raylan has his Beretta
    to Dale s face.  

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Stop the car.

      Dale stops the car.  Raylan hands Dale handcuffs.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Put one on your left wrist and snap 
                    the other one to the wheel.

      Dale does as he s told, blood dripping from his nose.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Now drive.

                                  DALE
                    I can t drive handcuffed to the 
                    steering wheel!

                                  RAYLAN
                    You ll get the hang of it.

      Dale exhales, gets back onto the road.

                                  DALE
                    You gonnareport what I did, get me 
                    another couple years?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m not your problem.

      Dale slows for a light, stops.

                                  DALE
                    I just wanna know if--

      WHAM!They are rear-ended.

                                  DALE (CONT D)
                    God damn!

      Raylan looks back to see a pickup easing back, making sure 
    the bumpers aren t locked.                                                                                      9.



      Raylan gets out of the Caddy to see two young black men get 
    out of the pickup, one wearing a CROCHETED SKULLCAP and the 
      other with his hair in CORNROWS.  Raylan sees Cornrows 
      holding something against his leg -- a pistol.  Raylan 
      pretends not to see it, goes to look at the damage.  

                                  CORNROWS
                    You see what I got here?

    He shows the gun to Raylan.  Raylan nods.  Skullcap heads for 
    the driver s window.

                                  CORNROWS (CONT D)
                    We gonnatrade, let you have a 
                    pickup for this here.  You see a 
                    problem with that?

      Raylan shakes his head.  Skullcap looks in the car.

                                  SKULLCAP
                    What the fuck?
                          (to Cornrows)
                    Come here look at this.

    The moment Cornrows turns his head, Raylan opens the trunk 
    and pulls out a Remington12-gauge.He points the gun at the 
    two carjackers, racks a load.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Let go of the pistol.

      Cornrows debates what to do.

                                  DALE
                    Do what he says.  He s the marshal 
                    outdrew that Mob guy in Miami.

                                  RAYLAN
                    And now I ve got a shotgun with a 
                    shell in the chamber.  Not much 
                    drawing involved.

      Cornrows drops the pistol.

      I/E. RAYLAN S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

    PAN ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT.  Dale is still driving, handcuffed 
    to the wheel.  Cornrows and Skullcap are next to him, 
      handcuffed together in a criss-crossfashion.  Raylan sits in 
      back, shotgun visible.  After some silence...                                                                                    10.



                                  CORNROWS
                    Saw that on the news.  You and that 
                    greaser in Miami.  Folks talking 
                    about it, saying if it was them, 
                    they couldabeat you.
                          (beat)
                      Whaddyathink?  If you just had 
                    your handgun, you think you coulda
                    beat me?

      Raylan says nothing.  After a beat...

                                  DALE
                    He s not much of a talker.

    On they go.


    The Blazer is stopped on a bridge.  Boyd tosses the grenade 
      launcher off the bridge into a deep dark stream.  He walks to 
    the Blazer, gets in the back seat.  The Blazer drives off.                                                                                    15.




    The Blazer heads into Long Term parking, goes down a row.

      I/E. BLAZER/AIRPORT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Jared drives, Boyd is still in the back seat.  

                                  BOYD
                    Don t worry about getting a close-
                    in spot.  Just go down to the end.  
                    Walk won t hurt us.

      Jared nods, keeps driving.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    How come you didn t want to blow up 
                    that church?  

                                  JARED
                    I told you -- I didn t want them to 
                    ID my car.

                                  BOYD
                    So you said.
                          (beat)
                    But I have to note, the target you 
                    selected was unoccupied.  

                                  JARED
                    So?

                                  BOYD
                    I was thinking maybe you had an 
                    aversion to hurting people.

                                  JARED
                    Hell, no.

                                  BOYD
                    Ah, well, see, I was alsothinking 
                    a building under construction is 
                    the kind of target the Federal 
                    Bureau of Imperialism would offer 
                    up as sacrifice in order to get 
                    someone deep in the movement.

                                  JARED
                    You think I m a snitch?                                                                                    16.



                                  BOYD
                    All I know is, you don t have any 
                    tattoos and you keep rubbing your 
                    head like you re not sure if your 
                    hair s gonnagrow back.

                                  JARED
                    You think I m a snitch because I 
                    rub my head?

                                  BOYD
                    Calm down.  Just pull in behind 
                    that Tahoe.

      Jared pulls into a spot, turns off the car.

                                  BOYD (CONT'D)
                    You understand my concerns, right?  
                    You show up from Oklahoma full of 
                    pissand vinegar, saying you re 
                    tired of spray-painting synagogues, 
                    you want to blow shit up--  

                                  JARED
                    You don t believe me, check me out!  
                    Call Oklahoma!

                                  BOYD
                    Don t worry, we are.  Devil s doing 
                    it right now.

                                  JARED
                    You ll see, Boyd.  I ain t no snitch.

                                  BOYD
                    Well, like you said, we ll see.

    And with that, Boyd puts the tip of the AK barrel up against 
    the back of Jared s headrest and pulls the trigger.  The 
      bullet goes through Jared s head and through the windshield.


      Boyd gets out of the Blazer.  He pulls out his cell and dials 
    as he checks out the damage.  The bullet went clear through 
    the backglassand windshield of the Tahoe in front of them.

                                  BOYD
                          (into cell)
                    It s me.                                                                                    17.




      Boyd walks toward the airport, traffic light on the roads.

                                                                  TIME LAPSE TO:


      Morning now, traffic heavy. 


      A crime scene has been set up around Jared s Chevy Blazer.  
      Jared s body is still behind the wheel.  CSIare doing their 
      work.  Raylan and Art are walking around the Blazer.

                                  ART
                    Airport Police found him just after 
                    dawn.  Name s Jared Hale, on file 
                    with the Bureau as some kind of 
                    Aryan knight.  Oklahoma driver s

                    Jared s sister in Tulsa says he 
                    came to Kentucky to hook up with 
                    some commandos.

      Raylan nods.  Art points at an AK on an evidence table.

                    Could be the murder weapon.  
                    Recently fired.  No prints so far.  
                    The whole vehicle s clean.  Except 
                    for this.

                    You know what that is?  I didn t.  
                    Apparently it hooks onto the back 
                    of a grenade launcher.  Holds the 
                      propellant, the juice.

                    Yup.And last night, a few minutes 
                    past nine, in a black neighborhood 
                    just outside of downtown, somebody 
                    used a grenade launcher to blow up 
                    a church.  


      CLOSE ON the church s sign, on the pavement, charred and 
      splintered.  REVEAL the crime scene -- the burned-out remains 
    of the church.  Cop cars.  Police tape.  CSIs.

      Raylan is walking with Art and two other members of Art s 
      Special Operations Group -- TIM GUTTERSON, 29, and FRANK 
      GARCIA, 35.  Tim is clean-cut and buttoned-down.  Frank has 
      been doing this too long to take any of it too seriously.  
    Tim is going over notes for Raylan.

                    All the wits say the same:  Two 
                    white males drove up in a dark SUV, 
                    parked at that corner by the cone.

                    One male got out with something on 
                    his shoulder -- several of them 
                    said it looked like a bazooka.  He 
                    said a few words, then something 
                    shot out of the bazooka, hit the 
                    church and detonated.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What did he say?  The fellawho got 
                    out of the SUV.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Then he should be easy to find.

      Forty yards away, RACHEL DUPREE, 35, African American, is 
      talking to the tall black man in a dashiki we saw outside the 
      church when Boyd blew it to shit.  He is ISRAEL FANDI, 40s. 
      Their conversation is animated, their voices loud.

                    Ethiopian by way of Jamaica.  
                    Believes marijuana is a sacramental 
                    herb.  See, The Temple of the Cool 
                    and Beautiful JC didn t have any 
                    actual services per se.  People 
                    just came here to get their 
                    supplies of sacramental herb.

                                  RAYLAN
                    So, basically it was a dope store.                                                                                    23.

                    Local law enforcement was okay with

                    take it to the Supreme Court on 
                    freedom of religion grounds.  That 
                    type of craptakes a lot of time 
                    and money to defend and the 
                    neighbors weren t complaining and 
                    it was just a little reefer, so...

      I/E. CAR/LEXINGTON RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

      Raylan is driving a rental car.  He pulls up to a red light, 
      stops.  He looks over, sees something.

    HIS POV:  A bus bench with an ad.  There s a photo of a 
      smiling couple and the slogan: Gary and Winona Klass.Want 
    to make Lexington realty a reality for you?  Go First Klass!


      A three-bedroom home in a tidy suburban neighborhood, a For 
      Sale sign out front.  Raylan s car pulls up, stops.


    The Pork Brothers are chopping wood.  Being the Pork 
      Brothers, they have made a stupid and dangerous game out of 
    it -- Pork Brother #1 holds a piece of wood on the chopping 
      block, only removing his hand at the last possible second as 
      Pork Brother #2 brings down the axe.  Pork Brother #2 almost 
      cuts his brother s hand off.  They laugh.

                                  PORK BROTHER #2
                    That was a close one!

                                  PORK BROTHER #1
                    I felt the air move!

      They turn as Dewey tears into the clearing, stomps on the 
      brakes, throwing up a shower of dirt.  Dewey jumps out.

                                  DEWEY
                    BOYD!

    The Caddy rolls forward at idle speed.  Dewey curses, gets 
      back in, shuts it down, jumps back out again.

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)

                                  DEWEY
                    I asked for Boyd, not you!  BOYD!

      Boyd and Devil come out of the church.

                                  DEWEY
                    At his house.

                    No, you moron, where on his body?

                                  DEWEY
                    I don t know.                                                                                    28.

                    Oh, yeah.  He s dead.

      That stops Boyd.

        19-year-oldRaylan is in the stands with 19-year-oldBoyd, 
      watching the high school game.  At least Boyd is watching the 
      game.  Raylan can t take his eyes off...

    THE CHEERLEADERS.  One in particular.  A strikingly pretty 16-
      year-oldblonde -- YOUNG AVA.  She can feel his eyes.  She 
      looks up at him.  Smiles.                                                                                    30.



      Young Raylan, caught, manages a smile in return, then steers 
    his vision back to the game.

      I/E. CAR/NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      Raylan snaps out of his reverie as he comes around a bend in 
    the narrow road and sees a red Dodge pickup parked in front 
    of a one-story with aluminum awnings set among the pines.


      Dewey shuts the Caddy trunk lid, revealing a pump shotgun in 
    his hand.  He heads for the house, slowing when he sees 
      Raylan coming out.  He points the shotgun at Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Mr. Crowe?  You better hold on 
                    there while I tell you something.

      Dewey stops.                                                                                    35.

                    I use it.  I want you to think 
                    about what I m saying before you

                    Jesus Christ, I got a scattergun
                    pointed right at you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    But can you rack in a load before I 
                    put a hole through you?

    And Dewey does think about that.  Raylan walks up to Dewey, 
      pushes the barrel of the shotgun aside and takes Dewey by the 
    arm to the Cadillac.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Where dyou want to take Ava?

                    Man, I don t understand you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Boyd want to see her?

                                  DEWEY
                    It s none of your business.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You know Boyd and I were buddies?  
                    We dug coal and drank beer 
                    together.  You see him, tell him 
                    I m in Harlan.

      Dewey gets into the car, starts the engine.  Raylan reaches 
      through the open window, puts his hand on Dewey s shoulder.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I was you, son, I d drop this Nazi 
                      bullshitand go back to poaching 
                    gators, it s safer.

      Dewey turns and looks up at Raylan.

                                  DEWEY
                    The next time I see you--                                                                                    36.



      Raylan grabs a handful of Dewey s spiked hair and slams his 
      head down hard on the windowsill.  Raylan hunches over to 
      look at Dewey s face, tightened with pain.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Tell Boyd his old buddy wants to 
                    see him.  Raylan Givens.

                                  ACT THREE


      Raylan steers his Town Car into the clearing.


    As Raylan approaches, Boyd and Devil come out.  Boyd opens 
    his arms, beaming.

                                  BOYD
                    God damn, look at you, a suit and 
                    necktie, all dressed up to look 
                    like a lawman.

      Boyd hugs Raylan, pats him on the back.  Then he looks at 
      Devil and points at Raylan s hat.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Here s how you wear a hat, casual, 
                    not down on your goddamnears.
                          (toRaylan)
                    I hear you called on Ava.  My boy 
                    Dewey said he ran you off.                                                                                    39.



                                  RAYLAN
                    You believe that?

                                  BOYD
                    Not if you say it ain t so.  Ava s 
                    the one told you I was here?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I talked her into it.  Told her I 
                    wouldn t tell anybody.

                                  BOYD
                    How do you know she didn t send you 
                    to me?  So I could decide what to 
                    do with you.

                                  DEVIL
                    I ll take care of him.

                                  BOYD
                    Go get a jar.  And some glasses.  
                    Clean ones.  And just two.  This is 
                    me and Raylan s party.

      Devil waits a second then heads inside.  

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    He just got his release, so he s 
                    looking for action.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I can tell.


      Boyd pours a few inches of corn liquor into each glass.

                                  BOYD
                          (raises his glass)
                    To the old days.

      Raylan nods, picks up a glass.  They clink and drink.  
      Moonshine.  Dear Lord.  Raylan lets his eyes clear.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    I hear your father s not well.

      Raylan gives a small nod.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    He sure was a wild man in his day, 
                    wasn t he?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    What was that scam he had, back in 
                    the  80s, during the coal boom?  He 
                    was stealing mining machinery -- the 
                    expensive stuff, the continuous 
                    miners -- and shipping it to Columbia 
                    where they still had ten-foot seams 
                    of coal, and they were paying him in 
                    cocaine.  Wasn t that it?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Something like that.

                                  BOYD
                    Then his drug mule was parachuting in 
                    with a hundred pounds of cocaine on 
                    his back and it overloaded the chute 
                    or what have you, and he streamered
                    and punched a hole in a driveway 
                    outside of Corbin.  Old geezer comes 
                    out to get his morning paper and 
                    there s a man with a parachute waist-
                    deep in his asphalt.
                          (beat)
                    They never tied your old man to 
                    that, did they? 

      Raylan shakes his head.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    You missed the next boom.  No more 
                    following a seam underground.  
                    Cheaper just to cut the tops off 
                    mountains, let the slag run down 
                    and ruin the creeks.
                            (shakeshead, smiles)
                    Remember when we was robbing mines?  
                    Chopping into those pillars, runnin 
                    like hell when she began to cave.
                          (darkens)
                    Then there were the picket lines.  
                    Courts backing the company scabs 
                    and gun thugs.  Whose side the 
                    govermintalways been on, Raylan, 
                    us or the people with money?  
                          (beat)
                    And who controls the money and 
                    wants to mongrelize the world?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Who?

                                  BOYD
                    The Jews.                                                                                    41.



                                  RAYLAN
                    Boyd, you know any Jews?

                                  BOYD
                    A few.  I know they run the economy, 
                    control the Federal Reserve and the 
                    IRS.  It s become the Jew-nited
                    States of America now, my friend.  I 
                    recruit skins, don t know more n
                    you, have to show  em why we have a 
                    moral obligation to get rid of the 
                    Jews.  It s in the Bible.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Where?

                                  BOYD
                    Part of Creation.  Back at the 
                    beginning of time you have your mud 
                    people, referred to as beasts 
                    because they have no souls.  And 
                    Cain -- you know Cain, don t you? -- 
                    well, he started screwing the mud 
                    people, and out of these 
                    fornications came the Edomites, and 
                    you know who the Edomitesare?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Tell me.

                                  BOYD
                    The Jews.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You re serious.

                                  BOYD
                    Read your Bible as interpreted by 
                    experts.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You know, Boyd, I think you just 
                    use the Bible to do whatever the 
                    hell you like.  

                                  BOYD
                    And what do I like?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You like to get money and blow stuff up.

      Raylan has struck a chord in Boyd, not that Boyd would admit it.                                                                                    42.



                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I know about your friend Devil and 
                    his history selling dope.  I m 
                    willing to bet you blew up that 
                    church in Cincinnati, not because 
                    it was black, but because it was a 
                    dope store.  Ten-to-one you got 
                    paid to do it by some of the other 
                    dope dealers around who didn t like 
                    the idea of that pastor getting a 
                    pass from the police.  It was win-
                    win for you, wasn t it, Boyd?  Not 
                    only did you get to blow something 
                    to smithereens, you got money.
                          (beat)
                    See, I m giving you the benefit you 
                    aren t mental.  I know you aren t 
                    stupid enough to believe that mud 
                    people story.

      Raylan and Boyd lock eyes for a moment.  

                                  BOYD
                    So, you think you know me, huh?  
                    Well, I know you, Deputy Marshall 
                    Raylan Givens.  I know you like to 
                    shoot bad guys.  I heard how you 
                    shot a wopgun thug in that hotel 
                    in Miami.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You heard about that.

                                  BOYD
                    We have television in these parts 
                    now, Raylan.
                          (beat)
                    What I wonder is, at any time while 
                    you were getting ready to shoot 
                    that Eye-talianfella, did his face 
                    change at all?  
                            (offRaylan s look)
                    Did he -- even for a split-second -- 
                    did he take on the appearance of 
                    your poppa?

    And now Boyd has nailed Raylan, not that Raylan would admit 
    it, least of all not to Boyd.  And so Raylan smiles.

                                  RAYLAN
                    The reason I m here, we re having a 
                    little line-up tomorrow morning--                                                                                    43.



                                  BOYD
                    Tomorrow s Sunday.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Justice never sleeps.  We ve got a 
                    witness who saw the man who fired 
                    the bazooka into the church.  I 
                    sure would appreciate it if you d 
                    be in that line-up.

                                  BOYD
                    I bet you would.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You either show up or we ll come 
                    get you.

                                  BOYD
                          (beat)
                    You shoot me, you get the chance?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You make me pull, I ll put you down.

      Boyd nods.


      Raylan s Town Car heads off.  Boyd watches him go.  Devil 
      comes out.

                                  DEVIL
                    You kiss him goodbye?

                                  BOYD
                    You want your jaw broke?

                                  DEVIL
                    Why dyou let him go?  I couldaput 
                    him away, easy.

                                  BOYD
                    What I do with Raylan s my 
                    business.

      I/E. CAR/HARLAN RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

      Raylan slows, stops, in front of a long driveway at the end 
    of a leafy street.  He picks up a stack of letters, bound 
      with rubber bands.

      ECURETURN ADDRESS ON THE LETTERS: 323 MountainviewDrive.                                                                                    44.



      Raylan looks at the driveway.  A sign reads: 323 Mountainview
      Drive.  Raylan just looks at the address for a moment longer, 
      then puts his car in gear and drives off.


      A pretty white clapboard church on a beautiful day.  The 
      PARISHIONERS are filing out after the Sunday service.

    An ELDERLY MAN, 70s, comes out, slows when he sees someone.

                                  ELDERLY MAN
                    I heard you were in Harlan.

      Raylan s standing by his Town Car.  This elderly man is 
      RAYLAN S FATHER.

                                  RAYLAN S FATHER
                    How dyou know I was here?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I followed you.

                                  RAYLAN S FATHER
                    From the house?
                          (Raylan nods)
                    Why didn t you just come in?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Didn t know what I d find.  I m an 
                    officer of the law now.  There s 
                    drugs in your house, I can t just 
                    look the other way.

      Raylan s father laughs, shakes his head.

                                  RAYLAN S FATHER
                    Well, there are drugs there, all 
                    right.  Paclitaxol. Carboplatin. 
                    Which sounds like something you do 
                    to your car.
                            (explaining)
                    I got a cancer, Raylan.  
                          (beat)
                    I m headed on outtahere.

      Raylan doesn t quite know what to say to that.

                                  RAYLAN S FATHER (CONT D)
                    Not what you were hoping for, huh?

                                  RAYLAN
                    What was I hoping for?                                                                                    45.



                                  RAYLAN S FATHER
                    Would only be a guess.

      Raylan looks at his father, his face impossible to read.


      Raylan comes out with Boyd.  Dewey and Devil are waiting by 
    the pickup truck.

                                  BOYD
                    Could be you ve got the wrong man.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Could also be he knows if he ID s 
                    you, your friends will kill him.

                                  BOYD
                    That man you shot in Florida.  Did 
                    I read that you gave him twenty-
                    four hours to get out of town or 
                    you d shoot him on sight? 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Was a gangster I saw shoot an 
                    unarmed man in a foreign land where 
                    I couldn t do anything about it.  I 
                    didn t feel he deserved any special 
                    favors.  I gave him the option to 
                    leave and he turned it down.

                                  BOYD
                    Well, all the trouble you re causing 
                    me I thought I d make you the same 
                    offer.  Get out of Harlan County by 
                    tomorrow noon or I ll come looking 
                    for you.  That sound fair?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Now you re talking.                                                                                    46.



      Boyd smiles, walks to his truck.  HOLD ON Raylan.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    47.



                                  ACT FOUR


      Raylan and Ava sit on the bench in front of the Coal Miners 
      Memorial.  Ava smokes.

                                  AVA
                    I plead to manslaughter and I won t 
                    have to go to prison.  Though if I 
                    have to, I have to.  It was worth it.
                          (beat)
                    Hey, why don t you come by for 
                    supper?  I ll fix you something 
                    nice.  Pick up a couple of fryers 
                    and fix you some hot biscuits and 
                    gravy.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    49.

                                  AVA (CONT'D)
                          (grins)
                    Look at you licking your lips.

                                  RAYLAN
                    All my life fried chicken s been my 
                    favorite.  But I got work to do here.  
                    Don t know when I ll be done.   

    Ava stubs out her cigarette.

                                  AVA
                    I m fixing it anyway.
                          (lookshim in the eye)
                    You re a big boy, Raylan.  You want 
                    to come, there s nothing on earth 
                    gonnastop you.


      Devil and Dewey are watching Raylan and Ava from the front 
      seat of Dewey s old Cadillac.

                                  DEVIL
                    Wasn t for Boyd I d have me some of Ava.

                                  DEWEY
                    Wasn t for Boyd me and you could 
                    have us the marshal.  Say we took 
                    him out, what would Boyd do, kick 
                    and scream?  He does that anyways.

                                  DEVIL
                    You got the nerve to shoot a marshal?

                                  DEWEY
                    I got the nerve and a reason to.

      They go silent for a moment.

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)
                    We get out on the highway, I reach in 
                    back for the twelve-gauge and blow 
                    him away.  What s wrong with that?

                                  DEVIL
                    There s nothing wrong with it.

      Dewey nods.                                                                                    50.



                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    Except for the squad of Fedsin front 
                    of and behind him watching you do it 
                    and shooting back until we re full of 
                    holes.  Other than that there s 
                    nothing wrong with it at all.

      Dewey frowns.  Devil allows himself a small grin.


    An SUV, Raylan s Town Car, and another SUVroll into the 
      parking lot of the Mount-Aire Motel on the highway.

    The battered Cadillacpulls off the highway and stops.

      I/E. CADILLAC/MOUNT-AIRE MOTEL - DUSK

      Dewey watches the motel with binoculars.  Devil gets on his 
      cell, dials.  Boyd picks up.

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                          (overcell)
                    Yup.

                                  DEVIL
                          (into cell)
                    He s at the motel with his friends.

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                    You see ourfriends?

                                  DEVIL
                          (looking)
                    I do.

    He sees a pickup parked on the other side of the highway.

                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    You sure they re up for this?  Feds
                    usually have a shitloadof 
                    firepower.

      I/E. BOYD S PICKUP/COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK - CROSSCUT

      Boyd is in his pick up, on his cell with Devil.

                                  BOYD
                    All s I need is for our fat friends 
                    to slow  em down.  Even a minute ll
                    be enough.                                                                                    51.



                                  DEVIL
                    They could get killed.

                                  BOYD
                    I hope not.  But if they do?  
                    They re not that hard to replace.  
                    You saw with Jared, there s lot of 
                    folks want to hitch their star to 
                    Crowder s Commandos.  You just do 
                    your part, they ll do theirs and 
                    I ll do mine.

      Boyd hangs up.  PULL BACK to reveal he s parked by the 
      shuttered fruit stand with the JESUS SAVES! billboard.He 
      starts up his pickup and drives off.


      Raylan gets in the Town Car; Art and the others in the SUVs. 
      They head out, Raylan in the lead.

      I/E. CAR/PICKUP/SUVS/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      Raylan turns onto the highway.  A second later... 

      A pickup lurches across the highway, gunfire spurting out of 
    the driver s side window and over the cab.

      Pork Brother #1 is driving, firing at the SUVs.                                                                                    54.



      Pork Brother #2 is in the truck bed, shooting over the roof.

      Both SUVsshudder to a halt as the occupants duck below the 
      dashboard, their windshields spiderwebbing.They all bail 
    out fast, taking cover behind their vehicles.

    ON THE HIGHWAY

      Raylan stomps on his brakes, starts to reverse.  His cell 
      rings.  He sees the caller ID -- it s Art.  Raylan answers.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (into cell)
                    Where do you want me?

    BY THE MOTEL

    Art is on his cell, hunkered down behind his SUVwith Tim.

                                  ART
                          (into cell)
                    Keep going.  Get Ava.  We got this.  

    ON THE HIGHWAY

      Raylan looks back at the stream of fire coming out of the 
      pickup and hitting the SUVs.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You got this?

                                  ART (V.O.)
                    We do.  Go.

    BY THE MOTEL

    Art shuts his cell, opens the back of the SUV, revealing an 
      arsenal of automatic weapons.  He and Tim each grab one.

                                  TIM
                    Do you want me to kill them?

                                  ART
                    Not yet.  

    He looks over at Frank and Rachel behind their SUV, arming 
      themselves.  He gestures to them.  They nod, start running 
      away from the firefight, keeping low, heading for the cover 
    of the other cars parked in front of the motel.

    ON THE HIGHWAY

      Raylan throws his car into drive and tears off.                                                                                    55.



    The Cadillacparked down the highway starts forward after 
      Raylan, lights dark.

    BY THE MOTEL

    Tim is down on the pavement with his rifle, aiming beneath 
    the SUV.He makes his shots coolly, with practiced aim, 
      taking out the tires of the pickup.  He gets back to his 
      knees, looks at Art.

                                  TIM
                    Kill  em or wing  em?

                                  ART
                    Start with winging.

    Tim nods, pops up, shoots twice -- through their SUV, out the 
      windshield. 

      Pork Brother #1 is hit in the arm drops down behind the dash 
    for cover.  His brother is hit in the shoulder flops down in 
    the bed of the truck.  

    Art and Tim go full auto and pump rounds into the windshield 
    of the Pork Brothers  pickup.

      WITH THE PORK BROTHERS

      Hunkered down, glass showering down on them.  And then the 
      fire from Art and Tim abruptly stops.  

                                  PORK BROTHER #1
                    You okay?!

                                  PORK BROTHER #2
                    I m hit!

                                  PORK BROTHER #1
                    Can you shoot?

                                  PORK BROTHER #2
                    I think so!

                                  PORK BROTHER #1
                    Then let s finish this.

      Pork Brother #1 starts to rise up, then stops when he feels a 
      pistol pressed to his temple.  The pistol is held by Frank.

                                  FRANK
                    Hey.                                                                                    56.



      Pork Brother #2 starts to rise up in the truck bed when he 
      hears a shotgun rack.  He glances up to see Rachel pointing a 
      shotgun at his head. 

                                  RACHEL
                    I ve been looking for any excuse to 
                    blow some asshole shead off, so 
                    please do something stupid.

    He lies back down, lets go of his AK.

      I/E. CAR/COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

      Raylan comes to the T-intersectionat the Jesus Saves 
      billboard, makes the turn.

    He checks his rearview, sees a car, lights out, make the turn 
    and follow.

      I/E. CAR/NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

      Raylan drives at a moderate speed down the narrow one-lane 
      dirt road winding through the forest.

    He checks his rearview -- the car is still following him, 
      lights still out, about fifty yards back.

      Raylan steps on the gas and shoots forward, now driving the 
      winding road at a wild speed.

      I/E. CADILLAC/NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

      Devil and Dewey see Raylan s car take off.  Raylan s soon two 
      bends ahead and out of sight.  Devil turns on the lights.

                                  DEWEY
                    He ll see us!

                                  DEVIL
                    He s already seen us, you moron.  
                    You want we should wrap ourselves 
                    around a tree?

                                  DEWEY
                    You re not gonnacatch him.

                                  DEVIL
                    Don t worry.  I ll get us to Ava s 
                    in plenty of time.  We ll back Boyd 
                    up when he makes his play.
                            (seessomething)
                    Christ Almighty...                                                                                    57.



      They ve come round a bend to find the Town Car stopped in the 
      middle of the narrow road.  Devil has to break hard to keep 
      from hitting it.

                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    The hell s he doing?

                                  DEWEY
                          (looking at Devil)
                    He must be sneaking up on the house.

                                  DEVIL
                          (looking past Dewey)
                    No, he ain t.

      Because there s Raylan standing at Dewey s side of the car, 
      hands resting on the sill next to Dewey.

                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    The hell are you doing?

                                  DEWEY
                    Why you blocking the damn road?

      Raylan doesn t say anything.  He opens the back door, gets 
      inside, picks up the shotgun and lays the barrel on the back 
    of the front seat, between Devil and Dewey.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Tell me what s going on.

      Silence.  Raylan racks the shotgun.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I didn t hear you.

                                  DEVIL
                    There ain t nothing going on.  We s 
                    out riding around.

      Raylan squeezes the trigger, putting a big hole in the 
      windshield.  Devil and Dewey clamp their hands over their 
      ears, shake their heads.  Raylan racks the pump again.

                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    Boyd wants to talk to you is all.

                                  RAYLAN
                    He told me he s gonna shoot me.                                                                                    58.



                                  DEWEY
                          (looks back)
                    Then what reyou asking us for, 
                    asshole?

      Raylan smacks the barrel across Dewey s face, hard, making 
    his nose run with blood.

                                  RAYLAN
                    An outlaw s life s hard, ain t it?

      Raylan puts cuffs on the end of the shotgun barrel, holds 
      them out to Devil.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Cuff your right hand, put the chain 
                    through the wheel and cuff gatorboy.

      Devil and Dewey do as their told.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Now your pistols and the keys.


      Raylan approaches the house, shotgun barrel down.  The door 
      opens and there s Ava.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Don t feel you have to say anything.

                                  AVA
                    I swear to God, Raylan, I didn t 
                    know he was coming.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I believe you.


      Establishing.


      Winona and Raylan are sitting out on deck chairs, Raylan 
      still working on his beer.

                                  WINONA
                    You almost gave him a heart attack.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Sorry about that.

                                  WINONA
                          (beat)
                    What reyou doing here, Raylan?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m going to be in Kentucky for a 
                    while, working for Art Mullen in 
                    the Eastern District.

                                  WINONA
                    Why reyou here?

      Raylan shrugs, thinks, sighs.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I saw my father.

                                  WINONA
                    I heard he s sick.

                                  RAYLAN
                    He s dying.
                          (beat)
                    He wasn t... what I expected.

                                  WINONA
                    The lion has lost his teeth, huh?  
                    Nothing left for you to fight.  

      Silence for a few moments.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I was in Italy a while back, 
                    looking for a bookie named Harry 
                    Arno.  He d slipped my custody and 
                    I wanted to bring him back.  The 
                    Mob was looking for Harry, too, and 
                    they sent out a gun thug named 
                    Tommy Bucks to kill him.  One day, 
                    Tommy Bucks  goons took me, took my 
                    guns, put me in a room with another 
                    man, fellow named Robert Gee.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    65.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    Good man.  Tommy Bucks comes in, 
                    asks me where Harry is and I tell 
                    him, no point in lying, but I guess 
                    he didn t believe me, or wanted to 
                    make sure I was telling the truth, 
                    so, to make sure I knew how serious 
                    he was, he shot Robert Gee in the 
                    heart.
                          (beat)
                    Next time I saw Tommy Bucks was in 
                    Miami.  I gave him twenty-four 
                    hours to get out of the country.

                                  WINONA
                    That s the man you killed?  The one 
                    on the news?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (nods, beat)
                    He pulled first, so I was justified, 
                    but ever since I ve been thinking, 
                    what if he hadn t?  What if he just 
                    sat there and let the clock run out.  
                    Would I ve killed him anyway?  I know 
                    I wanted to.  I felt it in my chest, 
                    behind my eyes.  
                          (beat)
                    I guess I never thought of myself 
                    as an angry man.

                                  WINONA
                          (laughs sweetly)
                    Oh, Raylan.  

      Raylan looks at her.

                                  WINONA (CONT'D)
                    You do a good job of hiding it, and 
                    suppose most folks don t see it, 
                    but honestly, you re the angriest 
                    man I ve ever known.

      Raylan looks at her -- what?  And on his incredulity mixed 
      with the realization she s absolutely right--

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                                  THE END
