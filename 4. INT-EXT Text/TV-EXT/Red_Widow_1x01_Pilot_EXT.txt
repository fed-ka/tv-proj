    ON THE WATER, SKIMMING the surface LOW AND FAST until we hit --


    CAMERA STILL AT WATER LEVEL - but we can SEE the normally 
    packed tourist trap is deserted.  The naval battleships, 
    fishing boats - empty, dark, eerie.  CAMERA MOVES TO -- 


    -- PUSH INTO THE BLACKNESS - suddenly, a PAIR OF EYES catch 
    the light.  A MAN, in a small motorboat, eyes darting, breath 
    short.  He s afraid... or excited.  This is IRWIN LAZAREV, 
    30 s.  He looks up as BOOTS STEP overhead.  PAN UP TO --

    THE DOCK DIRECTLY ABOVE 

    FOUR MEN - quickly, quietly unload crates of iced FISH from 
    a FISHING BOAT, and stack them onto a forklift.  Two of the 
    men look like RUSSIAN FISHERMEN, but both have GUNS in their 
    belts.  Clearly, they do more than just fish.  The other two 
    men, JULIUS and STAN, are American.  Decidedly not 
    fishermen.  Both are armed.  Dangerous.

    Julius spins as a CRATE tips over.  Its contents spill out - 
    fish, ice, and a sealed BRICK OF WHITE POWDER, marked with 
    the image of a LAUGHING DOG.  He hurries to repack it -- 

    UNDER THE DOCK - Ice DROPS down on Irwin, hitting his boat 
    with sharp KNOCKS.  He holds his breath...

    ABOVE DOCK - Julius stops - did he hear something? 

                                        FISHERMAN #1
                                (Russian accent)
                        That is the last one.

    Julius shakes it off as the two Fishermen climb onto their 
    boat, start the ENGINE.  The two camps share a terse nod.  
      Transaction complete.  As the fishing boat MOTORS out of port, 
    Julius climbs into the FORKLIFT - starts the motor...                                                                                      2.


                                        JULIUS
                        Check the ties.

    ON STAN - as he moves in front of the crates, out of Julius  
    view.  He doesn t see Irwin come up on him with a PIPE aimed 
    at his head - BAM!  The fork lift MOTOR drowns the sound.  

    ON JULIUS - waiting - then something catches his eye --

    IRWIN S SMALL, EMPTY MOTORBOAT 

    -- as it floats out from under the pier where it was hidden.  
    Someone is here.  Julius pulls his gun - circles the forklift - 
    FINDS STAN lying there unconscious.  

    JULIUS SPINS - just as A PIPE HITS him.  He drops.  Irwin KICKS 
    his gun away, goes to move him.  But the half-conscious Julius 
    struggles, twists around, then SEES Irwin s face.  Stops.

                                        JULIUS
                        Wait, I... know you.
                              (as Irwin steps back)
                        You crazy?  No one steals from 
                        Schiller. 

    Irwin tries to hide it, but is clearly in over his head, and 
    Julius knows it.  He sits up with more confidence --

                                        JULIUS
                        Walk away - maybe he just kills you.  
                        Do this - your whole family s dead.  

                                        IRWIN
                        You re right... Schiller can t find 
                        out who did it.

    With that, he pulls out a GUN with a silencer and SHOOTS 
    Julius in the head.  Does the same to Stan.  He then SHOOTS 
    several holes into the MOTORBOAT to sink it.  As Irwin 
    hurries to FORKLIFT and drives it up the dock --

    CLOSE ON FEET PEDALING A BIKE - DAYBREAK

    -- up a very steep hill.  PAN UP TO the rider, MARTA 
    WALRAVEN, 40 s.  She pushes hard; intense, focused.  
    Exercise is her religion.  Her meditation.  INCLUDE --


    The pedaling gets harder, the mountain steeper.  But this woman 
    is capable of almost anything, though she may not know it yet.  
    Finally, she CRESTS the mountain.  Exhales heavily as she floats 
    over the flat surface.  Made it!  She stops for some water, 
    taking in the SPECTACULAR VIEW OF THE BAY AREA.                                                                                      3.


                                        DINA (O.C.)
                        You are a complete bitch!

    Marta laughs as her best friend, DINA TOMLIN, 40 s, walks her 
    bike up.  Though sweaty, Dina is perfectly manicured, dyed, 
    preserved.  Her style contrasts Marta s earthy naturalism.  

                                        DINA
                        You said we d do an intermediate ride.

                                        MARTA
                        This is intermediate.  Admit it, you 
                        feel great.  Clearer.  Stronger --

                                        DINA
                        Strength is overrated.  I can hire 
                        people to lift things.

    Marta laughs again.  Clips into her bike and pushes off.   

                                        MARTA
                        Race you to the bottom.

                                        DINA
                        Bitch! 

    ON MARTA, wind in her face as she coasts downhill, her reward.


    The house is built of wood, stone, and glass, well 
    integrated into its natural surroundings.  It's all about 
      understatement, which is important to this family.  

    BORIS exits the front door, backpack on.  He looks over his 
    shoulder - no one s behind him.  He hurries to an AUDI SEDAN --


    Small boats, yachts, sailboats, fishing charters, dry storage 
      facilities, fuel dock.  FIND THE OFFICE, located in a 
    HOUSEBOAT.  The door SWINGS OPEN - Franklin exits with Irwin.  
    They re partners, in-laws and, though they argue, old friends.

                                        IRWIN
                        It s a unique opportunity --                                                                                       9.


                                        FRANKLIN
                        I m not interested in that crap --

                                        IRWIN
                        We need to expand, diversify --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        So you always say.  But we re still in 
                        business because we keep it small.  
                        Buy from the same grower.  Store it 
                        off-site.  And we do not diversify.  

    They approach a BOAT on which STEVEN TOMLIN, 40, works.  
    He s the foot-soldier, not the general, prefers it that way.

                                        IRWIN
                        Help me out, Steven.  

                                        STEVEN
                        I could use the income, Frankie.  
                        Dina s gallery is costing me --

                                        IRWIN
                        -- and I have a lead on a buyer.   
                        Maybe we should put it to a vote --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        A minute ago, it was an  opportunity.   
                        Now there s a buyer and a vote?  What 
                        else don t I know --

                                        STEVEN
                        -- Psst - heads up...

    ANGLE ON THE TOP OF THE DOCK

    FBI AGENT JAMES LEEFLANG heads toward them.  Late 30 s.  Neat, 
    smart.  Anger brewing beneath the surface, but kept well in 
    check.  His younger PARTNER, CELIA TREJO, waits up the dock.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        What re they doing here? ... Irwin?

    Irwin deflects by giving Leeflang a friendly wave as he nears --

                                        IRWIN
                        Agent Leeflang.  It s been a while.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        We ve been focusing on bigger fish.  

                                        STEVEN
                        Good for us, bad for the big fish.                                                                                    10.


                                        LEEFLANG
                        One big fish in particular.  I believe 
                        you know Schiller.  

    A chill runs down Franklin s spine.  But he hides it.  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Seems he got ripped off two nights ago.  
                        Two men were killed.  Right on the 
                        docks where the load was delivered.  We 
                        figured the sellers wanted to hold onto 
                        both ends of the deal.  

                                        IRWIN
                        Case solved.  Thanks for stopping by.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Then we found a sunken motorboat under 
                        the dock.  Bullet holes in it.  Someone 
                        else was there and drove the load out.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Which all has nothing to do with us --  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Whoever did it knew the time and place 
                        of the off-load.  Hard information to 
                        come by without ties to the Bratva.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        We re not Bratva.  I m not even Russian.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        You became both when you married a 
                        Lazarev.  

                                        STEVEN
                                (holding up his cell phone)
                        Ethnic profiling.  Caught on tape.

    He laughs nervously.  No one else does.  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Here s the thing.  Forensics can tell 
                        where a boat is from, just by the 
                        algae on its hull.  Seems that motor-
                        boat came from right around... here.
                              (no response, glances at Irwin)
                        Maybe you got tired of being small time.

                                        STEVEN
                        Yeah, maybe we lost our minds.                                                                                     11.


                                        LEEFLANG
                        Either way, Schiller will figure it 
                        out.  Which means whoever did it is 
                        dead.  Everyone he cares about is dead.  
                        Unless... he lets the Bureau help him.

    Again, they have no reaction.  Leeflang just shrugs.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        You have my number.

    Leeflang heads back up the dock with a satisfied expression.  
    They watch him disappear.  The second he s gone, Franklin 
    SPINS on Irwin -- 

                                        FRANKLIN
                        What did you do?!

                                        IRWIN
                        -- No one s gonna find out --

                                        STEVEN
                        -- Wait, what? --

    Franklin violently PINS Irwin against a boat, choking him --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        What did you do to us?

                                        IRWIN 
                        I - told you - I wanted to expand... 

    Franklin recoils, as if hit.  Steven paces, freaked out.  

                                        STEVEN
                        You said - you had product.  You never 
                        said it was Schiller s!  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        My God.  You killed two people. 

                                        IRWIN
                        Trust me, they were not good guys.   
                        Look, it s safe in the J Boat --

                                        STEVEN
                        It s here!?  

    Franklin leans against the boat, horror washing over him --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        We re all dead.

    Off him - HEAR THE RING OF A SCHOOL BELL --                                                                                    12.



    CLOSE ON BORIS S BACKPACK - as we HEAR the sound of children 
    at play.  INCLUDE Boris, wearing his backpack, walking 
    across the blacktop at recess, toward the periphery to --

    A SECLUDED KNOT OF REDWOOD TREES - where he finds TRENT, 13.  
    Trent leans against a tree, listening to his iPod with BOSE 
      HEADPHONES.  Boris approaches with trepidation.  

                                        TRENT
                        Look.  It s Doris.

                                        BORIS 
                        Will you please return my headphones?

                                        TRENT  
                        What headphones?

                                        BORIS 
                        The ones on your head.  You borrowed 
                        them last week.  

                                        TRENT
                        You re saying I stole them. 

                                        BORIS 
                        Give me my headphones. 

    Trent picks up a pinecone, PELTS Boris with it.

                                        BORIS
                        Don t do that.

    But Trent keeps LOBBING PINE CONES, unaware of the ticking 
    time bomb in Boris  backpack - for which Boris now reaches --

                                        TRENT
                        What did you say, Doris?

    -- Suddenly, Boris PULLS OUT THE HANDGUN.  Trent rears back --

                                        BORIS
                        Give me my headphones.

    OFF his intensity, the gun shaking in his hands -- 


    CLOSE ON MARTA - aware only of Kat's wedding crisis.  She 
    strides through the drab, treeless ethnic neighborhood.  Store 
    SIGNS written in Russian.  She passes two BABUSHKAS who wave, 
    friendly.  Everyone knows each other here.  Marta arrives at --                                                                                    13.



    A traditional Russian restaurant.  Leaning in the doorway, 
    is LUTHER, 40, her father's bodyguard.  Deadly calm, but 
    wry, lean, muscular.  He smokes a cigarette.  Marta smiles. 

                                        MARTA
                        You the doorman now?

                                        LUTHER
                        They won t let me light up inside.

                                        MARTA
                        Good.  Maybe you ll quit smoking.

                                        LUTHER
                                (deadpan)
                        Yes.  That s very likely.

                                        MARTA
                                (smiling)
                        Is he here? 

                                        LUTHER
                        In his office.

    Marta gives Luther a friendly kiss on the cheek.  For a 
    split second, his eyes linger on her.  We might sense he has 
    a soft spot for her.  He holds the door open --


    Marta pulls up in her Lexus to FIND a SQUAD CAR at the curb.  
    She SEES, in the back seat, BORIS, looking small, terrified.  
    TEARS spring to her eyes as she climbs out and starts toward 
    him.  But the PRINCIPAL blocks her path --                                                                                    16.


                                        PRINCIPAL
                        We were lucky, Mrs. Walraven - I 
                        happened to be nearby and contained the 
                        situation before anyone else saw...

    She nods, keeps moving, but the Principal stops her again.

                                        PRINCIPAL
                        The police will let us handle it, and 
                        the other boy s parents have agreed, 
                        but only if Boris is expelled.

                                        MARTA
                                (flaring, spins on him)
                        And the monster who s been bullying 
                        him?  Will he be expelled? --

                    PRINCIPALMARTA 
    He wasn t the one with the -- I ve been telling you 
    gun --about him for months, and 
                                                you ve done nothing --

                                        PRINCIPAL
                        -- You could appeal.  But the police 
                        would be forced to build a case 
                        against Boris.  Which could lead to an 
                          investigation of your entire family.  
                                (pointed)
                        Do you understand, Mrs. Walraven?

    The threat is clear.  Marta seethes but can do nothing.  
    Frustration, fury, shame course through her as the Principal 
    walks away.  Marta turns back to the squad car...  

    PUSH IN ON HER FACE, as she looks at Boris.  Her baby.  And 
    she has failed him.  It s a terrible moment.  Then we see 
    something click in her mind.  A decision.  


    -- The MUSIC wafts over the bobbing vessels as we land on a 
    sleek J BOAT.  HEAR the men s voices inside --  


    IRWIN'S BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE drives across the long steel 
    bridge toward the East Bay.  As it reaches the other side... 


    Irwin drives.  Then he sees, in the REARVIEW MIRROR - AN UNMARKED 
    SEDAN rev up behind him.  Its RED & BLUES FLASH, a SIREN blaring.  

                                        IRWIN
                        Nonononono....

    Irwin SPEEDS up, but a SECOND SEDAN pulls up, then two more.  

    Irwin pulls over to the SHOULDER, POUNDING on the wheel in 
    frustration.  He watches FBI AGENTS pour out of the sedans -- 


    LEEFLANG sidles up to the driver's window, knocks on it.  It 
    rolls down to reveal a now smiling Irwin.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Please step out of the car.

    As Irwin gets out, TREJO initiates a SEARCH of his vehicle.                                                                                      25.


                                        IRWIN
                        Since when is the FBI issuing speeding 
                        tickets?  

                                        LEEFLANG
                         Fraid speeding is the least of your 
                        concerns.

    He holds up a document.  Irwin takes it, surprised.

                                        IRWIN
                        A warrant?  For what?  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Hands on the hood, please.

    Irwin spreads eagle on the hood.  Leeflang pats him down as --

                                        IRWIN
                        There was no tail - I was looking. 
                        How d you know I d be here?  

    Trejo approaches, carrying IRWIN S GUN.

                                        TREJO
                        Serial numbers are filed off.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        This isn t good, Irwin.  A convicted 
                        felon in possession of a weapon.  
                        It ll buy you some jail time.

                                        IRWIN
                        Not enough to make it worth all this.

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Maybe.  But see... Schiller has people 
                        on the inside.  I can t help you in 
                        there.  But I can help you out here -    
                        if you want to discuss Schiller s 
                        missing product.  

    He looks at Irwin.  Waiting.  But Irwin smiles cheekily.

                                        IRWIN
                        I ll take that speeding ticket now.

    Leeflang just looks at him as ANOTHER AGENT leads him away.  

                                        TREJO
                        So that s our endgame here?  Throw him 
                        in the pen and hope he talks?                                                                                      26.


                                        LEEFLANG
                        He won t talk.  Has too much to prove.  
                        But I agreed to get him out of the way 
                        on a minor charge.  Part of the deal.

                                        TREJO
                        Your tipster better come through.

    Leeflang knows this all too well.  Off him, tense --  


    Steven is in Franklin s face.  

                                        STEVEN
                        They just  happened  to pull Irwin 
                        over now.  With a gun in his car.  We 
                        were the only ones who knew!

                                        FRANKLIN
                        Why would I tip them?                                                                                    27.


                                        STEVEN
                         Cause you re afraid to go through 
                        with this.  You d rather have him in 
                        jail, you chickenshit - am I next?!  
                        You goddamn coward -- !

    -- He SHOVES Franklin, who SHOVES back.  Steven THROWS A 
    PUNCH.  Franklin blocks him.  They scuffle.  MARTA - hurries 
    out.  GUESTS follow, shocked.  Appalled.

                                        MARTA
                        Stop this!

    KAT AND JOE exit, horrified.  Franklin shoves Steven down.  

                                        FRANKLIN
                        You re high, Steven.  Go home.

                                        STEVEN
                        I ll kill you!  

    -- as he jumps up and LUNGES at Franklin, KNOCKING him down.  
    Punching him.  Franklin swings back, defending himself.  
    Finally, LUTHER appears, PULLS Steven off Franklin --

                                        LUTHER
                        Calm down, brother.  

    Steven struggles against Luther s iron hold.  Dina runs up --

                                        DINA
                        What the hell, Steven!
                              (to Luther)
                        Will you just - let him go?

                                        LUTHER
                                (beat, to Steven)
                        It s a party, man.

                                        STEVEN
                        A party, yeah.  

    Finally, Luther lets him go.  Steven pulls away, PISSED.  He 
    glares at Franklin, then storms off.  Dina is mortified.  

                                        DINA
                        I m... so sorry.

    She shoots Marta an apologetic look, hurries after Steven.  
    Marta goes to Franklin, who forces a smile for the crowd --

                                        FRANKLIN
                         S all good folks.  We re celebrating 
                        the happy couple here, right?                                                                                      28.


    He gestures towards the Clubhouse.  People are reluctant, 
    but slowly move inside.  Marta just pulls Franklin away --


    Marta pulls Franklin to a dark, private area.

                                        MARTA
                        Was that about you getting out?

                                        FRANKLIN
                        I - don t know.  It s a mess --

                                        MARTA
                        Franklin.  I meant what I said.

                    FRANKLINMARTA
    I know.  I will leave --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        -- I know! 

    A long pause.  Finally, he looks at her.  Dead serious.

                                        FRANKLIN
                        If this is what you really want, I can 
                        get out --

                                        MARTA
                        -- It s what I want --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        -- But we d have to go.  Leave 
                          everything.  

                                        MARTA
                        What are you talking about?  You ll 
                        just... stop.  Go legit --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        -- Marta, we re in The Life --

                                        MARTA
                        You re barely connected --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        You don t know - over the years, 
                        protection fees, my trade routes - it 
                        keeps me tangled up - and now --
                                (stops himself)
                        We d have to take the kids and go --

                                        MARTA
                        -- Go where?                                                                                    29.


                                        FRANKLIN
                        I don t know.  But we could never come 
                        back.  We d leave everything, the 
                        Marina, the family --  

                                        MARTA
                        -- Gabriel has S.A.T s.  And Boris --

                                        FRANKLIN
                        This is the only way, Marta.
                                (looks into her eyes)
                        Do you want out? 

    They stare at each other, overwhelmed by the intensity of 
    the moment.  This man is the father of Marta s children, the 
    love of her life.  But what he s asking... then...

                                        MARTA
                        Yes.  

    The word takes her by surprise.  Then with more conviction --

                                        MARTA
                        Yes.  I want that.    

    She laughs.  So does he.  It s just so absurd.  And 
    exhilarating.  They hold each other, then kiss... 


    The sun rises on this lovely hamlet - who d ever want to leave it?


    -- Marta BURSTS out to FIND --

    FRANKLIN lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood.  

    BORIS standing beside his father, in shock, frozen.  

    Marta runs to Boris, covers his eyes.  Then looks down at her 
    husband.  She releases Boris, who seems almost catatonic --

    Marta kneels beside Franklin, the life bleeding out of him.  
    She tries to stem the bleeding, putting pressure on a wound.  

                                        MARTA
                        Franklin!  Can you hear me?!  
                                (yelling)
                        Help me!!!  Someone HELP ME!!!

    As we PULL UP AND BACK on her SCREAMING for help.  Weeping 
    over Franklin's body...

                                    END OF ACT II                                                                                    31.

    Gabriel approaches the pool.  Stares at it.  JUMPS into it 
    fully dressed.  Sinks to the bottom and stays there.  Off 
    him, we PULL UP AND BACK ON THE POOL to INCLUDE --                                                                                    34.



    THROUGH THE WALLS OF GLASS, we SEE THE FAMILY, each member in 
      a different room, separate, alone.  
    -- LIVING ROOM - Natalie scratching her grief into her sketch 
    pad; 
    -- BORIS  ROOM - Boris standing in his pajamas at the window.  
    -- MARTA S ROOM - Marta sitting on the edge of her bed in a 
    her robe.  Just... dazed.  Hollow.   


    -- STEVEN exits - and is immediately GRABBED from behind.  A 
    SECOND MAN WITH A KNIFE SLASHES Steven s face, then his 
    CHEST, cutting through his t-shirt.  Then his forearm.  

    Steven drops, bleeding.  He looks up at the knife wielder, 
    LEON, 30 s, slick, detached, chillingly graceful.

                                        LEON
                        It will be major arteries next.

    Leon s younger, meaner associate, WALL, 20 s, leans down --

                                        WALL
                        You took something that belongs to Mr. 
                        Schiller.

                                        STEVEN
                        It wasn t me!  I swear! - AGH!

    -- As Leon SLASHES Steven s other arm - off his SCREAM --  


    Steven, bloodied, terrified, looks up at the two hit men --                                                                                    38.


                                        STEVEN
                      I didn t take it --
                                (holds up a hand)
                        -- but I know where it is!  

    Wall hoists Steven up.  They drag him to their car --


    As MARTA S LEXUS pulls in, Marta is stunned to find the 
    driveway crammed with unmarked SEDANS.  AGENTS carry boxes 
    and computers out of the house --


    Marta pulls into the lot, parks.  As she opens the door, she 
    digs FRANKLIN S KEYS out of her pocket - but stops, SEEING 
    something on them...

    -- THE SMALL PLASTIC SAILBOAT dangling from the chain.  She 
    PULLS IT APART - to reveal a memory stick.  She s devastated...

                                        MARTA
                        Oh, Franklin...

    A long beat - but she inhales courage and gets out --


    Marta heads down the dock to BERTH SIXTEEN, the J BOAT.  She 
    climbs aboard with trepidation.  Then climbs down into --


    -- The Lexus stops.  Steven starts to climb out, but Marta 
    stops him.  Looks him in the eye.

                                        MARTA
                        Did you kill him?

                                        STEVEN
                        No!  No, I did not kill Franklin!  Why 
                        the hell would I do that?

                                        MARTA
                        To keep it all for yourself.  

    He just shakes his head.  The LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE come on.  

                                        MARTA
                        If you did it, I ll make sure you pay.  

                                        STEVEN
                        If you took that stash, I ll make sure 
                        you pay.                                                                                    43.


    DINA steps out of the house in her robe.  Steven exits the 
    car.  She sees his bloodied clothing.  Hurries over --

                                        DINA
                        My God!  What happened?

                                        STEVEN
                        ... Someone... jumped me at the 
                        Marina.  Mugged me.  Marta found me.

    It's a lame excuse.  Marta doesn t confirm or deny.  A 
    beat... SEE Dina decide to accept it.  She turns to Marta --

                                        DINA
                        Thank God they didn t hurt you, too.

    It's genuine concern.  Marta s moved, they share a look... 
    the beginning of a rapprochement.  Then Marta drives off --


    Marta climbs out of her car, walks toward the bank, but SEES 
    LEEFLANG exit the bank, head for his car.  She stops him --

                                        MARTA
                        What are you doing at my bank?

                                        LEEFLANG

                        through illicit means.  We have the

                                        MARTA
                        -- You what?! -- 

                    LEEFLANGMARTA (CONT D)
    -- as long as you re under How much more hell are you 
    investigation --*going to put us through --  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        Hey.  You re not the victim here --  

    She s obviously hit a button.  

                                        LEEFLANG
                        -- People like you, you re worse than 
                        the criminals.  You don t commit the 
                        crimes, but you condone them by doing 
                        nothing.  And when your world goes to 
                        hell, you blame everyone but yourself.  
                                (calming himself, a beat)
                        You can cooperate, or we can hold on to 
                        your funds.  It s your choice.  Yours.

    As he walks away, Marta chokes back a sob.  He s given voice 
    to her deepest fear and shame.  And it's devastating.  


    ON FEET PEDALING - attacking the pedals like she's trying to 
    kill them.  INCLUDE MARTA, breathing hard, but unrelenting.  
    More intense than we've ever seen her.  

                                                                        CUT AWAY TO:


    BACK ON MARTA, biking, pushing harder and harder...


    Marta exits, fully dressed, high heels.  She strides to 
    Leeflang and Trejo s SEDAN.  Hands him the MEMORY STICK --  


    BACK ON MARTA, fighting thirst, pain, but she keeps pushing...

                                        FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                      I just want to say I m... so sorry.  I 
                        didn t want to leave you.  To leave 
                        you with all this...


    Marta finally reaches the crest, FLOATS over flat land...

                                        FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                        Don't trust anyone but yourself...
