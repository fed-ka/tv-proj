As STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills
out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State
University.
We see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who's among
the top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to
develop a way with women.
LIZ
(falling in step)
Hiya Peter...
LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and
intelligent.
PETER
(ardent but
uncomfortable)
Hiya Liz... how're you doing...?
LIZ
(teasing softly)
How'm I doing what?
HARRY
Peter! Peter! Wait up!
HARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER,
can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty
ones like Liz.
HARRY
(to Liz)
Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?
Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him
away like a conspirator.
PETER
What is it? what...
HARRY
Did the Astro-Physics Journal really
accept your paper?
PETER
(laughs, embarrassed)
Yeah... well... all I got's the data but
they've agreed to publish it when it's
finished. You know... it's my
calculation on the Planetary Conjunction.
HARRY
And its influence on the anti-force.
Isn't it?
PETER
Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with...
(indicates Liz standing
there)
HARRY
Yeah, you and the rest of the class.
Every one is busy with Liz.
LIZ
(growing impatient)
Peter?
A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom.
FLASH
Hiya, cupcakes...
LIZ
(elbowing him
affectionately)
Flash...!
They kiss and walk away.
HARRY
(sneering)
And Flash is the busiest of them all...
PETER
(disappointed)
Come on, Harry... we'll be late for
Octavius.
HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.
HARRY
Ock is nuts, don't you agree?
PETER
Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But,
a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.
Establish as ART DECO BUILDING well beyond its prime. A
sign says: "The Daily Bugle." Peter enters the building.
JAMESON (V.O.)
Garbage! Absolute, 100% garbage!
A seedy east village walk up. Peter takes his camera and
takes various shots of a wino. ALL IN. He climbs the
stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he
collects from a beaten down mailbox.
PETER
(reading)
Rent! Rent, more bills, rent...
electricity, bills...
The long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN. A COP CAR pulls
to a halt in front of the COLLEGE. Many NYPD CARS are
already there, along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN, some
AMBULANCES, a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
and TWO TV VANS. ROZ runs across the lawn.
POLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press, students
and general gawkers.
J. JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see
TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it.
The MAN shakes his head. JAMESON throws down his CIGAR,
stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. THORKEL arrives to
address the CROWD.
THORKEL
(through bull horn)
There is no danger. Please go back to
your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger.
JAMESON
(approaches him)
Spill it out, Professor! The public
wants to know!
The CROWD closes on THORKEL.
THORKEL
Who are you?
JAMESON
Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now
what really happened here?
THORKEL
There will be a press announcement in the
morning Mr. Jameson... now if you'll
excuse me.
This elicits a flood of AD LIBS: "I heard a terrible
explosion?" "Nuclear accidents?" "Meltdown?" "Genetic
engineering?" "Are you guys making mutants in there?"
THORKEL
I have nothing to say... there will be an
announcement. Now, please go home...
everybody... we must clear the grounds...
In the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and
KIM.
FLASH
You think they'll cancel classes?
HARRY
They must... the whole building must be
contaminated with some kind of poisonous
gas.
PETER
How about nuclear contaminations?
KIM
My God... lets beat it.
But nobody moves.
LIZ
(more interested in other
things)
Could anyone be in there, Peter?
PETER
(concerned)
I don't know... Maybe Professor Octavius.
He usually works late...
FLASH
That nut, I bet it was all his doing...
JAMESON
(seeing Peter)
Hey Parker! Peter Parker!
PETER pushes forward.
PETER
Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here?
What's going on?
JAMESON
That's for them to know, and for you to
find out.
PETER
But sir, they wouldn't tell us. You
heard Thorkel... he said...
JAMESON
A press announcement tomorrow...! But we
must know tonight Parker. This is your
university, right...
PETER
Yes, but...
JAMESON
You got your camera?
PETER
Sure, but I can't--
JAMESON
A hundred dollars says you can?
PETER
Yes sir!
JAMESON
Get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks.
PETER
You just said a hundred.
JAMESON
Seventy, but I want blood and gore.
PETER
(calling back)
Seeya guys.
He dashes off. FLASH shakes his head in dismay at this
guy.
LIZ
Where is he going?
JAMESON
To make fifty bucks.
PETER approaches a CYCLONE FENCE keeping low and out of
sight. He leaps it like a skirmisher but fails
ignominiously in a heap. He's torn his PANTS and cut his
leg. He moves to the side of the building.
A DUMPSTER sits next to a FIRE DOOR. It's locked. As
PETER mulls over his next move, the LOCK clicks and the
DOOR slowly opens. PETER leaps on the DUMPSTER... and
falls in.
PETER squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the
NEWSPAPER. The Door closes behind him.
It bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws
his BACK PACK at him.
GUARD
(still distorted)
You get yourself over to the Police lines.
PETER
(ultra wooz)
Right. Police lines.
PETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON
appears at his side.
JAMESON
(distorted)
Okay, scoop, whaddaya got?
PETER
I... got pictures of the Professor... in
there... it's so strange in there... so
bizarre...
JAMESON
(winks)
Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need.
Pick this up in the morning.
(holding up his camera)
There'll be two crisp twenties tucked
inside.
He hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden
his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is
gone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to
the street.
We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind
him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN.
An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits
PETER who leaps to avoid it.
PETER'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his
eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the
building like a spider. And he's three stories up!
He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him!
And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away.
He tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and
crashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And
then another.
Tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he
"crawls" to the roof of the building. At the top he
gropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories
above the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the
roof one-handed.
PETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits
up and looks wonderingly at his hands.
On the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS
surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW
disappears.
PETER
(mutters to himself)
This is weird. My God, I feel so weird...
He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good
Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of
"jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the
air!
PETER
(exhilarated)
Very weird.
The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as
PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air.
With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps
from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL
where he lands sideways and sticks.
PETER
(sideways)
Very, very weird.
He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof.
He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a
step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.
PETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and
across the street. PETER bites his lip.
PETER
Well, what the hell!!
Backlit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of
the taller building, and misses the top!
He sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs
with the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty
BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way
and that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT
down the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws
into the room.
The MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST
and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED
LIGHTER.
In the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off
the taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time
to see PETER make it to the next FACADE.
With the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to
the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop.
Watching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT
follows PETER'S progress.
PETER leaps to a BROWNSTONE and lands amid the WASH.
He leaps up to a TENEMENT and lands on a BILLBOARD across
which he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again.
He touches down on a PIGEON COOP and bounds up and out of
frame again. The COOP OWNER, a LATINO in an undershirt
and a YANKEES CAP, comes running out of the COOP.
He's so surprised that he leaves the DOOR open and twenty
WHITE MORNING DOVES fly away in a furious flapping, free
at last. The LATINO lets out a stream of Hispanic
expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene
gestures.
PETER slides down a CABLE to a LAMP POST, and swirls down
the POLE to a PHONE BOOTH.
PETER comes face to face with the man in the LOUD
SPORTCOAT. He gives PETER his CARD.
REISS
You're a kid who's going places, and I'm
gonna point you the right way.
PETER
(reading card)
Max Reiss, models, strip dancers, escort
girls, blue movies...
REISS
Oops... sorry, wrong card.
(exchanges cards)
PETER
Max Reiss, Talent management.
REISS
It's a big outfit. Got a lot of
departments.
PETER
Yeah... well... why you approach me? I'm
not...
REISS
Oh yes you are... very talented. The
three questions of show business success.
One do you think you possess a unique
talent?
PETER
Well...
REISS
Two... what are you gonna do with it?
PETER
(not a clue)
Well... I don't know.
REISS
(the clincher)
Three... how much money you got in your
pocket?
PETER
Ten.
REISS
You invest half of that with me and I'll
make you a star.
PETER
(laughing)
What are you talking about?
REISS
I'm talking about fame. I'm talking
about fortune. I'm talking about the
chance of a lifetime. How'd you like to
be on MTV tomorrow night?
PETER
MTV...? Me? Really?
REISS
Taxi!
It screeches to a stop.
PETER
Hey!
REISS
(getting in)
Kid! Tomorrow night. Same place, same
time.
PETER
(calling after)
How do you know I'll show up?
As the TAXI roars off...
REISS
(from the taxi window)
Because you wanna be a star... everybody
does.
PETER pulls out a QUARTER. And enters a phone booth. He
dials.
PETER
Hello? Aunt May?
AUNT MAY (V.O.)
(filtered)
Peter? What time is it? Are you alright?
PETER
Well, no, I mean yeah I'm fine, but
listen... Aunti, the craziest thing
happened to me tonight.
As UNCLE BEN stirs fitfully
AUNT MAY
(lovingly)
Does this have to do with a certain girl
we talked about at dinner?
PETER
No, no, look, there was this radioactive
experiment... I was poisoned!
AUNT MAY
You were what?
PETER
I was bitten by a bug.
AUNT MAY
Oh! I get it, you mean a love bug.
PETER
No... No... A spider...
AUNT MAY
Peter, did you at least talk to her?
PETER
Aunt May, listen to me. I got bitten on
the hand... by a poisonous spider.
AUNT MAY
She bit you?
PETER
No. I was in the bathroom and...
AUNT MAY
Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter,
this is craziness, why don't you use your
bed? You're up all night. You're in the
radioactive labs. You never take time to
eat or sleep. Am I right?
PETER
Yes, Aunt May.
WE ARE TIGHT ON A NEW YORK JOURNAL TRUCK. On its SIDE
BANNER is a PICTURE of SPIDER-MAN'S face. Headline: "Who
is he? Mega-Smash Hits MTV!"
The TRUCK pulls away and we see PETER, LIZ, HARRY and KIM
standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. PETER is
rocking on his heels and smirking.
PETER
(indicating truck)
You know who that is?
LIZ
(walking ahead)
Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last
night... boy does Flash think he's hot.
PETER
He does...
KIM
I love wrestling.
HARRY
Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really
believe this little guy in a stupid
Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher?
LIZ
Hey, we better rush... visiting hours
will be over soon.
A CAMERA is mounted on a TRIPOD facing us. A TIMER winds
down and it CLICKS.
REVERSE ANGLE - CAMERA'S POV.
SPIDER-MAN is clinging to the side of a WALL.
SPIDER-MAN
And one like this...
(changing pose)
And one looking real sincere.
The WHITE EYES narrow to a slit. CLICK.
Suddenly he spots WEINER climbing onto his roof. He
hides.
WEINER tiptoes into the roof apartment. SPIDER-MAN jumps
in and grabs him.
SPIDER-MAN
What are you doing here?
WEINER
I'm looking for Peter Parker.
SPIDER-MAN
Oh, yes... so why not use the front door?
SPIDER-MAN throws him back onto the roof so that he almost
slides over the edge. WEINER turns, facing SPIDER-MAN.
WEINER
Hey, I know you...
SPIDER-MAN
You do?
WEINER
I saw you crushing the Crusher.
SPIDER-MAN
You like wrestling?
SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER.
WEINER
I love it! You are the best wrestler I
have ever seen... please don't hurt me!
SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna
above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately.
SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna.
WEINER
Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help
me down.
SPIDER-MAN
Of course I'll help you down. I am
Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not?
WEINER
Yes... yes, you are.
SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his
arms and whispers to him.
SPIDER-MAN
And by the way, Peter Parker does not
live here anymore...
SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of
the roof.
SPIDER-MAN
And tell the Professor he can't have
Peter's data. Goodbye.
SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors
straight down into heavy bushes below.
An ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the
Bank's DOORS.
Suddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW
of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER'S NECK
and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for
his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out
through his WINDOW.
TWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR
DOOR.
BANK GUARD
What's going on here?
The WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The
TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS.
OCK
Cash!
It enters the EAST RIVER DRIVE.
The TAXI skids and swerves like crazy, bumping into
everything in sight.
TAXI driving fast through STREET.
The CABBIE slowly changes the TIRE. Fearing the worst,
SPIDEY gets out, looking for a ride. A TRUCK approaches.
SPIDEY looks down at the CABBIE and then up at the TRUCK.
CABBIE
Hey! You wanna hand me that lug wrench?
He looks up to see SPIDEY go by, stuck to the side of the
TRUCK like a spider.
CABBIE
Some crazy kinda town...
SPIDEY stares at the lettering on the side of the TRUCK.
It says, "Victory Sporting Goods."
SPIDER-MAN
(a thought)
Sporting goods...
The TRUCK pulls away leaving PETER in a POOL of STREET
LAMP LIGHT. He's wearing a FOOTBALL JERSEY and SHORTS and
carrying a SPORTS BAG. He begins to run.
PETER runs up and hears a SHOT. He runs inside.
COP CARS, COPS, SEARCHLIGHTS playing their BEAMS against
the ACME CHEMICAL STORAGE BUILDING. GUNFIRE flashes from
one of the WINDOWS.
ELITE COPS in BASEBALL CAPS are plotting strategy.
COP #1
That place is loaded with solvents and
chemicals. If we blast our way in, it's
gonna go up like a roman candle.
COP #2
We could go in through the fifth floor
wash room.
COP #1
What's that up there? Throw a light on
that!
COP #1 directs the BEAM of the SEARCHLIGHT.
SPIDER-MAN is climbing it, trapped in the GLARE of the
SEARCHLIGHT. He freezes.
COP #1
He's got a partner!
Every COP'S WEAPON is trained upward at SPIDER-MAN!
COP #2
(on radio)
We got an accomplice up there! And we
got a clear shot. Do we have a go?
RADIO
(filtered)
That's a go.
GUNSHOTS erupt around SPIDER-MAN and he skitters around to
evade them.
LIZ running as fast as she can, but OCK is gaining
quickly.
A TAXI drives up and disgorges PETER.
PETER
Wait here...
LIZ looks back and sees OCK CARTWHEELING toward her. She
can't outrun him. She must hide. There's a CONSTRUCTION
SITE on the right. She ducks down the alley next to it.
Extending WALDO over WALDO, OCK climbs the ELEVATOR
HOUSING chasing the rising CAR inside.
The CAR arrives and LIZ jumps out. She's on nothing but a
narrow GIRDER! She tightropes on the GIRDER. OCK gets to
the top. He looks across at her. She's stuck between two
unfastened GIRDERS, at a dead end. He slowly telescopes a
WALDO toward her. She's got no place to run, no place to
hide. He grabs her by the BLOUSE and lifts her off the
GIRDER.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
Put her down, Ock.
OCK looks across the street. There, on the top of a tall
building, is SPIDER-MAN.
SPIDER-MAN
I know what's happening to you, Ock.
I've been through a lot of changes myself
lately. You have to listen to me.
OCK
(holding Liz)
Who the hell are you?
SPIDER-MAN
Spider-Man.
LIZ
(seeing Spidey)
Spider-Man...
OCK
That's a lot of crap, clown... I am
Spider-Man, not you.
(points to Liz)
Ask you girlfriend.
(to Liz)
Tell him!
SPIDER-MAN
I'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock.
Just like that girl you're holding. Now
let her go.
OCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the
kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories
up.
OCK
Let her go? What an excellent idea. If
you do not deliver your friend, Mr.
Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll
let her go.
LIZ
Put me down, you mechanical mutant!
LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She
twists. She flails around, making things a little worse.
The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP!
PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets!
SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his
characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the
falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short.
LIZ
(falling away)
You jerk!
He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to
a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound.
LIZ
(straightening herself)
Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get
the taxi myself...
OCK
(screams)
Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man...
Prepare to meet your death, bug.
SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK.
SPIDER-MAN
(whispers)
Actually, I'm rather fond of living...
especially now...
(he looks at Liz)
He lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the
cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above
the street.
SPIDER-MAN
(a last appeal to reason)
Octavius. Just stop and think.
OCK
I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking
about exterminating you!
SPIDER-MAN
Okay, if that's the way you want it...
Let's see what those chrome knuckles can
do, Doc...
A WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw.
It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and
rolls over. He rubs his jaw.
LIZ
Great...
SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by
another barrage of blows from above.
OCK
Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown.
OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY
off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on.
But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and
swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER-
ADVERSARIES engage in battle.
With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and
SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY,
they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the
CONSTRUCTION SITE.
OCK
Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one
will be able to stop me.
SPIDER-MAN
Stop you from what...?
OCK
My destiny!
OCK throws his biggest punch yet.
SIRENS can now be heard in the street.
SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes
WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning
circles.
SPIDER-MAN
Over here, Octopus!
OCK
That's Professor Octopus to you Spider
Jerk!
SPIDER-MAN
Give it up, Professor. You'll never
catch me!
OCK takes three steps and soars through the air.
OCK, misjudging the leap, soars right past SPIDEY and into
an alley! Screaming all the way...
OCK and TWO WALDOS pressed against each of the opposing
walls. It's a tenuous grip. Then, very slowly, sparks
flying from his WALDOS, OCK slides down into the alley.
SPIDER-MAN
So long, sucker.
COP CARS pull up. COPS leap from them.
OCK makes it down, sees the COPS, ducks out of sight.
The SEARCHLIGHTS go on. SPIDER-MAN swings back across the
street to the CONSTRUCTION SITE.
COP #1
There he is!
COP #2
It's that Spider-Man!
SPIDEY lands next to LIZ in a pose. Lit by the flashing
BILLBOARD, he's weirder looking than ever. SPIDEY puts an
arm around LIZ and extends a WEB SHOOTER.
LIZ
What do you think you're doing?
SPIDER-MAN
I'm rescuing you.
With that SPIDEY leaps way out and he and LIZ swoop away
on a WEB-STRAND.
LIZ
Thanks but nooooooooooo!
ALL WEAPONS point upward at SPIDEY'S movement.
COP #2
He won't get away this time!
COP #1
Hold your fire! He's got a girl.
COP #2
Looks like he's got a hostage.
SPIDEY sees the WEAPONS aimed upward. He shoots out
another WEB and swings off in a different direction. LIZ
whoops with the G-force.
LIZ
Wait a minute. Where are you taking me?
SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl.
SPIDER-MAN
I better just take you back where you
belong.
He shoots out another WEB.
SPIDER-MAN
Hold on tight.
LIZ
(Times Square)
Where are we?
SPIDER-MAN
Open your eyes.
They are standing on the ROOF of the CENTRAL TOWER of the
EMPIRE UNIVERSITY BUILDING. LIZ opens her eyes. It's an
extraordinary sight.
LIZ
(the Empire State Building)
If you're trying to impress me Spidey, I
want you to know I'm not easy. Okay, I'm
impressed... now put me down, Spidey...
put me down.
SPIDER-MAN
I like the way you say Spidey... Nobody
calls me Spidey... now we go...
They swoop down... and down... stopping on one of the
building's SILLS, actually right in front of a WINDOW in
the DORMITORY BUILDING.
LIZ
(Tavern on the Green)
Wow... look, this is our dormitory. I
can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute...
there's Flash, if I'm not mistaken.
SPIDER-MAN
Liz?
LIZ
You know my name?
SPIDER-MAN
Liz, listen to me. There's something I
have to tell you.
LIZ
Okay, put me down and we can talk,
alright?
SPIDER-MAN
Do you know who I am?
LIZ
All I know is you're the Amazing
Spider-Man... or better you're Spidey the
good guy on the block... you're a weirdo
in a clown spider suit.
SPIDER-MAN
And that's all you know about me?
(a beat, a sigh)
Okay, lets get your boyfriend.
LIZ
Which one?
SPIDER-MAN
How many do you have? I meant Flash.
LIZ
Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend...
SPIDER-MAN
He's not? Then who is?
LIZ
There's someone I like, but he's too shy
to notice.
(Flash appears)
SPIDER-MAN
Flash!
FLASH
Liz!
(a beat)
SPIDER-MAN!!!
LIZ
(to Spider-Man)
You know everybody... Flash we have to
call Peter!
FLASH rushes right past LIZ to the WINDOW. There's a
NEWSPAPER in his hand.
FLASH
Hey, they won't let up, man!
(shows Daily Bugle)
They keep calling you an accomplice in
that burglary murder. But that's a crock,
ain't it? I'm with you, Spidey, 100%
SPIDER-MAN
Thanks.
FLASH
(realizing)
By the way, what are you doing with...
Liz?
SPIDER-MAN
She needed a lift.
FLASH
Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A
lot of beer!
SPIDER-MAN
Thanks, but I have some business to take
care of.
FLASH
Well... take care of that later. Wait
here. I'll get the beer.
He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW
where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES.
LIZ
(accusatory)
How'd you know this was Flash's place?
SPIDER-MAN
Peter Parker told me all about it.
LIZ
Peter told you all about Flash?
SPIDER-MAN
No... he told me all about you. See you
later.
(he jumps away)
SPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT.
PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself
wonderfully.
PETER
(hurrying by)
Kim! Have you seen Harry?
KIM
Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac...
PETER
Yeah... have you seen him today?
KIM
No, un unh.
LIZ
(catching up)
Peter...!
PETER
(keeps walking)
Hi... have you seen Harry?
LIZ
No. What a night, huh?
PETER
(laughs)
Yeah, that was some ride home... must
have been pretty exciting.
LIZ
It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets
to Les Miserables... wanna go?
PETER
Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not
tonight... see you later.
LIZ
(thinking)
Hey, Peter... how did you know about last
night...?
PETER
What about last night?
LIZ
My exciting ride with Spider-Man...
PETER
Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to
find Harry... I'll see you later.
LIZ
Peter!
PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it.
PETER
Hey! Can I get a lift downtown?
FLASH
Take your shoes for a walk, Dork.
FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward
LIZ.
TAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar
WHINE. The "WALK" and "DON'T WALK" signs FLASH at the
same time.
BOY
Make up your mind!
The signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The
BOY looks at the GIRL.
GIRL
What's going on?
An ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS
of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner.
The ARCS of ELECTRICITY continue to rise. The STREET
LIGHTS buckle and bend into weird shapes.
WOMAN
Oh my God!
MAN
Get back! Get back!
TWO TAXIS roar through the intersection and COLLIDE. The
ETHNIC DRIVERS leap out and begin arguing.
A building ROAR rises from the SUBWAY ENTRANCE. Then the
sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE! The BOY looks down the STAIRS
and has to leap out of the way as the BROADWAY EXPRESS
comes highballing up the STEPS and blasts through the
SUBWAY entrance.
The TRAIN sails through the air.
The TRAIN crashes into the building in a storm of
cyclotron generated Dali physics.
The THROB and PULSE recede. SCREAMS, HONKS, SIRENS can be
heard.
A splendidly turned out MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN wakes from her
satin sleep to see that a SUBWAY TRAIN is in the middle of
her BEDROOM. The WALL through which the train has come
sags and ripples like it has melted and partially
resolidified.
WOMAN
Henry!!!
Several PASSENGERS climb out of the WINDOWS of the TRAIN
or pry open the DOORS.
WOMAN
What are you doing here? Get out of here!
Get out of here!
A CROWD has gathered to gawk and point. They look up and
we see their POV.
The MIDDLE CAR of the TRAIN is simply "embedded" in the
HIGH-RISE, its rear sticking out of the building fifteen
stories up. From its COUPLING dangles the LAST CAR.
The CROWD sees something else. Swinging high in the sky
is your friendly neighborhood SPIDER-MAN. The COUPLE and
TWO DRIVERS argue about what this means.
WOMAN
It's Spider-Man!
TRUCK DRIVER #1
Get outa here, you bum!
WOMAN
Hey, what are you talking about?!
TRUCK DRIVER #2
(back at woman)
What's the matter, lady don't you read
the papers?
This is the DRIVER of a DAILY BUGLE truck carrying the
historically famous Bugle headline, "Spider-Man - Threat
or Menace?"
MAN
Go Spidey! Go!
The FIRE TRUCKS arrive and begin assembling a LADDER.
The FIRE LADDER is up. But it is about TEN FEET short of
where it's aimed at. The end of the CAR. A FIREMAN
stands at its apex.
FIREMAN
(into walkie)
Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder!
WALKIE
Negative on that, you're at full
extension!
ROZ is hanging in mid-air on the WEB.
ROZ shouts.
ROZ
(shouting)
There's only one place he can get the
Plutonium SL 270...
SPIDER-MAN
Where...?
ROZ
Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump
would have SL 270.
SPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ
on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in
the doorway, manipulating the WEB.
The FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of
steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With
SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the
street below.
COPS, FIREMEN, PRESS, the works. The CROWD GASPS. CAMERA
STROBES pop as the LAST CAR crashes to the SIDEWALK. We
hold several beats on the incredible rubble.
Then, a WEBBED HAND. SPIDER-MAN groggily pulls himself
from the wreckage.
COP (V.O.)
Put your hands up, Spider-Man.
SPIDER-MAN
You're making a big mistake.
COP
And you're looking at twenty years.
SPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP'S GUN and
leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO... and swings up out of the
frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a
THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet
and falls limp.
COP
What the hell!
SPIDER-MAN swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the
end of a WEB STRAND. After falling ten stories, he is
groggy and weak. He can't think. He can't focus. He can
barely hold onto his WRIST GIZMOS. This bug is spent.
SPIDER-MAN
Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270
Plutonium... must get that crazy old
loony... before he gets to the
Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the
toxic dumps...?
He hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and
thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across
on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely.
SPIDER-MAN swings high above it. This is not the
confident swinger with LIZ in his arms. This is a guy
who's making it by the narrowest of margins. There is a
traffic jam below.
SPIDER-MAN
Got to find Ock... got to find the toxic
dumps.
(grabs his head)
Oh! Oh! Oh... yeah!
He looks down at the traffic. We PAN across the many CARS
until we come to a non-descript GREEN CAR.
OCK runs through HONKING TRAFFIC. SPIDER-MAN leaps from
CAR to CAR.
OCK turns to see SPIDER-MAN leap to a LIMO at the curb.
OCK turns tail and runs down an alley. A FEMALE COP pops
out of a DOORWAY. Her partner, a BIG, YOUNG COP, pulls
his GUN.
FEMALE COP
(gun poised)
Alright! Freeze! Up against the wall
and spread 'em
OCK complies. He raises his hands... and spreads the
WALDOS to full extension! The BIG COP screams and faints.
The little FEMALE COP'S eyes POP. OCK swats the GUN from
her hand. He starts to choke her.
SPIDEY comes swinging to the rescue. He lands on the ROOF
nearby.
SPIDER-MAN
Hey, you big OCK, why don't you pick on
someone your own size?!
OCK
Alright Spider-Bug... here I've come for
you...
OCK leaves the COP and attacks SPIDER-MAN, shooting his
iron fist at him. OCK runs to the end of the alley.
SPIDEY staggers to his feet and resumes the chase.
OCK breaks into a red Corvette convertible, starting it
with a WALDO.
SPIDER-MAN comes out in time to see the Vette drive away.
A CHINESE LAUNDRY TRUCK is passing. SPIDEY THWIPS it and
is whipped away.
He crawls over to the WINDOW.
SPIDER-MAN
Hey, driver. Could you follow that red
Vette for me?
The surprised CHINAMAN lets loose a stream of CHINESE
expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures.
SPIDER-MAN crawls to the top of the TRUCK and surveys the
situation. He sees a sea of moving traffic. He THWIPS up
a WEB and swings away.
SPIDEY swings along from BUILDING to BUILDING. The RED
VETTE is making headway. Suddenly, SPIDER-MAN spots a
blue MG with its top up.
SPIDER-MAN
(swinging)
Flash Thompson... I never thought I'd be
happy to see you.
SPIDEY swoops down on the BLUE MG.
With SPIDEY jammed in between LIZ and FLASH, the MG chases
the VETTE. Since neither OCK nor FLASH is any good at
this, both cars quickly careen into POLES, FENCES, HOT DOG
CARS and begin falling apart.
On RIVERSIDE DRIVE the MG begins to lurch and STEAM. The
VETTE looks eaten away. The GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE
looms ahead.
The VETTE roars through the TOLL BOOTH. They spot OCK
stuck in traffic.
FLASH
Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is
it in that shitty red car...
LIZ
Don't you recognize him... it's Ock!
SPIDER-MAN
New Jersey has the largest toxic waste
dump in the world.
FLASH
What does he want with toxic waste?
SPIDER-MAN
He's looking for Plutonium, my dear...
The car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam.
FLASH
Sorry... can't do anything about this
traffic.
SPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car.
SPIDER-MAN
Try to stay with me. I don't want to
lose him!
Speeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high
above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At
the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The
VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For
a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes
it across.
The VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN.
He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take
the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the
ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It
says, "DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!"
SPIDER-MAN
Bingo.
OCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO.
SPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO
snaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror.
With a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as
SUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses
SPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes
SPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing.
OCK'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN'S neck as the
WEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES
narrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING
SIGN. OCK tears off the CAP and then hurls the groggy
SPIDEY down the WELL.
OCK
Goodbye, Spider-Man!
The BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his
two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself...
Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder.
OCK
Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones...
for the last time.
OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back
seat of the CAR.
LIZ
(still ministering)
What do we do now?
FLASH
We kiss the world goodbye. If he is
right, all there is left to do is...
LIZ
Wait... I think I can release my right
hand...
Professor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ
and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS.
HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school
grounds.
HARRY
I think I can get some help... I can
teach anyone how to work a code in five
minutes.
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
Then do it!
The EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of
the CONJUNCTION.
HARRY and FLASH and LIZ and KIM, (the EARTH is SHAKING)
come out running from the building beneath an enormous
HANGING MOON. They are frightened.
Suddenly it all stops. It's quiet, the kids look at the
sky.
LIZ
Look at the moon... I have never seen it
so big.
FLASH
What is that...
HARRY
Must be the sun.
We now see the sky. With the sun on one side, and the
moon on the other. They watch it, shocked, frightened out
of their wits.
Suddenly from OCK'S basement lab a BLUE BEAM of LIGHT
breaks through. A WHINE starts, it moves magically out of
the WINDOW and PANS around a sleepy NEW YORK which doesn't
know that the end is upon it. The dreaded WHINE builds
throughout! People stop in their tracks, look up to the
strange looking skyline. Camera comes down to a street
where ROZ is DRIVING SPIDER-MAN fast toward the
UNIVERSITY.
We PAN down from the MOON to a STREET full of SIRENS and
SHADOWY FIGURES running in the night. LIZ and KIM and
HARRY come nearer. A very WEIRD light is emanating from
the CENTER.
LIZ
He's in there. I know Peter is in there.
She breaks into a run.
FLASH
Liz, don't... Liz come back... come back!
LIZ runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF
ELECTRICITY flashes across the doorway, stopping them.
The CONJUNCTION is now happening.
INSERT: Surreal DIALS spin madly.
The FULL MOON hangs over the building. FLASH and HARRY
and KIM stand at the entrance to the CENTER.
FLASH starts to run to the building.
FLASH
(screaming)
Liz! Liz come on out!
They run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the
building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall
of STONE and DIRT, six feet high.
HARRY
Get back! Flash... get back!
FLASH
Wow...!
Then the building lurches upward again! This time it
pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER
LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK.
FLASH, KIM and HARRY look on as heavy ELECTRICAL CABLES
stretch upward to the rising CENTER and then snap in
showers of sparks. As they fall away the CENTER becomes
airborne. The CABLES wave up at it, shooting arcs of
ELECTRICITY directly at the building.
People look up at the SCIENCE CENTER. A CYCLIST, riding
and looking, crashes into a TAXI. MAX REISS leaps out
with the BEAUTIFUL STARLET from the TAXI.
MAX
That's some show... if ever I saw one.
A very long shot of the SCIENCE CENTER rising into the
CLOUDS.
The PLANETS are virtually in line!
SPIDER-MAN falls through the air. He shoots up a WEB and
THWIPS, it sticks to the ROCKY bottom of the FOUNDATION.
OCK appears in the HOLE. He sees SPIDEY'S dilemma,
hanging on a thread of WEB. A half-broken WALDO snakes
down and CLIPS the WEB.
But the WEB sticks to the WALDO! OCK shakes it, but he
can't get loose. SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the
ROCK BOTTOM and, with the leverage, he pulls OCK out.
OCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the
ROCK upside down. He holds on fiercely.
OCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins
looking for an entry. SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail.
The building pitches sideways! OCK turns to face SPIDER-
MAN, his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE.
SPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off,
brandishing it like a broad sword.
SPIDER-MAN
Let's have it, old boy!
A bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way
and that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold,
from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET.
Now the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL
upside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes
flying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life!
SPIDER-MAN
Liz!!
OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the
head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now
lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY
ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE.
SPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of
SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE.
SPIDER-MAN
Come on.
LIZ
Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere.
SPIDER-MAN
(pulling her ahead)
He's around, don't worry... we'll find
him.
The BIG BEAMS start cutting out one by one. The CENTER
begins to PITCH and YAW. The CHOPPERS are getting closer.
Against the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of
HELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE
CRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER
begins to drop in PULSING SURGES.
It rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the
cavalry.
They burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building.
New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by
their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the
falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS
look across at each other, helpless.
It drops like a stone.
SPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding
along the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL.
SPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then
disappears over the edge. LIZ screams!
LIZ fights to her feet and grabs onto the WEB STAND. She
pulls on it with all her strength. She pulls and pulls
and pulls. We see the WEB running up between the ROCKS.
She gives one last pull and comes up with an EMPTY WEB
END.
A long, long beat.
PETER (V.O.)
Liz, Up here!
LIZ looks up and sees PETER hanging out the WINDOW two
stories above her. He throws out a ROPE LADDER. LIZ
grabs it. She begins to climb.
LIZ is already down the ROPE LADDER and is holding it for
PETER. He comes down with a HUGE bundle of RED, WHITE &
BLUE.
PETER
Okay, stand still.
He ties some ROPE around her waist.
LIZ
Is this going to work?
PETER
How do I know?
LIZ
I just adore confidence in a man.
PETER
Come on...
They move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL
PARK is still a couple thousand feet down.
LIZ
What is it you say when you jump?
PETER
Your prayers.
They SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them
to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They
reach out for each other but their hands don't quite
reach.
Slowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks
between them.
It spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And
then it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of
debris shoots upward.
There is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down
into the frame lit by its wonderful light.
The AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute.
They hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below.
They begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The
wind billows LIZ'S skirt and plays with PETER'S hair, and
snaps in the AMERICAN FLAG.
LIZ
We have a lot to thank your friend
Spider-Man for.
PETER
Somehow, I don't think we've seen the
last of him.
LIZ
Peter...! Finders, keepers...
PETER
What...? What is it? Why do you look
like that?
LIZ
I think I'm in love.
PETER
(even his eyes blush)
You are...
LIZ
With your friend...
PETER
Spider-Man? You're in love with
Spider-Man?
LIZ
I am... you think we'll see him again?
PETER
We might... you never know.
He kisses her.
LIZ
Oh.
(bittersweet)
This may be the end of a beautiful
friendship you know?
PETER
Nah.
They land in the center of the park under the parachute.
They stay there and kiss... completely covered by the
flag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.
THE END
