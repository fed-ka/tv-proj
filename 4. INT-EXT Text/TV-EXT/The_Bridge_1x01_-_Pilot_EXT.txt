      Steel and concrete vein connecting El Paso, Texas and Ciudad
      Juarez, Mexico.  The Rio Grande little more than a boxed in,
      trash strewn trickle on this moonless Bordertown night. 
      Past the gleaming lights of the two cities severed by the
      border wall lies a vast and unforgiving desert hiding secrets
      best left buried...  

      Tonight the CAMERA FINDS a black ESCALADE creeping across
      the bridge as WE PUSH IN. 


      One by one the lights suddenly go out, PLUNGING the bridge
      into DARKNESS, save the sweep of a few motorists' headlights.


      QUICK HANDHELD SHOTS of our Driver pulling something from
      the trunk of the car, dragging it into the road.

      TIGHT ON his watch as he checks the time and then ducks away
      from the headlights of a car crossing on the other side of
      the bridge...  He scurries back to his car and takes off.


      OVERHEAD SHOT of a WOMAN'S BODY resting smack in the middle
      of the bridge.  She's white, blond.  Her dead eyes stare up
      at the stars smeared in the sky... as we SMASH TO THE

      MAIN TITLES: THE BRIDGE.

                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                        3.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      TIGHT ON a SHADOWY FIGURE watching the flashing lights of
      approaching police cars streaming onto the bridge from both
      the US and Mexican side of the border.  This is STEVEN LINDER,
      30's, white, a wolf of a man dressed in a too tight leather
      jacket, no stranger to the dark and jumbled chaos of Juarez. 
      He takes a drag on his cigarette.  He's been waiting for
      this night a long time.  And now here it is, moonless, alive
      with possibility... 

      A BEAT as he crushes the half smoked cigarette under his
      boot and then retrieves the stub, pockets it carefully. 
      This is a man who leaves no trace.  He takes one last look
      at the red and white flash of the police cruisers on the
      bridge and turns to a sudden gust of wind blowing in off the
      desert.  It's time...


      Both sides of the bridge are closed to traffic.  In the center
      we see a crush of Crime Techs, Border Patrol Agents and
      uniform officers from both sides of the border.  A car pulls
      up from the Mexican side.  Out steps a man.  This is Mexican
      State Homicide Investigator MARCO RUIZ, (40s) still rubbing
      the sleep from his eyes as he flashes his badge to the
      uniforms and swings under the crime tape.

      Marco finds El Paso homicide detective SONYA NORTH, (30s)
      unkempt hair blowing about her face, leather pants, calf
      boots...

      They meet over the body.  It is literally on the line that
      divides the U.S. and Mexico.  The head on Sonya's side, the
      feet on Marco's.  Sonya eyes Marco --

                                      SONYA
                    Who are you?

      A BEAT as Sonya stares at him.  She's there but not there, a
      distant ship on the horizon, not cold but something else... 
      However tonight she's focused on the body perfectly straddling
      the border.  Marco smiles warmly, fishes in his pocket and
      shows his BADGE, lightly accented English...

                                      MARCO
                    Marco Ruiz, State Police.

                                      SONYA
                    Sonya North, El Paso Homicide.                                                                                        4.

      He puts a hand out to shake but she just looks at him, lets
      him dangle.

                                      MARCO
                    Do you know who she is?

                                      SONYA
                          (nods)
                    She's American.

                                      MARCO
                    Okay.

                                      SONYA
                    Lorraine Cross, the judge.

      The name means nothing to him.  He has his own dead.

      A UNI crosses to Sonya...

                                    UNI
                    There's a gal asking to talk to the
                    cop in charge.

      They spot CHARLOTTE MILLWRIGHT, (40s) wealthy ranch wife --
      with the hair, clothes, all that --  straining against several
      officers.  Sonya stays on point with Marco --

                                      SONYA
                    She's American, the car came from El
                    Paso.  It's ours.

      Marco gestures -- it's all yours.  

      Sonya crosses to Charlotte who's frantic behind the crime
      scene tape.  Sonya fixes her with that faraway stare a beat... 

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Detective Sonya North.  You have
                      information?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                      Information?

                                      SONYA
                    On the crime.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                          (confused)
                    No.  We need to cross the bridge...

                                      SONYA
                    You'll have to wait.                                                                                        5.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    We can't wait, my husband's having a
                    heart attack... 

      She points to an AMBULANCE from Mexico, stopped on the Mexican
      side of the bridge --

                                      SONYA
                    This is a crime scene.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    We're American.  We need a hospital --

                                      SONYA
                    The bridge is closed.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    I can pay you.
                          (then)
                    To let us cross.

      She fishes out her fancy wallet from her fancy purse.  Sonya
      is blank.  Charlotte offers a clutch of BILLS --

                                      SONYA
                    No one crosses.

      Sonya turns her back on the woman, walks past Marco who has
      been watching all this with interest.  As Sonya returns to
      the body, Charlotte looks at Marco, eyes pleading...

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Please.  

                                      MARCO
                    Why were you in Mexico?  Don't you
                    know the danger?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    We were looking at some horses...

      Her tears take her over.  Marco watches as Charlotte runs
      back to the ambulance.  He waits a beat, ducks back under
      the crime scene tape and follows her, sees her get in the
      back with her unconscious husband, KARL (60s)...

      Marco crosses to the PARAMEDIC behind the wheel, motions for
      him to roll the window down... 

                                      MARCO
                     Qu  tiene?

                                      PARAMEDIC
                          (points to his heart)
                    El corazon...                                                                                        6.

                                      MARCO
                     Es muy grave?

      Off the Paramedic's nod, we CUT BACK TO:

      CENTER OF BRIDGE.  Sonya stands over the body, questioning
      SAMUELS, a BORDER AGENT who was on duty when the killer's
      Escalade crossed --

                                      SONYA
                    What kind of car?  

                                      SAMUELS
                    Don't know.

                                      SONYA
                    It's your job to know.

                                      SAMUELS
                    Our job is border security and
                      interdiction, not dead bodies, Ma'am. 

                                      SONYA
                    The car would have crossed over into
                    Juarez.

                                      SAMUELS
                    That makes it Mexico's problem.  

      Before she can continue the Ambulance starts moving, drives
      slowly past the body and crosses over into America --

                                      SONYA
                    Stop! 

      She chases after the ambulance, but it's too late.  She grabs
      one of the Unis who have just allowed the ambulance to pass.

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Who authorized that?

      Marco steps out of the crowd, faces a furious Sonya...

                                      MARCO
                    I did.  

                                      SONYA
                    You compromised my scene.

                                      MARCO
                    Her husband's very sick.

                                      SONYA
                    What's your name again?                                                                                        7.

                                      MARCO
                    Marco Ruiz.

                                      SONYA
                    Badge number?  

                                      MARCO
                    He needed a hospital.

                                      SONYA
                    There are hospitals in Mexico.

                                      MARCO
                    You ever been to one in Juarez?

                                      SONYA
                    Why does that matter?

                                      MARCO
                    Here.

      He holds his badge out for her to inspect again.  She takes
      down the number --

                                      SONYA
                    My body.  My scene.  You had no right.

                                      MARCO
                    I don't need your body.
                          (off look)
                    Just this morning I got nine heads
                    in the parking lot of City Hall...

                                      SONYA
                    Why tell me that?

                                      MARCO
                    We have our own dead.

      She studies him a beat.  Then:

                                      SONYA
                    How do you let that happen?  

      Judgmental, yes.  Like most other El Paso law enforcement,
      she thinks very little of the Mexican cops.  But her tone is
        matter-of-fact... she really doesn't understand.  

      Sonya moves off to the body again.  Marco shakes off the
      remark, crosses to his car where several other Juarez police
      officers stand waiting on his word.

                                      MARCO
                    Americans are taking it.  I'm going
                    back to sleep.                                                                                        8.

      As they disperse --


      CAMERA PANS across a dark mountainside where we can just
      make out the words "LEA LA BIBLIA - ES LA VERDAD" painted in
      massive white print as we...


      SWOOP into the city, past blocks of squat bunker-like houses
      behind high concrete walls topped with razor wire.  The walls
      of course tagged with petty street gang poetry.  A pack of
      wild dogs roam looking for trash, pause under a BRIGHT PINK
      CROSS standing in an abandoned lot, plastic flowers crucified
      over the name of one of the lost girls of Juarez as we...


      What passes for a nice neighborhood in Juarez, gaudy narco
      tecture houses with their golden domes, iron gates --
      monuments to the spoils of the drug war.

      CAMERA FINDS Linder as he crosses down a street filled with
      SUV'S parked outside night club.  The door opens briefly to
      reveal a few drunken SICARIOS (narco soldiers) parting to
      make way for EVA, (20s) a hot mess all jeweled and tarted
      up, the girlfriend of a narco.  Her two girlfriends follow
      her out.

      AS THE DOOR to the club opens we glimpse a BOY in a RED and
      BLACK SHIRT -- 18, a baby face, somehow different than the
      jaded narcos and clubbers he's hanging with.  The girls shut
      the door and he's gone, but remember him.

      And linger outside the club.  At first girl's chatter looks
      light, but with a closer look -- Eva is wiping tears.  As
      her make-up washes away, we also see BRUISES on her face.

      Linder presses himself into the shadows, watching Eva.  She
      kisses her friends goodbye, then slips away into the night...


      Linder follows her down an alley.  She hears his footsteps;
      turns and sees him.  He approaches, holding out a bandana. 
      In Spanish:

                                      LINDER
                    For your tears.

      Eva is frozen as he hands her the bandana.  She looks at it
      like it's some kind of signal... which it is.                                                                                           9.

                                    EVA
                    Are you the one... ?

      She starts to shake.

                                      LINDER
                    Yes.  I am the one.  Now come.  

      She stiffens as he grabs her elbow, leading her...

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    Where is your car?

      A beat as she points to a Honda parked on an empty side
      street.  He pushes her across to the car.

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    The keys.

      She fishes in her purse, hands him the keys.  Instead of
      opening the door, he pops the trunk.

                                    EVA
                    No.

                                      LINDER
                    Si.

      Eva hesitates, looks around.  The street is totally fucking
      empty, the din of the club faraway and faint...

                                    EVA
                    Por favor...

      She looks around -- she's gonna run.  Before she can, he
      GRABS HER and throws her in the trunk of the car.  Stifles
      her cry.  Takes her purse and then presses his face close to
      hers and puts a finger to his lips --

                                      LINDER
                    Shhh....

      He SLAMS THE TRUNK shut as we...


      It's just Sonya now with the dead woman.  She kneels,
      finishing up her notes.  She motions to MORGUE ATTENDANTS --

                                      SONYA
                    I'm done.

      Two Morgue Attendants close in.  One grabs the shoulders,
      the other the feet...                                                                                        10.

      Sonya pulls out her cellphone to call her Lieutenant when
      she hears the morgue attendants react...

                                      MORGUE ATTENDANT
                    Shit... 

      She turns in time to see the dead woman's body CLEAVE IN
      TWO, perfectly vivisected.  She strides over and stares at
      the two halves -- what the fuck is going on?


      Nice neighborhood in the foothills of the Franklin mountains.
      The CAMERA PUSHES PAST a child's bike abandoned in the front
      yard to find a light in the living room as we PRELAP MIKE
      CROSS'S VOICE:

                                    MIKE
                          (prelap)
                    She was on her way to a conference
                    in Austin...


      Marco pulls through the gate in his crappy Taurus.  Pauses
      to make sure the gate shuts behind him.  He looks up at his
      house, sees a light on the basement, frowns...


      We see Linder driving across the bridge in Eva's Honda. 
      Faint WHIMPERS from the trunk.  He passes under a sign
      welcoming him to the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  There's barely
      any traffic at this hour and only two inspection lanes are
      open.  He chooses one, pulls to the gate arm only to have a
      BORDER AGENT wave him up for a little chat. 

      That's when he notices Eva's PURSE on the seat next to him
      and quickly shoves it under the seat, masking his movement
      by turning the radio up.

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    Passport?

      Linder reaches into his pocket, hands him the passport.  

                                      BORDER AGENT (CONT'D)
                    How long were you in Mexico?

                                      LINDER
                    Three hours.

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    What did you bring back from Mexico?

                                      LINDER
                    Just a smile, officer...

      The guy looks at him.  Stops with the rote questioning --

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    What were ya doin' in Juarez?

                                      LINDER
                    Seeing a friend.

      The Border Agent smells bullshit --

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    I got a friend in Juarez.  Haven't
                    visited him in six years.  Not worth
                    the risk...

      Linder looks at him, sheepish.  Confiding --

                                      LINDER
                    Okay.  I went over for the Senoritas.                                                                                        21.

      The Border Agent gives him a conspiratorial smile -- the man
      had a need.

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    Anything good?

                                      LINDER
                      Definetely worth the visit.

      The agent grins, hands the passport back...

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    Have a good night.

      He signals Linder through into America with his secret cargo,
      radio masking her trapped whimpers as we...


      Marco exiting his car, gingerly, enters the building...


      Marco pulls up to a massive, gaudy house, domed roof, ornate
      stone work, polished gold lions, crossed guns over bandoliers,
      and the visage of Jesus Malverde adorn the high brick wall
      surrounding the property.  Behind the walls we can see and
      hear a party going full tilt, the rhythmic oompah pa of a
      narcorrido reverberating. 

      All along the street are pimped out SUV's with bullet proof 
      glass, rims, BODYGUARD & DRIVERS sit waiting in the vehicles.

      Marco pulls up and exits his car (a tin can compared to all
      the vehicles around him).  He crosses to one of the SUV's
      and knocks.  The window rolls down to reveal HUGO (30s) an
      off duty cop.  A flash of disappointment in Marco's eyes -- 

      THE FOLLOWING IN SPANISH, SUBTITLED...

                                      MARCO
                    You too, Hugo?

      Hugo's thrown, then defensive --

                                    HUGO
                    You come here to judge?                                                                                        26.

                                      MARCO
                    I need to see the Captain.

                                    HUGO
                    He's not here.

                                      MARCO
                    I need to see him, so pick up that
                    radio. 

      A beat as Hugo grabs a two-way off the seat, says something
      we can't hear.

      A second later the large wrought iron gate rolls open.  Hugo,
      trying to explain himself as Marco heads into the house --

                                    HUGO
                    Natalie's pregnant again. 

                                      MARCO
                    Mm hm.

                                    HUGO
                    We need the money...

      Marco just keeps going --


      Marco enters a courtyard strung with paper lanterns, littered
      with party goers, some paired off with senoritas in skimpy
      dresses and stripper heels, others sitting and watching
      Narcoriddo band sing the glories of a bloody showdown through
      the dope and cigar smoke.  We see flashes of gang tattoos,
      gaudy jewelry, a nickel plated nine dangling from a holsters
      under five thousand dollar suits.

      On either side of the courtyard stand two large cages.  Inside
      one cage is a motherfucking LION and in the other a PANTHER. 

      The men all stop to note Marco's entrance, making him
      instantly for a cop.  Marco gives it right back.

      As he passes the caged panther he stops to watch a drunk
      narco SOLDIER blow dope smoke into the cage.  The panther
      hisses, backs into the corner of the cage.  If not for the
      bars...

                                      MARCO
                          (Spanish)
                    You're making a dangerous enemy.

      The SOLDIER eye fucks Marco, lifts his guayabera to reveal a
      gun.  Marco holds his gaze and then pushes past into the
      house.                                                                                        27.


      Past the sprawl of El Paso into the hard pan desert of the
      foothills we see a car snaking up a washed out road,
      headlights illuminating jack rabbits, moths, the occasional
      trailer surrounded by broken down trucks and cars.

      It's the Honda.  Linder driving.  He stops at a metal bar
      gate.  Exits the car, unlocks the gate.  Looks around and
      gets back in the car.

      The road snakes behind a mesa and in the sweep of the
      headlight beam stands a small white TRAILER.

      He pulls to the trailer, parks and opens the trunk to reveal
      Eva freaked the fuck out.  She jumps out and starts to run. 
      Linder quietly reaches in and KILLS THE HEADLIGHTS plunging
      the place into darkness.  Instead of chasing after he simply
      watches her stumbling over rocks, falling...                                                                                        31.

                                      LINDER
                    Watch for rattle snakes.  They come
                    out at night.

      She falls and doesn't rise...

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    Scream if you have to.  There's nobody
                    for miles.

                                    EVA
                      Ayudame...

      She crumples to the ground, crying.  He goes to her.  Slings
      her over his shoulder and crosses to the trailer, opens it
      and flicks a light on...


      A town car drives Charlotte through the gates of her sprawling
      ranch, down a drive lined with live oaks, the fields green
      and full of shimmering quarter horses...                                                                                           40.


      Charlotte looks out the window as the car continues up to
      the main house, a testament to old Texas money and the rewards
      of being a gentleman rancher.

      The car stops.  Charlotte alights, and sees CESAR (50s) the
      ranch caretaker and her late husband's right hand man waiting
      for her.

      He removes his hat, pokes a tear from his cheek --

                                      CESAR
                    I heard about Senor Karl...

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Have you told the rest of the staff?

      Cesar nods.

                                      CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                    Good.  I don't want to be disturbed.

                                      CESAR
                    Si.

      Charlotte grabs the plastic bag of her husband's clothes and
      enters the house...


      A highway cuts across the parched Texas scrub land, the sky
      an impossible lonesome cowboy blue as the CAMERA FINDS a
      truck barreling down the road...


      Long desolate strip of the Texas interstate.  A SHERIFF'S
      CRUISER parked in front of a silver BMW on the side of the
      road.  

      Sonya's truck approaches, pulls over; Sonya and Marco alight. 
      Clock the BMW.  The driver's side is open.

      A Sheriff's Deputy, MANNY STOKES, 30s, with braces on his
      teeth, tips his hat.  To Sonya --

                                      STOKES
                    Ma'am, you may not want to look.  

      Sonya badges him, moves to the car with Marco.

      PULL TO REVEAL the bloodless and severed legs of JUDGE CROSS,
      still in heels, in the driver's seat.  Marco notes some
      surgical tubing leading from the body out the car to a small
      lake of blood soaking into the dry earth. 

                                      MARCO
                    We dealing with a doctor?

                                      SONYA
                    Where's her purse?

                                      STOKES
                    Passenger seat.  Everything's there. 
                    Cash, credit cards, what have you...

      Sonya gloves up, goes to the passenger side.  Rifles through
      the purse.  Opens the wallet.  An EMPTY SPACE where the
      judge's ID would be.

                                      SONYA
                    Did you pull her ID?

                                      STOKES
                    No ma'am.                                                                                        44.

                                      SONYA
                    Then it's missing.

                                      MARCO
                    Maybe that's his trophy.

                                      SONYA
                    Did Cristina have her ID?

                                      MARCO
                    I don't remember.  

                                      SONYA
                    Her mother would know.  We'll go to
                    Juarez, ask her.

      Marco laughs.  Gives her a look up and down; the pants, boots --

                                      MARCO
                    You gonna wear a hoodie?

                                      SONYA
                    Why?

                                      MARCO
                    Tie back your hair?  'Cause you can't
                    go to Juarez looking like that.
                          (then)
                    It's not a good place.  Not anymore.

      Some sadness about that.  Sonya looks back at the body; then --

                                      SONYA
                    You want to write the scene?

                                      MARCO
                    Go ahead.

      But, he notes the generosity.  For the first time from her. 
      She pulls out a pad and pen, kneels next to the pool of blood --

                                                                                FADE OUT:

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                        45.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Charlotte ENTERS the barn to find Cesar stacking feed bags
      next to the grain bin.  He straightens when he sees Charlotte
      standing there.

                                      CESAR
                    Nobody has bothered you, have they?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    No.

      She holds out her husband's cell phone.

                                      CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                    This was in Karl's pocket.  Have you
                    seen it before?

      Cesar shakes his head slowly -- not sure what the hell she's
      up to.

                                      CESAR
                    No.  Why?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    A woman called for Karl.
                          (off look)
                    He's gone, Cesar.  You answer to me
                    now.                                                                                        49.

                                      CESAR
                    Si.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Who is she?

                                      CESAR
                    I don't know.

      Charlotte flinches, but doesn't want to give Cesar the
        satisfaction of seeing her vulnerable.  She pulls out the
      KEY she found hidden in Karl's wallet.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    What about this?
                          (off look)
                    I found it in his wallet.

                                      CESAR
                    Miss Charlotte, I don't know...

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    You're lying to me, Cesar.  What is
                    it?

      Cesar holds her gaze a long beat, realizes she's the boss.

                                      CESAR
                    It's better I show you.  Come.

      Off Charlotte as we...


      Fuller crosses the lot and finds his car.  He clicks the
      remote as we...                                                                                        52.


      Charlotte follows Cesar up to the door of the cabin.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    I don't understand.  Is this what
                    the key's for?  

                                      CESAR
                    Please, I show you.

      Charlotte watches as Cesar pulls a ring of keys from his
      jacket, finds the key and opens a door.

      He motions her inside...


      TIGHT ON a BOMB SQUAD TECH pulling on the heavy bomb suit. 
      We pull back to reveal uniform officers pushing back traffic
      and onlookers.

      WE FOLLOW the Bomb Tech as he joins several other men in the
      bulky suits walking with their bomb gear to Daniel Fuller's
      car.

      Sonya pulls up in the Truck and is brought to a halt by a
      phalanx of police and bomb squad support members.

                                      OFFICER
                    Fall back behind the perimeter!

      Sonya and Marco exit the car and badge one of the Bomb Techs.

                                      SONYA
                    Detective North...

                                    BOMB TECH
                    You're gonna have to vacate the area.

                                      MARCO
                    What's going on?

                                    BOMB TECH
                    There's a car rigged with a bomb in
                    that lot.

                                      SONYA
                    A black Escalade?

                                    BOMB TECH
                      Affirmative.  Now fall back please --

                                      SONYA
                    -- It belongs to Daniel Fuller. 
                    He's wanted in connection with a
                    double homicide.

                                    BOMB TECH
                    Well ma'am, he's the one called it
                    in.  He's trapped in there.
                          (then)
                    And he's gonna be scattered all over
                    this block if you don't let us assess
                    the situation and do our jobs.                                                                                        55.

      Sonya watches the Bomb Tech cross the barricade, frustrated --


      A block outside the parking lot sit Sonya and Marco just
      outside the police tape, waiting, helpless... 

                                      MARCO
                    Call him again.
                          (off look)
                    Fuller, call him.

      Off Sonya with her cell...


      Sonya on the phone as Marco watches...

                                      SONYA
                    Were you on the Bridge of the Americas
                    last night?

                                      FULLER
                    What?

                                      SONYA
                    Were you on the bridge?  Yes or no?

                                      FULLER
                          (losing his shit)
                    No -- I was here all night.  How is
                    this going to get me out?

                                      SONYA
                    Do you know Judge Cross?

                                      FULLER
                    What?

                                      SONYA
                    Judge Lorraine Cross.

                                      FULLER
                    Just -- from her cases.

                                      SONYA
                    What cases?

      BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...

                                      FULLER
                    Oh god...

                                      SONYA
                    How about Cristina Fuentes?

      Fuller, despairing --                                                                                        57.

                                      FULLER
                    I am fucked.  So fucked...

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel!  This is important.

                                      FULLER
                      Important?  I'm going to die!

                                      SONYA
                    Have you written about Judge Cross?

                                      FULLER
                    I don't remember.  Maybe...

                                      SONYA
                    When?

                                      FULLER
                    Oh god.  I'm such an asshole.  I've
                    fucked everything up...

      One of the Bomb Techs reaches through the hole in the
      windshield -- but he can't quite reach the bomb.  Daniel
      sees the guys exchanging worried expressions --

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel listen to me.

      He looks back at the timer as it reaches 3 MINUTES and then
      it fucking skips a minute -- HE'S GOT TWO MINUTES LEFT.

                                      FULLER
                    It skipped a minute!  It skipped a
                    fucking minute!

      Bomb Tech #2 looks inside, confirms that the timer has indeed
      slipped below two minutes.  


      And then something happens: One by one the Bomb Techs trade
      looks and step away from the car, signaling that they have
      precious little time to make it to safety.

                                    BOMB TECH #1
                    Fall back...

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel.

      The men retreat, leaving Fuller to the last minutes of his
      life...                                                                                        58.

                                      FULLER
                    No.  Come back!  Where are you going?

      He pounds on the window as the men fall back and he's left
      with the steady BEEP of the timer...

      One of the Bomb Techs turns and raises his hands up in a
      futile gesture, sorry...


      ON MARCO and SONYA.  Marco sees the first of the bomb techs
      retreating.  He motions to Sonya...

                                      MARCO
                    That's enough.  Let him die in peace.  

                                      SONYA
                    He needs to focus.

                                      MARCO
                    He's sitting on a bomb.  They can't
                    help him.

                                      SONYA
                    So he'll tell me the truth.

      Now Daniel hears the flat calm of Sonya's voice...

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Daniel, you must talk to me.


      Bomb Tech #1 approaches Sonya and Martin and hands them the
      CD in a clear evidence bag...

                                    BOMB TECH #1
                    It's clean.                                                                                        60.

      Sonya examines the CD.  She and Marco get inside the Truck.
