As Matt walks from the outdoor parking lot, past inexpensive
homes. In the lot, on private lawns and every public bench,
at each street corner, are various actors doing the relaxation
exercises which will form the basis of A DANCE, as they go
over their "sides".
MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR
...feathers I'm blowing. What am I,
a duck?
We pass various actors going over alternate sentences for
the same speech so that we get a sense of the speech as a
whole from the sum of its parts.
VARIOUS YOUNG ACTORS
1) I'm not thinking about whether
I'm going to shoot you. I'm...
2)...trying to decide where.
3)...the little spot behind the ear
where you die before you hear the
shot...
4)...on the left side of the belly
which is a very mean place.
An office building of clear architectural merit located in
an industrial area. Even the sign "Popcorn Pictures" has all
the artistic dignity the name itself lacks... MUSIC ENTERS...
Gradually, movement BECOMES CHOREOGRAPHED...i.e., the young
actor and actress running across the street do so with
uncommon grace. The area Matt passes is very crowded and we
still haven't reached the most congested area of all as we
STUDY FACES and HEAR snatches of the actors' preparation.
MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR
What am I, a duck?
OLDER ACTRESS
Sure I'll tell you... Favor first...
Do a nice middle-aged lady a favor...
A fair trade... tell you what you
want to know in return for a...
(grimaces over dialogue
she must say)
...a pity fu...
MUSIC BECOMING MORE INSISTENT as we approach the building--
the mumbling of the actors taking on the SOUND of a Wailing
Wall...
VARIOUS YOUNG HYSTERICAL ACTRESSES
...the height of ego. You think your
he-manness can make me get on that
elevator even though I'm phobic?...
I CAN'T GET ON THAT ELEVATOR. I don't
care if... they catch us. DO YOU
GET... IT. DO YOU GET IT! I CAN'T! I
CAN'T... three, please.
THREE HYSTERICAL ACTRESSES
SINGING the dialogue...
SINGING ACTRESSES
...can't get on the elevator... can't
get on the elevator... even if you
make me... even if you make me. Do
you get it?... do you get it?...
TWO ACTRESSES
Standing near each other--exchange glares as they break each
other's concentration and move apart... THEIR MOVEMENT SERVING
as our gateway to DANCING... The SONG "MAKE BELIEVE" enters
fully now and builds in intensity, reaching a repeated phrase,
as we move to Matt and he enters the building, thereby cutting
off the song.
ON MATT
As the SONG continues in intensity, Matt enters the building
at the end of a repeated phrase cutting off the song as we
move to:
ANGLE ON RECEPTION AREA
Where CATHY BRESLOW, age 30, waits. Hollywood is a bit of an
uphill struggle for Cathy. She is bright where others are
brilliant, pretty where others are gorgeous, enormously hard
working where others are obsessive-compulsive. She is clearly
waiting for someone while reading an enormously thick book
galley. Matt almost scoots by her, then stops.
MATT
Hi... See, I did recognize you. You
didn't have to wait for me.
CATHY
Well, I wanted to introduce you. As
if knowing me would help.
Matt drives his faded, seven-year-old car into view.
He looks off... sees something that arrests his interest and
pulls to the curb. It's a curious sight.
MATT'S POV
Burke Adler, standing at a street corner, palpably in pain.
He's trying to rein in his emotions, sucking in huge gulps
of air... and, then, a wave of emotion gets the better of
him as he looks at his watch. A sob escapes him--shocked
that he's so close to tears on a public street corner, he
battles for control... another sob as he looks to the heavens.
ON MATT
A split second to consider, then he's out of his car.
FULL SHOT - THE STREET CORNER
A flow of PEOPLE--in the foreground, the tortured figure of
Burke Adler--in the background, Matt Hobbs, pauses before
intruding. But Burke's spectacle is growing more public,
sounds of anguish escape him.
CLOSER SHOT - BURKE
BURKE
Oh, God... why? Why?...
(louder)
What am I going to do?
And now he begins to dissassemble, openly crying--on the
verge of a complete breakdown. Matt moves into frame, grabbing
Burke, trying to provide him with an anchor.
CLOSE ON MATT
His face--his eyes providing a beacon of strength.
MATT
Hey. Hey! HEY!!
ON BURKE
Totally fucked-up, wild-eyed. As he witnesses his own state.
BURKE
Look at me. You'd think I was a
writer.
(his story of travail
pours from him)
I hired this kid as a production
assistant. His father's a business
manager... a few good clients.
MATT
What happened?
BURKE
He's been driving for me two weeks...
all he has to do is pick me up on
time... he's twenty minutes late and
I have a test screening in the valley.
Everybody's gone from the office.
Burke flails at himself as Matt looks at him.
MATT
Is that it? You need a lift?
BURKE
Yeah.
MATT
I'm right over here.
Matt starts to lead him back, then realizes he's alone, Burke
having seen his car finally arrive.
MATT'S POV
Burke, berating the YOUNG DRIVER. Matt pauses, awed by the
wild gesticulating--the few screamed words...
BURKE (O.S.)
...Not just today... believe me,
there's no way you'll ever make it...
You are going to fail. Listen, listen--
I know about this; you are going to
be a failure.
CAMERA FOLLOWING MATT
As he joins Burke and the young man, Burke turns to Matt.
BURKE
(to Matt)
Let's get moving; you said you'd
give me a lift.
MATT
What the hell are you talking about?
Not in your car... I've got my own.
BURKE
I'll give you a hundred and twenty
dollars to take me... and it will
still be a favor.
(to Young Man)
Get out. Come on.
(to Matt)
Please. This is very important.
The driver gets out.
YOUNG MAN
(final plea)
A guy got shot on the freeway...
Traffic's tied up.
BURKE
You should leave time for that kind
of thing.
CUT TO:
The sun setting on a nondescript slab of California.
Burke's car moves toward the movie complex.
BURKE'S POV
Our first view of NAN MULHANNEY; middle-aged and pragmatic,
yet extraordinarily naive. She's a scientist of sorts--
monitoring the tastes and feelings of Americans, first in
Washington and now here. Though she just had a very rough
hour or so, she bends down to smile at Burke.
NAN
We're 34 minutes late. The studio is
appropriately wild... people are
beginning to leave... but I knew how
upset you'd be if we started without
you.
BURKE
(distantly)
Yeah. Thanks.
But he pays her no mind as MUSIC CONTINUES and he moves
towards the line. Nan approaches the car.
NAN
How is he tonight?
MATT
I don't know him, so I have nothing
to compare it to.
NAN
Well, how would you say he is, anyway?
MATT
Not quite himself.
ANGLE ON BURKE
As he approaches the line, he BEGINS TO SING his love to
them, "I'll Do Anything." As he pours out his misdirected
heart to individuals on the line who DO NOT HEAR HIM.
ANGLE ON LINE
Their impatience gives rise to a VERY SLOW TAP DANCE, each
couple or cluster doing it differently--barely exaggerating
the normal shifting of a line... As BURKE CONTINUES TO SING...
the song builds as does the dance... Burke sings even more
passionately, his D-PEOPLE perhaps joining in as BACKGROUND
SINGERS. At a key point, the disparate groups turn and form
a SOLID UNIFIED LINE. They begin the rhythmic clapping of
impatience--having become a line, they now threaten to become
a mob. Burke sings one more Joe Cocker-like passionate plea
before turning to camera to shout over the mayhem:
BURKE
Let them in.
As they enter.
Cathy and Matt are leaning against Burke's car. Cathy is
distraught--temporarily, but horribly, unsure of herself.
Matt is looking at her. If he had a little more confidence
going for him right now, he would make his move. But, for
now, they are two self-doubters on different trips.
CATHY
I never thought it would do this
well. There were so many holes; I
told everybody it wasn't going to do
business. Why am I so public with my
opinions?
MATT
You might be right.
CATHY
Not with that score. You know, maybe
tonight's the night I'm losing my
entire mind, but weren't you in
'Platoon?'
MATT
Incredible. I was only there for a
minute in the rape scene, moving
past Charlie Sheen when I left the
hut... I had a great scene cut out...
I was...
CATHY
But there was that one long close up--
where you seemed ashamed of yourself
but still arrogant.
MATT
That's exactly what I was going for.
CATHY
It reminded me of my last boyfriend.
(indicating book bag)
Got to go.
She hefts the bag--puts it back down--crosses her eyes,
burlesquing the weight of the bag. He helps her put it on
her shoulder.
MATT
You have to read all that?
CATHY
Beast of burden.
MATT
(sincerely)
So what are you, totally wonderful
or what?
She smiles and is gone, staggering a bit under the weight of
her scripts. Matt looks after her. Burke and Nan approach.
BURKE
How come you haven't said anything?
This is great, right?
NAN
No.
BURKE
What no?
NAN
The definite recommends are way off
for a score this high and, even for
action-adventure, it's just too low
for women.
(Burke looks anguished)
I'm sorry.
He leans against the car for support.
BURKE
It was such a good score.
NAN
(extraordinarily
sympathetic)
I know... And, unfortunately,
yesterday's tracking wasn't...
(he reacts)
I'm sorry... They just don't seem in
the mood for action-adventure right...
(he reacts)
Sorry... May I tell you one more
thing?
(he looks up in
anticipatory fear)
I think it's so wonderful that you
don't worry about even trying to act
strong.
BURKE
Thanks. You want to eat something
sometime?
NAN
I'm, uh... I'm blushing from head to
foot.
BURKE
Good. I'll call you.
As Burke moves to his car. He SEES the Group Captain paying
Matt.
GROUP CAPTAIN
Thirty-two, thirty-three.
Burke is looking at Matt with some surprise.
BURKE
You want to do this regularly for
me? I was gonna offer, but I thought
it would humiliate you.
MATT
(straight at him)
I don't mind an occasional odd job.
But I can't work tomorrow. I have to
get my kid.
As they get in the car, Burke has the front door open, about
to get in--reconsiders, and gets in the rear door.
BURKE
Okay, I got the cards to look at--I
think I'll ride back here.
(to Nan)
Maybe I'll drop by your place
tomorrow.
Matt gets behind the wheel, thereby ending the day as a full-
fledged chauffeur. They drive off.
Burke and Nan returning from lunch.
NAN
So, thanks for lunch. I hope this
leads to an evening date. Though I
have to stay home with my daughter,
Leslie, on Saturdays.
BURKE
(sincerely)
Yeah, okay. You were very interesting
to talk to. I swear to God. Honest.
No kidding. You really were.
NAN
I believe you.
(sincerely)
And I was very surprised what you
were like when you weren't working.
There was absolutely no difference.
You want to see where we do the
tracking?
BURKE
(excited)
Is it okay?
As Matt's cab pulls up. He opens the front gate and walks up
to the porch, noting a tricycle, stirred by old guilts. He
knocks on the door. A MAN answers.
MAN
Are you Matt?
MATT
Uh-huh.
MAN
I didn't know if we could wait much
longer. Come on in.
He lights a cigarette, takes three quick drags, then flicks
it away before walking inside behind Matt.
MAN
(again)
She's a real nut on smoking anywhere
near the kid.
All three adults and Jeannie sharing the burden of the luggage
as they move towards the cab. Mother and child hug. Matt
struck by his child's plight, him.
BETH
(turning to Matt)
Beginning now, you must give less
value to your own happiness and well-
being, then hopefully, you will reach
the point where you give that no
value whatsoever. Give her everything.
There's no such thing as spoiling a
child.
MAN
Even if you have to steal to do it?
BETH
You don't really want to mess with
me, do you?
MAN
(simple honesty)
No.
MATT
(to Jeannie)
Okay, sweetie. We have to go.
JEANNIE
(to Beth)
I want to go with you.
BETH
Can't, pretty-heart. I'm sorry.
Tears fall from Jeannie's eyes.
JEANNIE
Not even a compromise?
BETH
(thinking)
The compromise will be that you don't
have to ride in back; you can ride
up front with the driver... okay?
MATT
What?
JEANNIE
Okay.
As Beth buckles Jeannie into the front seat, Matt gets in
the back, alone, feeling preposterous. Beth nods to the
Marshal, who surreptitiously handcuffs her.
MATT
(to driver)
Can we please go?
SHOT - JEANNIE
The cab pulls away. Matt leans towards her as she looks back
at the receding figure of her mother and grows still.
ON MOTHER AND MARSHALL
As she sings him one last line of "DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS."
Matt checks Jeannie's luggage, then takes her hand. She lets
him. He is grateful.
MATT
It's going to be okay. I'm you're
dad, you know? So it will be okay.
You and I will make it okay. You
ever ridden in a plane before?
JEANNIE
(a sudden gust of
anger)
Yesssss!
Matt carrying the sleeping child like a sack over his
shoulder, also managing to hold onto all her luggage.
Burke walks tight little circles near Cathy and the rest of
his staff while a few feet away Studio Executives stand in a
cluster. There is a DISTANT, RHYTHMIC SHUFFLING SOUND. Burke
walks past Cathy.
BURKE
Nothing good that happens tonight
can make it worth feeling the way I
do right now. Nothing.
(turning to Cathy)
What do you think?
CATHY
(nervously taking the
plunge)
To be honest, I had problems with
'Ground Zero.' But this 'People Get
Hurt' one, while it might not be my
exact, exact thing, I think will
really work for an audience. It's so
over the top, you have a great time.
BURKE
So you think it'll score big?
CATHY
Yes.
This rooftop serves as an outdoor commissary for Popcorn
Pictures. There are a few tables, snack machines and
umbrellas. The whole "D" staff is there, including Cathy,
having lunch, along with Claire, the casting assistant. In
the b.g., we see Matt, huddled, sitting on the roof's awful
green outdoor carpeting, feeling much the same as Jeannie in
the previous scene.
ON MATT
Off in the distance, the Popcorn execs contentedly ply their
trade. As he overhears their conversation and the words begin
to register in all their horror.
MILLIE
Will somebody take a minute to look
over my casting list before Burke
gets here?
MALE D PERSON
(scanning list)
This isn't so great, Millie.
MILLIE
Well, I wanted to put in people we
had a shot at getting.
MALE D PERSON
(reading from list)
F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Daniels, Ed
Harris, John Lithgow, Rip Torn, Willem
Dafoe, John Malkovich... For an action
lead?
MILLIE
Could you at least take it one person
at a time instead of...
MALE D PERSON
Okay. Let's play 'State the
Obvious'... F. Murray Abraham has a
nose as long as an Aspen ski line,
Ed Harris is losing his hair, Joe
Mantegna has never played the lead
in a big movie... Willem Dafoe's
teeth... Bob Hoskins looks fur bearing
when he takes off his shirt...
Malkovich...
Matt can take it no more. He hears a loud voice coming from
his own throat. He wigs out.
MATT
I can't stand it anymore. I can't.
CATHY
What's wrong? What happened?
MATT
What, in God's name, are you doing
in this job you have?
SHOT
As they all start to answer at once.
MATT
I mean him. What, in God's name, do
you know about casting?
MALE D PERSON
Me?
Matt rises and walks towards the Male D Person.
MATT
Yes. What do you know? About anything?
You don't even know you have a habit
of touching your tongue with a finger
like you want to lick yourself.
(note: this is his
little habit)
Yet, you talk like you actually know
something... So I want you to tell
me...
(louder)
...what you know.
MALE D PERSON
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
MATT
I've been an actor most of my life
and this is the first time I've ever
heard what the people calling the
shots sound like when they're casting.
So I really want to find out what,
if anything, you know because what
if nothing you know.
FEMALE D PERSON
I don't think the yelling is
necessary.
MATT
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong. And
I'm not talking to you. And I don't
like you.
MALE D PERSON
How about you just mind your own
business?
Matt is very close to him--he shakes his chair.
MATT
You're minding my business. That's
the problem... so, just tell me,
what do you know?
ON MALE D PERSON
Matt's manner is threatening. The Male D Person looks around
for some support and finds little... then Matt's tone
changes... it's reasonable, almost seductive.
MATT
Just tell me and I'll shut up.
MALE D PERSON
(taking the bait)
First of all, I've been going to
movies since I was six, for God's
sake...
MATT
What you know is the size of a
schnozz. What you don't know is that
these guys...
(indicates list)
...are for real...
ON CATHY
She is a ricochet victim of every word Matt says, as he
continues to indict the Male D Person and unknowingly reach
her instead. His fury grows and becomes more complicated,
containing an element of mourning.
MATT
(again)
...that they can make something
happen, and even they don't know
what that is till they get in there
and play a little... they can make
something happen that you can't even
imagine... and it's not your fault,
this stupidity... 'cause you're just
this scared little prick who gets to
say he's making movies, and the only
thing they ever taught you is that
what you like doesn't matter.
MALE D PERSON
(frightened)
Thanks for understanding.
The anger leaves Matt. He is depleted.
MATT
But isn't it almost good manners for
you to feel a little shame?
Cathy rises and begins to exit.
MATT
(again)
I didn't mean you.
CATHY
If you didn't, you sure should have.
She exits. The D Person's Colleagues have taken advantage of
the beat to egg him on.
MALE D PERSON
You talk about manners--are you
actually so bitter you don't realize
how you acted just now? You're gone,
pal. But at least know that we can't
help that we're making it.
MATT
Oh, shit. You win. You got lucky
with 'bitter.' That word just scares
me to death.
As Matt exits his car with beaten down body language.
As Cathy drives past some rough examples of street life, and
finally finds Matt's building with its grim iron gate security
system. Cathy, uncomfortable in these surroundings, parks
her car, brushes her hair, while, at the same time, putting
in place a phony cheap-car-radio-sticker over her own
expensive system, and gets out.
Matt, holding the script, walks the small lane through the
tidy lawn to the perfect Silver Lake cottage. We HEAR MUSIC
from inside. (A soundtrack.) There is a note on the door,
which is slightly ajar, reading: "Come right in if you loved
it--ring if you have reservations." Matt enters.
As crowded as it was for the previous audition scene, but
this time they are reading children of varied ages, and the
kids and their parents are all over the stairs, etc. Jeannie
is filled with wonder and is arrestingly and atypically shy,
as she makes her way through this world of the young, clinging
to Cathy's hand, as the kids sing their version of "MAKE
BELIEVE"--the stage parents taking one verse. At one point,
Cathy's begins talking to someone, blocking Jeannie's view.
JEANNIE
Get out of my way!
CATHY
Don't say it like that!!!
JEANNIE
Which way should I?
(polite little girl)
Get out of my way.
(almost weeping)
Get out of my way.
(furious)
Get out of my way.
All this noticed by a casting person with a clipboard.
CASTING PERSON
Wow.
As Matt and Cathy come into frame... Matt forcefully placing
her with her back to the wall. She is not one to be pushed
around.
CATHY
Don't!
MATT
What in hell is wrong with you? You
actually think...
CATHY
I'm trying to hang in here but
everything in me cuts off when
somebody acts this way.
MATT
(continuing right
along)
...that you can have my kid audition
for a show without asking me.
CATHY
I didn't... She went for water and
by the time she got back, they had
offered her the part. Blame Burke,
he was there...
Matt takes this in. Just a millimeter underneath his fury is
professional curiosity.
MATT
What's the part, anyway?
CATHY
The white kid in a multi-racial foster
home with all these kids of varying
ages. It's not a bad show. I sure
can't wait to see the test.
MATT
How were they able to test her so
fast?
CATHY
No. They offered it to her off the
reading. I meant your test.
MATT
Oh... A child actor. Just what any
kid with problems needs to straighten
out--a series of her own...
Cathy has nothing to offer. Matt begins leading her back. We
HOLD ON THEIR BACKS and see the chink in Matt's confidence,
hear the tightness in his voice as he asks:
MATT
You'll let me know as soon as they
see my test?
CATHY
Right away... You've got my vote.
They hold hands.
As the car arrives outside Popcorn Pictures, we can SEE some
child actors and their parents arriving at the sound stage
next door.
MATT
Are you going to need me? The kids
are rehearsing and I'd like to take
a look.
BURKE
Yeah, sure. I have to stay inside
during lunch hours now anyway--that's
when everybody returns my calls
because they're trying to miss me.
MATT
(amazed)
Is that true?
BURKE
(misinterpreting)
Yeah. Thanks for the support.
The strains of "Poor Bastards" underscoring the moment as
Burke rushes into the parking area and grabs Nan's hand just
as a valet brings her car.
NAN
You don't understand that I'm
exhausted from hurting. I'm through
with you.
She begins to cry. Ordinarily this would be a scene which
would be unendurable for Burke. However, the lesson of a
moment ago is not lost on him. As people get out of cars and
witness the sobbing Nan.
BURKE
(to restaurant patrons)
Excuse me, we're working our shit
out... I'm sure it happened to you...
you know, private stuff in public.
The reaction to his openness is disdain and passing contempt.
She drives off, leaving Burke hurt and alone. "Poor Bastards"
up and out.
Matt and Jeannie walking from the catering truck. They are
eating ravenously. MUSIC CONTINUES... VERY JOYOUS.
JEANNIE
This is so good...
MATT
It's a breakfast burrito. It's what
actors eat when they're working.
JEANNIE
(excited)
Really.
MATT
Now, let's work a little more. The
most important acting you do is when
you listen. You're worried about
being able to cry when you're supposed
to, right?
JEANNIE
Yes. So much.
MATT
Well, there are really only two ways
to do it. Think of something that
makes you really sad... or forget
you're you and really forget you're
pretending...
JEANNIE
How do I do that one?
Matt reads from script.
MATT
(as a furious Black
woman)
'Don't test me, child! I could eat
you for lunch when I was your age
and I'm a hell of a lot bigger now!'
Jeannie looks afraid.
MATT
That's it... You just looked at me
and acted right without even thinking.
And there are games you can play to
help you with this. Get up...
(she does)
Now, be my mirror... do exactly what
I do... that's it... now, at a certain
point, I'm going to become your
mirror, but I'm not going to tell
you when... you tell me...
JEANNIE
(hesitantly)
Now?
Matt nods.
MATT
(enthusiastically)
Okay. We're going to make up words.
The words aren't what matter now.
JEANNIE
I'm on a roof...
MATT
You're a great dad.
JEANNIE
You're a...
(then stops; then
smiles at him)
This acting exercise of Chicago's Story Theater leads into
the song, "BE MY MIRROR." As the song finishes, Matt and
Jeannie are in the best spirits we've seen as an A.D.
approaches.
A.D.
They need you.
JEANNIE
Okay.
She takes the A.D.'s hand as Matt calls.
MATT
You're welcome. Don't mention it.
Cathy's car followed by Matt in Burke's car. The frame holds
both cars close as if this were one long car.
There is a longish line of cars behind Matt and Cathy.
MUSIC SEGUES to recall "I'LL DO ANYTHING," as he drives past
the line waiting to see RAINBOW HOUSE.
(NOTE: FROM THIS POINT ON, THERE WILL BE AN UNDERCURRENT OF
CHOREOGRAPHY TO CONCLUSION...)
The door to the roof garden opens and Jeannie enters--her
dad behind her as she sees the party... the sparkling lights,
the decorations, the other kids and MUSIC... our opening
song... "WOW".
ON JEANNIE
As her father urges her into the flow. She passes Millie,
who is dancing with the boy who held Jeannie's hand.
MILLIE
I cast him so he has to dance with
me, but I'm sure he'd prefer dancing
with you.
BOY
(to Jeannie)
Come on. You know how?
JEANNIE
(angrily, with disdain)
Yesssssss.
They begin to dance with the others. MUSIC SLOWS IN TEMPO as
we indicate TIME PASSAGE and:
ANGLE ON BURKE AND MATT
Perched on a ledge eyeing the party.
BURKE
I'm not comfortable with television
anyway... it's too small... I'm much
better at something with size... I
don't do itzy. Even this movie of
Cathy's--it's small... medium small.
But with Stone it takes on a certain
volume where I start to feel
comfortable.
(out of nowhere)
I hate my life...
(backtracking)
...in a way. I had a drink in my
office. I'm confused. You're not
saying anything. Is it because you're
not listening or because I haven't
stopped talking?
MATT
This Oliver Stone thing... does he
really want me?
BURKE
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I forgot to say
congratu...
MATT
Which part?
BURKE
Which one you want?
MATT
One of the two leads wouldn't be
bad.
BURKE
No. It's the crippled factory owner.
MATT
Best part in the movie.
He gets off the ledge and starts to move away... Burke moves
quickly to cut him off.
BURKE
Wait a second.
MATT
I want to see my kid.
BURKE
A second--look, they're taking the
cast picture now anyway.
THEIR POV
Jeannie, working her way to the absolute middle of the cast
picture, where she plops on someone's lap.
BACK TO SCENE
BURKE
She doesn't look anything like the
women I usually go with. And you
know what they say, "beauty fades."
What they don't say is that it fades
very slowly.
MATT
You don't think I can tell you what
to do?
BURKE
No. Only I can do that. I want you
to tell me what to feel...
(he begins to use his
fingers to run down
Nan's qualities)
Look. I trust her. More important,
everyone does. You have no idea how
impressed people are with her. She's
smart. She's interesting. You never
know what she'll say next... Her
work is amazing. I like talking to
her. You have no idea what to expect
next. I respect what she does more
than any writer or director--sincerely--
much more unusual--much more
important. So?
MATT
Good luck.
He walks away. Burke waves a grateful goodbye and looks around
the room until he sees:
BURKE'S POV - NAN ACROSS THE ROOF
Nan eating cake with her hands. She sees him. He indicates
he would like to dance. She does not move a muscle in
response... Still, he walks towards her. She begins to shake
her head, "no." He shifts uncomfortably, but keeps coming
until he reaches her side.
ON NAN AND BURKE
BURKE
Dance with me.
(she shakes her head)
On a business basis.
NAN
No.
(he turns away,
dejected)
But I'll dance with you because I
think it will reassure me that I
should have nothing to do with you.
BURKE
I'll take it.
As they dance.
NAN
Why are you breathing so heavy?
BURKE
Nervous... Look, let's move our thing
in a more regular direction.
NAN
What do you mean?
BURKE
Let me think.
(then)
What if we go out this weekend...
(before she can say
"no")
...with your kid.
Several more beats of dancing--as he awaits her answer.
NAN
...whose name is?
BURKE
Whose name is...
(then, triumphantly)
Leslie.
NAN
Okay.
SONG BACK--"WOW"... sung as a chorus... a slower cadence for
the romance as we... CHANGE MUSIC and they dance more closely.
The song slows for time passage and MUSIC CHANGES to "BE MY
MIRROR" as we...
DISSOLVE TO:
Matt and Jeannie--the last ones there. He holds her in his
arms, dancing. She is asleep. He dances her to a chair with
her wrap on it... shifts her around, wrestling to get it on.
She wakes up and puts it on herself.
JEANNIE
(looking around
satisfied)
Last ones here.
MATT
Well, I told you.
He takes her hand and starts to lead her towards the stair
shed--then:
MATT
I never got to see your bow.
She looks up, smiling pridefully, to see her father smiling
back pridefully.
JEANNIE
(as if it's a great
sacrifice)
Oh, all right.
She bows. It is a bow all her own.
FADE OUT:
