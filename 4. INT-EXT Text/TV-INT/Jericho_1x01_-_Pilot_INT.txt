  The intercom announces,  Next Stop, Topeka!  as we move down 
  the aisle, past businessmen and tourists, reading their 
  papers.  Each paper has a different photo and a differently 
  worded headline.  But all of them tell us one thing...  The 
  President s State of the Union Address is tonight.

  We move past two little girls pointing out the window,  Dad, 
  lookit!  and finally land on... JAKE GREEN, 27, the charming 
  prodigal son.  Jake is old movie handsome.  A rogue.  
  Troubled.  As he sips his whiskey, he looks sad and deep in 
  thought.  Jake stares through the window as billboards 
  advertising the Golden Eagle Casino and Trading Post roll by.

                                JOVIAL MAN (O.S.)
                Tough day?

  Jake turns to find a chubby JOVIAL MAN, 47, smiling.

                                JOVIAL MAN (CONT D)
                Just curious why you re drinking so 
                early in the morning?  Break-up?  
                Lay off?  Titans fan?

                              JAKE
                      (finds himself smiling)
                No.  I m going back home for the 
                day.  Going to visit my grandfather.

                                JOVIAL MAN
                Is that bad?

                              JAKE
                No.  The bad part is seeing my 
                father and brother.
                      (gestures like a boxer)
                Dad will hit me with the 'you're a 
                  disappointment' right, and Peter 
                will come in with the 'family 
                values' left.  Good times.                                                                                  2.



                                JOVIAL MAN
                      (smiles)
                Let me guess.  You re grandpa s 
                  favorite?

                              JAKE
                I don t know.  But he was my 
                  favorite.

  They smile.  Jake points to the man s empty beers...

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                What about you?  Why are you 
                drinking so early in the morning?

                                JOVIAL MAN
                Because I m a drunk.


  Jake s laughter becomes the squeal of the train s brakes.  
  Jake exits the train and passes baggage handlers, pushing 
  luggage carts.  If we look closely, we see one of them load a 
  silver suitcase on the train.


  The taxi moves around a cement pilar to reveal... a vintage 
  Ford Mustang Convertible.  Jake turns to the taxi driver.

                              JAKE
                You got jumper cables?


  Jake, now sitting in the Mustang, hands his ticket to the 
  TICKET TAKER, an African American woman, about 31.  She looks 
  at the ticket.  All yellow and faded.  She s confused.


  The ticket taker enters the messy office and approaches her 
  BOSS, a gruff man.  She holds up Jake s ticket.

                                TICKET TAKER
                I don t know what to do with this.                                                                                  3.



                              BOSS
                What do you mean?  Take his money.

                                TICKET TAKER
                You don t understand.  This man s 
                had his car here for... 5 years.


  We see a MOTORCYCLE GANG making life hell for a student 
  driver, then move over to Jake's Mustang as it pulls off the 
  crowded highway.  A sign reads... Jericho 87 miles.


  Jake flips through the radio dial.  Bill O Reilly blurts, 
   Larry.  Pensicola, Florida.  Go.   Larry,  Hey, Bill.  So, 
  the State of the Union tonight...   Jake changes the channel.  
  Rush Limbaugh groans,  It makes me ill that the President s 
  speech is going to acknowledge this liberal--   Click.  Al 
  Franken says,  The arrogance of this administration--   
  Click.   ... it ll be cold tonight.  Low in the mid 20 s. 

  Jake finally finds some music.  Bad Company s anthem,  Bad 
  Company.   Our new title song.  Ahh.  Much better.


  A poster endorsing Mayor Green hangs in the window of this 
    medium-sized supermarket and trading post.  STEPHANIE 
    LANCASTER, 16, a teenage princess of the highest order, 
  samples lipstick.  She complains to the cute tech nerd, ALVIE 
  CLEMONS, 15, who worships her like a beaten dog.  They ve 
  been friends since they were 3 years old.

                                STEPHANIE
                I ll never forgive my parents for 
                not taking me on their trip to New 
                York.  I could be shopping on 5th 
                Avenue right now instead of...
                      (referring to lipsticks)
                Look at this sad collection.  This 
                color was out of style before it 
                was invented.                                                                                  7.



                              ALVIE
                I think it looks nice on you.

                                STEPHANIE
                That s because you re staring at my 
                chest, Alvie.

                              ALVIE
                Yes, I am.  But, we really should 
                get back to--

                                STEPHANIE
                Would you forget about studying for 
                the SAT s and live a little?

                              ALVIE
                You re right, Stephanie.  Forget 
                M.I.T. and my dreams of a happy 
                life.  Let s ponder your chest.

  We move to the counter, where Jake indulges the never-ending 
  gossip of good-natured GRACIE LEIGH, 45.  Gracie almost scans 
  his bouquet of flowers and Swiss Army Knife... several times.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                ... his name is Rod Hawkins.  That 
                new man.  I think his wife is 
                lovely, but him... I don t know.  
                Mrs. Olson made me promise not to 
                tell anyone, but she heard he 
                bought that nice house in cash.  
                Cash.  Promise not to tell anyone.

                              JAKE
                Scout s honor, Mrs. Leigh.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                So, how about you, Jake?  Where you 
                been keeping yourself all this 
                time?

                              JAKE
                Promise not to tell Mrs. Olson.
                      (off her crossed heart)
                Believe it or not... I ve been 
                playing minor league baseball.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                That a fact?

                              JAKE
                Scout s honor.                                                                                  8.




  We see Jake and Emily through the large storefront window.  
  The stock boy, DALE TURNER, 16, is the trailer park kid 
  everybody picks on.  Dale watches Jake lean in to whisper in 
  Emily s ear.  Dale s jealous.  Stephanie Lancaster smirks.

                                STEPHANIE
                Well, here s to you, Mrs. Robinson. 
                Dale, do you really think you have 
                a chance with Miss Spenser or any 
                girl in her right mind?

  Dale looks away, embarrassed, and goes back to sweeping.

                              ALVIE
                Leave him alone, Stephanie.  He s 
                got enough problems.

  Dale takes one more look as Emily and Jake hug and say good-
  bye.  The door rings as Emily enters the store.  She s very 
  sad.  Whatever Jake told her, it s not good.


  MAYOR JOHNSTON GREEN, 58, small town charming, and PETER 
  GREEN, the 33 year old star of the family, hold an informal 
  meeting with Jericho s answer to a labor crisis.  On the side 
  of labor is union boss, SHEP CALE, 45, a blue collar Joe.  
  The Mayor hangs back, waiting for his moment to intervene.                                                                                11.



                              PETER
                We re all in agreement about that.

                              SHEP
                No, we re not in agreement, Peter.  
                My men have been promised safety 
                  equipment, a cost of living increa--

  On the side of management is NORMAN PERRY, 42, a high strung 
  workaholic.  He groans.

                                NORMAN
                You were not promised, Mr. Cale.

                              SHEP
                I m not talking to you, Mr. Perry.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                 Mr. Perry?  Mr. Cale?   For God s 
                sake, you two used to get drunk in 
                high school together.  Remember?  
                Look, that factory keeps this town 
                alive.  So, I don t want to hear 
                anything about strikes or lock 
                outs.  I want you two to sit down 
                like gentlemen and talk this thing 
                through.  That s what we do in 
                Jericho.  We don t feud.

  Shep and Norman look off screen.  Then... 

                              SHEP
                We don t feud, huh?

  The Mayor looks confused until he turns to the doorway to 
  find... Jake.  The Mayor turns instantly chilly.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                You re early.


                                END OF TEASER                                                                                12.


                                    ACT ONE


  The door opens to reveal Peter's wife, ANN GREEN, 33, 
  Jericho's answer to Hillary Clinton when she moved to 
  Arkansas.  Normally, the Green family would stop to say 
  hello, but right now, they are too busy with...

                              MAYOR GREEN (O.S.)
                ... don t you know I m fighting for 
                my political life?

                              JAKE (O.S.)
                Dad, I am not here to interfere 
                with your campaign.  All I want is 
                your signature, then I ll visit 
                grandpa, then--

                              PETER
                After 5 years?  That s all you have 
                to say to dad?

                              JAKE
                Peter, it s none of your business.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                It is his business.  It s all our 
                  business.  What you have put this 
                family through--

                              GAIL
                  Johnston, please.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                No, Gail.  He could have been a--

                              JAKE
                Dad, we could spend a week talking 
                about what I could have been.  I 
                have apologized.  I have made 
                amends.  This is me now.  I have a 
                plan.  But I need my money to--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                It isn t your money.  It s your 
                  grandfather s money.  

                              JAKE
                I know it s his, dad.  I didn t ask 
                for it.  But he gave it to me for a 
                reason.                                                                                13.



                              MAYOR GREEN
                And he gave me authority over it 
                for a reason.  So, when you 
                convince me you re leading a more 
                  productive life--

                              JAKE
                That s why he gave me the mone--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                You start the new life.  Then, you 
                get the money.  It doesn t work the 
                other way around.  

                              PETER
                That s right, Jake.

                              JAKE
                Peter, we were both born on 3rd 
                base.  Stop pretending you hit a 
                triple.

  Peter is silent.  Jake turns back to his father.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                You always look for the easy road, 
                Jake.  And I can t let you this 
                time.  I can t give you something 
                and watch you squander it again.  
                It s like that time I gave you my 
                swiss army knife from the war, and--

  Jake produces the new swiss army knife he bought at Gracie s 
  store from his pocket and hands it to his father.

                              JAKE
                I know the next 50 things you re 
                going to say, dad.  I wish I could 
                give you back the real one, but I 
                can t.  I am not here to fight.  I 
                just want to make grandpa proud.  
                So, just sign the papers, so we can 
                all get on with our lives.

  The Mayor looks at the knife, then hands it back to Jake.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                Dad, when are you going to realize 
                that I m 27 years old?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                When you do.                                                                                14.



  With that, the Mayor goes into his den and closes the door.

                              JAKE
                Peter, you know this is unfair.

  Peter, the loyal daddy s boy, says nothing.  He leaves the 
  house with Ann, who shrugs.   Sorry, Jake.   Gail approaches.

                              GAIL
                Let s visit your grandfather.


  Gail walks into the house to find a very angry Mayor Green.

                              GAIL
                  Johnston, when you give birth, you 
                can tell me about taking sides.

  The law is laid down.  The two sit down in front of the TV as 
  the State of the Union Address begins.  The page shouts, 
   Ladies and gentleman.  The President of the United States! 


  Applause.  The President takes the podium as Peter puts his 
  arm around his wife, Ann, holding their 6 MONTH OLD BABY.

                              PETER
                      (hurt)
                Jake s going to tell me about 
                things being unfair.


  The President drinks in the applause as Stanley Peterson 
    approaches his parents in the living room.  MR. and MRS. 
  PETERSON, 54, both salt of the earth, shake their heads.  
  They hand the final IRS bill to Stanley.  $131,852.  

  Stanley looks over at Bonnie, who is text messaging her 
    boyfriend.   We re going to lose the farm. 


  The President holds up his hands and the applause slowly dies 
  down.  Jimmy, Bill, and their respective kids watch the TV.  
  Jimmy's son, WOODY, 9, looks up at Jimmy.                                                                                16.



                              WOODY
                Do we have to watch this?

  Jimmy and Bill look into the kitchen at their two ball-
  breaking wives, both named MARGARET, giving them the eye.

                              JIMMY
                Sorry, kid.  Mom wants us to 
                improve ourselves.


  The President begins, "Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, 
  members of Congress, my fellow Americans..."

  Dale Turner gets ready to leave for the night as Gracie Leigh 
  gossips into the phone.  

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                ... You heard me.  Minor league 
                  baseball.  He and Emily were 
                talking right outside here.
                      (to Dale Turner)
                Thanks, Dale.  See you tomorrow.

  Dale Turner waves, then leaves the store.  Back to the phone.

                                GRACIE LEIGH (CONT D)
                Everyone thought they were going to 
                get married back in the day...


  "... by law and custom, we meet here once a year in this 
  sacred chamber to discuss the state of our union... 

  Emily looks at an old YEARBOOK picture of Jake.  The 
  inscription reads.   Emily, I ll love you until the day I 
  die.   She shakes herself out of her nostalgia, turns up her 
  iPod, and goes back to the champagne, flowers, and candles to 
  make her fianc  s arrival perfect.  The post-it note reads... 
  Roger s flight.  Kansas City Airport.  11:00pm.


   Tonight, with a growing economy, with...   

  Jake switches off the radio and continues to move down the 
  rural road.  He sighs.                                                                                17.




  We scan the old-fashioned saloon.  Mimi Clark from the IRS 
  looks sad as she drowns the unfortunate aspect of her job 
  down with a little wine.  The SEXY BARMAID turns up the 
  volume on the TV.  We move in on the TV as his voice booms.

                                PRESIDENT
                ... democracy in the Middle East, 
                the former Soviet Satellite nations 
                  stabilized, and threats from Iran 
                and North Korea contained... the 
                state of our union is... strong.

  Just then, the TV turns to snow.  The patrons grumble.  

                              PATRONS
                      (ad-lib)
                Damn.  The cable s out!


  Woody and the kids cheer!

                              WOODY
                Yay!  The cable s out!


  Stephanie Lancaster turns off the snowy television and goes 
  right back to fighting with her mother on the phone.

                                STEPHANIE
                I didn t do anything to the TV, 
                mom.  Well, if you had brought me 
                to New York, then maybe--  What?  
                Oh, I wish you d just die.

  Silence.  Stephanie is furious.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                Mom.  Did you hang up on me?!


  As Stanley shakes his head at the satellite TV, Bonnie looks 
  at the cell phone on the table flash green.  A picture 
  message.  Bonnie hits a button and the image begins to load.


  Mimi Clark, IRS employee, checks the ATM machine.  The sign 
  reads...  Technical difficulties.  Please, try again later.                                                                                 18.




  The pretty school teacher, HEATHER LISINSKI, 26, rides in the 
  front seat of the school bus.  She talks on her cell phone.

                              HEATHER
                We finally found a garage that 
                could fix it.  Had to take a 
                detour.  We re heading back now.

  Heather strains to see the road signs through the windows.

                              HEATHER (CONT D)
                We re on... Cedar Run Road.  We ll 
                be back in an hour, Mr. Mcvey.  Mr. 
                Mcvey?  Hello?

  Heather shrugs, folds her phone, and turns to the chubby bus 
  driver, who smiles.

                              BUS DRIVER
                      (thick Southern drawl)
                You wanna use my Blackberry?


  The mushroom cloud bellows in the distance of this isolated 
  highway.  Jake holds his hands in front of his face to shield 
  his eyes from the blinding light coming from the rear view 
  mirror.  We stay inside this white light for a beat.  

  The light subsides.  Jake blinks to find his visual bearing.  
  And once his eyes focus, he sees it.  A station wagon going 
  the other direction has just veered into his lane.  Jake s 
  eyes go wide and just before the moment of impact...


  CRASH!  Stephanie Lancaster has just dropped a plate of food 
  on the living room floor.  She moves to the massive bay 
  windows of her family s mansion on the hill.  The mushroom 
  cloud bellows in the distance.  Stephanie is speechless.


  The faucet runs.  Unaware of events, Mayor Green opens up his 
  bottle of prescription pills.  He coughs twice, then downs 
  the pills with a little water.  He sighs.  Thinking about 
  Jake.  When he turns off the faucet, he hears something... 
  the sound of crying.


  The Mayor walks down the stairs to find Gail kneeling with 
  Jimmy and Bill standing in front of her.  Both look sad.  
  Gail rises to reveal Jimmy s son WOODY, horrified.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Gail?  What s going on?

  Gail turns around.  Her own expression... horrified.                                                                                20.




  Peter and Ann, carrying their baby, rush into the house, now 
  buzzing with activity.  The Mayor holds up his hand for 
  silence as he moves to the other side of the room.

                              PETER
                Dad!  Dad!

                              MAYOR GREEN
                We heard, Peter.  Everyone, please.  
                The explosion came from the West.  
                There are military bases in 
                  Colorado.  It could have been a 
                test.  An accident.  Let s not get 
                ahead of ourselves.  I ll call the 
                  governor.  Find out.  In the mean- 
                time, let s not forget who we are.

  The Mayor s confidence settles the group down.  They watch as 
  he turns his back to them as he picks up the phone.  We see 
  the Mayor s face.  The line is dead.  He is now spooked.  But 
  he can t show it to the others.  He takes a breath.  Turns.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                Anyone s cell phone working?

  They all shakes their heads.  No.  Scared.

                              PETER
                Are we under attack, dad?

  Silence.  The Mayor thinks.  Looks at their frightened faces.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                I don t know.  Jimmy, Bill?  Get on 
                the radio.  I want everyone at the 
                  Sheriff s office in 20 minutes.  
                Tell them to assess any damage 
                along the way.  I need to know if 
                our town is still standing.  Peter, 
                we need to get the city s emergency 
                plan.  Let s move.

  They begin to scurry.  Woody trails after Jimmy.  

                              WOODY
                Dad, don t leave!  Dad, I want to 
                go with you!                                                                                21.



  Jimmy kneels.  Wipes the tears out of his son s eyes.  
  They ve said these words 1,000 times.  No sentiment.  

                              JIMMY
                Who s my hero?

                              WOODY
                Me.

                              JIMMY
                Who s the best?

                              WOODY
                Me.

                              JIMMY
                Who s going to take care of these 
                nice ladies?

                              WOODY
                Me.

  Woody hugs his dad.  Peter kisses Ann and the baby and 
  leaves.  Ann watches him go.  Gail and the Mayor lock eyes 
  with a look that only comes with 35 years of marriage.

                              GAIL
                Jake.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                We ll find him.


  Dale opens the trailer door.  He sees old beer cans, pizza 
  boxes, and an answering machine flashing ONE MESSAGE.                                                                                22.




  The juke box blasts as the people in the tavern enjoy their 
  last blissful moment of ignorance.  Mimi Clark, IRS employee, 
  leaves the ATM machine and approaches the SEXY BARMAID.

                              MIMI CLARK
                Excuse me, miss.  I m going back to 
                DC tomorrow, and I need money for 
                the cab.  Where can I find an ATM?


  Mayor Green and Peter burst through the door where the EMT, 
  Fire, and Police Crews have gathered.  The Mayor points to 
  the flashing lights on the cars through the window.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Could we turn off the Christmas 
                Tree out there before the whole 
                world starts asking questions?

  The SHERIFF, 57, all business, nods to one of his younger 
  deputies.  The deputy charges outside.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                Sheriff.  Chief.

  The FIRE CHIEF, 48, a real cowboy, nods to the Mayor.  The 
  Mayor lays his emergency plan on the sheriff s desk.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                Any damage?  Fires?  Buildings?

                              SHERIFF
                Nothing, Mr. Mayor.  Town s fine.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Let s hope you re right.

                              SHERIFF
                What do you mean?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Do we have any Geiger counters?


  Alvie is too focused on his SAT book and blasting stereo to 
  hear the knock.  His mother, TERESA CLEMONS, 45, shouts up.

                                TERESA CLEMONS (O.S.)
                Alvie, your friend Stephanie s here!

  Alvie bounds up, checks his hopeless hair, and leaves.


  Alvie walks down the stairs to find Stephanie Lancaster, who 
  is in a complete daze.

                                STEPHANIE
                I can t get my mom on the phone.


  Gray Anderson enters the room as the impact of the news 
  spreads across the group s faces.  The leaders are holding 
  their composure.  The younger cops and firemen are shaky.  
  Some cry.  Most are silent.  Men.  Women.  Black.  White.  
  It s the one human moment before...                                                                                24.



                              MAYOR GREEN
                I know.  We re all scared.  We re 
                all thinking of our families.  But 
                in about 2 minutes, people are 
                going to pour through those doors, 
                looking for answers.  So, we better 
                get some quick.  If we re calm, 
                they re calm.  Understood?  

  They all nod.  The sheriff gestures to the emergency plan.

                              SHERIFF
                What does the emergency plan say?

                              PETER GREEN
                Contact the governor.  National 
                Guard.  State troopers.

  They all look at the RADIO OPERATOR in the corner.  Static.  
  He turns to them.  Shakes his head.  Nothing.

                              SHERIFF
                Anything else?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                A whole lot about tornadoes.

  The group sighs.  One young cop panics.

                              PANICKED COP
                Are we under attack?  We re under--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Son.  Until we hear otherwise, I 
                don t want to hear that word again.  
                One explosion is not an attack.

  Gray Anderson makes his way into the center near the Mayor, 
  Peter, the Sheriff, and Fire Chief.  The Mayor and Peter 
  politely nod to him although we can feel the chill.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT'D)
                I m glad you re here, Gray.  We 
                could use the help.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  Peter.  
                Anything I can do.

                              BILL
                Mayor Green!  Sheriff!

  They turn to see Bill set down a box of Geiger counters.                                                                                25.




  The pick-up truck flies down the road.  Bonnie is shell-
  shocked.  Stanley puts a hand on her shoulder.

                              STANLEY
                Hang in there, Bonnie.  We need to 
                make sure the Mayor knows.


  The Mayor holds the Geiger counter.  He looks at the 
  assembled group.  Silence.  Prayers.  The Mayor switches the 
  power on.  Pins and needles as they wait.  Nothing.  Until 
  the Mayor lowers the Geiger counter and it starts CLIK-CLIK-
  CLIK ing.  People gasp.  Cry.  Terrified until...

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Wait a minute.

  The Mayor lifts the Geiger counter up.  The CLIK-CLIK goes 
  away.  Puts it back down.  CLIK-CLIK.  The Sheriff gives the 
  Mayor a quizzical look until...

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                I didn t turn off my cell phone.

  The group sighs in relief.  Almost laughing.  A YOUNG COUPLE 
  enters the Sheriff s office.  Shaken.

                              YOUNG HUSBAND
                Mr. Mayor?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Folks, no need to panic.  So far, 
                it looks like there s no radiation 
                fallout.  We ll keep checking 
                around town, but in the meantim--

                              YOUNG WIFE
                  Actually, sir.  We... uh... we 
                spoke to Principal McVey.  The 
                school bus isn t back from the 
                field trip... with our son.


  Alvie is speechless.  His mother now has tears running down 
  her face.  We might think she s reacting to the news, but...

                                TERESA CLEMONS
                Alvie, call Principal McVey to find 
                out where your little sister is.                                                                                26.




  Gail is now surrounded by a group of concerned parents.  Some 
  are worried.  Some are crying.  Some are irate.

                                CONCERNED PARENTS
                 It should have been back an hour 
                ago.    Where is your husband!? 

                              GAIL
                  Everyone, please calm down.  I m 
                sure my husband and the sheriff are 
                doing everything they can to find 
                the school bus.

                              IRATE MOTHER
                That s easy for you to say.  You 
                don t have a child out there!

  This hits Gail.  Ann puts her hand on Gail s shoulder.  Gail 
  kills herself not to cry.  One tough lady.


  We see the Mayor in silence for a breath.  His face registers 
  a flash of resigned sadness and worry about Jake.  He looks 
  over at the crowded room.  Townspeople asking questions, 
  panicked, some just wanting to help.  Then, the volume comes 
  back up, and it's right back to business.  The Mayor points 
  to the map of the surrounding counties.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Okay.  The school bus was here at 
                the caves.  Who can tell me where 
                they might have gone for repairs?

                              FIRE CHIEF
                There s Wilson s garage off 183.

                              EMT CREW CHIEF
                Or maybe Cedar Run Road.  They said 
                they took a detour before the phone 
                cut off.  What do you think, Sheriff?

  The crowd is getting louder.   What about fallout?    Are we 
  under attack?    Can we help?   Peter steps up and shouts.

                              PETER GREEN
                FOLKS!  WE CAN T HEAR OURSELVES 
                THINK OVER HERE!

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Peter, enough.

                              SHERIFF
                I figure two teams.  There are only 
                so many places it could be.

  The Mayor nods.  Good work, sheriff.  And then, Gray Anderson 
  throws in his two cents.  Just loud enough for the crowd.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                What about the parents?

  Parts of the crowd react.   Yeah.    We want to help.   Mayor 
  Green looks at the Sheriff.  Sotto voice.                                                                                28.



                              SHERIFF
                It s your call, but we don t know 
                what s out there.  Could be 
                fallout.  Could be the Chinese army 
                for all we know.  

  The Mayor thinks.  Makes the tough call.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Folks, I m sorry, but I want the 
                police out there finding your kids.  
                Not you.
                      (off their outrage)
                You re safe here.  And God forbid 
                you go out there, get stranded, and 
                your child comes back an orphan.  
                We ll get your kids.  I promise.

  The parents are furious.  Peter stares daggers at Gray 
  Anderson.  The Mayor pulls the sheriff aside.  Whispers.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                I know the school bus has to come 
                first, but Jake...

                              SHERIFF
                We ll get your son, Mr. Mayor.

  The sheriff pats his shoulder and moves.  Gray approaches.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                What can I do, sir?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Peter and I will find a way to call  
                the governor.  I need you to 
                  coordinate with the fire department 
                to make sure no citizens leave 
                town.  It could be a death trap out 
                there.  No one s dying on my watch.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                Anything I can do, Mr. Mayor.

  Gray leaves.  The Mayor watches him.  The look on his face 
  gives new meaning to the word mistrust.


  In stark contrast to the chaos we ve seen, Emily Spenser is 
  still in her own world.  Her iPod is still playing romantic 
  music.  She's still smiling at the champagne, the candles, 
  the "Welcome Home, Roger" sign.  And suddenly...                                                                                29.



                              EMILY
                Oh, God!

  We might think she just reacted to the tragedy.  But no.  The 
  clock on the wall reads: 9:30pm.  She takes off her iPod, 
  rushes over to the table, and grabs her keys, revealing...

  The Post-It note.  Roger s flight.  Kansas City Airport.  
  11:00pm.  In a dash, Emily is out the door.


  Emily turns the key.  The radio plays static.  But she has a 
  CD in there before it even registers to her that something is 
  wrong.  The romantic music continues.  


  Mayor Green and Peter sit with the radio operator, trying 
  channel after channel.  Static.  Static.

                              RADIO OPERATOR
                We have our frequencies, sir.  But 
                outside.  It s like no one s there.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Is the problem digital?

                              RADIO OPERATOR
                Maybe.  We could switch to CB but 
                it only has a radius of 15 miles.  
                That doesn t get us to the highway.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                What about analog?  A ham radio?

                              RADIO OPERATOR
                That s better, but we sold those 
                off when we switched to digital.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                I know where we can get one.  Come 
                on, Peter.

                              PETER
                Dad, stay.  We ll send somebody.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                No.  He won t talk to anybody else.
                      (to radio operator)
                Try the CB.  We ll be back.                                                                                33.




  GRACIE LEIGH, her gossip long forgotten, throws black spray 
  paint in a bag.  Alvie s mother digs in her purse for money.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                Mrs. Clemons, put your money away.  
                We re in this together, right?

  She nods.  Grateful.  Gracie turns to Stephanie, staring 
  absently at the cosmetics section.  Thinking of her mother.

                                GRACIE LEIGH (CONT D)
                  Stephanie, remember what the Mayor 
                said.  One explosion isn t an 
                attack.  Right now, your mom could 
                be calling you, worried.

  Stephanie nods.  Somewhat comforted.


  The ramshackle trailer is cold and messy.  One photograph of 
  Dale Turner and his mother at a little league game.  Even in 
  the picture, his mother is holding a beer.  Dale Turner sits 
    motionless in front of the answering machine.  We hear his 
  mother s voice on tape...

                                DALE S MOTHER (V.O.)
                      (drunk)
                ... sorry I didn t call sooner, 
                Dale, but we decided to stay a 
                couple extra days in Boulder.

                                BOYFRIEND (V.O.)
                      (drunker)
                Put down the phone and come to bed.

                                DALE S MOTHER (V.O.)
                      (laughs)
                Stop that.  It s my kid.  Honey? 
                Honey, what are you starin  at...

  A low rumble.  Glass shattering.  And then... silence.  Dale 
  hits rewind.  Then, he presses play.  From the look on his 
  face, we get the feeling he s been doing this for an hour.

                                DALE S MOTHER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      (drunk)
                ... sorry I didn t call sooner, 
                Dale, but we decided to stay--

    Mercifully for Dale, the power blows.                                                                                34.




  Jake enters the bus and looks around.  We don t see it, but 
  his face tells us the whole picture...

                              JAKE
                Jesus.                                                                                35.




  The image darts around with Jake as he takes in the sights of 
  the bus.  The BUS DRIVER is passed out on the driver s seat 
  with a severe concussion.  Jake checks his pulse.  Alive.

                              WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                What s happening?

  Jake turns to his left.  The pretty teacher, HEATHER 
  LISINSKI, 26, slammed into the metal partition when the bus 
  collided with the tree.  She s breathing shallow.  Bleeding 
  from the forehead.  But still conscious.  Frightened.

                              JAKE
                I don t know.  Are you okay?

                              HEATHER
                I can t move.

                              JAKE
                Can you feel your toes?

                              HEATHER
                Yes.  But I think... my insides.  
                Are we under attack?

                              JAKE
                It was one explosion.  That s not 
                an attack yet.

  Jake takes off his coat.  Puts it on her to keep her warm.

                              HEATHER
                Don t worry about me.  Worry about 
                them.

  Jake turns his attention to the school bus.  The children are 
    terrified.  Some cry.  With a never-ending chorus of... 

                                DIFFERENT KIDS
                 Mister, I want to go home.    I 
                want my mommy.   I m hungry.  
                 Please, Mister.    I m scared.   
                 They re coming to kill us. 

  And through the din, one little boy shouts at Jake.                                                                                36.



                                LITTLE BOY
                Mister, she s sick.  Mister, she 
                can t breathe.

  Jake finally focuses on the little boy.  

                              JAKE
                What?  

  The little boy gestures to a little BLONDE GIRL, shaking with 
  terror, her hands holding her neck.  Jake rushes over.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                What s wrong?  What s wrong with 
                her?

                                LITTLE BOY
                When the bus stopped, Stacy was 
                like this...

  The little boy puts his chin on the seat in front of him.  
  Jake moves his gaze to the frightened Blonde Girl.  In a 
  flash, Jake s mind puts the pieces together.  The little 
  Blonde Girl took the whole impact on her throat.

                              JAKE
                Are you okay?  Let me see.

  The little Blonde Girl removes her hands.  Her throat is 
  severely swollen.  Jake does his best to stay calm.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                      (to Heather)
                Do you have an ice pack?  We have 
                to stop the swelling now.

  Heather weakly points to the first aid kit.  The little Blond 
  Girl starts panting.  Jake turns back to her.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                It s okay, Stacy.  Calm down.

  A little boy brings the first aid kit over.  The little 
  Blonde Girl looks at it.  Panicked.  Breathing faster.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Just breathe normally.  You re 
                going to be okay.

  The girl nods.  Terrified.  Her breathing faster.                                                                                  37.



                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Oh, God.  Calm down.  You re making 
                it worse.  

  Jake fumbles for the emergency ice pack.  Punches it to break 
  the seal.  Shakes it up.  The girl s eyes start to flutter.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Stay with me.  Come on.

  The girl gives Jake a look of sheer horror, then she 
  collapses in his arms.  The children scream. 

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Wake up.  Wake up.

  He lays the girl on the floor and puts the ice pack on her 
  throat.  He frantically searches his pockets.  He rushes over 
  to the coat and pulls out the flask.  He puts the metal of it 
  near her nose.  No breath.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Dammit!


  The school kids are beside themselves with panic.  They re 
  shouting.  Crying.  Jake rummages through the first aid kit.  
    Band-aids.  Gauze.  Not what he needs.                                                                                  39.



                              JAKE
                Kids, calm down.  I need to focus.  
                Please.  I need quie-- DAMMIT!  
                WOULD YOU SHUT THE HELL UP!?

  His shouting only made it worse.  And then, out of nowhere...

                              HEATHER
                THE FIRST PERSON WHO STOPS TALKING 
                DOESN T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL 
                  TOMORROW!

  Immediate silence.  Jake looks at Heather, who nods at him.  
   Go ahead.   As he rummages through the bus driver s pockets, 
  Jake turns to the kids.

                              JAKE
                Kids.  I need everyone right now to 
                help me.  Who has a pen?  Anyone 
                have a pen?

                                LITTLE BOY
                      (hopeful)
                We have pencils.

                              JAKE
                No.  A tube.  Something hollow.  A 
                straw.

                              GIRL (O.S.)
                I have a straw.

                              JAKE
                Who said that?

  A girl raises her hand.  Jake rushes over to her.  

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Let me see it.  Let me see it.  

  She hands him her... juice box.  Jake pulls out the straw.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                It s too thin.  Does anyone else 
                have a juice box?

  30 hands go up.  

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Get them out.  Now.  What s your 
                name?

  Jake points to the first little girl who raised her hand.                                                                                40.



                              JULIE
                Julie.

                              JAKE
                Give your straws to Julie.  Quick.

  Jake moves back to the first aid kit.  Grabs two band-aids.  
  The kids all hand the straws to Julie.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Kids, put the straws in a circle.

  The kids do it literally.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                      (barks)
                No.  No.  No.  Not a circle circle.

  The kids don t understand.  Heather gestures with her hand...

                              HEATHER
                Like your moms when they measure 
                  spaghetti.  Or pick up sticks 
                before you drop them.

  The kids get it.  They start putting the juice box straws in 
  a tight bunch, making the equivalent of a wide straw.  Jake 
  hands 2 band aids to Julie.

                              JAKE
                Make it tight.

  Jake fumbles through his pockets as Heather guides the kids.

                              HEATHER
                      (calm)
                Nice and tight on the bottom.  Good 
                Julie.  Now, the top.  Nice, Roy.

  Jake pulls out his father s... SWISS ARMY KNIFE.  He opens 
  the knife and flask.  Then, he douses the blade with alcohol.


  The Young Cop keeps looking at the Geiger counter.  Paranoid.

                              JIMMY (V.O.)
                Sheriff.  Anything?  Over.

                              SHERIFF
                No.  We don t-- wait.  I see 
                  something.  This could be it.                                                                                41.




  Jake bends over the Blonde girl.  The kids lean, staring.

                              HEATHER
                Give him some room, kids.  

  The kids back away.  Jake grips the knife in his right hand.  
  He looks at the soft skin in the divit below her neck.  He 
  puts his sprained left arm on the girl s chest.  Winces.

                              JAKE
                Who s the strongest kid?

  17 hands go up.  8 boys.  7 girls.   Me.    Me.    Me. 

                              HEATHER
                Danny.  You.

  Danny, wide-eyed, approaches.

                              JAKE
                Danny.  I hurt my left arm.  I need 
                you to hold down her shoulders in 
                case she wakes up.  And don t look.

  Danny is frightened, but does as he s told.  Jake bends over, 
  his left arm now on her forehead.  He brings the blade to her 
  neck.  Danny shuts his eyes.  We don t see it.  But Jake 
  starts making the incision.  Danny slowly peaks open his left 
  eye.  Curiosity killed the cat.  We see Danny s reaction to 
  the blood.  And Jake s focus.  

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                Grab the gauze.  Stay with me, son.


  Jimmy drives.  Bill s in the passenger seat.

                              SHERIFF (V.O.)
                Jimmy.  We see the bus.

                              JIMMY
                Thank God.  What s your 20?

                              SHERIFF (V.O.)
                About 6 miles west of 183.

                              JIMMY
                You want us?                                                                                42.



                              SHERIFF (V.O.)
                Keep looking for Jake.

                              JIMMY
                10-4.

  Jimmy holsters the radio.  After all the intense focus of the 
  last few hours, the relief breaks him.  He starts crying.

                              BILL
                Better not let the sheriff catch 
                you do that.

  Jimmy smiles.  Bill pats his back.


  Jake finishes the incision and lifts up his arm.  He wipes 
  his forearm on his forehead.  Blood.  He nods to Danny, who 
  gives him the gauze.  Jake mops up the small pool of blood on 
  the girl s neck.

                              JAKE
                Julie.  Where are my straws?

  Julie hands him the juice box straws all wrapped tight.  He 
  brings the contraption to the incision.  Danny watches as 
  Jake inserts the juice box straws into the incision.  His 
  mouth hangs open.   Wow.   Jake bends down, revealing the CPR 
  sign behind him.  He moves his mouth to the straws.  He 
  blows.  The girl s chest doesn t move.  

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Come on, Stacy.


  Through the windshield, we see a bus.  The men in the 
  sheriff s car are ecstatic.

                              SHERIFF
                Let s not start cheering.  Stay 
                focused.  They may need help.

  The car stops.  The Sheriff and his men move toward the bus.


  Danny hands Jake 2 band-aids.  Jake quickly tapes them around 
  the juice box straws to make the seal around the air hole 
  tighter.  He moves to it again.  Blows into the tube.  The 
  girl s chest moves up and down.  Jake blows again.                                                                                43.



                              JAKE
                Come on, kid.

  He blows again.  Again.  Finally, the little girl takes a 
  breath on her own.  The kids are awestruck.  Jake exhales.  
  He looks at the blood on his shaking hands.

                              HEATHER
                How did you know how to do that?

  Jake turns to the pretty teacher.

                              JAKE
                Military school.  My father sent 
                me.

                              HEATHER
                Were you a soldier?

                              JAKE
                No.  A screw up.


  Gail and Ann open the door to reveal... Stanley and Bonnie 
  Peterson.  Stanley is sad.  Bonnie is shell-shocked.

                              STANLEY
                Mrs. Green, we uh... we saw 
                  something.  It s horrible.  You 
                should get Jake and your husband.


  Gracie walks through the darkness.  Every corner has 
  something that looks like an attacker.  A broom.  A globe.  
  Finally, a KNOCK makes her scream.  She shines the flashlight 
  through the glass door.  Standing there is Dale Turner.                                                                                45.




  The cell phone casts a glow on Stanley Peterson, Bonnie, Ann, 
  and finally Gail, who holds the cell phone to her face and 
  looks at the picture on it.

                              GAIL
                Oh, dear God.


  Heather and the children watch Jake as his foot slips off the 
  tire iron and his bad leg buckles.  Shrieking with pain.

                              JAKE (O.S.)
                WHERE S THE GOD DAMN RESCUE PARTY!?


  Jimmy and Bill look at the highway.

                              BILL
                It s like a ghost town.

                              JIMMY
                Bill, let s face it.  He didn t 
                come this way.


  Jake rushes into the bus.  

                              JAKE
                Kids.  I need you.  Now, dammit.

                              JULIE
                Mister, you swear a lot.                                                                                46.



  Jake and Heather exchange a brief smile and then... he looks 
  her over.  She is getting more and more pale.

                              JAKE
                How you holding up?

                              HEATHER
                      (not fine)
                Fine.  How about your leg?

  Jake s eyes say it all.  He s losing blood fast.

                              HEATHER (CONT D)
                Hurry.


  Silence like a heartbeat.  Gail s eyes scan Bonnie s cell 
  phone again.  We see her boyfriend s smiling face.  Then, the 
  image pans to reveal... the fire ball 5 miles behind him.  

  Gail turns to Stanley, sad, and Bonnie, who is on Mars with 
  shock.  Gail struggles to keep her own composure.

                              GAIL
                Where was this?

                              STANLEY
                Atlanta, Mrs. Green.

                              GAIL
                We ll notify the Mayor.  Thank you, 
                Stanley.  Bonnie.  God bless you.

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                Ma am... I m sure Jake will be 
                okay.

  Gail nods.  Thank you.  Stanley nods back.  Truth is, neither 
  of them are sure.  Especially when...

                                BONNIE PETERSON
                No, he s not.  He s not okay.  
                Nobody is okay.

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                Bonnie--

                                BONNIE PETERSON
                Jake s dead.  Don t you get that?  
                Why don t you get that?  He s dead.                                                                                47.




  An ANGRY CROWD stares down the convenience store CLERK.

                              ANGRY MAN
                But what if ours is contaminated?!

                              CLERK
                Folks, I can t let you have the 
                water without paying for it.

                              ANGRY WOMAN
                It s not my fault your credit card 
                  machine s down!


  The tavern is now half full.  The people with no families to 
  go home to are riding this out together.  The doors burst 
  open and the Mayor shouts at the SEXY BARMAID, known to her 
  friends and neighbors as MARY BAILEY, 32.

                              MAYOR GREEN (O.S.)
                Mary!  We need your generator!


  Gail hands a sealed envelope to the EMT Crew Chief.

                              GAIL
                Get this letter to my husband 
                  immediately.


  Over the shouting protests of the Clerk, the angry crowd 
  begins taking the convenience store s water supply.

                              CLERK
                Where are you going!?  You can t 
                just take it!


  Dale Turner leaves the store through the back, his arms 
  loaded with frozen foods.  Gracie is confused and frightened.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                Dale, what are you doing, honey?  
                Please, don t steal from me!


  The lights come on.  The frightened crowd surrounds the Mayor 
  as he turns on the ham radio.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                This is Mayor Johnston Green of 
                Jericho, Kansas... we are trying to 
                contact the governor, the national 
                guard, and the Crawford Power 
                plant.  Is anyone there?


  Mayor Green keeps trying channels.  Static.  Static.  Mary 
  Bailey looks at Peter.  Peter looks away.  The EMT CREW CHIEF 
  enters with the sealed envelope.

                              EMT CREW CHIEF
                Sir... a letter from your wife.


  The crowd watches as Mayor Green reads the letter.  We see a 
  few words.   Bonnie Peterson...   Atlanta...   At the bottom 
  of the letter...  Honey, how many pills do you have left? 

                              PETER
                What does the letter say, dad?


  Julie sits with Heather, who looks ghastly now.

                              HILDA
                Miss?

                              HEATHER
                Yes, Julie?                                                                                53.



                              JULIE
                Are we going to have school 
                anymore?

  Heather is about to say,  Of course  when she stops.  She 
  realizes she has no idea what tomorrow will bring.

                              HEATHER
                We ll figure it out, honey.

                              JULIE
                I vote no.

  Heather smiles, weakly.  Just then, Hilda and the two boys 
  rush into the bus, followed by Jake.  He moves to the school 
  bus driver, grabs him with his right arm, and struggles to 
  drag him out of the seat.


  Mayor Green looks at the frightened crowd.  Somberly.  He 
  folds the letter.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Bonnie Peterson's boyfriend was 
                killed outside of Atlanta by... 
                another explosion.  We can rule out 
                  accidents now.  We re under attack.


  The Mayor turns back to the ham radio.  He struggles to keep 
  his composure in front of the distraught crowd as he leans 
  into the ham radio microphone.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                This is Mayor Johnston Green of 
                Jericho, Kansas.  Is there anyone 
                out there who might have seen...
                      (voice breaks)
                ... my son?                                                                                54.




  Jake gets in the driver s seat.  He starts the engine.  He 
  blinks twice.  Feeling faint.  His leg bleeding.  He fights 
  it.  But he can t.  He collapses.  His head hits the steering 
  wheel with a...


  GONG!  The church bell is ringing.  The Mayor, Peter, Mary 
  Bailey, and the others look at each other.


  Hilda, crying, pounds on Jake s shoulders.

                              HILDA
                Mister, wake up!  Please, wake up!


  Hilda pounds on him.  Jake opens his eyes.  Shakes out the 
  cobwebs.  Hilda keeps punching.

                              JAKE
                Thanks, Hilda.  You can stop 
                hitting me now.


  GONG!  Stanley Peterson puts a comforting hand on Bonnie s 
  shoulder.  She begins to cry.                                                                                55.




  Jake looks at the odometer.  The gas gauge is hovering on 
  empty.  He turns to Heather, who fights to stay awake.

                              JAKE
                Don t you quit on me.

  Heather nods, weakly.  Jake turns back to the road, looks to 
  his left, and his eyes open WIDE.


  The gas gauge is now below the red.  Jake glares at it.  
  Woozy, he blinks a couple of times.  Pale.  He turns and sees 
  Heather, who smiles at him weakly.  Until...

                              JAKE
                Does this bus have a gas can?

  She shakes her head, no.  Jake looks at the gas gauge again.  
  Looks at the rearview mirror at the children.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                Kids... do you know what road we re 
                on? 
                      (off their  no )
                This is Cedar Run.  If you go 
                straight ahead for a long way, 
                you ll come to a stop light.  Then, 
                if you make a left...

                              JULIE
                Which way is left?

  Jake looks at Heather, who nods, sadly.  She understands that 
  the children might have to make it back on their own.

                              HEATHER
                      (gestures with her hand)
                If you hold up your hand and stick 
                out your thumb, it makes an  L , 
                see?  That s left.

  Jake smiles at Heather.

                              JAKE
                They don t pay you enough.
                      (to kids)
                So, kids, turn in the direction of 
                the  L  and walk straight ahead for 
                a long way.  That s where town is.

  The kids all nod to each other.   Oh.   And then...

                              JULIE
                Why are you telling us this?

  Jake looks at Heather.

                              JAKE
                You want to take this one?                                                                                58.




  The crowd is noisy.  Torches, flashlights, and lanterns 
    illuminate faces, casting shadows.  Gray Anderson stands at 
  the pulpit as Mayor Green moves to the front of the room.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                With all due respect, Mr. Mayor, 
                this isn t a debate about road 
                signs and taxes.  We have a missing 
                bus.  No police.  Fireman doing 
                  policemen's jobs.  No plan.

                              PETER
                Gray, how dare you politicize--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                      (under his breath)
                Dammit, Peter.

  Big reaction.  The crowd split down the middle.  Some 
  shouting,  Yes!   Some shouting,  No!   Gail sighs.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                  Politicize?  Peter, I m not talking 
                to my opponent.  I m talking to my 
                Mayor.  There was almost a riot at 
                the Shell station, and I haven t 
                seen him in hours.  What?  You 
                think I planned that just to get a 
                few votes?  

  Peter is silenced.  He sits down.  

                              GRAY ANDERSON (CONT D)
                I don t care about the election.  I 
                care about survival.  We might be 
                on our own here, and I need to know 
                what my Mayor intends to do.

  The Mayor takes the stage.  Scans the crowd.  He collects 
  himself and gives a heartfelt address.  He means every word.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Folks, I know we ve been through a 
                lot tonight, but I want to tell you 
                  something.  I have been to big 
                cities.  I have been to foreign 
                  countries.  And I would take the 
                good people...

  Shep, the union boss, nods.  He s not being cruel, but...                                                                                59.



                              SHEP
                ... good people of Jericho over any 
                city.  We know, Mr. Mayor.  We ve 
                heard the speech.  We need to know 
                what you re going to do now.

  The Mayor is taken aback.  If he weren t such a proud man, 
  you might have seen his heart break a little bit.  Gail 
  watches, concerned.  Not for the Mayor.  For her husband.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Well, uh... Shep, I hope you don t 
                think I ve been asleep at the 
                switch here.  I have spent tonight 
                trying to contact the governor to 
                  coordin--

                              SHEP
                But what if the governor is dead, 
                Mr. Mayor?

  That starts the seed.  People we ve come to know begin asking 
  the real questions.  Some helpful.  Some frightened.  Louder 
  and louder.  The Mayor does his best to keep up.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Now, hold on.  There have been no 
                reports of anything happening to 
                Topek--

                              IRATE WOMAN
                How are there going to be reports 
                with no phones?

                                NORMAN PERRY
                Or no televisions.

              MAYOR GREENSTEPHANIE

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                How are we going to get the power 
                back on, Mr. Mayor?                                                                                60.



              WOMAN S VOICEMAN S VOICE
  What about firewood?  I m Is the drinking water okay?


                              MAYOR GREEN
                Folks, one at a time.

                BURLY MANJIMMY S MARGARET
  What happens when we run out Let the Mayor speak!


  Gray Anderson slowly steps back into the shadows and watches 
  as the town swallows the Mayor with questions he can t 
  possibly answer.  Peter bangs the pulpit for order.  People 
  shout at him angrily.  Teasing.

                              SHEP
                Oh, Peter, put your gavel away.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Please, folks.  Calm down.

                              IRATE FATHER
                Calm down?  My boy is still out 
                there, and you--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                The sheriff is looking for your boy 
                and my boy right now.

                              IRATE MOTHER
                And why weren t there more police 
                in the budget?!

                              IRATE WOMAN
                Why didn t we have more emergency 
                workers?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                The school needed books.

  Gail joins the fray.

                              GAIL
                People, please.  This shouting 
                isn t helping anything.

  She is swallowed.  Voices shouting.  Gray Anderson watches 
  the chaos with a measured eye.  A faint, pleased look.  He 
  takes the stage, raises his arms to give the town the 
    leadership it needs, and just as he opens his mouth...

  HONK.  HONK.  HONK.                                                                                61.




  Jake, relieved almost to the point of tears, puts the bus in 
  park.  And turns off the engine with a shaking hand.


  Heather and Jake ride in the back of the Ambulance.  Jake 
  turns to Heather.  They smile.  A lifetime in one night.

                              JAKE
                What s your name?

                              HEATHER
                Heather.

                              JAKE
                Jake.

                              HEATHER
                It s nice to meet you, Jake.

                              JAKE
                You, too.

  They both finally close their eyes for sleep.


  We see the champagne.  The ice is now melted.  We see the 
   Welcome Home, Roger  sign.  We see the candles, still 
  waiting to be lit.  We end on the Post-It Note: Roger s 
  flight.  Kansas City Airport.  11:00pm.
