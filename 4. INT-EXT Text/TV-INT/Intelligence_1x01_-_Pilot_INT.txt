      CAMERA GLIDES through a moment FROZEN IN TIME - a THREE 
      DIMENSIONAL SNAPSHOT of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. BODIES are 
      strewn across the floor, MASKED GUNMEN POINT AUTOMATIC 
      WEAPONS, a WOMAN squats in a corner, holding her ears in mid-
      scream, a window has just shattered, GLASS FROZEN IN AIR. 

      [This  CYBER-RENDERING  will be explained, but to see a 
      visual example of what we re imagining please CLICK HERE.]

      CAMERA continues to glide past these STILL IMAGES, until... A 
      quick glance at a MIRROR and WE SEE MOVEMENT. It s Gabriel, 
      the only figure moving through the eerie and surreal scene. 

      He s searching for something - someone. As he walks, 
      something else begins to happen. The walls deconstruct and in 
      their place we see a DATA STREAM - PHOTOS, NEWSPAPER 
      HEADLINES, TV TALKING HEADS, SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS - all 
      related to the Mumbai attacks. 

      CLOSE ON GABRIEL S MOUTH as he whispers...

                                    GABRIEL
                    Amelia, where are you? 

      PULL BACK from his lips and WE RE...  INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                2



      Gabriel continues to move through the macabre scene and spots 
      the woman he s looking for...

                                    GABRIEL
                    No... Amelia, no. 

      He approaches the frozen figure of AMELIA HAYTES, a striking, 
      beautiful, Caucasian woman, 30, blue backpack slung over one 
      shoulder, an AUTOMATIC RIFLE in her hands, angrily pointing 
      it at a group of HOSTAGES. Standing next to her is another 
      GUNMAN, the FLAME from his gun barrel suspended in mid-burst. 
      As Gabriel approaches them, WE SEE a rapid DATA STREAM in 
      Gabriel s POV - THE MAN S NAME, COUNTRY OF ORIGIN - PAKISTAN - 
      AND HIS INTERNATIONAL RAP SHEET. Gabriel turns back to Amelia 
      and a similar DATA STREAM flashes various images, a CIA ID, 
      and her name. 

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    How could you...

      WE HEAR a LOUD VOICE of someone speaking over a PA, IN HINDI. 

                                  AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
                          (subtitled)
                      Attention, this is the Indian Coast 
                    Guard, prepare to be boarded!

      CLOSE ON Gabriel, as he TURNS toward the VOICE, the entire 
      hotel lobby falling away, revealing that we re back on... 



      Gabriel is being questioned by an Indian Intelligence Officer 
      named BADRI ADANI. 

                                  BADRI ADANI
                    You are in Indian waters, on a 
                    rented boat, with no papers, no 
                    passport. 

      Gabriel doesn t respond. 

                                  BADRI ADANI (CONT D)
                    What were you doing twenty miles 
                    off shore all by yourself? 

      Gabriel glances up at the CAMERA pointed at him from above. 
      Switch to CAMERA POV of Gabriel staring at us. 



      Outside the door, a similar CAMERA is aimed down the 
      corridor. 

      CAMERA POV: A FEMALE OFFICER approaches, carrying a CUP OF 
      COFFEE. She types in a series of numbers on the ELECTRIC DOOR 
      LOCK. 



      Gabriel looks at the door as the final ELECTRONIC BEEP of the 
      door combination signals the CLICK of the door opening. The 
      female officer enters and hands Adani his coffee.

                                  FEMALE OFFICER
                          (Hindi, subtitled)
                    We re pulling into port now. 

      Adani smiles at her, which Gabriel notices, and she leaves. 
      Adani takes a sip of his coffee and continues...

                                  BADRI ADANI
                    At eighteen hundred hours, we were 
                    alerted to a Level One sigint 
                    breach on a highly protected 
                    military geosync satellite. We 
                    sourced the signal to your vessel, 
                    yet we didn t find any 
                      communication equipment on board, 
                    let alone with the processing power 
                    to break through a Helio-encrypted 
                    fire wall. Can you explain that?   INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                4


                                    GABRIEL
                    You know, she doesn t like the 
                    attention you give her. 

                                  BADRI ADANI
                    What are you talking about? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    That officer. Abhilasha. She s 
                    married and you make her 
                      uncomfortable. 

                                  BADRI ADANI
                    How do you know her name? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    In fact, she s afraid of you. Why 
                    is that, Badri? 

                                  BADRI ADANI
                    I haven t told you my first name. 

      Gabriel looks at the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA again. 

      CAMERA S POV - LOOKING BACK AT GABRIEL. He s looking back at 
      himself, through the camera. CUT TO: 



      CAMERA POV of the HALLWAY. Empty. 



                                  BADRI ADANI
                    How do you know who I am? Who are 
                    you? 

      Gabriel looks at the door and the LOCK STARTS DIALING. Adani 
      follows Gabriel s gaze to the door as it CLICKS, but doesn t 
      open. He walks to the door and opens it, finding no one 
      outside. He suddenly realizes something...

                                  BADRI ADANI (CONT D)
                    Did you just do that? 

      He turns back to Gabriel, but the CHAIR IS EMPTY -- SLAM, 
      Adani crashes against the wall and the last thing he sees are 
      Gabriel s feet running up the corridor.   INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                5



      Alarms blare as Gabriel runs down another corridor. He 
      reaches a ladder and CLIMBS IT QUICKLY, just as AN INDIAN 
      SAILOR come running toward him. He turns behind him and TWO 
      MORE are coming from that direction. He runs toward the 
      single sailor. The sailor STRIKES, but Gabriel parries the 
      blow, his other fist snapping like gun hammer into the man s 
      throat. The sailor staggers backward, gasping, as Gabriel 
      heads toward a ladder. 



      The sounds of Riley s footsteps and that of her driver echo 
      down the empty hallway, approaching another guard desk. The 
      double doors behind the desk open and a woman steps out. 
      She s LILLIAN STRAND, 50. Lillian has strong, attractive 
      features, piercing eyes, conservative suit, and an all-
      business demeanor. 

                                  RILEY
                    Pleasure to finally meet you, Ms. 
                    Strand. I ve heard a lot ab...

                                    LILLIAN
                    This way, please. 

      The driver stays behind, as Riley follows Lillian back 
      through the double doors and into: 



      It s a sprawling collection of LAB STATIONS, populated by 
      hundreds of MEN and WOMEN in WHITE COATS.   INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                7


      They pass a section where a woman wearing an EXOSKELETON runs 
      on a treadmill at 40mph, as TECHNICIANS monitor her.

                                    LILLIAN
                      I understand you have questions. 

                                  RILEY
                    I was ordered to go through months 
                    of testing and vetting and nobody 
                    will even tell me what the job is. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    That s because the position itself 
                    is Classified Code Word. 

      Riley expects Lillian to tell her about the job, but Lillian 
      just keeps walking. They pass a lab station where a man with 
      EEG sensors on his head sits quietly reading the newspaper. 
      As he does, the WORDS of the article he s reading APPEAR ONE 
      BY ONE ON THE MONITOR on the wall. 

                                  RILEY
                    What s he doing? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Word Mapping. Ever word has a 
                      corresponding brain signal. We re 
                      translating them in real time. 

                                  RILEY
                    Is that even possible? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    What do you know about CyberCom? 

                                  RILEY
                    I know you re responsible for cyber 
                    security for the government. 

                                    LILLIAN
                      CyberCom s purview includes the 
                      development of genetics, robotics, 
                      artificial intelligence and 
                      nanotechnology, as well as data 
                    mining, DeepNet salvage, 
                      cryptanlysis, and protection of the 
                    Global Information Grid. And then 
                    there s Clockwork.

                                  RILEY
                      Clockwork?

      Two ARMED SOLDIERS open a set of double doors for them.   INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                8



      They walk down a long corridor toward another set of doors. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Last year, 60 Minutes first aired a 
                    story about a quadriplegic who 
                    could operate a robotic arm with 
                    her mind. The microchip attached to 
                    her brain was created right here. 
                    But Clockwork took it further than 
                    we could ever imagine. 

      They reach the doors at the other end of the hallway. A small 
      sign says,  CLOCKWORK.  Two more ARMED GUARDS open the doors. 



      They enter a walkway surrounding the glass walls of a round 
      room - THE LAB. A few TECHNICIANS work on equipment 
      surrounding an examination table, on which lies a MAN, the 
      top of his head facing us, so we can t see him just yet. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Once we started translating the 
                    brain s signals - phase syncrony, 
                    neural integration, proteomics - we 
                    realized we could facilitate a 
                    direct neural interface that could 
                    access the entire electromagnetic 
                    spectrum - telephone, internet, 
                    radio, satellite... 

                                  RILEY
                    Are you saying you put a computer 
                    in a man s brain? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    I m saying we created a man who is 
                    the first of his kind. An advanced 
                      intelligence agent. 

      Now we see the man on the table. It s Gabriel. His eyes are 
      closed, as a TECHNICIAN works a computer next to him. 

                                    LILLIAN (CONT D)
                    We built an agency complex around 
                    him - analysts, tack teams, field 
                    ops. When a situation rises to a 
                    certain level of national security, 
                    the Director of National 
                      Intelligence brings us in. 
                                  (MORE)  INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                9

                                    LILLIAN (CONT D)
                    Gabriel s been active for six 
                    months and since then, we ve 
                    enjoyed an 85% success rate. 
                    Included in that success is the 
                    thwarting of the Super Bowl bomber. 

                                  RILEY
                    I thought that was CIA? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    You haven t been cleared to think 
                    anything different. 

      Lillian opens the door and leads Riley into...



      Lillian and Riley enter. 

                                  RILEY
                    What are they doing to him? 

      The technician, AMOS PEMBROKE (29), looks up. Lillian nods 
      that he can answer. 

                                  AMOS
                    Stuxnet Two eradication. 

                                  RILEY
                    Stuxnet? The computer virus? 

      He looks at Lillian. She nods again. 

                                  AMOS
                    Virus? Please. Stuxnet is the 
                    world s first weaponized cyber 
                    worm, a digital cruise missile. We 
                    took out Iran s nuke program first, 
                    and now North Korea. Boo-yah. 
                          (beat)
                    Of course, the only way to plant it 
                    in an isolated, bunkerized system, 
                    four stories underground, was for 
                    Gabriel to carry it himself...
                          (points to Gabriel s head)
                    Which is why we re making sure none 
                    of the code burrowed in. 

                                  RILEY
                    Is he under anaesthesia? INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                10


                                    GABRIEL
                    He wishes. 
                          (opens his eyes)
                    Riley. You ve changed your hair 
                    color. 

                                  RILEY
                    I m sorry, have we met? 

      Now we see Riley from GABRIEL S POV. A facial recognition 
      program draws lines around her face, measuring distance 
      between eyes, etc., as DATA STREAMS, including flashes of 
      TEXT and PHOTOS - are on each side of the screen. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    No, but wow. 

                                  RILEY
                    What does that mean? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    That nude photo you sent to your 
                    boyfriend in college. And they re 
                    yours. Nice. 

                                  RILEY
                    Excuse me? 

      Riley looks at Lillian, who isn t amused. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Gotta be careful when you send 
                    pictures out there. It s called 
                    Digital Permanence, right Amos? 

                                  AMOS
                    Don t worry, he can t print. 
                    By the way, I m Amos Pembroke, 
                    Gabriel s pri-tech. 

                                  RILEY

                                  RILEY
                    I was a bad test taker. Who the 
                    hell do you think you are? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Whoa, I just found a sealed 
                    juvenile record?

                    Gabriel, don t open that file. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    What s in it? Shoplifting? 
                          (hands up in surrender)
                    Fine. But tell me, how does the 
                    daughter of a surgeon and a chemist 
                    become a Secret Service Agent? 

      In GABRIEL S POV we FLASH to various images in rapid fire, 
      FAMILY PHOTOS, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, FACEBOOK PAGES. Finally, 
      a quick shot of President OBAMA getting into a limo, RILEY 
      CLOSING THE LIMO DOOR, an earpiece in her ear. 

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    Youngest woman ever assigned to 
                      presidential detail. That s the 
                    beginning of a storied career. And 
                    now what? Follow around a charming 
                    devil with a chip in his brain? 

                                  RILEY
                      Impressive. Almost every word of 
                    that was accurate. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Almost? Which word did I get wrong? 

                                  RILEY
                    Charming. 

      Amos stifles a laugh. Gabriel shoots him a look. Lillian is 
      suddenly very satisfied with her choice in Riley. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                          (to Lillian)
                    You should find someone else. 

      Riley walks out. Lillian glares at Gabriel. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Nice try. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                12



      Riley walks down the hall. Lillian steps out of the lab, 
      calmly watching her. A moment later, Riley opens the door and 
      an ALARM SOUNDS and the ARMED GUARDS appear. Riley turns back 
      to Lillian, gestures to the guards to stand down. One of them 
      types a code into a wall keypad, the alarm stops. The doors 
      close again, leaving Riley and Lillian in the empty hallway. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    We looked at the best agents from 
                    every discipline. Of the top 
                    twenty, you re the only one we 
                    brought here. 

                                  RILEY
                    I m a secret service agent. What 
                    could you possibly want me for? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    In that room is the most valuable 
                    piece of technology this country s 
                    ever produced. What do I want you 
                    for? You re going to protect it for 
                    us. 

      Off Riley s look...

                                            ACT ONE



      Standing at the sink, hand washing the dishes, DR. WILLIAM 
      CRISPIN, 70, talks out loud. Nobody else is in the room. Is 
      he insane? 

                                    CRISPIN
                    Albert, when I was at NASA in  69, 
                    we sent an astronaut to the moon. A 
                    cell phone today has a million 
                    times more computer power than we 
                    put on that spacecraft. Technology 
                    isn t revolutionary. It s 
                      evolutionary. Oh, that s good. I 
                    like that. 

      Crispin opens the refrigerator, takes out a carton of milk 
      and pours a glass for himself and then pours a bowl for the 
      cat who just landed on the kitchen counter. Then, a SOUND. 

                                    CRISPIN (CONT D)
                    Sounds like our raccoons are back. 

      Crispin walks to the large window. He can t see anything 
      outside, only his reflection in the window. He turns off the 
      lights, the outdoors now materializing in the relative 
      darkness. 

                                    CRISPIN (CONT D)
                    Think I ll keep you inside tonight. 

      The CAT SHRIEKS. Crispin quickly turns on a light, 
        revealing... A MASKED MAN WITH A GUN. The CAT RUNS, knocking 
      the glass of milk and a stack of papers to the floor. The 
      glass SHATTERS, shards of glass and a fallen VOICE RECORDER 
      scattering under the refrigerator.

                                    CRISPIN (CONT D)
                    Please! Take whatever you want! 

      The GUNMAN SPEAKS QUIETLY, WITH A CHINESE ACCENT. 

                                  MASKED MAN #1
                    I think we will. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                14


      He says something in CHINESE and a SECOND MASKED MAN appears 
      behind Crispin, holding a gun to his head. 



      A gleaming, high tech command center called CDOC (pronounced 
      see-dock), which stands for Cyber Defense Operations Center. 
      Walls of monitors, work stations, lots of PERSONNEL. 

      Riley stands against the wall drinking a cup of coffee. She 
      looks up a set of steel stairs, at the large windows of an 
      office overlooking CDOC. Lillian s office.



      Lillian sits behind her desk arguing with Gabriel. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    What did you think was going to 
                    happen after India? That s the 
                    third time you went off-book and 
                    almost burned Clockwork to a 
                    foreign government. And all for 
                    intel you already have. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    The Indian DIA files make no 
                    mention of Amelia s death. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    But they did identify her as one of 
                    the attackers. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    That doesn t mean she turned. CIA 
                    had her deep black for two years. 
                    For all we know, she was still 
                    dark. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Maybe, maybe not. But thirty-three 
                    bodies incinerated in the fire in 
                    Mumbai, and she never reported in 
                    or showed up on the grid again. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    And that s evidence? INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                15


                                    LILLIAN
                    If I go to bed at night and there s 
                    no snow on the ground and in the 
                    morning I m shoveling, it snowed. 
                          (beat)
                    Gabriel, I m not going to let you 
                    bang and burn your own agency in 
                    pursuit of this fairy tale you re 
                    clinging to. Whatever became of 
                    Amelia, she s gone. I m sorry, but 
                    it s time to move on. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    And this secret service agent? 
                    That s how we re moving on? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    That s how I m protecting my 
                      investment. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    What is she, then? Body guard, 
                      babysitter, chaperone? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    All of the above. Her primary job 
                    is to keep you alive.

                                    GABRIEL
                    That girl? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    That girl s greatest advocate says 
                    she personally thwarted the most 
                    elaborate assassination attempt on 
                    the president since 9/11. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    And who s this advocate? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    The president. 

      Lillian s phone buzzes. She picks it up. 

                                    LILLIAN (PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Yes, Elizabeth. What do you mean, 
                    he s here now? Is this on the 
                    calendar? Well, send him in.

      The door opens and a SECRETARY lets in DNI OLIVER RUSSELL, 
      50, and DEPUTY DNI TOM LATHAM. 

                                    LILLIAN (CONT D)
                    Oliver, Tom. What do we have?

                                  DNI OLIVER RUSSELL
                    I m sorry for the surprise, but I 
                    didn t want to use a phone. 
                          (noticing Gabriel)
                    Gabriel. Good. Glad you re here. 
                    Everybody sit down. Tom? 

                                  DEPUTY DNI TOM LATHAM
                      Kidnapping. High value, low 
                    profile. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    You re both here, so what kind of 
                    value are we talking about? Red?

                                  DNI OLIVER RUSSEL
                    I d say so. And he s one of yours. 
                    Dr. William Crispin. 

      Lillian sits back in her chair. Gabriel exhales. 



      A SURVEILLANCE VIDEO plays. Image is grainy, obscured, shot 
      through the trees of Crispin s home. Two masked gunman drag 
      Crispin out of the house to a waiting white van. 

      Lillian addresses the room of a DOZEN of her PEOPLE. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Until he resigned last year, Dr. 
                    William Crispin was our top 
                      neuroscientist and leading member 
                    of the Clockwork team. 

      Everyone takes that in. Gabriel, Riley, and Amos. Also here 
      are CHRIS JAMESON, by-the-book investigator, and his partner, 
      GONZALO  GONZO  SANCHEZ, scrappy, muscular Latino.

                                    JAMESON

                                  GONZO
                    Has it been scrubbed?

                    hard for facial rec. Gabriel? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Nothing. 

                                  AMOS
                    See? And no audio. 

                                  GONZO
                    What about the van s plates? 

                                  AMOS
                    We re trying to dig out a partial. 

                                    JAMESON
                    Did they get his computer? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    FBI swept. No computers found. 

                                  AMOS
                    His computer isn t a concern. I 
                    created the encryption protocol. 
                      Twenty-forty Bit. Impregnable. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Unless they torture him for his 
                    password. 

      Everyone turns to Gabriel. He s right, of course. 

                                    JAMESON
                    Do we know what s on that computer? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    No. 

                                    JAMESON
                    If they get in, they could learn 
                    about Gabriel. 

                                  GONZO
                    He could be a target already. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Then it s good we have Riley to 
                    protect me. 

      Everyone turns to see the woman he s referring to. Riley. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                18

                    Listen up. This one isn t like any 
                      kidnapping we ve handled before. 
                    The clock always ticks on the 
                    victim. This time it ticks on us, 
                    too. 

      With that, everyone is on their feet. Riley, though, follows 
      Lillian out the door. 



      Riley catches up with Lillian, who doesn t stop. They 
      continue walking across CDOC and down a long hallway. 

                                  RILEY
                    Ms. Strand. I hope you find Dr. 
                    Crispin, but I put in a call to...

                                    LILLIAN
                    Your ASAC. Yes, I know.

                                  RILEY
                    I m sorry. I m not a bodyguard. 
                    When the President has an event, 
                    I ve already done ninety percent of 
                    my work. I can walk through a hotel 
                    lobby blindfolded and know how many 
                    steps it is to every exit. I have 
                    hundreds of support assets, 
                      ambulances, a helicopter on the 
                    pad, and two F-22s standing by. We 
                    don t make PTZ stops unless it s 
                      absolutely necessary. You want me 
                    to ride with a belligerent 
                      protectee, with no assets, and 
                      everywhere we go is a potential 
                    threat zone? I can t do that. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    That s not your problem. Your 
                    problem is that you think 
                      protecting the president is more 
                    important than this. 

                                  RILEY
                    Because, respectfully, it is more 
                    important than this. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                19


                                    LILLIAN
                    We got very lucky with Gabriel. 
                    When we were looking for a 
                      candidate, the criteria wasn t just 
                    to find someone capable. We needed 
                    to thread a very rare genetic 
                    needle. Let me tell you something 
                    about him. When he was a Seal he 
                    was alternately shot, cut up, 
                    tortured, burned and frozen alive. 
                    None of it stopped him. He 
                      volunteered for five tours in Iraq 
                    and Afghanistan. Five. That s a 
                    hero in there. 

                                  RILEY
                    I m sure he is. But...

                                    LILLIAN
                    We re in the middle of a 
                      technological arms race, unlike 
                    anything we ve seen since the 
                    Soviet nukes. Now, if you knew that 
                    every nation on earth was trying to 
                    steal our nuclear arsenal, would 
                    that be important to you? 

                                  RILEY
                    Yes, obviously, but...

                                    LILLIAN
                    What do you know about Echelon? 

                                  RILEY
                    It s a system that develops threat 
                      assessments by monitoring 
                      electronic communication. 

      Lillian stops and turns to her. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Echelon is a hunter. Echelon can 
                    find its prey in a jungle so dense 
                    that sunlight can t breach the 
                    canopy. Echelon is the most 
                    fearsome weapon in human history. 
                          (off her look)
                    Riley, Gabriel is Echelon. And 
                      protecting him is the most 
                    important thing you ll ever do. 

      Lillian lets that sink in. And it does. Lillian puts an 
      unexpected hand on Riley s shoulder, then keeps walking, 
      leaving her standing alone. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                20



      Riley drives. Gabriel watches her, but she doesn t look back.

                                    GABRIEL
                    So, what s in that sealed file of 
                    yours? 

                                  RILEY
                    I m surprised you didn t read it 
                    already. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    What am I, an animal? 
                          (beat)
                    Was it drugs?

      She looks at him, then back at the road. She s not playing. 

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    Did you hold up a liquor store? 
                          (still no answer)
                    Come on, I thought this was the 
                    part where we share and bond. 

                                  RILEY
                    Seems more like the part where I 
                    find out how much of a pain in the 
                    ass you are. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Wait a sec...

      Gabriel s HEAD TILTS sharply -- something is happening. 

                                  RILEY
                    What s happening? Are you okay? 
                    Should I pull over? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Hold on...

                                  RILEY
                    Gabriel?

                                    GABRIEL
                    The kidnappers are Chinese. 

                                  RILEY
                    Excuse me? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    There s an audio recording of the 
                      kidnapping. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                21


                                  RILEY
                    What do you mean? Why didn t you 
                    mention that at the briefing? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Because I didn t know it until 
                    thirty seconds ago. 

      Riley turns the car up the dirty driveway of Crispin s house. 
      Gonzo and Jameson wave from a front lawn covered with CRIME 
      SCENE TAPE and FORENSIC TEAMS. 



      The AUDIO RECORDER sits on the table, playing the recording 
      of the kidnapping.  

                                    CRISPIN (RECORDING)
                    Albert, when I was at NASA in  69, 
                    we sent an astronaut to the moon. A 
                    cell phone today has a million 
                    times more computer power than we 
                    put on that space craft. 

      PULL BACK - Gabriel and Riley, Jameson and Gonzo stand around 
      the table listening. 

                                    JAMESON
                    Who s Albert? 

      Gonzo points to the cat s bowl that says ALBERT on it. 

                                  RILEY
                          (to Gabriel)
                    How did you know? 

                                    GABRIEL
                      Bluetooth. Once I was in range...

                                    JAMESON
                    Shhh. 

                                    CRISPIN (RECORDING)
                      Technology isn t revolutionary. 
                    It s evolutionary. 

      On the recording we hear ALBERT SHRIEK, GLASS SHATTER...

                                    CRISPIN (RECORDING) (CONT D)
                    Please, take whatever you want! 

      WE HEAR the KIDNAPPER SPEAKING IN CHINESE. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                22


                                    GABRIEL
                    There it is. Chinese. 

                                  GONZO
                    Mandarin, to be exact. 

                                    JAMESON
                    Gabriel, can you translate? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    He s saying, Bring the house. 

                                  GONZO
                    Bring the house? 

                                  RILEY
                    Where did you learn to speak 
                    Mandarin? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    I didn t. 
                          (points to his head)
                    Software. 

                                  RILEY
                    You should get an upgrade. It s not 
                    bring the house. Gong-Ding means 
                    house, yes. But it also means safe 
                    or vault. 

                                  GONZO
                    Bring the safe.

      Gonzo and Jameson are impressed, which annoys Gabriel. 



      Gabriel, Riley and Amos sit with NELSON CRISPIN, 35 years 
      old, next to a large window overlooking the Potomac River. 

                                  NELSON
                    What was in the safe? Dad s 
                    computer. We drilled a hole in the 
                    back for the wires. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    What was on the computer that 
                    warranted that? 

                                  NELSON
                    Nothing compromising. Dad was just 
                    paranoid about his memoirs. He s 
                    been dictating them for months.

                                  NELSON (CONT'D)
                    He said it s easier to talk to 
                    Albert, so I made him a recorder. 

      Nelson takes a deep breath, tries to collect himself. 

                                  NELSON (CONT D)
                    He is going to be really happy to 
                    see you again, Gabriel. Talks about 
                    you all the time. 

      That nearly puts Nelson over the edge. Riley looks at Amos, 
      her eyes telling him to say something. 

                                  AMOS
                    You built the recorder? 

                                  NELSON
                    Yeah, I wanted it to respond to his 
                    voice. Wasn t hard. I used the 
                    Corona chassis, added a few gigs of 
                    flash, and hacked some code to make 
                    it dump into the computer every 
                    night.

                                  AMOS
                    That s why it was sending out the 
                    signal that Gabriel picked up. It 
                    was trying to log in. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Nelson, is there anything in those 
                    memoirs that someone could use to 
                    build a chip of their own? 

                                  NELSON
                    No way. We know the rules about 
                    black intel. 

                                  RILEY
                    I have a question. If you don t 
                    mind. 

                                    GABRIEL
                          (minding)
                    No, go ahead. 

                                  RILEY
                    If there s nothing compromising on 
                    that computer, and it s encrypted, 
                    why did it need to be in a safe? 

      Gabriel looks at Riley. Nelson looks caught. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                24


      POV - WE NOW SEE THEM ALL THROUGH THE SCOPE OF A SNIPER 
      RIFLE, SCANNING ACROSS EACH FACE. 



      Back with Gabriel, Riley, Amos and Nelson. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    You re angry at your father. 

                                  NELSON
                    Why would I be angry? 

                                  RILEY
                    You re his lab assistant. He 
                    leaves, you re out, too. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    That s not why he s angry. He s 
                    angry about me. 

                                  NELSON
                    What are you talking about? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Just three weeks ago you sent an 
                    email to your dad,  Gabriel is all 
                    you talk about. He may be your 
                    creation, but he s not your son.  
                    What happened, Nelson? Did you want 
                    the chip in your big brain? Is that 
                    what it is?

                    I don t have the mutation.

                    And that burns you up, doesn t it? 
                    Tell us about the Chinese.

                                  AMOS
                    Just tell them the truth, bro.

                                  RILEY
                    What was in your father s safe? 



      OVERHEAD VIEW of a CIRCULAR MAZE. CONCENTRIC CIRCLES emanateg 
      from the center. A shiny MONOLITH floats into the frame. The 
      monolith is held by tweezers and we suddenly realize the 
      monolith is a MICROCHIP and the maze is the FINGERPRINT on 
      the end of a finger. The CHIP is placed on the FINGER.

      The finger belongs to JIN CONG, a handsome Chinese man in a 
      dark suit. He stares at the chip, holding it up to the light. 
      He turns to Dr. Crispin, framed by two ARMED CHINESE MEN. 

                                  CONG
                    What would your government do to 
                    you if they learned you not only 
                    made another chip, but you made it 
                    even better than the first? 

                                    CRISPIN
                    It probably doesn t even work. 

                                  CONG
                    How long after the surgery will you 
                    know if it s been a success? 

                                    CRISPIN
                    Surgery? I m not implanting an 
                    untested chip in a live human! 

      Cong holds up his phone, on it is VIDEO coming from the 
      sniper VIDEOSCOPE pointed at his son s head. 

                                  CONG
                    That is a live image from a Chinese-
                    made M99 sniper rifle. 



      Gabriel suddenly turns to the window, HE S PICKING UP THE 
      SIGNAL from the SNIPER RIFLE S VIDEOSCOPE. He SEES THE ICE 
      CREAM TRUCK OUTSIDE with the SNIPER RIFLE POINTED at them. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Sniper! Get down! 

      Gabriel runs. Riley is on her feet. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                26


                                  RILEY
                    Gabriel, wait! 



      Jin Cong walks Crispin into a room. When he turns the lights 
      on WE SEE it is an OPERATING ROOM. 

                                  JIN CONG
                    Your surgical team has just landed 
                    and will be here shortly. We have 
                    spared no expense in outfitting 
                    this room with everything you will 
                    need. 

                                    CRISPIN
                      Everything I ll need for what? This 
                    isn t some appendectomy. Getting 
                    past the histocompatibility complex 
                    was a feat in and of itself, but to 
                    coax the brain s chemical 
                      neurotransmitters into generating a 
                      completely new biochemical language 
                    was tantamount to creating a sixth 
                    sense. We rewrote the rules of 
                    nature. I implore you to explain to 
                    your government...

                                  CONG
                    My government? Beijing is too 
                    crippled by so-called reformers to 
                    do anything this bold. No, doctor, 
                    I m not doing this on behalf of my 
                      government. I intend to take back 
                    my government from the cowards who 
                    denigrate it. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    The fact remains that this simply 
                    won t work. We discovered that the 
                    candidate must possess a very rare 
                    genetic mutation called Athens-
                    4U7R. To find such a person...

      Cong nods to one of his men, who opens a door, revealing a 
      beautiful, 26-year-old Chinese woman named MEI ZHAO. 

                                  CONG
                    This is Mei Zhao. She possesses the 
                    gene mutation, Athens-4U7R. 

      Crispin is stunned. Cong is satisfied. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                28



      Nelson sits across a table from Lillian. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    That chip is based on top secret 
                      technology and is vital to national 
                    security. I d like to know who has 
                    it now. 

                                  NELSON
                    Do you even remember me? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Of course. 

                                  NELSON
                    All those years I ran his lab, we 
                    didn t have a single conversation.  



      Gabriel, Riley and Amos stand outside the one-way glass, 
      listening to Lillian s conversation with Nelson. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    It can t be easy. 

                                  RILEY
                    Your father being kidnapped? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Your father being a genius. In all 
                    that time I spent with them, it 
                    never occurred to me what it was 
                    doing to Nelson. To him, I got to 
                    be Pinocchio, while he was only 
                    Gepetto s assistant. 

                                  RILEY
                    He passed a lie detector. 

                                  AMOS
                    The polygraph is the lowest form of 
                      technology. It s right down there 
                    with the self-cleaning toilet. 

      Riley and Gabriel share an amused look. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                29



                                  NELSON
                    The chip wasn t tested, so we don t 
                    know. But, if it is functional, 
                    Moore s Law dictates that it will 
                    be significantly faster and more 
                    robust than the original. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    What was William planning on doing 
                    with the chip? 

                                  NELSON
                    He was going to give it to you. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Just like that? Why? 

                                  NELSON
                    Loyalty doesn t always go both 
                    ways. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    You think I was disloyal?

                                  NELSON
                    You could have kept him on. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    He s 70 years old. 

                                  NELSON
                    Dad s first invention was a garage 
                    door opener. He was eleven. This is 
                    the guy you keep.  

                                    LILLIAN
                    I don t make the rules. 

                                  NELSON
                    And what about me? I m not seventy. 
                    Do you even know what my 
                      contribution was to this program? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    The thing I can t figure out, 
                    Nelson, is why you sold out your 
                    country. Was it because I insulted 
                    your father by letting him go? Or 
                    was it because I insulted you, by 
                    not inviting you for tea. 

      Lillian stands and walks out.  INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                30



      Lillian steps out, to find Gabriel, Riley and Amos waiting. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    I don t feel great about what I 
                    just did in there. 

                                  RILEY
                    You have to push his buttons. You 
                    have no choice.  

                                    GABRIEL
                    There s no electronic signpost that 
                    he s lying. No emails, voicemails, 
                    nothing. 

                                  RILEY
                    But he also knows to avoid those 
                    traps, right? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    He may be angry at us, but I don t 
                    see him putting his father in 
                    danger. 

      Jameson and Gonzo approach.

                    We got the partial plate off the

                    week ago. The car the plates were 
                    taken from was a blue, eighty-eight 
                    Chevrolet Caprice, parked on the

                                  RILEY
                    This is a great party trick. How 
                    many white Ford vans are in a 
                    twenty mile radius? 

                                    GABRIEL
                      Twenty-seven. 

                                    JAMESON
                    Ours is a  98 Ford E-Series 
                    Extended Cargo 2-Door. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    That narrows it to two vans. One 
                    was towed for unpaid parking 
                    tickets six weeks ago and still 
                    sits in the impound lot. The other 
                    is registered to a business called 
                    Bullseye Paintball.

                                    JAMESON
                    The enhancement showed paint 
                    splatters on one side. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Guess where Bullseye Paintball is? 
                          (off their looks)
                      Chinatown. 



      It s an outdoor paintball arena with various areas set up for 
      battle. There s an old west town, a junkyard, a fake jungle, 
      etc. There s also a collection of corrugated aluminum 
      buildings. 

      Riley and Gabriel get out of one car, Gonzo and Jameson out 
      of the other. On the other side of the wooden fences, kids 
      shoot splatters of red and yellow paint at each other.  

                                  GONZO
                    What do we do about all the kids? 

                                  RILEY
                    We have satellite right? Let s see 
                    what s going on inside these 
                      buildings.

                    And the tack team is ten minutes 
                    out.  

                                    GABRIEL
                    We could look around, not engage. 

                                  RILEY
                    I don t think that s a good idea. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Guys? What do you think? 

                                  RILEY
                    It doesn t matter what they think. 
                    We re waiting.  

      Gonzo and Jameson share a look. Gabriel ignores her. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    I m going to look around. 

      Gabriel starts walking. Gonzo and Jameson take the cue. 

                                  GONZO
                    We ll go this way. 

      Riley, left alone and frustrated, follows Gabriel.  As she 
      catches up to him...

                                  RILEY
                    You think you re the first 
                    protectee that s given me trouble? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    The F-35 is the most expensive 
                    airplane ever built. The first 
                    thing they did was throw it in a 
                    war zone. This thing in my head may 
                    be valuable, but it s no good to 
                    anyone sitting in the hangar. 

                                  RILEY
                    You re no good to anyone if you re 
                    dead either. We re going to have to 
                    come to some kind of understanding. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    The only thing to understand is 
                    that I m not a machine. You can t 
                    just shut me off.

      He turns. She instantly realizes... 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    God, I m sorry. I know about your 
                    wife, of course. It s in your file. 
                      I forgot...

                                    GABRIEL
                    You believe what you read? You 
                    believe that my wife, a decorated 
                    CIA agent, would suddenly fall in 
                    love with a blood-loving member of 
                    the Lashkar-e-Taiba? Take part in a 
                    terrorist attack? Murder innocent 
                      civilians? 

                                  RILEY
                    I didn t know your wife. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Don t ever talk about her in the 
                    past tense again. She s not dead. 

      They reach one of the warehouses. He opens the door. 

                                  RILEY
                      Gabriel... 



      All lit with black lights, the paint in here is dayglo, and 
      the music, some kind of Chinese rap, is blaring. Splatters of 
        glow-in-the-dark paint are everywhere. 

                                  RILEY
                    Listen, you don t have to like me, 
                    but this is exactly what Lillian is 
                    talking about. And she s right. 
                    Waiting ten minutes won t change...

      SPLAT - she gets hit on the arm with a paintball. Glowing 
      yellow splatter covers her shoulder. A kid cackles and runs. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Great. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Have you ever been taken, held 
                    against your will?  I have. And ten 
                    minutes can be a lifetime. 

      They arrive at another door. It has a padlock on it. Gabriel 
      uses the butt of a FIRE EXTINGUISHER to SMASH the lock. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                34



      Gabriel and Riley enter a dark and junk-filled garage. All 
      kinds of paint supplies, old paint guns, etc. And in the 
      corner, by the outer door is the WHITE FORD VAN. Jackpot. 

      They approach it. Look in the windows. Gabriel tries the 
      door, but it s locked. She walks to a tool bench, grabs a 
      SCREW DRIVER and HAMMER.  She shoves the screw driver into 
      the door lock, hammers it, turns it hard and POP. It opens. 

                                    GABRIEL

                    No. 

                                  VOICE
                    Hey! 

      SIX CHINESE GANGBANGERS enter. BASEBALL BATS and GUNS. The 
      voice belongs to a thug we will come to know as HUANG FU. 

                                  HUANG FU
                    Who said you could come in here? 

                                  RILEY
                    We re federal agents. 

      One of the gangbangers AIMS at GABRIEL and FIRES, but Riley 
      pushes Gabriel aside and FIRES BACK.  They all SCATTER. 

      Gabriel looks at Riley and sees the BLOOD ON HER SHOULDER. 
      She falls backward against the car. He pulls her down to the 
      relative safety of the floor. A gun in one hand, Riley in his 
      other arm, he scans the darkness for the muffled voices of 
      the gangbangers.

                                    GABRIEL
                    You took a bullet for me? What do 
                    you think you re doing? 

                                  RILEY
                    My job. 

      She loses consciousness, slumping over into his arms.

                                          ACT THREE



        Pitch-black, gunshots, shouts in Chinese. Gabriel stays down 
      low with an UNCONSCIOUS Riley, putting pressure on her 
      shoulder where she was shot. He talks on a cell phone. 

                                    GABRIEL (PHONE)
                    She s alive, but I can t tell if...

      Another SHOT is fired, just misses. Gabriel fires back.

      Lillian is at the control center. Gabriel is now on speaker. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Amos, where s my satellite! 

                                  AMOS
                    Two more minutes. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    He doesn t need it in two minutes.

                                  AMOS
                    Moving eighty tons through space. 
                    It s not like ordering a pizza.

                    Gabriel, the tack team is on site, 
                      evacuating the civilians. How many 
                    shooters? 

                                    GABRIEL 
                    Seven.  

      Gabriel SHOOTS into the darkness at a moving shadow.

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    Six. 

      SHOUTS in Chinese are heard. Through the piles of junk 
      Gabriel can see movement. They re closing in on him. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                36


                                  AMOS
                    Forty seconds! 

      Riley s eyes open, just in time to SEE a FIGURE charging at 
      them. Her GUN still in her hand, she lifts it up and FIRES, 
      HITTING THE MAN IN THE CHEST. Gabriel looks down at her. 



      With Riley s good arm draped over his shoulder, Gabriel 
      bursts into the now empty indoor range. He tries to get 
      across the large space to the EXIT, but the gangbangers start 
      SHOOTING at them from behind. 



                                  AMOS
                    Satellite in four, three, two... 



      Gabriel looks out at the darkness and then we re IN HIS POV. 
      He sees a three-dimensional space. The room suddenly appears 
      almost translucent. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    I ve got satellite infrared... 

                                  RILEY
                    You can do that? 

      As he helps her to her feet, INTERCUT with his POV and SEE 
      the entire space with INFRARED VISION - A 3D ENVIRONMENT, 
      LIKE A VIDEO GAME, with RED FIGURES hiding behind various 
      obstacles. Gabriel, with Riley s arm over his shoulder, is 
      able to move them toward the door, while avoiding the BOGEYS. 



      Jameson and Gonzo direct the crowd toward the arriving police 
      cars, and flash their badges to the arriving SWAT unit. 



      Gabriel spots a BOGEY raising a gun. Gabriel FIRES - HITTING 
      HIM. They keep moving toward the door. Just as they reach it, 
      the DOOR BURSTS OPEN and MEN IN TACK SUITS and BAYONET LIGHTS 
      move in. Jameson and Gonzo rush to Gabriel and Riley. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                37



      Gabriel and Riley emerge into the fading sunlight and 
      flashing lights and sirens. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    We need a medic!

                    The Romans used to say it s bad 
                    luck not to give something to the 
                    person who saves your life. I think 
                    twenty dollars should do it. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    You re not giving me twenty 
                    dollars.

                                  RILEY
                    I saved your life, remember? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    You want me to give you twenty 
                    dollars? Did you miss the part 
                    where I used my Terminator Vision 
                    to get you out of there? 

      Jameson comes back with the PARAMEDICS.

                    No sign of Crispin.

                    He s not here. 

      Paramedics take Riley on the stretcher as Gabriel points to 
      one of the Chinese GANGBANGERS in handcuffs - Huang Fu. 

                                    GABRIEL

      Riley is in the bed, shoulder bandaged, hospital gown on. 
      Lillian, Amos, Gabriel and Gonzo are here, too.

                    That gangbanger s his cousin. 

                                  RILEY
                    Jin Cong is a spy?  

                                  GONZO
                    CIA hunted him for about a decade.

                    He hasn t shown up on the grid in 
                    five years. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Now he has. Let s start working it. 
                    Gonzo, Jameson, Amos, you head 
                    back. It s time I put in a call to 
                    the Chinese. 

      Gonzo and Jameson start to leave. Amos, too. 

                                  AMOS
                    Riley, I m glad you re okay. 

      Before she can respond, he gets yanked away by Gonzo. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Someone has a crush.

                    They brought a clean T-shirt for 
                    me. It s in the cabinet. 

      Lillian realizes she s not talking Riley out of this. She 
      goes to the cabinet. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    What s the real on Gabriel s wife?

                    Excuse me?

                    You want me to take bullets for 
                    him, then I need to know where he s 
                    going to be unpredictable. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    The real is that Amelia Hayes is an 
                    enemy of the United States. 

                                  RILEY
                    If that s true, why would you 
                    violate all established protocol by 
                      entrusting the man who loves her 
                    with the most powerful intelligence 
                    weapon on earth? 
                          (realizing...)
                    You don t believe she s a traitor, 
                    do you? And I bet you don t even 
                    believe she s dead. 

      Lillian considers her answer carefully. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    What I believe is irrelevant. 
                          (beat)
                    Let me be very clear with you, 
                    Riley. We have spent billions of 
                    dollars creating something that 
                    every nation on Earth would go to 
                    war to possess. I didn t bring you 
                    here to argue with me. I brought 
                    you here to keep it safe. 

                                  RILEY
                    Him. Not it. He s a human being and 
                    she s his wife. He s not going to 
                    let go of this. Nor should he. 

      Lillian doesn t have a response. Maybe she agrees.INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                40



      A makeshift recovery room, built for one patient only. Mei 
      Zhao is unconscious, her head wrapped in bandages. A Chinese 
      NURSE attends to her, while standing at the foot of the bed 
      is a quiet, stoic Jin Cong. 

      Dr. Crispin is brought in by an armed guard. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    We had many heartbreaking failures 
                    that often resulted in exactly what 
                    we re seeing here. This poor girl 
                    could wake up in weeks or months, 
                    or never. We are meddling in the 
                    building blocks of life. And that 
                    mystery is still beyond our reach.

      Cong produces a BLACK HANDGUN with a PEARL HANDLE, INLAID 
      WITH A DRAGON in one hand. 

                                  CONG
                    Have you ever seen a Canglong 
                    handgun before? Canglong means 
                     black dragon.  This is the finest 
                    gun made in the world. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    What are you planning on doing with 
                    your Black Dragon gun? 

      Without warning, Cong cracks the gun across Crispin s 
      forehead, sending him to the floor. He looks up, bleeding. 

                                  CONG
                    Did you sabotage us, doctor?! 

                                    CRISPIN
                    No! Like I said, she might still 
                    wake up! We need to give her time! 

                                  CONG
                    You will replace this chip with the 
                    original chip, the one that works. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    You don t have that chip. 

                                  CONG
                    I will shortly. 

      Cong walks out, leaving Crispin trembling on the floor. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                41



      Riley wakes up, feels for her bandaged shoulder. Ouch. She 
      strains to pull herself up out of bed. 



      Riley walks down the stairs and STOPS in her tracks. She s 
      shocked to see that standing in her living room is Gabriel. 
      He s walking slowly, MUMBLING TO HIMSELF. 

                                  RILEY
                    Who are you talking to? And what 
                    are you doing in my house? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Lillian told me to stay and keep an 
                    eye on you.  

      He still doesn t turn to face her. Completely perplexed, she 
      walks down the stairs. There s nobody here but Gabriel. 

      GABRIEL S POV: Though he can see Riley s living room around 
      him, and Riley walking tentatively toward him, what he sees 
      more clearly is a FROZEN THREE DIMENSIONAL IMAGE OF...



      Riley watches Gabriel, completely confused. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                42


                                  RILEY
                    Are you going to tell me why you re 
                    wandering around my living room 
                    like a zombie. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    I m cyber-rendering. 

      HIS POV - she walks right through the apparition of the safe. 

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    It s something that the chip does 
                    that nobody expected. I can create 
                    a virtual snapshot of an event in 
                    my mind and then walk through it. 
                    But it's more than that. It's like 
                    a virtual evidence wall. All the 
                    intel I have access to, I can see 
                    it. The chip processes it like a 
                    computer, but my brain metabolizes 
                    it, well, like a brain. 

                                  RILEY
                    You re doing this right now? What 
                    do you see? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Crispin can t take his eyes off the 
                    safe. 

                                  RILEY
                    Makes sense. It s important to him. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    It s not just that. He can t 
                    imagine how they knew to take it. 

                                  RILEY
                    You said you only had access to 
                    available intel. We could barely 
                    see his face in the surveillance 
                    video, so how are you seeing it 
                    now? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    The render is sort of a compilation 
                    that s generated by me. 

                                  RILEY
                    So, you re extrapolating. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Think of it like a dream. Analyze 
                    it like a dream. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                43


                                  RILEY
                    Your brain is saying that the 
                    single most important question is 
                    who knew what was in that safe? And 
                    the only other person who knew is 
                    Nelson. That s why Crispin is so 
                    shocked in this cyber-render. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    But, Nelson s not the only other 
                    one who knew, is he? 

      Gabriel turns sharply, as the entire RENDER OF THE KIDNAPPING 
      FALLS AWAY, immediately replaced by another...



      Gabriel stands in Nelson s office at the moment he told 
      everyone to get down when he saw the sniper. Riley and Nelson 
      are on the floor. Gabriel walks over to the rendered version 
      of himself, also ducking below the window frame. Then Gabriel 
      looks at Amos, who hasn t moved. HE STANDS CALMLY, 
        UNFLINCHING, RIGHT WHERE HE WAS THE WHOLE TIME. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Why aren t you scared? 

      Riley suddenly comes to the same realization...

                                  RILEY
                    Amos wrote the encryption code. 
                      Twenty-forty bit. Impregnable. 

      The cyber-render FALLS AWAY, leaving only Riley and Gabriel. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Call Lillian. 

                                  RILEY
                    I ll call her from the car. 



      Jameson and Gonzo sit in the control room. Lillian s voice on 
      speaker. We can see her walking across the Washington Mall 
      from different angles on numerous monitors. 

                                    JAMESON
                    Do you believe him? 

                                  GONZO
                    The dead or alive bit was a good 
                    sell. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Where are we with Cong s cousin? 

                                    JAMESON
                    Nowhere. And Gabriel s locator is 
                    still dark. 

                                  GONZO
                    Why would Gabriel shut down his 
                    locator? 

                                    JAMESON
                    He wouldn t. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                47


                                  GONZO
                    It would be nearly impossible 
                    without a passcode for anyone to 
                    hack a triangulated GIS chip and 
                    shut it down. And the only other 
                    person who knows the code is...

                                    JAMESON
                    Amos. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Amos had access to Crispin s 
                      computers, so he would have known 
                    he was making another chip and that 
                    it was in that safe. 

                                  GONZO
                    And he sold the information to 
                    Cong. I can t believe it. Amos?

                                    LILLIAN
                    We ll have time for hand wringing 
                    later. Right now we need to focus. 
                    Why did they take Gabriel, if they 
                    already got away with the new chip? 

                                    JAMESON 
                    What if new chip doesn t work? 

                                    LILLIAN
                    They d want the only one that does. 

      Lillian climbs into the back seat of a waiting SUV. 



      We re in some kind of a large janitorial closet. Gabriel 
      slams against the locked door. No use. He looks back at 
      Riley, at a utility sink, running water on a paper towel. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Do you know how many hours I ve 
                    spent with Amos? Sitting in that 
                    lab? All those tests, software 
                    updates, diagnostics... you get 
                    pretty close to someone. 

      He PUNCHES the door. He turns and sees Riley sit on a metal 
      chair. She looks down at the plume of blood on her shirt. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                48


                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    I d better take a look at that.  
                          (off her look)
                    Just the wound. Don t get excited. 

      She winces as he peels the top of her shirt back. 

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    Stitches are holding, but it 
                    doesn t look great. 

      He gently takes the wet paper towel from her and begins to 
      clean the wound. It stings, but she takes it. He looks 
      intently at what he s doing. 

                                  RILEY
                    Did Lillian really tell you to keep 
                    an eye on me last night? 

      He shrugs.  

                                    GABRIEL
                    You were supposed to be in the 
                    hospital. I couldn t leave you 
                    alone. Just in case. 

      She looks at him. He continues cleaning her wound, studiously 
      avoiding her eyes. They re close, the moment is intimate. 

                                  RILEY
                      Manslaughter. 
                          (off his look)
                    I wasn t convicted, but everyone 
                    agreed to seal the file. It wasn t 
                    hard to convince them. 
                          (beat)
                    My parents split when I was ten. My 
                    mother got a boyfriend soon after. 
                    She wasn t very discriminating. For 
                    the next five years I didn t do 
                    anything to protect us from him. 
                    Then one day I did. 

      He s takes a breath. That wasn t what he was expecting. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    You ve been protecting people ever 
                    since. 

      Maybe she hadn t thought of that before. Or maybe she had.

                                  RILEY
                    You know, I wasn t just hired to 
                    protect you. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                49


                                    GABRIEL
                    I know. You re supposed to keep me 
                    from looking for Amelia. 

                                  RILEY
                    Yeah, well, hell with that. 

      They both smile, grateful for the moment, a moment burst 
      by... THE DOOR OPENING. Jin Cong and THREE CHINESE GUARDS 
      enter. Gabriel and Riley are both on their feet. 

                                  JIN CONG
                    So, you re Gabriel. Are you 
                    scanning me right now? What do you 
                    see? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    An asshole. 

      Two of the men grab Gabriel, cuffing his wrists. Riley shouts 
      in Chinese, and one of the guards PUNCHES HER ACROSS THE 
      MOUTH, sending her to the floor. Gabriel tries to break free, 
      but there s nothing he can do. Cong commands his men and 
      leaves. They drag Gabriel out next. 

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    Riley, whatever happens, stay 
                    alive. I m coming back for you. 

      She watches him disappear, as she s hoisted into a chair, her 
      mouth and shoulder bleeding, hands pulled tight behind her. 



      Gabriel is brought in by the guards and Cong. Crispin, 
      dressed for surgery, turns and when he sees Gabriel he sighs, 
      sadly, Gepetto fearing for his Pinocchio.

                                    CRISPIN
                      Gabriel...

                                    GABRIEL
                    Doc, are you okay? 

                                    CRISPIN
                    I m alive. And you will be, too. 

      Gabriel now notices the straps on the operating table. 

                                  CONG
                    Doctor, if you attempt subversion, 
                    you ll be shot and I will dig the 
                    chip out of his dead skull myself. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                50


      He gives a few orders in Chinese and leaves. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    Is Nelson all right? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    He will be. 

      The guards drag Gabriel to the table and STRAP HIM DOWN. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    Stop! You don t have to hurt him! 

                                    GABRIEL

                    Do these guys speak English? 

                                    CRISPIN
                    No. Only Cong. He ll be back soon.
                          (picks up syringe)
                    This is Midazolam. It will relax 
                    you before the anesthesia. I m 
                    sorry, I don t see a better option. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    I do. 



      Riley is tied to a chair, her shirt bloody. She doesn t look 
      great. Amos walks in, carrying a cup of water.

                                  AMOS
                    How are you feeling? I brought you 
                    some water. 

                                  RILEY
                    Not interested. 

                                  AMOS
                    I m the only reason they haven t 
                    killed you yet. I told them you 
                    could be turned. 

      Riley laughs bitterly. 

                                  AMOS (CONT D)
                    Do you have any idea how much money 
                    Cong has? I could pretty much buy a 
                    Greek Island if I want. Though, 
                    that s not saying much these days.

                    We don t have to be enemies, Riley.

                    We could be friends. Very rich 
                    friends. 

                                  RILEY
                    I ll take that water now. 

                                  AMOS
                    Great. That s great. 

      He walks over and holds the water up to her mouth. She drinks 
      it. She looks at him and smiles a thank you. He smiles. And 
      she SPITS THE BLOODY WATER IN HIS FACE. 



      Jameson and Gonzo sit across the table from Jin Cong s 
      cousin, who glares back at him from his tattooed eyes. 

                                    JAMESON
                    You re hoping to be deported, 
                    right? Think your friends back in 
                    China will take care of you? 

                                  GONZO
                    That s not going to happen, pal. 
                    Know why? Because nobody will ever 
                    know we have you. You re going to 
                      disappear. 

      A KNOCK on the door. Jameson walks out. 



      Lillian is waiting in the hallway. 

                                    JAMESON
                    He s a rock. 

                                    LILLIAN
                    Our friend, Wang, just had his

      Gabriel is unconscious. Crispin looks to the observation room 
      where Cong has just entered. Cong nods to him to begin. 

      Crispin looks down at Gabriel. The Chinese ANESTHESIOLOGIST 
      prepares the mask to go over Gabriel s nose and mouth, while 
      a NURSE slides a tray of SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS toward Crispin. 

      The anesthesiologist lowers the mask onto Gabriel s face. 
      Crispin looks grave as the nurse hands him a SCALPEL. Then... 
      Gabriel starts CONVULSING. The anesthesiologist freaks, 
      checking his gauges.

                                    CRISPIN
                          (shouting at the 
                              anesthesiologist)
                    What did you give him?!

                                  CONG
                          (shouting)
                    What s happening?

                                    CRISPIN
                    He s in cardiogenic shock!

      The anesthesiologist is at a loss. Crispin rips the mask off 
      of Gabriel. 

                                    CRISPIN (CONT D)
                    Gabriel! Gabriel, can you hear me? 
                    Help me hold him down! 

      Cong leaves the observation room, immediately appearing in 
      the operating room with them. 

                                  CONG
                    What s happening? I demand to know 
                    what is happening. 

                                    CRISPIN
                    I don t know. I don t know what 
                    they gave him! 

      Gabriel s legs are kicking wildly. 

                                    CRISPIN (CONT D)
                          (to anesthesiologist)
                    Do you have any Naloxone?! 
                      Naloxone?! Do you understand me?! INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                53


      Cong yells to the guards to come help. They each grab a leg 
      as Crispin and the nurse hold their weight on his body to 
      stabilize him. The anesthesiologist prepares a syringe. 
      Then...

      Gabriel opens his eyes, looks right at Crispin. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Now, doc! 

      Crispin backs off of him quickly, as Gabriel grabs the 
      scalpel and jumps up, plunging it into one guard s throat, 
      grabbing the gun from his waist, turning and shooting the 
      other guard. In the melee of screams and gunshots, Cong slips 
      out the door. 



      Gabriel and Crispin run down a hallway, as an ALARM SOUNDS. 

      Gabriel looks up at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

      GABRIEL S POV - HE CAN SEE HIMSELF through the CAMERA LENS. 
      HE CUTS from CAMERA TO CAMERA THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY. In one 
      room, Cong shouts at his MEN to mobilize; in another hallway 
      ARMED MEN run by; in the processing plant employees in white 
      gowns look at each other in fear; in the room with Mei Zhao 
        unconscious; finally CUTTING TO: Riley, strapped to her 
      chair, Amos PEERING out their door.

                                    GABRIEL
                    She s still there. 

      POV - A SECURITY CAMERA around the corner - ARMED MEN. 

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    In here! 

      He yanks Crispin into a stairwell, as the armed men run by.



      A tiny CHINESE WOMAN is on a video monitor in a Chinese jail, 
      talking to camera - to her son, sitting at a table with 
      Lillian, Gonzo and Jameson. The woman is crying as she speaks 
      in Chinese. Her son, Huang Fu, is finally cracking. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                54


                                    LILLIAN
                    Huang, the Chinese government is 
                    going to make sure your mother 
                    spends the rest of her life in 
                    prison if you don t tell me where I 
                    can find Jin Cong. 

      Huang s mother cries as she pleads with him. His body softens 
      and he looks up at Lillian and nods. 



      Lillian in a helicopter as it lifts off the roof of Cybercom. 
      A FLEET OF CARS and SUVs, their lights flashing, heads out 
      beneath her. 



      Cong enters as his men point out on one of the monitors, the 
      armada of vehicles approaching the facility in the distance, 
      including the chopper in the sky. 



      Cong enters with his men. Mei Zhao is still unconscious. 

                                  CONG (SUBTITLE)
                    We re not leaving without her. 



      The alarm blaring in the background, Amos is at the opened 
      door looking each way down the hallway. 

                                  AMOS
                    I don t know what s going on. 

                                  RILEY
                    What s going on is that this is all 
                    about to go sideways on you. 

      We HEAR a HELICOPTER starting up somewhere above them. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    That s your friend, Cong. Sounds 
                    like he s leaving without you. 

      Amos pulls out a GUN and points it at her, his hand is 
      trembling. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                55


                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    What are you doing, Amos? 

                                  AMOS
                    If you re dead, you can t tell them 
                    what I did. 

                                  RILEY
                    Are you going to kill Gabriel and 
                    Crispin, too? 

                                  AMOS
                    If they re not already dead, yes. 

      Out of nowhere a metal chair appears in the air over Amos, 
      smashing him across the back of the head. He sinks to the 
      floor, revealing Gabriel and Crispin standing behind him. 
      Gabriel smiles and drops the chair. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    We re even.

                                  RILEY
                    Day s not over yet.

      Gabriel unties her wrists. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Are you okay? 

                                  RILEY
                    Better than dead. 

      They all scramble for the door, but Gabriel stops them. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Wait! 

      GABRIEL S POV - from a CAMERA IN THE HALLWAY. A GUARD coming 
      around the corner. 

      Gabriel goes to the door, turns quickly and FIRES, hitting 
      the guard. 

                                  RILEY
                    How did you know he was out there? 

                                    GABRIEL

                          (beat)
                    Seems we re in a massive industrial

                                    GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                    There s an underground parking 
                    garage that runs for a mile under 
                    the entire complex. We need to get 
                    down there. 



      Gabriel, Riley and Crispin enter the sprawling parking 
      garage. They stay low as they move alongside cars, trying the 
      doors that won t open. Riley points to the ONSTAR STICKER on 
      the window of a VOLVO. 

                                  RILEY
                    Can you do something with that? 

                                    GABRIEL
                          (smiles)
                    I believe I can. 

      He closes his eyes and a moment later, the door locks pop and 
      the engine starts.

                                  RILEY
                    Show off. 



      The Volvo peels through the parking garage. They seem to be 
      home free, until&

      About a hundred yards ahead, Jin Cong steps out in front of 
      them, pointing his gun directly at them. INTELLIGENCE_Seitzman_Network Draft 4_012813                                57


      Then Jin Cong motions to someone we can t see. It s Amos and 
      TWO of his MEN carrying the unconscious Mei Zhao, her 
      bandaged head slumped forward. 

                                  RILEY
                    Don t stop! He has a gun! 

                                    CRISPIN
                    But, she doesn t! You ll kill her! 
                    Stop the car! 

      Gabriel SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, barely stopping before them.

                                  RILEY
                    I said don t stop! 

      She jumps out of the car, gun drawn. Gabriel is already out, 
      his GUN drawn. It s a standoff with Cong and his men. 

                                  AMOS
                    You ll notice they re only pointing 
                    their guns at Gabriel. Let s trade. 
                    We take the car, Gabriel lives. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    How about I shoot you instead and 
                    whatever happens, happens? 

                                  AMOS
                    You re not authorized to make that 
                    decision and you know it.

                    You are not a man, anymore, Mr. 
                    Black. You are a piece of very

                    Dr. Crispin. Get out of the car 
                    slowly.

      He looks at her. He knows she s right. There s no choice 
      here. He relents, but doesn t drop his weapon. 

      Cong s men load Mei Zhao into the Volvo, as Amos gets behind 
      the wheel. Cong slowly backs into the passenger seat. Gabriel 
      just can t let it happen and HE SHOOTS CONG IN THE LEG. 

      Cong falls to the ground. Gabriel and Riley shoot, killing 
      one of Cong s men. Amos guns the engine and takes off, as 
      Gabriel and Riley pepper the back of the car with bullets, 
      but it speeds off into the darkness of the parking structure. 
      Gabriel holds his gun on Cong. 



      Riley and Gabriel sit on a plane high over the U.S. 

                                  RILEY
                    You okay?
