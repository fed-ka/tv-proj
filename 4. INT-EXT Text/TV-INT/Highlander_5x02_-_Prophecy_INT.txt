      A nicely furnished high tech office.  ANDREW BECKMAN, 35,
      private investigator, spends more time behind his computer
      than he does on a stake-out.  He is well tailored, if a little
      nerdy.  More banker than P.I. He is having a conversation
      with ROLAND KANTOS, Alan Rickman at 34.

                                      BECKMAN
                    So, even if I knew this individual
                    you're looking for...

                                      ROLAND
                      Cassandra.
                          (beat)
                    Her name is Cassandra.

                                      BECKMAN
                    Never heard of her.

      He leans forward, and picks up a card on Beckman's desk.

                                      ROLAND
                    And yours is Andrew Beckman.  Well,
                    Andy... That's not really good enough.

      CLOSE ON ROLAND'S EYES

      Cold and hypnotic, they look like they could bore through a
      bank vault.  Roland Kantos is a supremely gifted MESMERIST,
      almost a sorcerer.  And his greatest weapon is his VOICE,
      which aided by Post, will be extraordinary.

      Objects on Beckman's desk begin to quiver as if they were
      caught in a slight wind, but there is no wind.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                          (using The Voice, but
                            only slightly)
                    I know you wouldn't forget her. 
                    Long hair.  Green eyes.  A body
                    that'll stop your heart.

                                      BECKMAN
                      Cassandra.

      Beckman is losing his concentration, but he shakes it off. 
      He speaks to Roland.

                                      BECKMAN (CONT'D)
                    If I knew her, she'd be my client. 
                    If she was my client, I wouldn't
                    talk to you about her.

                                      ROLAND
                    Oh, but you would.  If I wanted,
                    you'd open your soul to me.  If I
                    wanted, you'd cut out your own heart.
                          (beat)
                    You'll tell me everything.

      He pushes closer, eyes blazing, using the full power of THE
      VOICE.  The air in front of Beckman begins to shimmer.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    Where she went... what she asked you
                    to find.  It's burning inside you. 
                    You can't stand it.  C'mon Andy...
                          (beat)
                    I'm waiting.

      Beckman goes slack-faced, losing all will.  He nods.

                                      BECKMAN
                    She had to find someone.  Acted like
                    her life depended on it.

                                      ROLAND
                    It does.
                          (beat)
                    What was his name?

                                      BECKMAN
                    Duncan MacLeod.

      Roland reacts.  This is it, the time has come.

                                      ROLAND
                    Where can I find him?

      Beckman takes a SHEET from his drawer, slides it across to
      Roland.  Roland picks it up, glances at it -- then turns
      back to Beckman.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    One last thing, Andy.
                          (beat)
                    I'd like to see your gun.

      He puts out his hand.  Beckman reaches in the desk, removes
      a gun.  He hands it to Roland, who checks the chamber and
      racks a round.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                          (re the gun)
                    A Sig Sauer.  Bulky, but good.
                          (beat)
                      Personally, I prefer a Baretta. 
                    It's so much more elegant.

      Roland raises the gun -- and SHOOTS him.  Beckman crashes
      back in his chair.

      Roland grips the gun by the barrel, uses a KLEENEX from the
      desk to wipe the prints, and places it on the desk as

      The DOOR bursts open.  Beckman's PARTNER rushes in, gun in
      hand.

                                      PARTNER
                    Andy, what the hell is going on?

      He freezes as he takes in --

      BECKMAN lying there.

      Roland points to the Partner's gun.

                                      ROLAND
                    There's no need for that.

      The Partner hesitates.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    Drop it.

      The Partner drops the gun to his side.  Roland picks up
      Beckman's gun and moves closer, freezing the man with his
      eyes, like a snake with a frog, as he hands him Beckman's
      gun.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    There's been a suicide.

      THE PARTNER

      stands staring at the gun in his hand.  Roland turns and
      looks at him.

                      A suicide.

      As Roland turns his back on the Partner, we hear a shot.

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      It's dark, silent, deserted.  A figure enters quietly, stands
      motionless against the wall for a moment.  Then a LIGHT flicks
      on revealing --

      MACLEOD.  Wearing street clothes, a long coat -- he's just
      back from Europe and he looks out of place here.  He moves
      through the dojo, touching a practice bag, a kendo stick
      propped against a wall -- everything is just as he left it,
      but MacLeod feels different.

      He reaches the CLIMBING BARS where Dawson tied him months
      ago.  He almost touches the bars -- then stops himself. 
      Nothing here that he wants to remember.

      MacLeod seems to change his mind about staying.  He turns to
      head back out the door -- then he feels it: the BUZZ.

      He searches -- it's coming from ABOVE HIM, in the loft.  No
      one knows he's here.  No one should.  Alert now, he opens
      the door and quietly heads up to --


      The loft is dark as MacLeod warily enters.  He's on edge,
      unsure what to expect.  He calls out softly.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with an edge)
                    Honey, I'm home.

      No answer.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Richie?

      No reply -- but he's still feeling the BUZZ.  Not good.  Now
      he draws his sword, turns --

      MACLEOD S POV - THE IMMORTAL

      a woman, standing half-hidden in shadow -- it's as if she
      just materialized.  MacLeod takes a ready stance.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (an edge)
                    I'm Duncan MacLeod of the Clan
                    MacLeod.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I know.

      MacLeod reacts.  The voice is soft, throaty, oddly seductive --
      there's something familiar about it, but he can't place it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What do you want?  Who are you?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Don't you know me, Duncan?

      A MATCH flares as a CANDLE is lit, revealing a beautiful
      face, a cascade of hair framing it.  CASSANDRA is late
      twenties/early thirties, gorgeous, smoky eyes that seem to
      see right into you.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Because I know you.

      MacLeod starts in shock as he recognizes her, not trusting
      his eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra.

      He lowers his sword, stunned, as she moves into the light. 
      No apparition -- just a very attractive woman.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Have I changed all that much?

      MacLeod stares, takes in the beautiful face, the body.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.

      She steps closer, gives him an appraising look.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    But you have.

      And OFF this, we --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      CLOSE ON

      A blurred image swimming in dim light.  Slowly the image
      comes into focus.  It is the skull of a wolf, all fangs and
      growl as it stares down on:

      YOUNG DUNCAN

      who reacts with a start and backs away as he finds himself
      wrapped in a fur on a wooden palette, in a small hut, a hearth-
      fire blazing against a wall.  Suddenly he remembers the wolf. 
      He quickly feels his body, his chest -- then glances under
      the fur to make sure everything is intact.  Then slowly Young
      Duncan scans his new surroundings.

      YOUNG DUNCAN'S POV - THE HUT - SEVERAL SHOTS

      revealing an assortment of weird artifacts: on the walls,
      animal bones, an eagle's wing.  On a low table close by him
      a human skull.

      RESUME YOUNG DUNCAN

      as he reacts to the bizarre sight.  Cautiously he rises and
      moves to the hut's door, which has been left open.

      He steps outside.


      Cassandra is moving around the loft, examining it, curious
      about the type of man that lives there.  MacLeod watches her
      with a touch of awe as she moves in and out of pools of light,
      looking alternately real and ethereal.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    It's been a long time since that
                    night.  I wondered what kind of man
                    you'd become.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm surprised you didn't just check
                    your crystal ball.

      She peers at him closely.  She touches his face, almost as
      though she can feel what he felt.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    And the road's been hard.

      MacLeod turns away.  It's true, but he doesn't want to discuss
      it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A lot happens in four hundred years. 
                      I survived.

      He's kidding, but only half.  Cassandra smiles.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What for?  It's the twentieth century. 
                    I used a detective agency.

      She's deadly earnest, all humor gone.

      FADE IN:


      Young Duncan sleeps on furs, smile on his face.

      He murmurs in his sleep.  Cassandra watches over him, staring
      into the fire.  He awakens to find her staring at him.  She
      is wearing a cotton dress with a loosely laced bodice.

                                      CASSANDRA

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                          (beat)
                    I was a man, the leader of my Clan,
                    and...

      He stops himself.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    And?  Were you alone?

      Young Duncan shakes his head.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                          (understands)
                    You were with me.
                          (beat)
                    What were we doing?

      She moves her face closer to his.  She looks into his eyes. 
      He turns away nervously.  She takes his face in her hands
      and kisses him.

      Duncan's eyes remain wide open for a moment and then close
      in reverie.

      She pulls away slowly.

      Young Duncan's lips remain pulsed and his eyes closed long
      after she moves away.  Then, from without, a cock crows,
      pulling him from his reverie.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                          (shocked)
                    Morning?
                          (realizing)
                    I must go!

      Cassandra takes his arm.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Not yet.  There's someone in your
                    village who wants to harm you.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    That would be my father.  He'll skin
                    me alive!

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan, listen to me.
                          (intense)
                    This one is an enemy... and he means
                    to kill you.

                          (beat)
                    You can't face him now, but you will
                    one day.  And then you must kill
                    him.

      Duncan looks at her, a little spooked.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Then you really are a witch.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Don't they tell a tale in your village
                    of a man in your grandfather's time
                    who died and came back to life?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Of course, Connor MacLeod, but that's
                    just Clan legend.  It's just a story.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Some stories are true.

      And OFF his puzzled look, she gazes into the fire, stares at
      the flames, as if reading something there.  Her voice and
      eyes become becomes distant.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    One will come, who will know the
                    darkness and the light.  He will
                    challenge a great evil, that only he
                    can defeat.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I don't understand.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Not now.  But you will.

      Then she closes her eyes, as if listening to something only
      she can hear.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    It's time.  Your people are coming
                    for you.
                          (off his look)
                    Go now.  Straight out from the hut,
                    and they will find you.

      Young Duncan is bewildered -- but he accepts what she says. 
      He moves to the door.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Duncan --

      He turns to look at her.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    When the wolf came for you, you really
                    weren't afraid?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    No.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Why not?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Because good must always triumph
                    over evil.  Did you not know that?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Perhaps I just needed to hear it
                    from you.

      He nods, accepting that answer.  Cassandra moves to him,
      takes something from her dress, hands it to him.  It is his
      knife.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    You won't need to worry about the
                    wolf again.

      He takes the knife, hesitates, looks up at her.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Will I ever see you again?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Yes.

      He turns and steps out.


      MacLeod is on the couch, groggy, Cassandra hovering over
      him.  She hands him a glass of amber liquid.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Take this.  I told you he was
                      dangerous!
                          (off his hesitation)
                    Don't worry.  It's whisky.  Single
                    malt.

      MacLeod takes a slug, grimaces, and hands it back.  Reaches
      for his sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He'll be coming.

      He starts to rise, but she puts a hand on his chest.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Using the power tires Roland.  He
                    needs to regain his strength.
                          (beat)
                    We have some time.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What happened back there?  What the
                    hell did he use on me?
                          (beat)
                    And don't tell me magic.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Call it what you want.  The power of
                      suggestion.  A trick learned over a
                    thousand years.

      MacLeod thinks there's something she's holding back.  He
      takes her arm, looks into her eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A trick you taught him?

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (beat)
                    Roland was my student.  Ages ago. 
                    When I realized what he was, it was
                    too late to stop him.  He was too
                    strong.  It's the prophecy, Duncan.

                    You're the only one who can beat
                    him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You still believe that?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    So far, I'm batting a thousand.

      MacLeod hesitates.  There's something he wants to ask.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If you saw the future, did you see
                    the life I'd have?

                    My own father disowning me... Tessa

                                      CASSANDRA
                    It's not like that.  I wish it was. 
                    I only see glimpses, fragments...
                    never the whole.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Do you see my death?

                    I see death, Duncan.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Whose?

                    I don't know.

      And OFF this --


      Roland enters.  He checks the place warily.  He gets the
      BUZZ and smiles.

                                      ROLAND
                    Hello, witch.

      He starts to move to the elevator.


      MacLeod and Cassandra get the BUZZ.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I thought you said he needed time.

                          (panicking)
                    He should.  He's become stronger
                    than I thought -- we have to hurry!

                                                                                INTERCUT:

      ROLAND

      in the elevator.  The button-box is locked, but Roland passes
      a hand over it -- it STARTS.  The elevator begins to rise. 
      Roland inside, focussing his power, readying for the kill.

      RESUME LOFT

      MacLeod, katana in hand, moves to the elevator to meet Roland.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan!

      ROLAND

      rising, feeling his power -- he seems to swell up.

      RESUME LOFT

      Cassandra pulls at MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I won't run.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You're not running...

      Then her VOICE changes.  She uses the same power as Roland,
      but it's different: her voice is soft, seductive, siren-like.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    You re using your strength.  Saving
                    me from him.
                          (beat)
                    I need you, Duncan.  You're my only
                    chance.  And our only chance is to
                    leave.

      The VOICE affects him.  MacLeod's resolve is weakening.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I can't.

      Cassandra continue in the same voice but with more intensity.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You must.  Now, Duncan, or I will
                    die.

      MacLeod hesitates.  He s drawn to her voice.  And OFF his
      hesitation --

      ANGLE -  THE ELEVATOR - MOMENTS   LATER

      It arrives.  Roland steps from it into the loft, pumped and
      confident in his power.

                                      ROLAND
                    MACLEOD!

      But all he feels is the fading BUZZ.

      Roland moves about the place, sword out.  He knows they were
      there, that he missed them.  No matter.  He moves around the
      loft until he sees --

      CLOSE - A PHOTO

      sitting on the desk, small, in an antique frame a photo of
      MacLeod.

      Roland lifts it, tears out the picture and tosses the frame
      aside.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    Three can play.

      And OFF his grim smile --

120120OMITTED


      Cassandra sits, exhausted by the effort of using her power. 
      MacLeod paces before her, pissed at having been manipulated.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't like being controlled.  Not
                    by Roland, by you... by anyone.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What choice did I have?  He would
                    have killed you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan, you felt his power.
                          (beat)
                    The prophecy is at hand.

                                      MACLEOD

                    "An evil one will come to vanquish
                    all before him.  Only a Highland
                    child, born on the winter solstice,
                    who has seen both darkness and light,
                    can stop him.  A child and a man."

      As Cassandra speaks we will hear and see echoes of Old Tom,
      Cassandra, and Roland offering their pieces of the legend.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We make our own destinies.  Nothing
                    is written.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    No?  Did you pass through darkness
                    into light?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Everyone does.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Not like you.  You were truly evil,
                    Duncan.  You know the darkest place
                    in men s souls.  You ve been there
                    and survived.

                    You're the one from the prophecy.  I

                    now.
                          (beat)
                    Do you believe me?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I believe Roland wants my head.
                          (with urgency)
                    Teach me.  Like you taught him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I can't.  Roland's gift was always
                    there.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then what?!  What can I use?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Use the prophecy.  If you're the
                    man, who's the child?

      He turns back to her, but instead of finding Cassandra, he
      finds himself in --96501       "Prophecy"       39.       Final Shooting Script 6/26/96




      The PRESENT-DAY MACLEOD stands watching Young Duncan alone
      in the hut.  He is fingering the wolf's skull.

      Young Duncan feels a presence.  He turns and sees MACLEOD. 
      He stands, approaches him with a wondering look.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Who are you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You.

      Young Duncan reaches out, touches the hard muscled arm of
      MacLeod.  MacLeod leans down, until he's face-to-face with
      his young self.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    It's true.  Why are you here?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know.
                          (realizing)
                    You're the child.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I'm no child.  I'm a Chieftain's
                    son.  I'm going to lead our clan to
                    glory.  I will be a great warrior.

      MacLeod reacts to the boy's innocence.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (sadly)
                    Aye, you will be a great warrior.

      Cassandra enters, carrying a basket of herbs.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Who are you talking to?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    The man I'll become.

      Cassandra looks -- but from her POV, sees nothing.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Do you like what you see?

      Young Duncan turns to MacLeod, flashes him a shy smile.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Yes.

      And OFF their looks, MacLeod hears a sound behind him.  He
      turns, and he's back in --

      RESUME SCENE

      He's where he was before, Cassandra watching him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did you do that?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I helped.
                          (impatient)
                    What happened?  What did you see?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Me as a child.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    The child and the man.
                          (beat)
                    The prophecy.

      Before he can answer --

                                    COP ONE
                    You!  Don't move!

      TWO COPS race toward MacLeod, their guns out.

                                    COP ONE (CONT'D)
                    Freeze right there!

      MacLeod raises his hands.

                                    COP ONE (CONT'D)
                    Turn around.

      MacLeod does as asked.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What's this about?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    It's Roland.  He knows we're here. 
                    He's using them!

      As Cop one tries to cuff MacLeod, he moves quickly, flips
      the man, slams him on his back.

      A spinkick takes out Cop Two.

      Cassandra pulls him away.

                    Go!  Hurry!

      MacLeod turns and heads down the pathway, toward a door. 
      Cop One staggers up, grabs his gun and lurches after him.


      A huge, hollow space, containing one or two wooden crates
      and a filthy mat.  LIGHT stabs into the room as the DOOR
      groans open --

      ROLAND enters, holds the door as the Cops enter behind him,
      dragging MacLeod.  He's in rough shape, just starting to
      revive.

      As they drag him to the center, he starts to struggle -- COP
      ONE clubs him, sends him sprawling to the floor.

      Roland steps before the Cops, using the VOICE.

                                      ROLAND
                    You've done well, officers... but
                    it's finished now.  Time to forget.

      Cop one looks confused, holds up MacLeod's picture.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    You chased a robbery suspect.  You
                    turned up nothing.  Saw no one.

      Roland takes back MacLeod's picture.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    There's no one here.  You hear
                      nothing... see no one.
                          (beat)
                    You never saw this place.  You never
                    saw me.

      REVERSE - ANGLE

      as the Cops talk.  Where Roland and MacLeod should be, there's
      only blackness -- they're invisible to the cops.  They go
      back to the conversation they were having before they met
      Roland.

                                    COP ONE
                    I swear, two strings and a band-aid. 
                    And she says can't we work something
                    out.

      They move out.

                          (coming to his knees)
                    Wait!

                                      ROLAND
                    They can't hear you, MacLeod.  As
                    far as they know, you don't exist.
                          (beat)
                    Soon they'll be right.

      The cops leave.  Roland turns back to MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You waited four hundred years for
                    this, Roland?

                                      ROLAND
                    If it weren't for that witch, I
                    would've got you when you were
                    thirteen.
                          (beat)
                    There's something about children. 
                    Their innocence, their honesty...

                    It gives me the creeps.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then go for it.

      Roland knows what MacLeod is trying to do: goad him into
      fighting when he has depleted his power.

                                      ROLAND
                    Not quite yet.

      He suddenly KICKS MacLeod, sends him rolling.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    I'll be back.  When I'm ready.

      He leaves, sliding the great door behind him.  It grinds
      shut with a hollow CLANG as final as a closing coffin.

      MacLeod rummages in the dark.  Near the mat, he finds a CANDLE
      among the rubbish, matches.  He lights it, and rises to
      examine his prison: high walls, the mat, a wooden crate. 
      Nothing else, no way out, nothing he can use.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Should call Architectural Digest.

      He tries the door, but it won't budge: locked from the
      outside.  No way out.

      MacLeod sets the candle on the crate, and slides to the floor. 
      Nothing to do but wait for Roland.  Wait to die.  He shakes
      off the despair, trying to convince himself.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Nothing is written.  Nothing.

      He assumes a meditation position, closing his eyes, trying
      to focus.  Then he hears a voice --

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN (O.S.)
                          (wondering)
                    Are you a dream?

      MacLeod opens his eyes: standing on the opposite side of the
      candle flame, like a wraith in the light -- YOUNG DUNCAN
      watches his grown self.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.
                          (beat)
                    Maybe we both are.

      Young Duncan reaches a hand towards MacLeod, almost to the
      candle but he won't cross it.  It's like some boundary.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Cassandra promised I'd live a long
                    time.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe not much longer.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                          (confused)
                    But you've grown.  I've grown...
                    into a great warrior.
                          (wondering)
                    Who could ever defeat you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's not important.  There's so much
                    we need to talk about.  So much you
                    have to learn.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    About my future?

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's right.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Do I win many battles?

                    Then I'm a great chieftain.

                    It s different.

                    You'll see.

      Young Duncan doesn't push it.  They eye each other for a
      moment.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Tell me about this other warrior.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes.  He has powers I don't have.
                          (beat)
                    I don't know how to defeat him.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I faced a wolf, and I'm thirteen.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a smile, remembering)
                      I remember.

      Young Duncan smiles with childish certainty.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    You'll win, because you're good... 
                    and good wins over evil.  Did you
                    not know that?

      MacLeod smiles gently at his innocent self.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's more complicated than that.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    It's never more complicated than
                    that.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    This one has a kind of... magic. 
                    It's in his voice.  If I even hear
                    him speak, I'm dead.

      Young Duncan looks pensive a moment.  He's thinking.  Then
      he looks up --

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Then don't listen.

      And as MacLeod takes this in, Young Duncan starts to fade
      away, dematerialize.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Don't go.  Please!  We're not
                    finished.  Wait... wait!

      But Young Duncan is gone.  The silo is empty and silent.

      Only the candle remains.  As MacLeod's eyes go to the candle --

128128OMITTED


      The DOOR grinds open, throwing light into the space.  Roland
      enters, finds MacLeod seated before the crate, looking calm
      and composed.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Finished your beauty sleep?

      Roland draws his sword.

                                      ROLAND
                    We're making history, MacLeod... no
                    point in rushing it.

      He kicks the crate aside, smashing it.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    It's time.

      Still calm, MacLeod rises to face him.

      Roland lunges at him, and they fight across the silo floor. 
      They're closely matched in skill and strength, neither gaining
      an edge.  Then --

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    Did you feel that, Highlander?

      Roland uses THE VOICE.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    That's your arm, growing weaker.
                          (growing intensity)
                    The muscles, giving up.

      MacLeod sags a little, backing away.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    You're tired... so weary... You're
                    finding it hard to focus.

      MacLeod brings the katana up.  He looks tired, but each time
      Roland attacks, MacLeod's blade seems to be there in the
      last instant.  Roland seems to get a little frustrated.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                          (louder)
                    Your legs are getting numb...
                    frozen... Your arms are like lead. 
                    Moving is pain.  Moving is agony.

      But MacLeod fights better, his moves faster, stronger.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                          (with increasing
                              desperation)
                    And the sword is so heavy, MacLeod...
                    too heavy to lift.

      MacLeod's blade is faster than ever.  Roland is cut on his
      arm.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    This can't be.

      Roland backs away.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    The prophecy must be fulfilled.

      He attacks.

      MacLeod smiles and slashes Roland across the gut.  Roland
      falls to his knees.

                    This is impossible.

      MACLEOD

      swings -- and Roland dies.

      The Quickening hits.  It's a storm in that space, light
      cascading out from MacLeod's feet, running up the walls of
      the silo, to shower down on him.

      After, MacLeod lifts his head, starts to rise.  He looks up
      and Cassandra hurries toward him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan... Duncan...

      He smiles.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Sorry... I can't hear you.

      He reaches into his ears and removes two balls of wax.  He
      looks at the fallen Roland.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I didn't listen.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT : TAG

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod is in his loft.  A lit candle glows on the table. 
      He's gazing at it, pensive, remembering what happened, his
      encounter with Young Duncan.  We HEAR the sound of childish
      LAUGHTER far off, the sound in Duncan's mind: then we see
      BRIEF FLASHES of Young Duncan --

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I faced a wolf, and I'm thirteen...

      Another BRIEF FLASH, Young Duncan's smiling face.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm a Chieftain's son.  I'm going to
                    lead my clan to glory.

      The smiling face fades.  Then another voice brings him back
      to the present.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What would you have told him?

      Cassandra stands there, watching him.  If MacLeod felt her
      approach, he gave no sign.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know.
                          (beat)
                      I could've warned him.  Saved him
                    some of the grief he'd know in his
                    life.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What would you have said?
                          (beat)
                    Don't feel?  Don't grow?  Don't live
                    with hope?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I suppose not.
                          (beat)
                    So.  The prophecy is fulfilled.  Now
                    you leave.

      She looks at him a moment.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    There's one more thing to do.

      She holds out her hand.  He takes it.  She leads him to his
      bed.  She starts to unbutton his shirt.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Is this part of the prophecy, too?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    No... This is for me.

      She kisses him.  MacLeod is almost timid in responding.  She
      notices.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Is something wrong?

      He runs his large, strong hands down her sides.  Touching
      her... feeling her.  Runs a hand through her hair and down
      the side of her face as if in wonder.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just making sure you're real.

      His hand goes to the clasp of her gossamer shift and undoes
      it.  It falls to her feet.  She stands there, naked and real.

      As his arms fold around her --

                                                                              FADE OUT.
