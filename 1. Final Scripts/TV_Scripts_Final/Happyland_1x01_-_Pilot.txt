      EXT. WONDERLAND THEME PARK - DAY

      CLOSE ON: the beautiful, ageless, Latina face of GLORIA 
      VILLAR. Well, she isn t really ageless; she s 34, and right 
      now she s under about nine pounds of stage makeup and clad in 
      full-on fairy-tale regalia to play  Princess Sophia. 

                                  GLORIA
                    ... Dreams really do come true...

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Gloria is being embraced by the handsome 
      PRINCE VALOR (a younger  ageless  than Gloria s ageless) as he 
      stares into her eyes, completely in love. 

                                  PRINCE VALOR
                    How about  happily ever after?  

                                  GLORIA
                    Well, Prince Valor  

                                  PRINCE VALOR
                      If we re going to marry, you should 
                    probably start calling me  Edward. 

                                  GLORIA
                    Well, Edward... I think  happily ever 
                    after  starts right about now.

      Prince Valor leans in and gives her the most romantic   and 
      chaste   stage-kiss a six-year-old could dream up...

      ... And indeed, we now see the audience is comprised of scores 
      of CHILDREN and their PARENTS, watching what s called a 
         Street-mosphere  show on the  Main Street  of the celebrated 
      American institution Wonderland Theme Park. 

      Gloria and Prince Valor are surrounded by ANTHROPOMORPHIC 
      ANIMALS and performers dressed as GIANT VEGETABLES, all 
      cheering their love. A movable BACKDROP of a royal animated 
      kitchen is in the background. 

      As the romantic couple kiss, we Panic Room-style ZOOM THROUGH 
      a hole in the ivory-covered fence behind them into:

      EXT. BEHIND THE FENCE - CONTINUOUS

      Past the waiting PERFORMERS IN COWBOY COSTUMES and black-clad 
      TECHIES preparing a large prop stagecoach, and into:                                                                                       2.


      INT. BACKSTAGE TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

      KEEP ZOOMING DOWN A STAIRCASE, into the Wonderland Underground 
      Tunnels, which comprise the first floor of the whole park.

      And finally, we find LUCY VILLAR: 16, half-Latina, pragmatic, 
        quick-witted and acerbic. Like the techies we saw behind the 
      fence, Lucy is clad in black. She has an ear-piece and holds 
      an iPad. Currently, she s stressed and on the move.

      Everything here is happening FAST FAST FAST.

                                  LUCY
                    Where the hell is my Rocky?

      Lucy passes by PERFORMERS in various stages of undress: giant 
      rabbit rubber legs on SWEATY GUYS in tank tops; PRINCESSES of 
      different ethnicities scrambling to put on wigs. All of them 
      regard Lucy with familiarity   quick high-fives,  hey Lucy , 
      etc   but no one s seen Rocky.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    I kinda need a giant talking raccoon 
                    wearing a Stetson to appear in the 
                    next six seconds.

                                  WILL (O.S.)
                    Lucy. I can do it.

      Lucy turns to see WILL ARMSTRONG (17, mixed race black and 
      white, masculine and tough), in the costume of a Rocky Raccoon 
      in a Hawaiian shirt. He holds the giant rubber head. 

                                  LUCY
                    You re coming off 45 minutes of love 
                    and shoves and you re in Hawaiian Fun 
                    Rocky gear. You re still dripping in 
                    kid juice  

                                  WILL
                       Kid juice  is phrase no one should 
                    ever say, and I can swap out the 
                    costume in three minutes   

                                    PATRICK
                      We don t have three minutes. 
                    They re at bows, and Cowboy Rocky s 
                    up next. Lucy, he s new, you gotta 
                    hold his hand, here.

      Will s dad   and their boss   stage manager PATRICK ARMSTRONG 
      (40, white, blue-collar, tough but kind) rounds a corner.                                                                                       3.


                                  WILL
                    Dad, she s in a bind, I know the 
                      choreography  

                                    PATRICK
                      Union regulations say you need 
                      forty-five minutes between sets. Like 
                    I need grief from them if you go out 
                    again right away. 

                                  LUCY
                    Costumes said Rocky checked in. But 
                    it s his first day, maybe he s lost  

                                    PATRICK
                      Behind me on the left. You see?

      Lucy sees: a guy we ll just call ARMANI SUIT for now (21, Wall 
      Street handsome, well-bred and well-mannered). He lingers off 
      to the side, inconspicuous but watching closely.

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    New guy from upstairs. Here to 
                       familiarize himself. 

      Eye-contact between Lucy and Patrick: this is serious. Lucy 
      quickly rounds a corner while speaking into her ear-piece:

                                  LUCY
                    I need all eyes on Rocky Raccoon. I 
                    repeat, all eyes on Rocky Raccoon  

      And SMACK   she runs right into:

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                      I m assuming that s me?

      The performer playing ROCKY RACCOON   Wonderland s iconic 
      flagship character   is in full rubber-suited, cowboy getup, 
      his voice muffled but audible through the giant raccoon head.

                                  LUCY
                    I don t know who you are, but you re 
                    an idiot.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    This goes without saying. Look how 
                    I m dressed.

      Annoyed, Lucy grabs Rocky s arm, pushing him down the hallway 
      as performers part like the Red Sea. Channeling Robert Downey 
      Jr. in Iron Man, this Rocky talks quickly:                                                                                      4.


                                  ROCKY RACCOON (CONT D)
                    What s your name? I m Rocky, but you 
                    probably knew that part already.

                                  LUCY
                    I know the part about you being late 
                    and almost ruining everything.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    True, but you didn t quite answer my 
                    question. 
                          (off her glare)
                    If you re glaring it s wasted on me. 
                    I can barely see through this head.

      They arrive at the steps leading to the area behind the fence.   
      As Lucy talks, she gives final adjustments to his costume.

                                  LUCY
                    Okay, to review: you enter in front 
                    of the stagecoach and do your dance 
                    with the cowboys. A tech in the crowd 
                      manipulates your mask s jaw and makes 
                    the words come out. Then you have 
                    love and shoves   hug a kid, pose for 
                      a picture, sign an autograph, send 
                    them off   while I run interference 
                    on the crowd. After twenty minutes I 
                    say  Rocky has to go back to the 
                    rodeo,  and I take you inside. 
                    Remember, to these kids, you are 
                    Rocky Raccoon, so no dream-crushing 
                    or illusion-shattering on my watch. 
                    If you re in distress, the signal is 
                    you take off your cowboy hat. Got it?

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    ... I sign autographs for cowboys?
                          (off her silence)
                    Are you glaring again?

                                  LUCY
                    Just get the hell out there.

      But guiding him up the stairs, she smells something:

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    Hold up, is that pot? Are you stoned?

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    I m getting a high-strung vibe from 
                    you, so there s really not an answer 
                    to that question you re gonna like.                                                                                      5.


      EXT. BEHIND THE FENCE - CONTINUOUS

      We hear the sound of kids CHANTING  Rocky! Rocky!  from the 
      other side of the fence. They pass by Gloria (Princess Sophia) 
      and Prince Valor, who offstage is the GAYEST MAN ALIVE. 

                                  LUCY
                          (to Rocky; incensed)
                      You were burning one?

                                  PRINCE VALOR
                    Oh, helllllll s to the no!

      As Gloria gives her Prince Valor a playful smack, the FENCE 
      SWINGS OPEN and the stagecoach rolls out with the cowboys. Too 
      late to turn back now   stoned Rocky is going on.

      EXT. WONDERLAND THEME PARK - CONTINUOUS

      The crowd goes nuts when they see Rocky, the cowboys, and the 
      entourage (Lucy included) roll out. Rocky begins speaking 
      through a COMPUTERIZED VOICE (not the performer), as operated 
      by a nearby TECH, just as Lucy said.

                                  ROCKY COMPUTER VOICE
                    Howdy kids, looks like it s time for 
                      a hoedown! Whaddya say?

      The kids CHEER. But as the cowboys and Rocky go into a cowboy 
      hoedown, Rocky starts off strong, but then he stumbles... And 
      Rocky falls down. And stays down. Shit   he must have passed 
      out! Still, his computer headpiece KEEPS TALKING:

                                  ROCKY COMPUTER VOICE (CONT D)
                    I love a good hoedown!

      But with him on the ground, it seems creepy. A kid starts 
      CRYING. From the sidelines, Lucy radios into her earpiece:

                                  LUCY
                    We have a Rocky tumble.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. BACKSTAGE TUNNELS - SAME TIME

      Stage Manager Patrick doesn t waste a breath as he calls out:

                                    PATRICK
                    Rocky tumble!                                                                                      6.


      Five GUYS in black   Will among them   run out to the exit... 
      Patrick glances at Armani Suit. Armani Suit watches and then 
      writes something down on his iPad, ominously.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. WONDERLAND THEME PARK - SAME TIME

      Rocky lies on the ground, unmoving, as kids grow concerned and 
      whisper. The COWBOY PERFORMERS continue their dance, standing 
      in front of the fallen Rocky.

                                  COWBOY #1
                    I reckon Rocky is hidin ...

      As the cowboys improvise, we find Lucy in the audience again. 
        A 6-year-old KID looks up at her, scared:

                                  KID
                    Did Rocky have a stroke? My grandpa 
                    had a stroke.

                                  LUCY
                    Rocky didn t have a stroke! He loves 
                    to hide! You know how silly he is...

      The kid smiles, while in the background we see WILL and the 
      other guys in black, who discreetly enter through the 
      stagecoach while the cowboys onstage stay in character:

                                  COWBOY #2
                    How we gonna have a Rocky hoedown 
                    without a Rocky? You fellas seen him?

      While behind them... The guys surround the fallen Rocky. We 
      don t see exactly what s happening   we re with the audience 
      here   but only a few moments later, Rocky bounces up again. 
      The kids LAUGH and CHEER with relief.

                                  ROCKY COMPUTER VOICE
                    Looks like it s time for a hoedown!

      The cowboys and Rocky begin their dance again, while behind 
      the stagecoach, the black-clad guys carry a SEMI-CONSCIOUS GUY 
      away. Will is no longer with them   he s in the suit.

                                  LUCY
                          (into earpiece)
                      Switch-out s done. Show s back up.

      As the show goes on, Lucy allows herself a moment of relief   
      which quickly turns to anger.                                                                                      7.


      INT. BACKSTAGE TUNNELS - DAY

      Lucy pushes open the door to a dressing room with Rocky s 
      iconic cartoon face on it and enters THE DRESSING ROOM, where 
       Rocky  is behind a changing curtain as Lucy barrels in.

                                  LUCY
                    You must already hate this gig 
                    something fierce or you wouldn t be 
                    trying to get yourself fired so fast.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON (BEHIND CURTAIN)
                    Hey, it gets hot under that costume.

                                  LUCY
                    You got high under that costume.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    Like you ve never passed out in 
                    there.

                                  LUCY
                    I m not the performing type. Kinda 
                    like you re the  unable to handle his 
                    buzz without fainting  type.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON (BEHIND CURTAIN)
                    You gonna narc on me?

                                  LUCY
                    It smells like Amanda Bynes s tour 
                    bus in here so you basically narced  

      But as she talks,  Rocky  steps from behind the curtain... And 
      for the first time, we see IAN CHANDLER. He is 16, currently 
      shirtless, dripping with sweat, and possibly the best-looking 
      male specimen in the known world. 

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    ... Narced... yourself.

      Lucy s words are mush. But doing anything besides taking in 
      the utter hotness of Ian is a fool s errand   and he knows it. 

                                  IAN
                    Sorry, what were you saying?

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

      Right back to that moment where Lucy is taking in Ian.

                                  IAN
                    If you were looking for more 
                      adjectives to go with  can t handle 
                    his pot, let s start with 
                       irresponsible,   caddish   

      Lucy may be flustered, but she s not one to change her tune at 
      the sight of a pretty face. (Not for very long, anyway.)

                                  LUCY
                         Unjustifiably self-satisfied,  
                     smug,  and of course,  douchey. 

                                  IAN
                    Oh, those are good!

      Patrick walks in. He tosses Ian a robe.

                                    PATRICK
                    Hey Magic Mike, put on some clothes.

      Ian wraps the robe around himself, a little slower than 
      necessary. Then Patrick sniffs the air. Smells the marijuana.

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    What s that?

      Patrick looks at Ian   who for the first time, displays a hint 
      of nervousness. Then Patrick turns to Lucy. She shrugs. She 
      may be pissed, but she s not a narc.

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    Tumble on your first day, huh?

                                  IAN
                    I was curious to see how the rescue 
                    protocols worked. Sadly, turns out I 
                    was unconscious by that time.

                                    PATRICK
                    Ha. I was a fur for ten years. You 
                    gotta make friends with the Gatorade.

      Patrick and Ian CHUCKLE. Then Patrick studies Ian s face:

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    But maybe you d be better as a 
                     face.  Maybe a Prince Valor...                                                                                      9.


                                  LUCY
                    Patrick, that s a promotion. 

                                    PATRICK
                    He s the right height. Right 
                      complexion. We re short on Valors.
                          (to Ian)
                    And it s less costume, so you 
                    wouldn t be as hot. Heat is why you 
                      collapsed, right?

                                  IAN
                    ... Yeah. It was the heat.

                                    PATRICK
                    All right. We ll get you learning the 
                    part stat. For now, hydrate.

      Patrick heads out into the BACKSTAGE TUNNELS, and Lucy 
      follows. Once out of Ian s earshot, she says:

                                  LUCY
                    We have guys who ve been waiting 
                    years to play Valor. This ass-hat 
                    screwed up right out of the gate, so 
                    why would you  

                                    PATRICK
                      Lucy. I love you like a daughter, 
                    but you gotta drop it and let me do 
                    my damn job.

      Patrick walks away, leaving Lucy alone. She peeks into the 
      dressing room and sees Ian getting ready. He heard everything:

                                  IAN
                    ... Maybe add  ass-hat  to the list?

      Annoyed, she stomps off. He watches her go and smiles.

      EXT. TWINKLE S NEST - EVENING

        A 4-year-old BOY screams and cries while sitting on the lap of 
      TWINKLE BIRD, an anthropomorphic canary wearing suspenders. 
      They sit in giant bird nest outfitted to look like a house.

                                  CRYING BOY
                      AHHHHH!!!! HE S SCARY!!! 

      The boy cries and thrashes while his PARENTS attempt to calm 
      him, photographer HARPER MUNROE (16, crucifix necklace, good 
      Christian girl turning restless,) tries to keep a happy face.                                                                                     10.


      We now see that Lucy and Will stand off to the side in 
      civvies, amused by the display.

                                  HARPER
                    And... Smile?

                                  BOY S MOTHER
                    C mon, honey! Smile for Twinkle!

                                  CRYING BOY
                    I HATE TWINKLE!!!! AHHHH!!!!!

      Harper sighs and snaps the photo. After the boy throws his 
      slushie at Harper s head, TWINKLE S GREETER leads the crying 
      boy away. Harper is tapped on the shoulder by a NEW 
      PHOTOGRAPHER, signalling her break.

      Heading away from the LONG LINE OF KIDS AND PARENTS, Harper 
      wipes her face as she joins Lucy and Will as they walk through 
      THE PARK. Harper and Will hold hands, a longtime couple. 
      Everywhere you look there s something  Wonderland-Ful,  with 
      rides, shops, stands of food and apparel. Paradise to an over-
      stimulated kid, but old hat to Lucy, Harper, and Will.

                                  HARPER
                    I m so over this job. I can t believe 
                    my parents are still making me work 
                    at this Diet Snot-flavored park.

      Lucy and Will exchange a glance. She nods:  Go ahead. 

                                  WILL
                    Pop quiz!

                                  HARPER
                    No! Why?

                                  WILL
                      Shirtless, coked up Charlie Sheen 
                    shows up at your family s new house 
                    at 3 AM. He just wants to talk. Do 
                    you let him in?

                                  HARPER
                          (not enthused)
                    ... No...?

                                  WILL
                    Bad move! He wanted you to join the 
                    Dazzle Homeowner s Association where 
                    they weigh you and then give you that 
                    weight in gold as a  Welcome to the 
                      neighborhood  gesture. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                  WILL (CONT'D)
                    So then he breaks all your dishes and 
                    makes you tell him he s pretty.

                                  HARPER
                    I change my answer to  yes.  I let in 
                    shirtless coked up Charlie Sheen.

                                  LUCY
                    Bad move! He blames your father s new 
                    promotion for escalating violence in 
                    Syria and says you need to move back 
                    to your old neighborhood with your 
                    friends. 

                                  HARPER
                    Then he cries in my soup, right? 

                                  LUCY
                    Yes, but they re delicious tears.

                                  HARPER
                    What did I say to deserve a pop quiz? 
                      Seriously, I m still Harper from the 
                    block. I can do the dance and 
                      everything.

                                  WILL
                    You literally live in a Wonderland-
                    owned town named  Dazzle.  My car got 
                    towed there  cause it didn t  meet 
                    the aesthetic requirements.  Exactly 
                    what  block  are you talking about?

      The mood s joviality is tested in a moment of tension. Harper 
      opts to ignores Will s snark and instead says to Lucy:

                                  HARPER
                    Dude, Luce: Did I hear a GQ cover 
                    model took a Rocky tumble?

                                  LUCY
                    Whatever, he s not that cute. Kinda 
                    big on the dick-scale.
                          (before Harper can joke)
                    Not that dick-scale.

                                  HARPER
                    You sure you don t want a litter of 
                    Hot Rocky s raccoon babies inside 
                    you? Park chatter says he s gorg.                                                                                    12.


                                  LUCY
                    If by  gorg  you mean  inconsiderate 
                    towards the livelihood of his fellow 
                      performers,  then yes: totes gorg. 

      As Will watches Lucy deny the obvious fact of Ian s 
        attractiveness, we see a look of jealousy on his face. 

      And Harper notices Will s look, but doesn t say anything. 
      Instead she just takes her boyfriend s hand. 

      EXT.  THE BRICK  - NIGHT

      With the lights of Wonderland in the distance, Lucy walks 
      through the working-class neighborhood that houses many of its 
      employees. She approaches a drab, nondescript building that 
      could almost be a college dorm. For Lucy, it s home.

      INT. LUCY S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

      As Lucy approaches the front door, she hears the sound of a 
      woman s FLIRTATIOUS LAUGHTER coming from inside. She sighs   
      her expression reading  here we go again    before entering:

      THE APARTMENT

      A modest home Lucy shares with her mother Gloria   the 
      princess from the opening sequence. Photos of the two of them 
      adorn the walls, along with photos of Gloria playing 
      princesses in various Wonderland shows through the years.

      Gloria entertains Italian CHEF ANTONIO MICARELLI (30, drunk, 
        stud-muffin) who barely speaks English. Gloria and Antonio 
      canoodle on the couch, but when Lucy walks in, Antonio moves 
      his arm off like a teenager caught in the act.

                                  GLORIA
                    Honey, this is Antonio. He s a chef 
                    in the World Village. Antonio, this 
                    ray of sunshine is my daughter, Lucy.

                                  CHEF ANTONIO
                          (heavy Italian accent)
                    Your... Daughter?

                                  LUCY
                    He s doing the math right now in 
                    Italian, isn t he?

                                  CHEF ANTONIO
                    It is late... I must go.                                                                                     13.


      Unsure of what to do around Lucy, he gives her an awkward 
      handshake. Gloria looks somewhere between disappointed and 
      amused as he takes off in record time.

      A slightly uncomfortable moment between mother and daughter 
      lingers in the air. So Lucy asks with mock seriousness:

                                  LUCY
                    Mom... Is Chef Antonio my real dad?

      Gloria throws a couch pillow at her head. Lucy throws it back 
      and walks to the kitchen portion of the main room. 

                                  GLORIA
                    Chef Antonio could be the one. You 
                    don t know.

                    I do, though. What s for dinner?

      Lucy opens the fridge. Practically empty.

                                  LUCY
                      Apparently, peanut butter. Crap, I 
                    should ve gone to the grocery store

                      Honey, relax. We ll do takeout 
                    tonight,  cause tomorrow the park is 
                      buuuuuying, what what...

      Gloria begins to raise the roof. Lucy sighs.

                                  LUCY
                    We talked about you raising the roof.

                      Also, no more saying  crunked.  I

                    Today. Apparently someone dropped out 
                    last minute, and I was one of the

      Gloria pulls Lucy into a big embrace. She starts tearing up.

      INT. RED CROSS OFFICE - DAY

      Lucy sits opposite Red Cross supervisor DENISE (35, serious-
      minded, polar opposite of Gloria). She is not  blowing them 
      away.  In fact, she may just be  blowing it :

                                  LUCY
                      And I think, um... All people 
                    affected by disaster across the 
                    country and around the world should 
                    receive care, shelter and hope.

                                  DENISE
                    ... That s our mission statement. 
                    Word for word. It s on our website. 

                                  LUCY
                          ( oh fuck me )
                    ... I knew it sounded familiar.

                                  DENISE
                    Well! Thanks for coming in.                                                                                    15.


      Denise smiles a professional  you re not going to get this  
      smile, and Lucy tries to keep it together as she heads to the 
      door. But just before she s out, she turns to Denise:

                                  LUCY
                    I totally bombed that, didn t I?

      Denise holds up Lucy s application file.

                                  DENISE
                    You have stellar grades. Your essays 
                    are immaculately-researched. But the 
                    reason we didn t select you before   
                    and what I was hoping to see today   
                    is why you want to work here.

      Lucy takes a deep breath. This isn t easy for her.

                                  LUCY
                    I ve lived in Wonderland my whole 
                    life. All around all you hear is 
                     dreams come true  and stuff, but I 
                    don t necessarily believe that.

      Denise is hard to read, but Lucy definitely has her attention:

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    I do believe I ve got about $14 in 
                    savings, and that affirmative action 
                    and good SAT scores won t be enough 
                    to get a full-ride to college. 

                                  DENISE
                    So this program is just about padding 
                    your college resume?

                                  LUCY
                    No... See, the world s a big place 
                    and I haven t seen it. You work in 
                      Wonderland too long, you can start 
                    thinking life will turn into a fairy 
                    tale. Like you re a character at the 
                    beginning of an animated movie 
                    waiting for a magical adventure to 
                    start. You get delusional. I ve seen 
                    it happen to my moth   to other 
                    people. The Red Cross is about 
                      reality... And I want to be part of 
                    something real.

      Denise smiles; that s what she wanted to hear.                                                                                    16.


                                  DENISE
                    ... I can t promise anything, but how 
                    about you come back for a final 
                    interview with my supervisor this 
                    week, and then we ll see what s what?

      EXT. WONDERLAND THEME PARK - NIGHT

      The main square of Wonderland has been lit up like it s 
      Christmas   no different from every night here, with one big 
      exception: no guests. Tonight, it s employees only. Everyone 
      from CAFETERIA WORKERS to HIGH-POWERED EXECUTIVES are there. 
      This is the  Wonder Buddy Ball. 

      You can tell the working-class  Brickers  apart from the 
       Dazzlers  by their clothes and affect. They ve clustered on 
      opposite sides of the park like kids at a middle school dance. 

      On the Bricker side, Gloria is exuberant as she hugs her 
      daughter, proud and exclaims to her nearby BRICKER FRIENDS.

                                  GLORIA
                    My girl s curing malaria!

      The Brickers CHEER. Lucy tries to temper expectations:

                                  LUCY
                    Again, malaria: already curable. But 
                    I still have a final interview  

                                  GLORIA
                      You re going to murder that final 
                      interview. You re celebrating! We re 
                    getting you a boy to rub up on.

                                  LUCY
                    You re really piling up my future 
                    therapy bills here.

      Gloria spots Ian walking through the park. He s dressed well. 
      Very well. As he passes by, he sees Lucy. He confidently 
      smiles and nods at her, charisma in effect even at a distance.

                                  GLORIA
                    Who is that? Did you see the way he 
                    looked at you? I got lady tingles.

                                  LUCY
                    I d sooner kick it to Chef Antonio, 
                    ESL and all.

                                  GLORIA
                    Then, my precious treasure, you must 
                    be deaf, dumb, blind and dead.                                                                                    17.


      Will comes over, pissed. Still, Lucy s relieved to see him:

                                  LUCY
                    Please save me from this 
                      conversation.

                                  WILL
                    This is some straight-up nonsense. 

      Will points out Harper on the other side of the park talking 
      to a group of WELL-DRESSED TEENAGERS.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Harper s hanging out with Chris 
                    Rummel? Freshman year that kid put 
                    his pubes in my cheeseburger. Not a 
                      euphemism. 

                                  LUCY
                    He lives on her new block. And if 
                    it s any consolation, she says 
                    they re top-notch pubes.

      He look at her, amused by her joke but still saddened by 
      Harper on the other side of the party. 

      As Lucy gives him a consoling look, the sound of a CHAMPAGNE 
      GLASS BEING CLINKED is heard through the loudspeaker.

                                  JAMES (O.S., ON LOUDSPEAKER)
                    Hello! And welcome!

      All eyes turn to the steps of the ENCHANTED CASTLE   a large 
      attraction at the front of the park. Standing atop it is a 
      dashing man of 45; a silver-haired, square-jawed, well-
      tailored captain of industry. As we ll learn in a moment, this 
      is the new president of Wonderland. This is JAMES CHANDLER. 

      He stands next to his elegant, glamorous wife MARGOT (45), and 
      speaks into a mic:

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    As some of you know, my name is James 
                    Chandler, and I am honored to take 
                    over as Wonderland s president today.

      The crowd APPLAUDS. Lucy notices Gloria watching intently.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    ... My Grandpa Hank started this 
                    company when he drew the very first 
                    Rocky Raccoon cartoon back in 1928. I 
                    worked in this very park twenty-five 
                    years ago. Even played Rocky myself.                                                                                    18.


      Will throws Lucy a look:  give me a break. 

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    More recently, I was an executive 
                    here and then in our New York 
                    offices. But now I m here to stay. 
                    And so is my family. So I d like to 
                    introduce my beautiful wife Margot  

      Margot waves to the crowd, in full on Jackie O mode.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    And my son Theodore, who will be 
                    taking over as creative director of 
                    the park. Theodore, c mon up. Say hi.

      By James s side is young man we recognize as  Armani Suit.  
      Now we know his name: THEODORE CHANDLER waves to the crowd.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    He looks twelve, but kid graduated 
                    Harvard in three years. It s unseemly 
                    but a dad s gotta brag, right? 

        Good-natured CHUCKLES from the Dazzlers, while some Brickers 
      like Will are more suspicious.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Working in the character department 
                    taught me the ropes, so I thought 
                     Why not have my younger son start at 
                    the same place?  In fact, he s 
                    already begun working. Ian, wave hi.

      And now Ian stands on stage. He smiles that charming smile, 
      and waves to the crowd. 

      In the audience, Lucy GASPS. She s been working   or rather, 
      sparring   with the son of the president of Wonderland. As 
      Lucy s jaw hangs open, Will leans over and whispers:

                                  WILL
                    ... Guess we know why my dad had to 
                    promote Snoop Lion...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    19.


                                        ACT TWO

      EXT. WONDERLAND THEME PARK - NIGHT

      Lucy, Gloria, and a few others stand in an informal  greeting 
      line  to say hello to James and his family. We recognize a few 
      assorted Brickers   Patrick, gay Prince Valor, some Cowboys   
      who ve all had a few extra glasses of  Magic Ale.  

      Harper and Will are conspicuously off to the side, engaged in 
      what appears to be their umpteenth lover s spat. The mood in 
      line is buoyant, but Gloria seems nervous. 

                                  GLORIA
                    Maybe we ll meet him another time.

                                  LUCY
                    I think this love and shove is a one-
                    time deal. Aren t you excited to  hob-
                    knob with the Dazzler elite? 

                                  GLORIA
                    I was. I am. I just  

                                  JAMES
                      Gloria, right?

      Lucy and Gloria have reached James, Margot, Theodore   and of 
      course, Ian. He gives Lucy a little wave, but she looks away.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    You were here when I was an executive 
                    twenty years ago...

                                  THEODORE
                    You ve been a princess for twenty 
                    years?

      Gloria is flustered; it s not every day she comes face to face 
      with a man of this much power and wealth. And the fact that 
      Creative Director Theodore is scrutinizing her age isn t doing 
      wonders for her confidence. Still, she manages to say:

                                  GLORIA
                    Not quite twenty years... Don t you 
                    go aging me. I m not ready to play a 
                    crone just yet.

                                  JAMES
                    Far from it. Wonderful to still see 
                    you here, Gloria.

      Gloria forces her most confident smile and moves away from the 
      receiving line. Lucy follows, but doesn t get far:                                                                                    20.


                                  IAN (O.S.)
                    Lucy, hold up.

      She turns to see that Ian has left the line and followed her. 
      Gloria gives her daughter a look:  Are you okay? 

                                  GLORIA
                    I can hang around...

                                  LUCY
                    I got it.

      Still flustered, Gloria nods, and disappears into the crowd. 
      Now away from her mom, Lucy turns to Ian, self-conscious:

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    Our adjectives list about you didn t 
                    mention  Wonderland president s 
                      offspring. 

                                  IAN
                    I knew I forgot something. 

      Lucy is awkward: what should she say to this guy?

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Look... I didn t open with that 
                    salient detail because I didn t want 
                    you to feel like you had to play 
                    nice. You re more fun when you re 
                    pissed at me.

      He smiles at her: is he flirting? Fuck. This can only lead to 
      trouble. But look at his eyes: you could swim in those things.

                                  LUCY
                    We re lucky I m still pissed at you.

                                  IAN
                    At least let me try to get back on 
                    your good side.

                                  LUCY
                     Back  implies a time when you were.

                                  IAN
                    Have you ever been to the top of the 
                    executive penthouse?

                                  LUCY
                    Crap, must ve lost my key.

                                  IAN
                    Want to see it now?                                                                                     21.


      Lucy is thrown for a curve?

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    What? I think you re sweet.

      He s 100% serious. For once, Lucy has no quick retort. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                     Sweet  might be a stretch. We ll go 
                    with  plucky.  I can make adjective 
                    lists, too. What do you say?

      But before she can answer, the moment is interrupted by:

                                  HARPER (O.S.)
                    ... What do you say to what exactly?

      They turn to see Harper: drunk and flashing her biggest and 
      best flirtatious smile at Ian. This duet just became a trio.

      INT. PENTHOUSE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

      Lucy, Ian, and Harper ride up the executive elevator. Lucy is 
      nervous, Harper drunk and wobbly, while Ian is on his phone 
      turned away from them. As he talks, Lucy and Harper WHISPER:

                                  LUCY
                    What s going on with you and Will? 

                                  HARPER
                    Ugh, Will s acting like one of those 
                      self-righteous poor people in Les 
                      Miserables. Besides... Look who we re 
                    in an elevator with...

      They glance at Ian, still on the phone. More WHISPERS:

                                  HARPER (CONT D)
                    Wait   am I box-blocking you?

                                  LUCY
                    ... Hardly. He s not my type.

                                  HARPER
                    No, he s not.

      The elevator doors open as Ian gets off the phone. 

                                  IAN
                    Sorry about that. I think my dad has 
                    a bottle of the good stuff up here...

      Ian leads them to:                                                                                    22.


      THE PRESIDENT S PENTHOUSE OFFICE

      Everything you d expect to find in the office of a Fortune 500 
      CEO. Solid oak furniture with original Rocky Raccoon animation 
      cells worth more than Gloria or her ilk make in a year. 

      Harper looks around and SQUEALS IN DELIGHT at the opulence. 
      Ian grabs a bottle of Krug Brut Vintage from his dad s bar. He 
      says to Lucy:

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Balcony s got a ridiculous view.

      Lucy walks out onto the adjacent BALCONY over-looking the 
      whole park from floors up. You can see all the way from the 
      Brick into Dazzle. But more pressingly, from up here, the park 
      looks beautiful. Lucy whispers:

                                  LUCY
                    ... I ve never seen it from up here. 

                                  IAN
                    Kind of amazing, right?

      Lucy nods, then looks at him. His hand starts to creep towards 
      hers. Right now, he doesn t look so smug. In fact, he looks 
      downright dashing. Above the park, literal fireworks go off. 
      Time almost seems to stop... But then: 

                                  HARPER
                    Oh my God, you can totally see my 
                    house in Dazzle! Look!

      Harper has loudly joined them. Ian s hand moves away.

                                  HARPER (CONT D)
                    You are so bad. When were you going 
                    to tell everyone who you were?

      Lucy eyes her friend: Harper s tone is quite flirtatious...

                                  IAN
                    A Libra?

      Harper laughs far too loudly at the joke. 

                                  LUCY
                    This was nice and veritgo-inducing, 
                    but Harp... We should go. 

                                  IAN
                    I promise wherever you re going is 
                    less fun than this balcony.                                                                                    23.


                                  HARPER
                    Yeah, Fun Police, we just got here!

                                  LUCY
                            (deliberate)
                    Will will wonder where we are.

                                  HARPER
                    Oh, will Will?

      Drunk, Harper laughs at her own joke. 

                                  LUCY
                    Okay, I m gonna take Harper home 
                    while her embarrassing splatter to 
                    the ground is only figurative. 

      As Lucy starts to lead Harper away, Harper calls back.

                                  HARPER
                    Byeeee Ian...

      Lucy and Harper arrive at the elevator doors. As they open, 
      Lucy and Ian make eye contact as Harper whispers loudly:

                                  HARPER (CONT D)
                    Do you think he likes me?

      The doors close as Lucy and Ian exchange a little smile.

      INT. LUCY S APARTMENT - MORNING

      Lucy wears her greeter uniform while making breakfast. She s 
      in a good mood. Gloria emerges from her bedroom. 

                                  GLORIA
                    So... What did Ian want last night?

                                  LUCY
                          (little smile)
                    He showed me the penthouse view.

                                  GLORIA
                    ... Was that... all he showed you?

                                  LUCY
                    Mom! Blegh! 

                                  GLORIA
                      Because... I don t think he should be 
                    showing you anything except... Math 
                    homework, or something.                                                                                    24.


                                  LUCY
                    Okay, for one it s summer and there s 
                    no homework, and two, I also thought 
                    Ian seemed sucky at first, but maybe 
                      I misjudged  

                                  GLORIA
                      Lucy, I forbid it.

      Lucy looks at Gloria: is she joking? No, she s not.

                                  LUCY
                    ... And I quote:  Lucy, rub up on a 
                    guy. He gave me lady tingles.  

                                  GLORIA
                    Honey, trust me, I get guys like Ian. 
                    I just want to give you advice   

                                  LUCY
                      I forgot what a guy expert you are. 
                    How silly of me, considering I ve had 
                    front-row seats to the parade of 
                    winners you ve brought around  

                                  GLORIA
                      Hey, watch it, I m your mother  

                                  LUCY
                      No, I m your mother. Look who buys 
                      groceries, does laundry, makes 
                      breakfast, while you dress like a 
                    runner-up from  America s Skankiest 
                    Model.  You don t want me going away 
                    to the Red Cross because you ll lose 
                    your maid. Who the hell are you to 
                     forbid  me from doing anything?

                                  GLORIA
                    ... I m sorry that s what you think 
                    of me. Good luck on your interview.

      Lucy looks like she wants to apologize, but doesn t have the 
      chance as a truly hurt Gloria quickly retreats to her bedroom. 

      INT. ROXY S SALOON - DAY

      Lunch at a grimy Bricker Bar, located just outside Wonderland. 
      Something of a speakeasy, it has clearly unlicensed drawings 
      of Rocky and Roxy Raccoon (Rocky s equally iconic 
       girlfriend,  obviously) in revealing outfits, smoking, 
      drinking, playing pool, etc. An inside joke to park employees, 
      and an obvious subversion of Wonderland s squeaky clean image.                                                                                    25.


      Lucy and Will have lunch in a booth, on break from work.

                                  WILL
                    Where d you and Harper run off to 
                    last night?

      Lucy considers how fully to answer the question...

                                  LUCY
                    ... She just needed to cool off. I 
                    hear you guys had like act three of 
                      Relationship Drama Theater.

      Before Will can respond, the bar goes quiet. All eyes turn to 
      the entrance: Ian and Theodore Chandler just walked in. 

      Silence lingers. Theodore walks over to a picture of scantily-
      clad Roxy Raccoon. He addresses a blue-collar BARTENDER:

                                  THEODORE
                    Do you have license for these 
                      decorations?

                                  BARTENDER
                    Uh... We re not technically in the 
                    park. There s no sign on the door, we 
                    never get tourist business  

                                  THEODORE
                      So you don t have a license?
                          (off Bartender s silence)
                    Well... Then all I can do is buy 
                    everyone in here a round.

      Theodore LAUGHS; he was joking. The Bartender SIGHS, relieved. 
      Someone gives Theodore a backslap. As drinks are poured, Ian 
      approaches Lucy and Will, and extends his hand to Will.

                                  IAN
                    I m Ian.

                                  WILL
                          (doesn t take it)
                    I know who you are.

                                  LUCY
                    This is Will.

                                  IAN
                    Of  Harper and Will?  Plot thickens.

                                  WILL
                    What the hell s that mean?                                                                                    26.


                                  IAN
                    Means whatever you want it to, man.

                                  WILL
                          (standing up)
                    Do we have a problem?

                                  IAN
                    Ask my shrink, I got loads of them.

                                  LUCY
                          (to Will)
                    Take the testosterone down a notch  

      Having overheard their conversation and sensing the tension 
      between Will and Ian, Theodore approaches his younger brother:

                                  THEODORE
                      Ian. You don t enter a man s home 
                    and drop a deuce on his carpet. 
                          (to Will)
                    Will Armstrong   character 
                      department, right? You play Rocky, 
                    Slinks, and Professor Prune. Can I 
                    buy you a beer? 

                                  WILL
                    I m underage.

                                  THEODORE
                    Who s gonna tell?

      Will eyes Theodore with suspicion. Then he gives a slight nod.

      EXT. DAZZLE - DAY

      Our first real glimpse of Dazzle, and it s a sight to behold: 
      clean and tidy, with uniform houses boasting perfectly fresh-
      mowed lawns, the streets litter-free and immaculate. 

      One such Dazzle lawn is being examined by HARPER S MOTHER 
      (40s, slightly out of her element) and MRS. COVINGTON (45, 
      total Stepford wife, everything in place). Ms. Covington holds 
      a clipboard while Harper s Mom anxiously listens:

                                  MRS. COVINGTON
                    Lawns must be mowed each week to 
                    avoid a fine, with of course the  
                    exception of December, when we import 
                    the snow....

      We MOVE UP TO HARPER S HOUSE, where Lucy and Harper are on the 
      second floor, watching Harper s Mom and Mrs. Covington talk. 
      Harper nurses a Gatorade after last night s hangover.                                                                                    27.


                                  LUCY
                    She s saying these words out loud and 
                    yet it s not a Funny or Die video.

                                  HARPER
                          (holding her head)
                    Shhh... We need to create a hangover-
                    friendly space...

                                  MRS. COVINGTON (ON THE LAWN BELOW)
                    ... Of course you ll need to provide 
                    a minimum of three reindeer...

      Harper starts unpacking boxes, less enthused to laugh at this.

                                  LUCY
                    I wonder if she s read 1984. Dude, do 
                    you think the Dazzle neighborhood 
                    committee is secretly Big Brother? I 
                    can t believe you actually live here.

                                  HARPER
                    It s a bit much, but I see where 
                    they re coming from.

                                  LUCY
                    ... Are you really defending the 
                    reindeer Gestapo down there?

                                  HARPER
                    Having a nice lawn isn t exactly 
                    puppy genocide. There s nothing wrong 
                    with wanting to fit in.

                                  LUCY
                    ... So  fitting in  means getting 
                    bombed and throwing yourself at Ian 
                    Chandler when you have a boyfriend?

                                  HARPER
                    Like my boyfriend would ve been more 
                    upset about me being there with Ian 
                    than he would about you being there 
                    with him. 

      This hits close to home. Lucy tries to play it off:

                                  LUCY
                    ... Will s like my brother.

                                  HARPER
                    You think he sees it that way?

      Lucy is silent.                                                                                    28.


                                  HARPER (CONT D)
                    Even before I moved, you guys have 
                    always had more in common. You have 
                    those in-jokes. You both work in the 
                    character department. You re both 
                    raised by single parents. Both...

                                  LUCY
                    ... Economically challenged?
                          ( Lucy, you dick )
                    Sorry, I   I m not saying the right 
                    thing today at all...

      Before Harper can respond, Lucy leaves.

      EXT. PARK TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY

      Gloria approaches the tunnels when her phone RINGS.

                                  GLORIA
                    Hello....

      Whoever Gloria is talking to throws her for a curve.

                                  GLORIA (CONT D)
                    ... How d you get this number?... No, 
                    I can t see you now. I have a show...

      But she s not hanging up   in fact, she s getting emotional. 
      We don t know who s talking to her   at least, not yet... 

      INT. BACKSTAGE TUNNELS - DAY

      Lucy walks down the tunnels finishing up a greeter shift, 
      practicing her Red Cross interview under her breath as she 
      looks over some notes.

                                  LUCY
                     There s ways to help beyond giving 
                    money or blood. I mean, obviously I 
                    have so much money and even more 
                    blood...  Yeah, that ll slay  em...

      She passes some PERFORMERS who laugh. She doesn t stop moving.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                          (to the performers)
                    Just talking to myself like a crazy 
                    person, carry on.
                          (practicing again)
                     Last year you helped 155 million 
                    people in 70 countries                                                                                       29.


      But Lucy trails off when she sees Patrick bounding around a 
      corner, nervous as hell.

                                    PATRICK
                    We got a problem. Your mom s on in 
                    ten and nobody can find her. Phone s 
                    off. What the hell s going on?

      But before Lucy can answer, Theodore rounds another corner 
      holding a chart. Lucy lingers behind, torn about what to do...

                                  THEODORE
                    Gloria Villar s scheduled to perform 
                    as Princess Sophia, yes?

                                    PATRICK
                      Something s gotta be up. She s never 
                    missed a show in fifteen years.

                                  THEODORE
                    Fifteen years is a long time for a 
                    grown woman to play a teen princess. 

                                    PATRICK
                      Wonderland is Gloria s life. 

      Lucy looks at her notes. Then at her watch. Clock s ticking...

                                  THEODORE
                      I appreciate your loyalty, but if 
                    I ve been observing for two days and 
                    she s missed one of them, we might 
                    need to reconsider our personnel  

                                  LUCY
                      My mom s not coming.

      All eyes turn to Lucy. With a straight face she says:

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    She s sick. She asked me to fill in. 
                    I just finished my last greeter shift 
                    or I would ve been here earlier.

      Will and Patrick exchange a look: obviously Lucy s story is 
      bullshit, but she smiles in the face of Theodore s gaze.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    ... Maybe I should get into costume?


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    30.


                                      ACT THREE

      INT. BACKSTAGE TUNNELS - DAY

      Lucy quickly walks towards the dressing room, next to Will (in 
      half Rocky costume) who s gotten wind of her stunt:

                                  WILL
                    You have that interview in an hour  

                                  LUCY
                      Maybe I can still make it. My mom 
                    can t lose this job. 
                          (quick pause)
                    And you need to go easy on Harper. 
                    She s doing her best.

      He takes her arm. For a second, they both stop:

                                  WILL
                    Maybe   Maybe Harper s not who I m 
                    supposed to be with...

      A charged moment between them. Lucy s torn.

                                  LUCY
                    ... Yes, she is. Fix it.

      Lucy enters a dressing room, beginning a short SEQUENCE.

        IN A DRESSING ROOM, Lucy struggles to fit into Gloria s 
      Princess costume with the help of some other GREETERS and 
      PERFORMERS. It doesn t fit quite right; adjustments are made. 

        IN THE TUNNELS, Lucy races down the halls with towards the 
      exit to outside her own GREETER. 

        AT THE STAIRCASE, Lucy practices the choreography. She fucks 
      it up. She grimaces, when Patrick approaches:

                                    PATRICK
                    You know the part?

                                  LUCY
                    Seen my mom do it a million times.

                                    PATRICK
                    That better be enough. You re on.

      She heads to the area OUTSIDE BEHIND THE FENCE, ready to meet 
      her  Prince Valor ... And holy shit, it s Ian.

                                  IAN
                    Even you re a princess deep down.                                                                                    31.


      Lucy fights to fend off a panic attack as she speaks rapidly:

                                  LUCY
                    I m not a performer and I ve never 
                    done this and your brother can t fire 
                    you but he can sure as hell can fire 
                    me and my mom. God, last time you 
                    performed you were high and fainted. 
                    You probably don t even know the 
                      choreography  

                                  IAN
                          (no bullshit, reassuring)
                      I know it all. And I got you.

      From outside the fence, FAIRY TALE plays as a NARRATOR speaks:

                                  NARRATOR (O.S.)
                    Once upon a time there lived a 
                    beautiful girl named Sophia  

      The fence doors swing open and Lucy walks out into:

      WONDERLAND THEME PARK. She s been here a million times, but 
      she s never had so many eyes on her. Young, hopeful eyes, 
      waiting to be whisked away to someplace magical.

                                  NARRATOR (CONT D)
                      In the kingdom of Prince Valor. 
                     Edward,  to his friends. 

      Now Ian walks out onto the street, perfectly in character. He 
      and Lucy are on different sides of the  stage. 

                                  NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    Prince Valor lived in a magnificent 
                    castle. Sophia scrubbed the floors of 
                    her wicked step-mother s inn. Prince 
                    Valor and Sophia had never met...

      Lucy begins to  scrub the ground  while Ian gazes out.

                                  NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    ... But sometimes, late at night, 
                    they dreamt of each other.

      Ian sings his part of a romantic duet. And he s perfect.

                                  IAN
                    When will I find you / I know you re 
                    out there / When will I find you / 
                    You re waiting for me somewhere.                                                                                    32.


      Now it s Lucy s turn. She steps forward, tripping on her dress 
        but Ian catches her. For a moment they lock eyes. He smiles 
      at her:  You got this.  And she does:

                                  LUCY
                    When will I find you / Come take me 
                    away / When will I find you / Oh my 
                    prince, please say today.

      She s recovered. They smile and keep SINGING.

      INT. BACKSTAGE TUNNELS - DAY

      Still in costume, Lucy tears down the tunnels towards the 
      exit. Also in costume, Ian follows her.

                                  IAN
                    Where are you going?

                                  LUCY
                    I m ten minutes late, but maybe 
                    they ll still be there  

                                  IAN
                      Are you running over in costume?

                                  LUCY
                    You have a better idea?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      I/E. IAN S PORSCHE - DAY

      Still in his prince costume, Ian s car tears down the streets 
      of Dazzle. In the back seat, Lucy changes from her princess 
      outfit into her civvies.

                                  LUCY
                    Don t peek!

      Ian smiles to himself. He peeks.

      EXT. RED CROSS OFFICE - DAY

      Ian pulls up. Lucy rushes out, covered in sweat. She finds 
      Denise   the woman who interviewed her   walking to her car.

                                  LUCY
                    Denise! I m here! I can meet your 
                      supervisor...

                                  DENISE
                    You re half an hour late.                                                                                     33.


                                  LUCY
                    I know, It s complicated but   but 
                    I m here now...

                                  DENISE
                    She s gone. We filled the spot. 

      Denise looks at Ian in his Porsche. Nods to herself. Getting 
      back in her car, she says one last thing to crestfallen Lucy:

                                  DENISE (CONT D)
                    But your boyfriend s very good-
                    looking. Nice car.

      Denise drives off. Lucy watches her go, fighting back tears. 

                                  LUCY
                    ... We need go back. Not supposed to 
                    take costumes out of the park. 

      EXT. BEHIND THE FENCE - SUNSET

      Lucy is alone in the fenced area behind the park just as the 
      sun is setting. Ian enters from the tunnels and joins her.

                                  LUCY
                    My mom has never flaked like this. 
                    I'm a little worried she fell out of 
                    a roller coaster or something.

                                  IAN
                    Nah. My dad says the safety 
                      regulations are up to snuff.

                                  LUCY
                    ... Thanks for the ride. That was 
                    solid of you.

                                  IAN
                    I m not sure what to do with you 
                    being nice to me. It feels so wrong.

      She laughs sadly, then looks out at the setting sun.

                                  LUCY
                    I ll never get out of here.

                                  IAN
                    ... Maybe there s a part of you that 
                    didn t want to leave. Maybe, despite 
                    what you say, you kinda like it here. 
                    Your friends are here. Your family is 
                    here. Wonderland is home.                                                                                    34.


                                  LUCY
                    I just wanna play my whole life safe? 

      Ian takes a step closer to her.

                                  IAN
                    I didn't say  safe ... But maybe you 
                    kinda wanted it to happen that way. 

                                  LUCY
                    Yeah, I wanted my mom to flake out  

                                  IAN
                    Nothing here makes you want to stay?

      Now he s right up in her face. She almost whispers:

                                  LUCY
                    No... Nothing.

      And finally they re kissing. Imagine the best first kiss 
      you ve ever had, and you re still nowhere near this. But then:

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                    Lucy!

      Lucy and Ian break away from the embrace. Gloria stands in the 
      tunnel doorway, sweaty, out of breath, and horrified.

                                  GLORIA (CONT D)
                    You can t  

                                  LUCY
                      I m not talking to you.

      Both livid at her mother and embarrassed by the interruption, 
      Lucy runs away, leaving Gloria alone with a confused Ian.

      EXT. WONDERLAND THEME PARK - NIGHT

      Ian and Theodore walk through the park towards TWINKLE S NEST. 

                                  THEODORE
                    For a sick lady, Gloria Villar seemed 
                    quite intent on rushing to the show.

                                  IAN
                    Maybe she just really, really wanted 
                    to see me play Prince Valor. Lucy and 
                    I killed it, huh?

                                  THEODORE
                    You two were very convincing.                                                                                    35.


                                  IAN
                    ... I think I might do well here. 
                    Maybe it won t be like New York.

                                  THEODORE
                    I m pleased you re taking something 
                      seriously. But... Having you publicly 
                    work minimum wage   you know this is 
                    just Dad s PR stunt, right?

                                  IAN
                          (trying to play it off)
                    ... Oh... I know...

                                  THEODORE
                    So... By all means, have your fun 
                    with your lady co-stars   onstage or 
                    off. But let s not pretend you re 
                    going to bring these people home... 
                    Not in the daytime, anyway. 

      Ian is torn: he doesn t agree, but it s his big brother...

                                  THEODORE (CONT D)
                    C mon. Car s waiting.

      As Theodore leads his conflicted brother away, in the dark 
      they don t notice Harper packing up her equipment. She s heard 
      everything. She looks she s just been punched in the gut... 

      She takes out of her phone and sends a text that we don t see. 
      But then she looks up to see Will approaching.

                                  WILL
                    Hey...

      Harper turns to see Will approaching.  There s an uncertain 
      coolness between them. Neither knows what to say...

      EXT. LUCY S APARTMENT ROOF - NIGHT

      From her rooftop, Lucy looks out onto Dazzle, only miles   but 
      many worlds   away. Then DING: She gets the text from Harper:

                                  HARPER S TEXT
                    <3

      Lucy is confused, but touched. She texts  <3  back, as a 
      nervous Gloria opens the door to the roof. Palpable silence.

                                  GLORIA
                    ... The Red Cross?

      Lucy shakes her head. That s not happening.                                                                                     36.


                                  LUCY
                    ... No curing of malaria, typhoid, or 
                    any of the actual things I could ve 
                    worked on.

      Gloria s heart breaks, the world on her shoulders...

                                  GLORIA
                      I didn t... I didn t know you d sub 
                    in for me. I d never have  

                                  LUCY
                      What the hell, Mom? Where were you? 

                                  GLORIA
                    Luce... Look... With Ian... I didn t 
                    want you to kiss him because  

                                  LUCY
                      Let s just focus on one of your 
                    epic screwups at a time, okay?

      Gloria collects herself. This is excruciating for her:

                                  GLORIA
                    ... They re connected because   God, 
                    this got so messed up   I was late 
                    because I got a phone call...

      Gloria s been dreading this conversation for years. She nearly 
      chokes on the words:

                                  GLORIA (CONT D)
                    ... I got a phone call... I got a 
                    phone call from James Chandler...

                                  LUCY
                    Ian s dad?

                                  GLORIA
                    ... Ian s dad... And... Your dad.

      Lucy stares at Gloria, dumbfounded...
