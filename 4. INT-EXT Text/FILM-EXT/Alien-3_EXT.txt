Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.
John holds her in
front of him.
Unconscious.
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves.
The monks start to row back to short.
FIRST MONK
(reverent)
A space ship...
SECOND MONK
(even more reverent)
A woman...
KYLE
You shouldn't have gone in --
JOHN
I'm supposed to be a doctor.
He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.
JOHN
She could've been lost.
FIRST MONK
Been a long time since I saw either.
SECOND MONK
It isn't sinking.
Look at it.
What are we
supposed to do with it?
KYLE
What was it like in there --?
JOHN
Lights.
So many lights --
THIRD MONK
Tow it in.
Bring it in.
SECOND MONK
It's evil.
FIRST MONK
It's just technology.
SECOND MONK
Evil technology.
Look at these fish --
THIRD MONK
The Abbot will know what we should do
with it --
KYLE
Just lights?
JOHN
Machines.
Buttons.
Metal.
SECOND MONK
See?
Just look at the fish.
THIRD MONK
The Abbot will know.
SECOND MONK
They're boiled.
These fish are boiled.
JOHN
Thousands of lights.
Like the stars.
Like Heaven on Earth.
Ripley stirs in John's arms.
Groans.
Fights to come out of her fugue state...
Looks around through half-lidded eyes --
She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.
MONKS?
She closes her eyes.
Tries to clear the imagine.
Opens:
They're still there.
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --
realizes she's sitting on someone's lap.
Looks back over her shoulder --
JOHN
He smiles at her.
Friendly, not sexual.
RIPLEY
Shakes her head.
Tries to speak --
Her lips form soundless words.
She looks over her other shoulder, sees --
THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV
Bobbing on the surface.
Growing small with each stroke of the oars.
RIPLEY
Brows knit.
Fights the cobwebs in her brain.
Tries to focus on the ship --
Remembers.
Turns to John, tries to speak --
RIPLEY
Wait.
New...
She loses consciousness.
GO TO BLACK...
The waters grown rough with the approach of night.
Wind whips across
white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their
boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --
Start to tow it to shore...
A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.
The monks wear small round
goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a
huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --
Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT.
Timbers GROAN.
They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --
Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre.
Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out
across the rafters...
We pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into
Ripley's good foot KICKS down the burning planks that surround
the escape ship.
John and Mattias stand behind as she climbs
through to the ship.
John looks around:
The ABBEY LEVEL is devastated.
The air is filled with smoke.
The Abbey is burning.
The Library is in flames.
John looks down at his medical bag.
Torn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders.
Inside: The only remaining book.
RIPLEY O/S
Come on in!
John and Mattias step through --
