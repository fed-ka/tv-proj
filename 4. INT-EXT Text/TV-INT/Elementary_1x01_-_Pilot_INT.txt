  A beautiful REDHEADED WOMAN (30s) struggles near the sink 
  against an ATTACKER whose face we cannot see.  He s grabbed her 
  from behind, one GLOVED HAND clamped down over her mouth -- but 
  despite his size advantage, she WRITHES against him, lifting her 
  feet off the ground and PLANTING them against the counter.  She 
  PUSHES BACKWARDS and the attacker STUMBLES, SLIPPING in the 
  water and broken glass on the floor.  As he lands on his back 
  with a THUD, he loses his grip on her and she BREAKS FREE -- but 
  not before she GASHES HER WRIST on a piece of glass. 


  The terrified woman, the wound on her wrist OOZING BLOOD, rounds 
  a corner in this UPSCALE HOME.  We SEE expensive ART on the 
  walls, FRESH CUT FLOWERS in VASES.  And as she clambers UP THE 
  STAIRS and OUT OF FRAME, and we SEE the SHADOW of her attacker 
  against the wall, his HAND landing on the rail...


  The redheaded woman BURSTS through the door -- but no sooner has 
  she crossed the threshold of the room than a GLOVED HAND catches 
  her by the ankle and she goes down in a HEAP.  She KICKS at her 
  attacker, catching him under the jaw and loosening his grip 
  again, then SCRAMBLES on hands and knees towards... 

  ...the NIGHTSTANDbeside her bed.  It couldn t be more mundane a 
  piece of furniture, but the woman REACHES for it like it s her 
  salvation.  We wonder: Is there a weapon inside?But just as 
  she GRABS FOR it... her attacker PULLS HARD on one of her ankles 
  and her knees go out from under her.  And ON her outstretched 
  hand, still STRAINING to reach the nightstand, we PRELAPa 
  terrible BUZZING SOUND, and we...

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:

  CLOSE ON A DIGITAL ALARM CLOCK

  ...as it BLARES, its display telling us it s 7:00 AM.  A woman s 
  hand comes INTO FRAME and SWATS it off.  REVEAL we re --                                                                                                2



  JOAN WATSON, 29, rolls back onto her stomach in her bed, not 
  quite ready to wake yet.  But then a SECOND ALARM CLOCK begins 
  to blare on the other side of the room.  Joan, sleepy-eyed, 
  finally SITS UP.  And as she moves to turn off what we realize 
  is her  backup  alarm, we PRELAPthe opening strains of The 
  Naked and Famous   Punching in a Dream,  and we...

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:


  -- and once again, she PULLS UP SHORT. 

  REVERSE ANGLE: The Batcave. Q slaboratory.  The house from the 
  original  Texas ChainsawMassacre.   The brownstone is somehow 
  all of these places and none of them; as complicated and 
  colorful as the man who calls it home.  Joan takes in a living 
  room that is more crime lab than living space.  One wall is 
  adorned with thousands of different padlocks hanging from narrow 
  bars.  Another is papered with a  decoupage  of MUG SHOTS and 
  WANTED POSTERS.  Joan s eyes drift to a closet door that has 
  been dotted with what appear to be BULLET HOLES.  And as she 
  HEARS a CACOPHONY OF VOICES coming from upstairs...


  Joan stops at the threshold of a vast  media room,  very 
  obviously the source of the LOUD and OVERLAPPING VOICES.  

  REVERSE ANGLE finds a SHIRTLESS MAN (his back to Joan) sitting 
  in front of a BANK of flat-screen TVsand watching nine 
  different programs at the same time.  

  RESUME JOAN as she clears her throat, speaks loudly to be heard 
  over the DIN of the televisions:

                                  JOAN
                    Mr. Holmes -- ?

  But the shirtless man just SHUSHES her.  A long and strange 
  moment as Joan just stands there... and then he suddenly PAUSES 
  all nine monitors and TURNS to face her, deadly serious:

                                  SHIRTLESS MAN
                    Pick one.

                                  JOAN
                    I m sorry -- ?

                                  SHIRTLESS MAN
                    A monitor.  Quickly.  

  A beat, and then a wary Joan indicates a monitor that appears to 
  have been paused in the middle of an INFOMERCIAL.                                                                                                  6

  The man closes his eyes... and when he OPENS them again, it s 
  like he s a completely different person; Billy Mays by way of 
  P.T.Barnum. 

                                  SHIRTLESS MAN (CONT D)
                    Do you like cured meats?  Do you 
                    hate preservatives and outrageous 
                    deli prices?  Well now, with the 
                      KenCoCure-All, you can cure your 
                    own meats in the comfort of your 
                    own kitchen!  Brine and dine!  So 
                    easy, even a child could do it!   

  He turns back to the bank of monitors and uses a REMOTE to 
   unfreeze  the one that Joan chose.  REWINDS and hits  play,  
  and we HEAR a NARRATOR S VOICE over IMAGES of the  Cure-All.  

                                  NARRATOR
                    Do you like cured meats?  Do you 
                    hate preservatives and outrageous

                    easy, even a kid could do it!  

                                  SHIRTLESS MAN
                    Damn.  Kid, not child. 

  And as he FREEZES the monitor again and begins to PACE, clearly 
  angry with himself, and we realize that, prior to Joan s 
  arrival, he was memorizing every program on every monitor...

                                  JOAN
                    Mr. Holmes, my name is Joan Watson 
                    and I ve been hired by your brother 
                    to be your Personal Recovery 
                    Assistant, or sober companion. 
                          (then; getting NOTHING)
                    He told me he was going to e-mail 
                    you about me...?

  But the man SAYS NOTHING, just continues to pace.  Joan, uneasy 
  but trying to hide it, tries again:

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    My job, Mr. Holmes, is to make the 
                    transition from your rehab 
                    experience to the  routine  of your 
                    daily life as smooth as possible.  
                    I ll be living here for the next 
                    six weeks, which means I ll be 
                    available to you 24/7.  I ll go 
                    where you go.  Your schedule will

                    And as I meet the people in your 
                    life, I ll try to help you separate 
                    the good apples from the bad --

                                  SHIRTLESS MAN
                          (suddenly)
                    Do you believe in love at first 
                    sight? 

  Joan just STARES at him.  Excuse me?

                                  SHIRTLESS MAN (CONT D)
                    I know what you re thinking.  The 
                    world is a cynical place and I must 
                    be a cynical man, thinking a woman 
                    like you would fall for a line like 
                    that.  Thing is... it isn t a line.  
                          (then; inching closer)
                    Oscar Wildeonce said that men as a 
                    rule love with their eyes; women, 
                    with their ears.  So please... hear
                    me when I say this: I have never 
                    loved anyone as I do you, right 
                    now, in this moment. 

  Joan, DUMBSTRUCK, drops her purse, and some of its contents -- 
  including a distinctive orange PARKING TICKET-- spill onto the 
  floor.  The man just STARES into her eyes.  Looks for a moment 
  like he might kiss her... but at the last second, he SPINS back 
  to his bank of monitors and plays the last thirty seconds of a 
  SOAP OPERA that was recorded on one of the TVs. And as an ACTOR 
  delivers the same  love at first sight  speech that he just 
  delivered to Joan, and we REALIZE that he was merely testing his 
  memory again... he suddenly CLAPS HIS HANDS:

                                  SHIRTLESS MAN (CONT D)
                    Spot on. 
                          (then; TURNING to Joan; 
                            offering his hand)
                    Sherlock Holmes.  Please don t get 
                    comfortable; we won t be here long.

  He EXITS, and Joan follows him into --


  The only  furniture  in this room is a WHEELED LADDER to reach 
  high shelves and a large MATTRESS on the floor.  And as Sherlock 
  searches through a laundry basket for a clean shirt...

                                  JOAN
                    Mr. Holmes... did your brother tell 
                    you about me or not?                                                                                                8

                    He e-mailed, said to expect some 
                    sort of  addict-sitter ...

                                  JOAN
                    Then he explained his conditions 
                    with respect to your sobriety...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    If you mean his threat to evict me 
                    from this, the shoddiest and least 
                    valuable of the five, count them, 
                      fiveproperties he owns in 
                    Manhattan, then yes, he made his 
                     conditions  quite clear.  I use, I 
                    wind up on the street.  I refuse 
                    your quote-unquote help, I wind up 
                    on the street.  
                          (then; out of nowhere)
                    It was my understanding most sober 
                    companions are recovering addicts 
                      themselves, but you venever had a 
                    problem with drugs or alcohol.  

  Joan s caught off guard by this, but quickly realizes --

                                  JOAN
                    Your brother told you.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Of course he didn t.

                                  JOAN
                          (right...)
                    Care to explain why you broke out 
                    of your rehab facility the same day 
                    you were being released? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Bored.

                                  JOAN
                    You were bored?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    No, I ambored. Right now.  Happens 
                    often; you ll get used to it.  
                          (then)
                    Regarding our mutual friends at 
                    Hemdale-- I d say they should be 
                    thanking me for exposing the flaws 
                    in their rubbish security system, 
                    wouldn t you? 
                          (then; as he finally finds 
                            a SHIRT)
                    Excellent.                                                                                                 9

                                  JOAN
                    There was a woman leaving just as I 
                    got here.  Who was she?

                                  SHERLOCK
                      Acquaintance.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    About six feet.   

  Joan follows his gaze to the nearby LADDER.  And as she notices 
  two sets of HANDCUFFS dangling from a particular rung, and she 
  REALIZES he s referring to a sex act, not a drug binge...

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Full disclosure?  I actually find 
                    sex repellent -- all those fluids 
                    and odd sounds -- but my body and 
                    brain require it to function at 
                    optimal levels.  And so I...  feed  
                    them as needed.    
                          (then)
                    You re a doctor, you understand.

  ON JOAN -- finally, utterly TAKEN ABACK.  

                                  JOAN
                    I m not a doctor --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    But you were.  Surgeon, judging by 
                    your hands.

  Joan, confused, looks to her hands, but Sherlock continues:

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Is your car parked nearby?

                    can you?
                          (then; before she can 
                            respond)
                    We need to get going.  We re late.

  And when he MOVES PAST HER and OUT THE DOOR --                                                                                                10

  He OPENS the door for her to exit, but she CLOSES it.

                      experience.  Your rehab experience.  
                    What you got out of it.  What you

                                  SHERLOCK
                    But that could take minutes! 

  Sounds like a joke, but it isn t.  And as he checks his watch:                                                                                                11

                    Fine.  I ll talk.  You ll drive.

                                                                            CUT TO:


  Joan drives; Sherlock fiddles with her RADIO PRESETS from the 
  passenger seat.  And as he lands on a station in the middle of 
  England Dan & John Ford Coley s I d Really Love to See You 
  Tonight  --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Seriously?

                                  JOAN
                          (turning the radio OFF)
                    Your brother told me about Scotland 
                    Yard.  You were a detective.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I was a consultant.  I wasn t paid 
                    for my services and therefore 
                    answered to no one but myself.

                                  JOAN
                          (not surprised)
                    He also mentioned you had issues 
                    with authority. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    My  issues  are with bureaucracy, 
                    Ms. Watson, not authority.  The 
                    former is the enemyof a good 
                      investigator, a giant mechanism 
                    operated by pygmies, and is to be 
                    avoided at all costs.  Police 
                    departments, despite their best 
                      intentions, are bureaucracies to 
                    the power of ten. 
                          (then)
                    Turn left here. 

  As Joan complies, her cell phone begins to RING.  We SEE an 
  image of her smiling PARENTS on the display, accompanied by the 
  identifier,  MOM & DAD.                                                                                                   12

  ON SHERLOCK noting the image.  And as Joan hits  ignore  --

                                  JOAN
                    What about London?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    What about it?

                                  JOAN
                    He told me that s where you 
                    bottomed out.  He thinks something 
                    terrible happened to you there, he 
                    just doesn t know what.
                          (then; when he LOOKS AWAY)
                      Hemdalesent me your records last 
                    night.  I know you didn t talk to 
                    them about it either, but --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Handsome woman, your mother.  Very 
                    big of her to take your father back 
                    after the affair. 

  That just HANGS THERE a moment.  Joan s eyes stay GLUED to the 
  road.  We aren t sure if he s right about her parents until:

                                  JOAN
                    How could you possibly--

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Next right, please.  

                                  JOAN
                    You know you still haven t told me 
                    where we re going.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    About that.  I think you and big 
                    brother will be pleased to hear 
                    I ve devised a post-rehab regimen 
                    for myself that will keep me quite 
                    busy.  Pull over here. 

  Joan brings the car to a halt.  And she SEES they ve stopped in 
  front of a home that is BEDECKED in YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE and 
  SWARMING with POLICE PERSONNEL... Sherlock turns to her.

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    I ve decided to resume my work as a 
                    consultant here in New York. 

  And ON JOAN, as he EXITS from the car, we...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                        ACT ONE

  FADE IN:


  And no sooner have Gregson, Holmes, and Watson STEPPED INSIDE 
  than we REALIZE: We ve seen this home before.  It s the same 
  upscale residence the Redheaded Woman was in when we saw her 
  fighting for her life in the Teaser.  Same expensive art on the 
  walls, same fresh cut flowers in vases.                                                                                                 15
  CONTINUED:

                                  GREGSON
                    Dr. Nicholas Mantlo arrived home a 
                    few hours ago to find his door 
                    kicked in and his wife missing.  
                    That s him over there. 

  And as Sherlock and Joan follow his gaze to a MAN (early 40s, 
    bespectacled, distraught) being interviewed (MOS) by a 
    PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE in the LIVING ROOM...   

                                  GREGSON (CONT D)
                    He s a headshrinker out of 
                    Bellevue.  Caught an emergency last 
                    night, didn t get back until 5 AM.  
                    Saw the front door and called 911.  
                    First responders found signs of a 
                    struggle in the kitchen and master 
                    bedroom, but no Ms. Dampier.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Ransom demand?

  Gregson shakes his head,  no.   Holmes MULLS that a beat, then 
  turns his attention to the splintered FRONT DOOR and the BOOT 
  PRINT near its handle.  He pulls out his CELL PHONE and snaps a 
  picture.  Then, when he notices a troubled Joan FIXATING on a 
  SPOT OF BLOOD on the floor near the stairs -- 

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Odd, a former surgeon thrown by a 
                    little blood. 

                                  JOAN
                    It s arterial.  You can tell from 
                    the color.  Wherever the kidnapper 
                    took her, you better hope he 
                    dressed the wound. 

  ON SHERLOCK -- as surprised by the observation as he is 
  impressed.  He looks to Gregson, who NODS -- 

                                  GREGSON
                    CSUsaid the same thing.

  Sherlock MULLS that a moment, then RETURNS to the opened front 
  door and takes in the STAIRS and WALKWAY just beyond it.   

                                  GREGSON (CONT D)
                    What is it?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Not sure.  Maybe nothing. 

  As he steps back into the foyer, his eye catches on a WALL 
  adorned with PHOTOS in SQUARE and OVULAR silver frames.                                                                                                  16
  CONTINUED: (2)

  And as we SEE that several of the pictures feature the Redheaded 
  Woman, and we REALIZE she could only be the missing Lisa 
  Dampier, Sherlock observes a small  arc  of discoloration on the 
  wall above a SQUARE FRAME.  He REMOVES it to find it (mostly) 
  covers a  ghost mark  where an ovularframe once hung.  He lifts 
  the remaining SQUARE FRAMES from the wall to discover that they 
  too cover ovular marks.  And as he finally turns to Gregson:

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Ms. Dampier scell phone.  Did you 
                    recover it? 

  Gregson looks to a DETECTIVE, who passes a PHONE in an EVIDENCE 
  BAGGIEto Sherlock.  Sherlock removes the phone and begins to 
  flip through its PHOTO ALBUM.  And after a moment:

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    She either lost a tremendous amount 
                    of weight or underwent significant 
                    plastic surgery sometime in the 
                    last two years. 

  Joan, confused, indicates the picshe s still SCROLLING THROUGH:

                                  JOAN
                    She looks exactly the same in all
                    of these.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    My point.  

  When she still doesn t get it, he indicates the array of frames:

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Ovular frames have been here 
                    longer; you can tell by the way the 
                    paint on the wall has faded around 
                    them.  Square frames are newer and
                    are the only ones that feature Ms. 
                      Dampier.Coincidence?  No.  Check 
                    her cell phone.  No photos of her 
                    older than two years -- even though 
                    there are countless pictures of 
                    othersin her life from as many as 
                    five years ago. 
                          (RETURNING the phone)
                    Obviously, she wanted the images 
                    around her to jibe with her new 
                    look, not her old one. 

                                  JOAN
                    How is that relevant?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    How is it not?                                                                                                 17

  And ON JOAN as he continues OUT OF FRAME...


  It s MOMENTS LATER and Joan is WATCHING as Holmes gets down on 
  his hands and knees to sniff at the carpet, attracting more than 
  a few stares.  And as Gregson sidles up to her...

                                  GREGSON
                    So.  Wanna tell me how a  personal 
                    valet  knows from arterial blood? 

  Joan hesitates.  Isn t sure how to answer without exposing her 
  real relationship with Holmes.  But after a beat --

                                  GREGSON (CONT D)
                    It s okay.  Holmes and secrets have 
                    always been a package deal.  I just 
                    care about results.     

                                  JOAN
                    You ve worked with him before? 

                                  GREGSON
                    After 9/11, I was assigned to 
                    Scotland Yard to observe their 
                      counterterrorism bureau.  Holmes 
                    mostly worked homicides, but our 
                    paths still crossed a few times. 

                                  JOAN
                          (beat)
                    Is he as good as he thinks he is?

                                  GREGSON
                    My first week in London, C.T.unit 
                    catches a guy who s been setting 
                    car bombs off all over the city.  
                    We know he s got another bomb out 
                    there, but he won t tell us where. 
                          (then)
                    Holmes is in the same room with the 
                    guy for maybe five minutes.  
                    Figures out where the bomb is off a 
                    couple stains on one of his shoes. 

  As Joan processes that, he nods in Sherlock s direction...

                                  GREGSON (CONT D)
                    Few days ago, he calls me from 
                      HeathrowAirport.  Tells me he s 
                    relocating to New York and, I 
                    quote,  willing to provide his 
                    services to the NYPD. 
                          (smiles at that; then)
                    I figure, why the hell not?                                                                                                18

                    I m sorry.  Did you say he called 
                    you from Heathrow?

  But suddenly, we HEAR --

                                  SHERLOCK (O.C.)
                    Captain, if you please. 

  And Gregson and Joan cross the floor to join Sherlock in --


  Holmes, standing beside a detective we ll come to know as 
  OLSHANSKY, indicates a mess of BROKEN GLASS and SPILLED WATER on 
  the floor.  It s mostly SHARDS, but we can make out the thick, 
  circular  base  of what used to be one drinking glass. 

                                  SHERLOCK 
                          (re: Olshansky)
                    Your man here was just sharing his 
                    theory that the victim was pouring 
                    herself a glass of water when the 
                    intruder kicked the door in.  She 
                    startled and dropped the glass to 
                    the floor; it was crushed under his 
                    feet and hers as they struggled. 
                          (beat)
                    That theory is wrong.

                                  OLSHANSKY
                          (wasn t expecting this)
                    Excuse me?

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (ignoring him; to Gregson)
                    Ms. Dampierknew her attacker; she 
                    let him into the house herself. 

                        OLSHANSKYSHERLOCK
      Captain, who is this guy -- ? (speaking over him)
                                                    There are twobroken glasses 
                                                    here, not one.  You can tell 
                                                    by the volume of shards.  
                                                    Obviously, she was pouring a 
                                                    glass of water for her guest 
                                                    when he assailed her. 

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    Right.   Cause that s what you do 
                    when some nutjobkicks your door 
                    in.  You ask him if he s thirsty.                                                                                                19

  Sherlock just scans the floor with his eyes.  Finally kneels 
  down and searches beneath the stove until he recovers the thick, 
  circular base of a secondbroken glass.  And as he holds it up 
  for Olshansky s perusal, he turns back to Gregson:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Look more closely at the boot print 
                    on the front door; you ll find an 
                    almost imperceptible spot of blood 
                    where the heel made contact.  Lab 
                    tests, I m quite certain, will 
                    confirm it s the victim sblood and 
                    could only have been left there 
                    afterthe assault had already taken 
                    place.  Ms. Dampierlet the man in 
                    because he was familiar to her; he 
                    kicked the door in as he exited to 
                    try to obscure this fact.  Also: He 
                    took something from the living 
                    room. 

  He EXITS, and Gregson and Joan follow him into --


  Dr. Mantlo is mid-statement with a detective; Sherlock just 
  SPEAKS OVER HIM to Gregson and Joan:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Note the symmetry of the space.  
                    This wall is very nearly a 
                     reflection  of that one.  
                    Painting, painting.  Knickknack, 
                      knickknack.  I see balance 
                      everywhere... except this one 
                    shelf.  
                          (suddenly; to Mantlo)
                    Something was here.  What was it?

                                  MANTLO
                    I m sorry -- ?

                                  JOAN
                          (to Sherlock)
                    Maybe now isn t the best --

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (ignoring her; to Mantlo)
                    Please.  Concentrate.  Something
                    used to occupy that shelf.  I need 
                    you to tell me what it was. 

  Every eye in the room is now GLUED to Sherlock, every cop asking 
  himself the same question: Who the fuckis this guy?Gregson 
  seems on the verge of pulling him away when --                                                                                                20
  CONTINUED:

                                  MANTLO
                    It was an old ring box.  Lisa s 
                      grandmother gave it to her.  Why?

  Sherlock doesn t answer, but Mantlo s answer clearly concerns 
  him.  And as he turns to Gregson, confirming --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You said there were also signs of a 
                    struggle in the master bedroom. 

  Gregson NODS, and Sherlock TURNS and takes the stairs up to -- 


  -- and as Joan, Gregson, and Olshansky follow...

                                  JOAN
                    What is it?  Why s it so important 
                    that the kidnapper took a ring box?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Kidnappers don t take trophies.  
                    Killersdo.   

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    There s no body, genius. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    No blood on the front stoop or 
                    walk, either.  Rather difficult not 
                    to leave any when you re abducting 
                    someone with an arterial wound, 
                    wouldn t you agree?
                          (then; to Gregson)
                    You re certain your men have been 
                    over every inchof this house. 

                                  GREGSON
                    Of course.  

  Sherlock spots what he s looking for, continues into --


  He studies it a moment, then CROSSES it a few times with his 
  arms outstretched, as though testing his own balance.  Joan, 
  Gregson, and Olshansky LOOK ON, perplexed.  Sherlock finally 
  STOPS; his expression DARKENS.  He s QUIET when he announces:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    She s in the safe room.

                                  JOAN
                    What safe room?                                                                                                21
  CONTINUED:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The one behind that wall. 

  But when Gregson and Joan follow his gaze, all they SEE is a 
  perfectly normal-lookingwall. 

                                  OLSHANSKY
                          (bullshit...)
                    Husband didn t say anything about 
                    any  safe room.  

  Sherlock pulls a MARBLE from a VASE resting on a bureau. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    There s a slight angle to the floor 
                    in here; I felt it as soon as I 
                    stepped inside.
                          (then; explaining)
                    The extra weight of a safe room s 
                    steel reinforcements can cause the 
                    floor around the room to decline 
                    slightly, creating a  slope  of 
                    anywhere between one and five 
                    degrees.  

  He sets the marble down on the hardwood floor and Joan and 
  Gregson watch in AMAZEMENT as it very slowly ROLLS in the 
  direction of the wall Sherlock indicated.  

  Sherlock feels around until he finds a  switch  on the wall 
  behind Lisa s nightstand-- the samenightstandwe saw her 
  scrambling to in the Teaser-- and as he FLIPS it... 

  ...A HIDDEN DOOR is REVEALED in the wall he just identified, 
  OPENING INWARD.  Unobstructed now, the marble RESUMES its 
  course, continuing INTO THE SAFE ROOM, and we...

  ...FOLLOW it at a LOW ANGLE... and as it finally comes to rest 
  against a WOMAN S BLOOD-SPATTERED HAND, we...

  ...RESUME HOLMES, FRAMED in the doorway, FLANKED by Joan and 
  Gregson...

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    I hate it when I m right.


                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                                22


                                        ACT TWO

  FADE IN:


  We re looking THROUGH the TWO-WAY GLASS and INTO the neighboring 
    INTERROGATION ROOM, where a REELING Nicholas Mantlo sits 
  opposite Gregson and Olshansky at a table. 

                                  MANTLO
                    For the last time: I loved my wife.  
                    I didn t hurt her.  And until this 
                    morning, I had no idea there was 
                    any  safe room  in my house. 

  And as we RACK FOCUS to find the REFLECTIONS of Sherlock and 
  Joan in the two-sided window, and we realize they re WATCHING 
  from the observation room...

                                  GREGSON
                    You get why that s difficult for us 
                    to believe, don t you? 

                                  MANTLO
                    The house was guttedbefore Lisa 
                    and I moved in two years ago.  She 
                    oversaw all of the construction, I 
                    just signed the checks.

  NEW ANGLE -- as Holmes, curiously, uses his phone to ZOOM IN on 
  one of Mantlo s hands and then snap a picture of it.

                                  OLSHANSKY
                          (to Mantlo)
                    I m sorry.  Are you saying she had 
                    it installed but never toldyou?   

  Mantlo hesitates.  Knows how this is going to sound --

                                  MANTLO
                    We had a few arguments about money 
                    back then.  She said she wanted 
                    one, but we were so over budget 
                    that I put my foot down.  
                    Obviously, she didn t listen.  

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    That a recurringthing with Lisa, 
                    Dr. Mantlo?  Her  not listening? 

  An emotional Mantlo just STARES.  Can t seem to believe he s 
  actually in this situation.  Holmes STUDIES him with laser-like 
  focus from the observation room.  And after a moment --                                                                                                23
  CONTINUED:

                                  GREGSON
                    You were paged to Bellevue Hospital 
                    last night at 6:47 PM, but you 
                    didn t arrive until 7:20.  Given 
                    you don t live more than 10 minutes 
                    from the hospital, I m curious: 
                    What slowed you down? 

  Mantlo REELS at the insinuation...

                                  MANTLO
                    I showered before I left... there 
                    was traffic...

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    M.E.puts the time of death 
                    somewhere between seven and eight, 
                    and you don t have an alibi until 
                    7:20.  So let me tell you what I 
                    think.  I think you and your wife 
                    had another  argument  last night.  
                    I think it happened in your 
                    kitchen.  You attacked her, but she 
                    broke free, ran upstairs to the 
                    safe room.  Thing is... you got 
                    inside before she could sealit. 
                          (then)
                    You choked her to death.  Thenyou 
                    went to Bellevue.  And then, when 
                    you got back this morning, you 
                    called 911 and said she d been 
                    kidnapped, so that the lastplace 
                    we d look for her would be inside 
                    her own home.   
                          (then)
                    Tell me when I m getting warm.

  ANOTHER ANGLE -- as Holmes catches Watson s REFLECTION in the 
  observation window. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You don t look well, Watson.  
                    Perhaps you should go home. 
                          (then; dryly)
                    I promiseI won t do any drugs.

                                  JOAN
                    I m fine.  

  Holmes  eyes drift back to the interrogation... but Joan s eyes 
  stay LOCKED on him.  And after a MOMENT, she can t help but ask:

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    How do you do it?                                                                                                 24
  CONTINUED: (2)

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Do what?

                                  JOAN
                     Guess  things.  About me, about 
                    the woman who was murdered...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I don t guess, I observe.  And once 
                    I ve observed, I deduce.  Simple, 
                    really.

                                  JOAN
                    Is it? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    For me. 

                                  JOAN
                          (beat; then)
                    How did you know within secondsof 
                    meeting me that I wasn t a 
                    recovering addict?

  Sherlock SIGHS.  Doesn t really want to do this in the middle of 
  Mantlo s interrogation, but as we ve seen -- he s more than 
  capable of following two conversations at once. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Your purse.

                                  JOAN
                    My purse?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    When you spilled it this morning, 
                    the absence of a sobriety chip was 
                    conspicuous.  No self-respecting 
                    former addict would leave home 
                    without one.

                                  JOAN
                          (beat)
                    You said you could tell from my 
                    hands that I used to be a surgeon.

                                  SHERLOCK
                     Hand,  singular, actually.  It was 
                    soft, no callouses.  You ve 
                    obviously gone to lengths over the 
                    years to maintain it.  Your grip is 
                    steady, firm, precise -- yet 
                    protective of the hand itself.  A 
                    surgeon s grip.  Also, it smelled 
                    faintly of beeswax.                                                                                                 25

  Joan just LOOKS at him.   Beeswax?   

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Many surgeons use a beeswax cream 
                    to protect their hands from the 
                      dehydrating effects of repeated 
                    washings.  You re no longer 
                      practicing, but old habits die 
                    hard.  Far as whyyou gave up your 
                    medical career to become a 
                    counselor or a  companion  or 
                    whatever it was you called it this 
                    morning, I d wager that addiction 
                    claimed someone close to you and 
                    his or her death moved you to make 
                    drastic changes in your life.
                          (then)
                    Am I close?

                                  JOAN
                    What about my dad?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    What about him?

                                  JOAN
                    How did you know he had an affair?

                                  SHERLOCK
                      Google.When my brother gave me 
                    your name, I did a search.  Only 
                    article I found was on your father, 
                    a novelist who d recently 
                    reconciled with his wife. 
                          (offher LOOK; a shrug and 
                            a smile)
                    What?  Not everythingis deducible.

  Just then, Gregson and Olshansky ENTER from the corridor.  We 
  sense Olshansky says the following under duress:

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    I, uh... just wanted to say thanks 
                    for helping out this morning.  You 
                    got us to our guy and we re 
                    grateful. 
                          (then; offering his hand)
                    We can take it from here. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                      Respectfully, Detective, I doubt 
                    that very much.  Because I have 
                    reason to believe Nicholas Mantlo 
                    didn tkill his wife.

  And as he EXITS, moving right past Olshansky s proffered hand --                                                                                                26



  Olshansky, Gregson, and Joan are right on his heels. 

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    Come again?

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (stopping)
                    Dr. Mantlo has girl s feet, or 
                    hadn t you noticed?  He s a size 8 
                    if he s an inch.  The boot print on 
                    his front door was an 11.

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    So he s smart.  Wore a bigger shoe 
                    to throw us off. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    And did he also wear bigger hands 
                    when he strangled his wife? 

                                  GREGSON
                          (cut to the chase)
                    Holmes.

  Sherlock holds up his cell phone to show them an ECUof Lisa 
    Dampier sBRUISED NECK. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    These strangulation marks are 
                    indicative of man much larger than 
                    Mantlo.  Not just heavier, but 
                    taller.  I d estimate his height to 
                    be somewhere between 6 1 and 6 3.  
                    Your M.E.will come to the same 
                    conclusion in a few hours; I m 
                    delivering it now.

  When Olshansky laughs, Holmes  splits  the screen on his phone: 
  The image of the strangulation marks is now side-by-side with 
  the picture he took of Mantlo s hands just moments ago.  And as 
  he holds the phone out to Joan --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    You re a doctor, tell them I m 
                    right. 

                                  JOAN
                          (embarrassed; to Gregson)
                    I m not a doctor.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You werea doctor.  Surely you 
                    haven t forgotten how bruising 
                    works.                                                                                                27

  All eyes are on Joan.  And as she finally takes his phone...

                                  JOAN
                    Okay.  Yeah.  Sure.  These hands do 
                    seem a little small for this bruise 
                    pattern.  But --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    With your permission, Captain 
                    Gregson, I d like a moment alone 
                    with Dr. Mantlo.

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    Captain --

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (OVER him; to Gregson)
                    We now know three things about our 
                    killer.  One, he was tall.  Two, he 
                    was familiar to the victim.  Three, 
                    he was intelligent enough to 
                    attempt to concealthat familiarity 
                    by kicking the front door in after 
                    he killed her.  Stands to reason 
                    that if he was familiar to Lisa 
                    Dampier, he may also have been 
                    familiar to her husband, wouldn t 
                    you agree? 

  Gregson sighs.  And after a beat --

                                  GREGSON
                    You ve got two minutes. 

  Holmes turns and continues into --


  And as he slaps a PEN and PAPER down in front of Mantlo --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Tall men in your life.  I d like a 
                    list. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


  We re observing CARTER POLK (tall, mid-30s, tightly wound) from 
  a distance as he confers (MOS) with a nurse.  

                                  JOAN (O.C.)
                    You know he doesn t have to answer 
                    any of your questions, don t you?

  ANOTHER ANGLE finds Joan and Sherlock watching him. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Why not?  I m a New York police 
                    detective. 

  He flashes a POLICE BADGE.  And as Joan SEES the PHOTO ID of 
  Detective Olshansky that accompanies it, and she realizes he 
  must have stolenit -- 

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Relax.  He ll have it back by end 
                    of day.

  Before Joan can object, Polk starts heading their way.  And as 
  Sherlock nods at him, adopting a flawless American accent--

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Mr. Polk? 
                          (then; flashing the badge)
                    Detective Olshansky, NYPD.I d 
                    like to ask you a few questions. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


  It s MOMENTS LATER and Polk stands opposite Sherlock and an 
    uncomfortable Joan.                                                                                                31
  CONTINUED:

                                  CARTER POLK
                    I don t know what to say.  Lisa was 
                    a good person.  But if you re here 
                    because you think I had something 
                    to do with it --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Dr. Mantlo said you made a pass at 
                    her at a holiday party last year.

                                  CARTER POLK 
                    Actually, no, I didn t.  
                          (then)
                    I asked her about all the plastic 
                    surgery she d had.

  ON JOAN -- LOOKING UP at that, recalling that Sherlock deduced 
  that Lisa had either lost a tremendous amount of weight or 
  undergone plastic surgery.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (for Joan s benefit)
                     Plastic surgery? 

                                  CARTER POLK
                    She d undergone a rhinoplasty and a 
                    breast augmentation.  I couldn t 
                    understand why an already beautiful 
                    woman would change her appearance 
                    so drastically, so I asked her 
                    about it.  She thought it was some 
                    sort of come-on --  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I m sorry.  Did you sayalready
                    beautiful? 

  And as Polk moves to his desk, starts searching for a file --

                                  CARTER POLK
                    I helped organize a fundraiserfor 
                    the hospital two years ago, back 
                    before the surgeries.  I know I 
                    still have the pictures... 

  Joan, meanwhile, notices GYM CLOTHES and a SNEAKER BOX resting 
  on a chair.  And as she SEES the shoe-size listed on the box is 
   11  -- the same size of the boot print left on Lisa Dampier s
  front door -- she COUGHS to try to get Holmes  attention, tilts 
  her head in the direction of the shoe box.  But as he gives her 
  a LOOK that says,  Yes, thank you, I know  --

                                  CARTER POLK (CONT D)
                    There.  That s a picture I took of 
                    Lisa and Dr. Mantlo that night.                                                                                                32
  CONTINUED: (2)

  He turns his screen around to display an image of a tuxedo-clad 
  Mantlo, his arm wrapped around a SLENDER WOMAN with short, dark 
  hair... and as we re STRUCK by the realization that the slender 
  woman is none other than a pre-surgery Lisa...

                                  CARTER POLK (CONT D)
                    Tell me youwouldn t want to ask 
                    why she did it.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (beat; then)
                    Tell me about the stalking charge 
                    brought against you two years ago. 

                                  CARTER POLK
                    I asked my neighbor out.  Twice, 
                    she said no.  The third time, she 
                    called the police.  Total
                    overreaction on her part.  She 
                    apologized and dropped the charges.

  Sherlock starts to ask another question, but Joan cuts him off:

                                  JOAN
                    Mr. Polk, can you account for your 
                      whereabouts last night? 

  Sherlock, surprised, glances at her.  Her expression is serious, 
  but he can tell that -- on some level -- she s into this. 

                                  CARTER POLK
                    I was home.  Sleeping.  Alone.  No, 
                    that s not much of an alibi, but 
                    I m not worried.  Know why?  
                    Because I didn t do it. 

  And as he finally STORMS PAST Sherlock and Joan...

                                                                            CUT TO:


  CLOSE ON AN ELECTRICAL SOCKET as a two-pronged PLUG is inserted.  
  WIDER to find Joan settling into her new room.  And as she sets 
  the time on her  primary  alarm clock, her cell RINGS.  She

                    don t have to worry. 

  And as she pulls her BACKUP ALARM out of a CARRY-ON...

  Ty Morstansits at a desk in the BULLPEN, phone to his ear.

                                  TY

  EXITS to the hallway...


                                  JOAN
                    Recovering addicts can be pretty 
                    resourceful.  Gotta dispose of any 
                    household items they might use to 
                    get high in a pinch.  Aerosol cans, 
                    old cologne bottles...

  She stops short when she sees there s no mirror on the cabinet 
  over the sink.  Just an empty frame on a hinge.  And after she 
  considers the mostly empty shelves a moment --

                    This.  You and me.  Still talking. 

                                  TY
                          (beat)
                    Six months of dating shouldn t undo 
                    ten years of friendship, should it?

  Before Joan can respond, a VISCOUS GOLDEN LIQUID suddenly DRIPS 
  onto her shoulder.  And as she LOOKS UP to discover some sort of 
   syrup  is leaking from a damp spot on the ceiling...

                                  TY (CONT D)
                    Joan? 

                                  JOAN
                    Sorry.  Gotta call you back. 

  And as she HANGS UP and EXITS, and we END INTERCUT...                                                                                                34



  It s the NEXT MORNING and we re CLOSE ON A SLUMBERING JOAN as 
  her eyes PEEL OPEN.  Still half-asleep, she turns to her alarm 
  to check the time -- only to discover it s been unplugged. 

  ANOTHER ANGLE -- as she sits bolt upright in bed.  Looks across 
  the room to her backup alarm, but it, too, has been unplugged.  
  She GRABS for her cell phone.  And as she SEES she has one new 
  TEXT MESSAGE from  S. Holmes,  we...

                                                                            CUT TO:


  Sherlock sits at a COMPUTER, surrounded by opened FILE BOXES, 
  when he HEARS -- 

                                  JOAN (O.C.)
                    I m going to need you to spit in 
                    this. 

  And as he TURNS to find an unhappy Joan standing in the doorway, 
    a disposable drug test known as a SALIVA CUP in her hand...

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (checks his watch)
                    10:37.  I take back everything I 
                    said last night.  You obviously 
                    loveyour job.  Couldn t waitto 
                    get started this morning...

                                  JOAN
                          (setting the cup down)
                    Your saliva.  Right now.  If you re 
                    on anything, that little strip will 
                    turn blue.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (eyes on the computer)
                    Spitting is undignified.  If you 
                    really want to test me, you ll take 
                    me to a lab so I can give a proper 
                    blood sample.                                                                                                37
  CONTINUED:

                                  JOAN
                    Do you wantme to tell your brother 
                    to talk to Captain Gregson? 

  A beat, and then an unhappy Sherlock takes the cup from her.  
  Keeps his eyes ON Joan as he spits in it.  And as he returns it:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I have a new theory about our 
                    killer.  I think he s struck at 
                    least once before.
                          (then)
                    I -- who lovewhat I do -- woke up 
                    early and couldn t stop thinking 
                    about the ring box he stole from 
                    Lisa Dampier sliving room. 

                                  JOAN
                          (remembers)
                    You said it was some sort of 
                     trophy.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    And you know what flavor of killer 
                    takes trophies, don t you?  Serial.  
                    Souvenirs help them differentiate 
                    between victims.  It occurred to me 
                    that if Lisa wasn t ourkiller s 
                    first go, there might be other
                    cases in common. 

  Then, as he takes a CRIME SCENE PHOTO from a FILE, and Joan SEES 
  it s an ECUof a woman s badly bruised neck --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Teresa Renfro.  Savagely beaten and 
                    strangled by an intruder in her 
                    Bronx home two years ago.  He took 
                    a jewelry box on his way out, but 
                    left behind a size 11 footprint.  
                    Especially striking are the 
                    physical similarities between her 
                    and Lisa.  Both were curvaceous 
                    with long red hair --

                                  JOAN
                          (getting it)
                    You think the killer has a  type. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (nods)
                    The one significant differencein 
                    the cases?  Teresa Renfro survived
                    her attack. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                                38



  TERESA RENFRO -- mid 20s, buxom and red-haired -- studies a 
  PHOTOGRAPH of a smiling Lisa Dampier.And after a moment...

                                  TERESA RENFRO
                    I m sorry.  I can see why you might 
                    think it was the same guy... I just 
                    don t think I can help you. 

  NEW ANGLE reveals she s sitting opposite Sherlock and Joan in 
  her modest LIVING ROOM.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I know from the police report that 
                    the man who assaulted you wore a 
                    mask.  You never saw his face.  But 
                    that doesn t mean you can t help us 
                    identify him. 

  Teresa seems confused by that, but before she can speak --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Did he say anything to you?  

                                  TERESA RENFRO
                    No.  I came in through my front 
                    door and he was just... there.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Did he have a particular scent?  
                      Cigarettes, cologne, halitosis...

  Teresa, uncomfortable, begins to toy with the small CRUCIFIX 
  that dangles from her neck.  

                                  TERESA RENFRO
                    I don t think so...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Was he tall?  Short?  Somewhere in 
                    between?

                                  TERESA RENFRO
                    I don t know.  I mean... he was on 
                    top of me so quickly.  His hands 
                    were around my throat...

  Sherlock WATCHES as she continues to fiddle with her pendant.  
  It means something to him, but he files it away for the moment.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    What about the mask?

                                  TERESA RENFRO
                    What about it?                                                                                                39

                    Was it ski?  Mexican wrestling?  
                    Paper-plate?

                                  TERESA RENFRO
                    Ski --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Excellent.  Then surely, you got a 
                    good look at his eyes. 
                          (then; off her confusion)
                    Correct me if I m wrong, but a 
                    strangler literallycannot be more 
                    than an arm s length from his 
                      strangl-ee, can he?  
                          (then; holding his own 
                          arms OUTRIGHT)
                    That s not more than, what?  Two 
                    feet?  Two and a half?  I m twice 
                    that distance from you now and I 
                    can see youreyes are a lovely 
                    brown.

                          (beat)
                    I think I d like you to leave now.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Why?  Because I know you re lying?

  And as Joan s head WHIPS AROUND at that --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                          (sharply)
                    She is.  You can tell by the 
                    crucifix.  She fiddles with it 
                    every time I ask her a question.  

                                  JOAN
                    What??

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s a pacifying behavior.  
                    Elementary haptic communication.
                          (then; frustrated by her 
                          STARE)
                    Read a book, would you?  She did
                    see her attacker s face!  I think 
                    she may even know who he is!

                          (ANGRY now; to Teresa)
                    You do understand that because you 
                    protected him two years ago, you 
                    have the blood of an innocent woman 
                    on your hands, don t you?  Perhaps 
                    you d like to go for two?  Or 
                    three?  Or four?

                                  JOAN
                          (standing)
                    That s enough. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    But --

                                  JOAN
                    No.  No buts.  You re done here.  
                    Go wait in the car.

  A beat.  A chastened Holmes stares daggers at Teresa, then 
  EXITS, SLAMMING the door shut as he goes.  And after a moment...

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    Ms. Renfro, I don t think I can 
                    apologize enough for Mr. Holmes  
                    behavior.  He s a very... 
                    complicatedman.  

                                  TERESA RENFRO
                    He s an asshole. 

  Joan can t argue.  Yet neither can she completely disregard 
  Holmes  suspicions.  And after a moment --

                                  JOAN
                    And you know what the worst part 
                    is?  He s usually right about stuff 
                    like this.
                          (then; off Teresa s LOOK)
                    Please.  If there s even a chance
                    you can help us stop the man who 
                    hurt you from hurting anyone 
                    else... tell us now.  Before it s 
                    too late. 

  And ON Teresa, frightened but considering...


  Gregson, phone to ear, stands at the center of a HIVE of police 
  activity.  A very deadPETER SALDUA lies in a pool of blood on 
  the floor, a PISTOL clutched in one hand.  And as we note he s 
  just inches from a  shrine  that includes SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of 
  Lisa Dampierand the small RING BOX he took from her home...

                                  GREGSON
                    Technically?  Yeah.  He s all ours.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                      ACT THREE

  FADE IN:


  ON the corpse of Peter Saldua as it s zipped into a BODY BAG: 

                                  GREGSON  (O.C.)
                    Mailman saw the body through the 
                    window and called 911.  Said he 
                    thought someone on his route had 
                    killed himself.

  ANOTHER ANGLE finds Gregson, Olshansky, Joan, and Sherlock 
  looking on as the body is WHEELED AWAY.  

                                  GREGSON (CONT D)
                    He was right.  Gun was still in 
                    Saldua s hand when we got here.  
                    M.E.thinks he s been dead about 24 
                    hours, but that s pending an 
                    autopsy.  
                          (re: the  shrine )
                    Everything else pretty much speaks 
                    for itself.  

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    Turns out Mantlo and his wife used 
                    the florist Saldua worked for.  
                    They ordered fresh flowers to the 
                    house once a week.  Saldua was the 
                    guy who delivered them.   

                                  JOAN
                          (realizing; to Sherlock)
                    That would explain why Lisa let him 
                    inside the house the other night.  
                    He was a familiar face.

  ON SHERLOCK -- and it s hard not to notice that, for the first 
  time since we ve met him, he seems TROUBLED.  CONFUSED, even.  
  He scans the area a moment, his eyes catching on an OVERTURNED 
  WASHING MACHINE in an adjacent room.  It looks as though someone 
  STOMPED on it with booted feet during some sort of tantrum.   

                                  SHERLOCK
                    What happened over there?

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    Mixed his colors with his whites.  
                    Who knows.  Guy was a nutbar.

  Sherlock moves to a nearby DESK.  Notes a CELL PHONE CHARGER 
  plugged into a wall.                                                                                                  44
  CONTINUED:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Did you already take his phone...?

                                  GREGSON
                          (shakes his head)
                    Hasn t turned up yet.  But it will. 

  And as a CSUTECH approaches him and Olshansky, pulling them 
  into an (MOS) conversation, Sherlock LINGERS at the desk, his 
  eyes drawn to a PILL VIAL on a shelf.  He PICKS IT UP; notes 
  that while it bears a label that reads  XANAX,  it doesn t 
  include any pharmacy or doctor information.  And as Joan 
  approaches, thinks she has a read on his mood...

                                  JOAN
                          (quietly)
                    You wanted to be the one who found 
                    him, didn t you?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (still distracted)
                    I don t do what I do for the 
                    credit. 

  Joan s actually a little surprised by that. 

                                  JOAN
                    Then why doyou do it? 

  It s too big a question for Sherlock in this moment.  And as he 
  returns the vial to the shelf and EXITS without another word...

                                                                            CUT TO:


  We re CLOSE ON A TELEVISION as an emotional Nicholas Mantlo 
  addresses the media from the front steps of the police station:

                                  MANTLO
                          (via the TV)
                    ...like to thank the police again 
                    for finding the man who killed my 
                    wife.  I would have liked to have 
                    seen him stand trial for what he 
                    did, but I take some comfort in the 
                    fact he can t hurt anyone else...

  ANOTHER ANGLE finds Joan at her desk, using her laptop to PRINT 
  OUT what appear to be TWO TICKETS to a concert or show.  And as 
  she takes the tickets from her printer and EXITS...


  She s on her way down the stairs when she suddenly STOPS SHORT.                                                                                                45
  CONTINUED:

  REVERSE ANGLE -- reveals the living room has been transformed 
  into a virtual  cocoon  of information that pertains to the Lisa 
    Dampiercase.  One wall is PAPERED with photographs of the 
  slender, dark-haired, pre-surgery Lisa Dampier; another wall 
  with pictures of the curvier, redheaded, post-surgery Lisa.  
  Crime scene photographs litter the floor, as do various REPORTS 
  and DOCUMENTS.  Sherlock, looking even more troubled than he did 
  at the Saldua home, stands at the center of it all, his arms 
  crossed.  And when he SEES Joan on the stairs, he holds up a 
  BLOWN-UP PHOTOGRAPH of pre-surgery Lisa and points to a small, 
  Marilyn Monroe-like mole on her cheek --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    She had her mole removed when she 
                    changed her look. 
                          (then; frustrated)
                    It doesn t make any sense.  She 
                    lovedthat mole.  Before her 
                    surgery, she turned her head to 
                    featureit whenever her picture was 
                    taken.  

  He turns his attention back to the photo.  And as a concerned 
  Joan approaches from the stairs...

                                  JOAN
                    Where did you get all these 
                    pictures?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    These?  Reached out to Lisa s 
                    friends via her Facebookpage, said 
                    I wanted them for a memorial 
                    websiteI was putting together. 

  Joan is horrified, but Sherlock, eyes on the pic, is oblivious:

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Carter Polk was right.  She was as 
                    beautiful beforethe surgery as she 
                    was after.  So why bother?  What 
                    was the point?
                          (then; grabbing a mess of 
                            DOCUMENTS off the floor)
                    Another thing: Saldua s phone 
                    records indicate he used his cell 
                      constantly.  But then, three days 
                    ago, he just stopped.  Didn t make 
                    a single call, didn t send a single 
                    text.  Why?

  But before she can even fathom a guess, he grabs more PAPERS --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    His bank records, meanwhile, list 
                    several checks made out to  Dr.                                                                                                 46

                    Rolland Jessup,  psychologist.  
                    Given the promise Saldua made to 
                    Teresa Renfro to get help, he seems 
                    worth a talking-to, no?
                          (beforeshe can answer)
                    No.   Cause the plonkdropped dead

                    files, but God knows if they ll be 
                    any help...

  He turns back to the wall.  And after Joan WATCHES him a moment, 
    concerned...

                                  JOAN
                    Sherlock, the Lisa Dampiercase is 
                    over.  You helped solve it. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    No.  Too simple.  Too fast.  
                      Something s off, I can feel it. 
                          (then; finally noticing 
                          the PRINTOUT she brought 
                          from her room)
                    What s that? 

  Joan just stands there a beat, a bit lost, and then --

                                  JOAN
                    I got us tickets to Jersey Boys 
                    tonight. 
                          (then; off his confusion)
                    To celebrate.  When your brother 
                    hired me, he mentioned something 
                    about you liking the theater...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I went to one playwhen I was nine! 
                    Now I m a theater buff?!?

  And as he STANDS and MOVES PAST HER --


  While Sherlock searches cupboards for something to eat, Joan 
  enters from the living room.  Speaks plainly but gently:

                                  JOAN
                    I m worried about you.  I see you 
                    making this case more complicated 
                    than it really is, and it tells me 
                    you re struggling --

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (tossing another cupboard)
                    I don t  struggle.   With anything.                                                                                                  47

                                    SHERLOCK(CONT'D)
                    Or haven t you been paying 
                    attention the last few days?  I ve 
                    been right about everything. 

                                  JOAN
                    Actually, you haven t. 

  Sherlock turns to her.   Excuse me? And if Joan could take it 
  back, she probably would, because she doesn t typically tell 
  people what she s about to tell him.  It s just too painful.

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    The day we met, you  deduced  that 
                    I gave up being a surgeon to become 
                      a companion because I d lost 
                    someone close to me. The truth --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    -- is that you made a mistake 
                    during a surgery that cost a 
                    patient his life.  I knew it as 
                    soon as I saw your parents  picture 
                    on your phone.  

  ON JOAN -- and it couldn t be more obvious that he s right.  
  She s as hurt as she is surprised; she wanted to sharethis with 
  him, not have it  taken  by way of deduction.  Sherlock, 
  however, is oblivious; can t stop himself: 

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    It takes years of study to become a 
                    surgeon, not to mention a 
                    tremendous ego.  Surgeons don t 
                    just  leave  to become addict-
                    sitters; they re forced out.  And 
                    they re only forced out if they 
                    commit the sin of malpractice.  I 
                    knew it would be a sore subject, so 
                    I made up the bit about you losing 
                    a friend to spare your feelings. 

                                  JOAN
                          (beat; quietly pissed)
                    That was very big of you.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (turning back to the 
                            cupboard)
                    I thought so.

  Another beat as Joan watches him, and then she forces a smile:

                                  JOAN
                    How do you know the patient died?  
                    How do you know I didn t just leave 
                    him paralyzed or in a coma?                                                                                                 48
  CONTINUED: (2)

  A beat, then he turns to her again.  Starts slowly, but picks up 
  speed as he goes; a deductive boulder rolling down a hill: 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The parking ticket.  The one you 
                    had in your purse.  You incurred it 
                    two weeks ago near the corner of 
                    86th and Washington.  Only thing 
                    there is Carver Cemetery.  
                    Obviously, you were visiting a 
                    grave.  Not a parent s grave, of 
                    course; Googleindicated they re 
                    both alive and well.  A sibling s?  
                    No.  Carver is a pauper s field, 
                    and the picture you keep of mom and 
                    dad in your phone say they re well 
                    to do.  No sibling of yourswould 
                    be interred in a place like that.  
                    The grounds don t even include a 
                    proper parking area, hence the 
                    ticket.  So.  A surgeon who s no 
                    longer a surgeon, a parking 
                    violation incurred just outside a 
                    poor man s cemetery, and two 
                    parents who are as moneyed as they 
                    are alive.  Add it all up, and what 
                    does it say?  You were visiting the 
                    grave of the man youlet die on 
                    your operating table. 

  A long and quiet moment as this just HANGS THERE... and then 
  Joan, angry but trying to cover, forces another smile:

                                  JOAN
                    It s so incredible.  The way you 
                    can  solve  people just by looking 
                    at them.  I notice you don t have 
                    many mirrorsaround here.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  JOAN
                    It means, Mr. Holmes, that I think 
                    you know a lost cause when you see 
                    one.  I do too.  You re not cut out 
                    for companionship.  Sober or 
                    otherwise.  Tomorrow, I ll pack my 
                    things.  But tonight...
                          (holds up tickets)
                    ...I ve got plans. 

  She turns and EXITS.  And ON Sherlock, knowing he went too far, 
  but too full of himself to admit it...

                                                                        TIMECUTTO:                                                                                                49



  A packed house.  It s approximately one hour later and the 
  curtain is RISING as Joan settles into her seat.  Distracted by 
  the EMPTY SEAT beside her -- the seat that would ve been 
  Sherlock s -- she rests her bag in it. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


  Where New York s Finest come to let off steam.  FIND an uneasy 
  Sherlock in the CROWD at the bar.  We wonder if he s falling off 
  the wagon, but then a MANILA FILE lands in front of him --

                                  GREGSON (O.C.)
                    There you go.  Everything your dead 
                    shrink had on my dead strangler.

  And as Sherlock TURNS to find Gregson taking a seat beside him:

                                  GREGSON (CONT D)
                    You can thank me with a shot of 
                    Crown.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (re: the file)
                    Dusty.

                                  GREGSON
                    The guy hasbeen dead for almost 
                    two years, okay?  His widow had all 
                    his stuff in storage.  You re lucky 
                    she even let me take a look --

  But Holmes, who has already started to SPEED-READ, cuts him off:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    According to this, Saldua never 
                    told him about the attack on Teresa 
                    Renfro, just that he had an 
                    obsession with red-haired women and 
                    a tendency towards violence.

                                  GREGSON
                    I m serious about that Crown, you 
                    know...

  Something in Jessup snotes catches Sherlock s eye:

                                  SHERLOCK
                     Mr. Saldua, now obsessed with his 
                    own recovery, has taken to 
                    recordingour sessions with his 
                    phone so he can listen to them 
                    again and again.                                                                                                   50

  FLASH TO: Peter Saldua, mid-session with DR. ROLLAND JESSUP
  (50s, white-haired) in Jessup sMODEST OFFICE.  FIND Saldua s 
  PHONE on the table between them, RECORDING the conversation.

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                          (beat; to Gregson)
                    Has the phone turned up yet? 

                                  GREGSON
                          (shakes his head)
                    Starting to think he lost it.
                          (re: his own phone)
                    See this?  My third in the last two 
                    years.  

  When Sherlock just MULLS that, Gregson sighs --

                                  GREGSON (CONT D)
                    Holmes --

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (distractedly)
                    The case is over.  Yes.  Well 
                    aware. 

  Gregson finally STANDS, rests his jacket on his stool --

                                  GREGSON
                    Watch this, OK?  Gotta take a leak. 

  He EXITS FRAME and we HOLD ON SHERLOCK.  Another beat as he 
  thinks, and then his attention is drawn to... 

  ...THE TELEVISION mounted over the bar.  It s tuned to a WWE-
    stylewrestling show; two steroid-addled muscle men, separated 
  only by a small, tuxedo-clad announcer, barking threats at each 
  other in the middle of a ring.  Wrestler #1 turns to address the 
  camera directly, and Wrestler #2 slips away to take a folding 
  metal chair from a ringside crony.  He sneaks up behind #1, then 
  SMASHES the chair into #1 sskull.  #1 crumples to the ground, 
  but #2 just keeps pummeling him with the chair, his face 
  contorted with RAGE.  

  ON HOLMES -- suddenly transfixed.  

  FLASH TO: The overturned washing machine in SALDUA S HOME.

  RESUME SHERLOCK: As it hits him --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Rage.  He felt rage. 

  And as he suddenly EXITS, abandoning Gregson s jacket...

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:                                                                                                51



  The theater is dark; the production is up and running.  Joan is 
  sitting in her seat when she HEARS a commotion at the back of 
  the theater, followed by -- 

                                  SHERLOCK (O.C.)
                          (a loud whisper)
                    Watson!

  Joan DUCKS DOWN, but not quickly enough.  Holmes has spotted 
  her.  And as he makes his way to the empty seat beside her:

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Peter Saldua felt ragethe night he 
                    killed Lisa.  It was obvious from 
                    the condition of her body.  

                                  JOAN
                          (eyes on the stage)
                    You re not here right now.  I don t 
                    see you, I don t hear you...

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (a threat)
                    Shall I speak up?
                          (then; as she TURNS)
                    He had some measure of control with 
                    Teresa Renfro, but not with her.  
                    Why?  

                                  JOAN
                    He knew Teresa.  She was like 
                    family to him. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    True, but the pill vial I found at 
                    his home tells us he was medicated
                    this time around.  He was treating 
                    himself.  He wanted to get better, 
                    but instead he got worse. 
                          (then; cutting her off)
                    Tell me exactlywhat a Xanaxtab 
                    looks like. 

                                  JOAN
                    Small.  White.  Ovular.  Why? 

  Sherlock doesn t answer; just whips out his cell and dials.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (into phone)
                    Detective Olshansky, please. 

  Then, when he s SHUSHED by a woman in a neighboring row --                                                                                                52

                          (re: a performer on stage)
                    He s not even on-key. 

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  ...as Olshanskybrings his phone to his ear.

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    Make it quick, Prince Charles, I 
                    was just on my way out. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The pill vial that was on Saldua s 
                    desk.  Was it taken into evidence?

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    Yeah, everything from his place is 
                    here in the bullpen.  Why? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I need you find that vial for me. 

    Olshanskymoves to an assortment of BAGGED EVIDENCE laid out on 
    a particular desk.  Finds the vial in question and OPENS IT:

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    Now what? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Open it. The pills inside should be 
                    white and ovular, but they re not, 
                    are they?  They re round and pink. 

                                  OLSHANSKY
                    How dyou know?  

  But Sherlock, his mind RACING, just HANGS UP, ENDING INTERCUT.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (to Joan; urgently)
                    I need a ride.  Right now.

                                  JOAN
                    I m in the middle of something.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You were right the other day.  
                    About Teresa Renfro.  I had no idea 
                    she d respond to you the way that 
                    she did.  I only told you I did 
                    because I was embarrassed I d lost 
                    my temper.                                                                                                  53

  But before Joan can thank him for admitting it --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Would I have gotten to the truth 
                    some other way?  Of course. But you 
                    got me there faster.  Now please:

  Sherlock white-knuckles the steering wheel, his face mere INCHES 
  from a freshly deployed AIRBAG.  And after a MOMENT --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Yes.  Better.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                        ACT FOUR

  FADE IN:


  FROM ABOVE: Sherlock reclines on a cot, his eyes CLOSED.  We 
  HEAR the loud BUZZ of a security door being OPENED, followed by 
  the CLICKING of a woman s heels on the concrete floor.  And 
  after a moment, Sherlock smiles --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Ms. Watson, have I told you how 
                    much I enjoy your perfume?

  And as he finally OPENS HIS EYES, TURNS to find Watson in the 
  CORRIDOR beyond his cell, a VISITOR BADGE affixed to her coat:

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Almost makes me forget how much 
                    urine has stained this floor.

  Beat.  Joan opens her mouth to speak, but Sherlock cuts her off:

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  Not just for the car, 
                    but for the way I spoke to you 
                    earlier.  I knew the death of your 
                    patient would be a sore subject, I 
                    just --

                                  JOAN
                    Couldn t help yourself.  Yeah.  
                    Starting to see how that s kind of 
                    a thing with you. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (beat)
                    I assume you ve told my brother 
                    about what happened tonight?

  Joan nods; Sherlock SIGHS. 

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    I m going to miss that brownstone. 

                                  JOAN
                      Actually... you re not. 
                          (then; when he LOOKS UP)
                    I had a long talk with him, and 
                    since what you did in that parking 
                    lot didn t have anything to do with 
                    drugs... he s agreed to give you 
                    one more chance.

  ON SHERLOCK -- surprised by that.  Suddenly REALIZING --                                                                                                59

  Her silence confirms it.  And as Holmes smiles, grateful --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    I m pleased, Watson.  Quite 
                    pleased.  Not for myself, of 
                    course, but for you.  I happen to 
                    think there s some hope for you as 
                    an investigator -- 

                                  JOAN
                    I want you to let me in on the rest 
                    of the plan. 

  Sherlock just looks at her --  Plan? 

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    The plan to get Mantlo.  I know you 
                    wouldn t have smashed my car into 
                    his unless it was part of some 
                    elaborate --
                          (OFF his sheepish smile; 
                            realizing)
                    -- temper tantrum.  Crap.

  Another beat, then --

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    In that case... I want you to tell 
                    me about London. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Big place, lots of rain...

                                  JOAN
                    I want you to tell me about what

                                  JOAN
                    Because.  If I m going to help you, 
                    I need to know everything --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Actually, you don t  need  to know 
                    anything more than I m a recovering 
                    addict.  You wantto know about

                    don t havemeaningful connections. 

  ON JOAN -- and something about that makes her smile.  

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Why are you smiling?

                    Because now I know it was a woman. 

  ON SHERLOCK -- and if Joan is right, the only hint she gets is 
  an almost imperceptible hesitation before he asks:

                    What makes you say that?

                    You re trying too hard.  Just like 
                    you were the other day with the 
                    tattooed lady, all that  sex is 
                    repellent  crap.You canconnect 
                    to people; it just frightens you.

  Sherlock is inscrutable.  Will neither confirm nor deny.  Then:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    See you at the hearing, Ms. Watson. 

  Joan nods, MOVES OFF.  And ON Sherlock...

                                                                            CUT TO:


  Joan ENTERS through the front door, locks it behind her.  A 
  beat, and then she finds herself drawn to the living room FILLED 
  with evidence from the Lisa Dampiercase.  Notices that a few 
  small rivulets of HONEY have made their way down the far wall.  
  And as she TOUCHES one, rubs the syrupy substance between her 
  fingers...    

                                  JOAN
                          (echoing Sherlock)
                     Happens sometimes.  

  She TURNS, knocking over a stack of Sherlock s papers with her 
  foot.  She kneels down to collect them, then FREEZES.  Something 
  on one of the papers has caught her eye.  When she finally 
  STANDS, she moves to one of the walls PAPERED with CRIME SCENE 
  PHOTOS and pulls down a picture that features PETER SALDUA S 
  KITCHEN.  And as her eyes dart back and forth between the 
  document and the photograph, as though trying to make sense of 
  some discrepancy only she can see...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                                61



  It s the NEXT MORNING and Sherlock is sitting near the defense 
  table, waiting for his hearing to begin when he HEARS --

                                  JOAN (O.C.)
                    I want to show you something.

  And as he turns to find Joanclutching a MANILA FOLDER...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Can it wait until after my hearing?  
                    I sense a strong sexual attraction 
                    from the judge, and I m attempting 
                    to determine whether I should 
                    represent myself. 

  Joan looks to the JUDGE, a bespectacled woman in her late 60s
  who doesn t even seem to register Holmes  presence. 

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                          (then; can t help himself)
                    Is it important? 

                                  JOAN
                    Honestly?  I m not sure.  But after 
                    spending the last few days with 
                    you, seeing how big the  small 
                    stuff  can be...

  She shrugs.  Opens the folder and pulls out the DOCUMENT that 
  caught her eye last night.  And as she sets it on the table... 

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    This is Peter Saldua s medical 
                    file.  Look under the  known 
                    allergies  heading.  

  And no sooner has Holmes done so than Joan places the crime 
  scene photo of Saldua s kitchen on top of it --

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    Thiswas taken the morning Peter 
                    Saldua s body was found. 

  ON SHERLOCK -- and it couldn t be more obvious that he SEES the 
  same  discrepancy  that Joan noted last night. 

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    Weird, right? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (beat; transfixed)
                    No, actually.  Not even a little.                                                                                                 62

  And as he smiles, obviously excited, we...

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:


  Nicholas Mantlo sits in a chair opposite Gregson s vacant desk.  
  And as Gregson ENTERS from the corridor and Mantlo STANDS --

                                  GREGSON
                    Dr. Mantlo.  Sorry for the wait.  I 
                    appreciate you giving me an 
                      opportunity to apologize face to 
                    face for what happened last night.  

                                  MANTLO
                    Not at all.  I can t promise it ll 
                    change my mind about suing the 
                    department for what your 
                     consultant  did to my car... but 
                    it s a start.

  Gregson indicates Mantlo should sit.  And as Gregson settles in 
  behind his desk --

                                  CAPTAIN GREGSON
                    Before I issue any  official  
                    apology, Dr. Mantlo... there is 
                    just one thing I wanted to ask you.
                          (beat; then)
                    Didyou ever treat Peter Saldua as 
                    a patient? 

  ON MANTLO.  He wasn t expecting that, but as we ve seen, he s 
  cool under fire.  And as he gives a small smile...

                                  MANTLO
                    You have a funny way of saying 
                    you re sorry, Captain. 

                                  CAPTAIN GREGSON
                    It s a simple question, Dr. Mantlo. 

                                  MANTLO
                    No.  I did not treat Peter Saldua.  
                    I never even met the man.  Now.  If 
                    that s all, I m late for an 
                      appointment with my attorney --

  But Gregson just calls out in the direction of the hallway:

                                  GREGSON
                    Detective? 

  And as Detective OlshanskyENTERS, trailed by Sherlock and Joan, 
  Mantlo smiles again, indicates Holmes to Gregson --                                                                                                63
  CONTINUED:

                                  MANTLO
                    You know you re just digging 
                    yourself deeper, right?  Putting 
                    this man in the same room with me --

  But Sherlock just passes a now familiar DOCUMENT to Mantlo --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    This, Dr. Mantlo, is a medical form 
                    completed by Mr. Saldua for another
                    of his doctors. 

                        MANTLOSHERLOCK
    For the last time, Mr. Holmes.  (talking OVER him)
      I wasn t Peter Saldua s --My associate, Ms. Watson, was 
                                                      perusing it last night when 
                                                    she noticed that Saldua had a 
                                                    rather strong allergy to rice. 

                                  MANTLO
                    This is ridiculous --

  He starts for the door, but to his surprise, Olshansky BLOCKS 
  HIS PATH.  And as he realizes he s stuck here --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    As I was saying.  Ms. Watson noted 
                    Mr. Saldua s allergy to rice.  So 
                    you can imagine her confusion when 
                    she remembered seeing a sackof the 
                    stuff sitting on his pantry shelf.  

  Sherlock holds up the same CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPH of Saldua s 
  kitchen we ve seen previously -- only this time, we ll note that 
  a BAG OF RICE has been CIRCLED with red marker.  Mantlo just 
  looks at him: So fuckingwhat?

                                  JOAN
                    We also found a credit card receipt 
                    that told us he bought it exactly 
                    three days before his death.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (to Mantlo)
                    Odd, that, right?  Him going to the 
                    store and buying nothing but the 
                    onething he s allergic to?  Odder 
                    still, it was the same dayhe 
                    stopped using his cell phone.  His 
                    records indicate he didn t make or 
                    receive a single call.  At first I 
                    thought that was by choice... but 
                    then I remembered the overturned 
                    washing machine.   

  FLASH TO: Holmes, taking in the machine at the CRIME SCENE.                                                                                                64
  CONTINUED: (2)

                                  MANTLO
                    Okay, Mr. Holmes.  Amaze me.  What 
                    do a bag of rice and an overturned 
                    washing machine have to do with 
                    anything? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I was wrong the other day when I 
                    accused you of taking Saldua s 
                    phone after you murdered him.  You 
                    wanted to take it, but you 
                    couldn t, could you?  Because you
                    couldn t find it. 

  ON MANTLO -- a CRACK finally forming in his cool veneer.  And as 
  we realize that Holmes  deduction re: the phone is correct--

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    He laundered it, you see.  Left it 
                    in his pocket when he put his pants 
                    in the wash.  By the time he 
                    realized his mistake, it was too 
                    late.  The phone he d turned into a 
                    virtual libraryof his therapy 
                    sessions was wet and no longer 
                      functional.

  FLASH TO: Peter Saldua, standing in his LAUNDRY ROOM and 
  clutching a CELL PHONE that is DRIPPING WET.  TREMBLING with 
  RAGE, his eyes drift to the opened MAW of his washing machine...  

                                  SHERLOCK (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Furious with himself - and
                    suffering the effects of what he 
                    couldn t possibly have known was 
                    steroid intoxication- he destroyed 
                    the washer in a fit of rage.

  And as Saldua suddenly GRABS the machine with both hands and 
  THROWS it on its side --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    And then he went to the nearest 
                    grocer and purchased a bag of rice. 

  Then, when Mantlo just STARES at him --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Rice, as you re apparently not 
                    aware, is a natural desiccant and 
                    can be used to absorb the excess 
                    moisture from electronic devices 
                      that vebeen immersed in water.
                    We went to Saldua s home this 
                    morning to examine hisbag of rice.                                                                                                 65
  CONTINUED: (3)

  FLASH TO: Sherlock, leading Joan and Olshansky into Saldua s 
  kitchen and making a beeline for the sack of rice.  And as he 
  OPENS it, POURING its contents all over the counter...

                                  SHERLOCK (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    You ll never guess what we found 
                    inside. 

  RESUME SHERLOCK as he holds up PETER SALDUA S CELL PHONE.  And 
  as he hits  play  on the phone s voice recorder, we HEAR --

                                  PETER SALDUA (V.O.)
                    ...hername is Lisa.  When I see 
                    her, I get these feelings and I...

  He TRAILS OFF, emotional.  Couldn t sound more a tortured soul.

                                  PETER SALDUA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Please, Dr. Mantlo.  You need to 
                    help me.  You need to tell me how 
                    to stop myself from hurting her. 

  He starts to SOB.  And after a MOMENT, we HEAR...

                                  MANTLO (V.O.)
                    It s okay, Peter.  It s okay.  I m 
                    here for you.  Let s try upping 
                    your meds, see where that leads us.

  Sherlock hits  stop.   Gregson looks to Mantlo:

                                  GREGSON
                    Wanna tell us one more time how you 
                    never met Peter Saldua? 

  And ON Mantlo, knowing he s sealed his own fate, we PRELAPthe 
  CRACK of a BAT hitting a BASEBALL, followed by the ROAR of a 
  crowd, and we...

                                                                            CUT TO:


  A ball sails UP and OVER the right-field wall, missing the glove 
  of a leaping RED SOX OUTFIELDER by centimeters.  And as the 
  massive Yankee scoreboard LIGHTS UP --  HOME RUN!  -- and a 
  YANKEE PLAYER rounds the bases...  

  ...ANOTHER ANGLE finds Joan and Sherlock in UPPER LEVEL SEATS 
  along the third base line.  She s standing and CHEERING for all 
  she s worth; he s sitting and couldn t look more miserable. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Another tiny leather orb has left 
                    the field of play. How spectacular.  
                    May we pleasego home now?                                                                                                 66

                          (are you insane?)
                    We re in extra innings.  The Yanks 
                    just pulled within one and there s 
                    nobody out.  
                          (then; off his LOOK)
                    Don t give me that look.  This was 
                    youridea, remember?  You said you 
                    wanted to make up for pulling me 
                    out of Jersey Boys last night, and 
                    so far, so good.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I agreed to nineinnings of 
                    baseball, not twelve --

                    This is like... bonusbaseball.  
                    The last three innings?  Totally 
                    free.  Okay? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s remarkable.  I didn t miss 
                    drugs until just... now. 

  But Joan isn t about to let him rain on her parade.  CLAPS for 
  the new hitter coming to the plate:

                                  JOAN
                    Just  cause you don t understand 
                    something doesn t mean it isn t 
                    awesome, okay? 

  ON SHERLOCK -- turning at this.  Feeling challenged.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Actually, Ms. Watson, I m quite
                    familiar with the American Pastime.  
                    The other addicts at Hemdaleoften 
                    gathered in the common room to 
                    watch the matches when they were on 
                    telly.

  He studies the scoreboard a moment, then the defensive alignment 
  of the Red Sox.  Seems to do a little  math  in his head.  
  Checks it, then --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Pop-up to center, intentional walk, 
                      game-ending double play.  Final 
                    score: Red Sox of Boston, 3, 
                    Yankees of New York, 2. 

  Joan STUDIES him a moment, then smiles:

                                  JOAN
                    Yeah.  Right.  Nice try --

  But she s interrupted by the CRACK of another bat.  And as she 
  turns back to the field to SEE Boston s center-fielder catching 
  what was clearly a pop-fly...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I ll meet you at the car. 

  He gets up from his seat and EXITS, but Joan doesn t budge.  
  Wonders for a moment if he really could have predicted the pop-
  up, then decides, no, he couldn t have.  But then --

  -- the Red Sox catcher STANDS and moves a few feet from the 
  plate to receive an intentional BALL from his pitcher.  And as 
  he tosses it BACK to the pitcher, who, once again, throws 
    intentionally HIGH and AWAY from the plate...

  ...RESUME JOAN, her expression suddenly FLAT.  She should be 
  gladthe batter s about to be awarded a base... but she isn t.  
  Because she now knows, thanks to Sherlock, that the Yankees are 
  destined to lose.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


  Sherlock makes his way into one of the stadium s ELEVATORS.  The 
  door is CLOSING when a hand suddenly CATCHES IT.  It s Joan, who 
  SAYS NOTHING as she makes her way inside and stands shoulder-to-
  shoulder with him.  

  We HEAR the crack of a bat, followed by the rapid  thwap-thwap  
  of the Sox infield relaying the ball from second to first.  The 
  crowd GROANS at what could only have been a game-ending double-
  play.  And as the elevator door CLOSES on Joan and a smiling 
  Sherlock...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
