      A small ferris wheel, miniature roller coaster, raffles, 
      ring toss, spider ride, students, parents, a fund raising 
      event for the school as we pick up EMILY, BRENDA and JILL, 
      carrying her Newcomer Barbie doll, coming off a ferris 
      wheel, dizzy. (WE FOLLOW and shoot them from the invasive 
      yet distant P.O.V. of unseen observers -- hand-held, rough 
      movement.)

                                  JILL
                    My legs are jello!

                                  EMILY
                    Spatial disorientation. Neat, huh?

                                  BRENDA
                    Neat no. Queasy and dizzy yes.

      Emily is distant a beat here, looks at a game with a 
      picture of a clown in a fake jail.

                                  JILL
                            (concerned)
                    Emily?

                                  EMILY
                    It reminded me of Buck. Do you think they 
                    have decided what to do with him yet?

                                  BRENDA
                    If he's innocent, he has nothing to worry 
                    about.

      Emily reacts doubtfully.

                                  EMILY
                    I hope so, Brenda, but last night I scanned 
                    precedent cases in the Supreme Court 
                    records on my P.C. and sometimes the law 
                    makes mistakes too. Laws are enforced by 
                    people and people are biased, subjective 
                                  (MORE)                                  EMILY (CONT'D)
                    and often times prejudiced.

      Brenda kneels before Emily, holds her hands.

                                  BRENDA
                            (gentle)
                    Your father enforces the law. Do you think 
                    he's biased, prejudiced or subjective?

                                  EMILY
                            (wise)
                    No, but it's different for him. He's a 
                    Newcomer. Newcomers are not accepted. 
                    People are suspicious, quick to condemn 
                    what they don't understand or feel 
                      threatened by.

      Brenda reacts to Emily's intellect and far-sighted 
      rationale.

                                  BRENDA
                    Now where did you hear that?

                                  EMILY
                    Moodri.

                                  BRENDA
                    Moo-who?

                                  JILL
                            (explains)
                    Moodri's a Newcomer from the olden days. He 
                    lives with Emily's family, kinda like the 
                    guru you had in the sixties ...

                                  EMILY
                    You had a spiritual advisor?

      Jill rolls her eyes as they toss rings at a game.

                                  JILL
                    Emily, please stop, you'll set her off. 
                    She'll go home and play Crosby, Stills, and 
                    Nash LP's all night. If I hear "Dock of a 
                    Bay" again I'll go off-line crazy.                                  EMILY
                    I've read about the sixties, a time of 
                      enlightenment; of vision.

                                  BRENDA
                    It was an exciting time to be young.

                                  EMILY
                    What went wrong?

      They are walking along the carnival. (as if someone's 
      stalking them.)

      Emily stops in front of "The Whip", a ride which slings the 
      passengers around and around, as they get in line for the 
      ride, as a peal of screams rings out.

                                  EMILY
                    C'mon guys, physics never lets you down.

                                  JILL
                      Passadena, Emily. I can't out debate you 
                    and I'm not going. We'll watch you...

      Emily hesitates at the gate as she gives her ticket to the 
      ticket taker, climbs onto the ride, is buckled in.

                                  JILL
                    Good luck, Emily!

      Emily smiles, her expression reads, "I'm still a tad 
      scared", but she gets a determined look on her face as the 
      whip begins to go faster and faster until Emily SCREAMS, 
      stops, steels herself.

                                  VOICE (OS)
                    Mrs. Berks?

      Brenda turns to find a pair of PARAMEDICS, a MAN and a 
      WOMAN, both in their 30's, pleasant looking, I.D. badges, 
      the works.

                                  BRENDA
                    Yes?                                  PARAMEDIC MAN
                    Mrs. Rossiter in the school office asked us 
                    to tell you you had an urgent phone call.

      Brenda is concerned at this. "Who can It be?" reads her 
      expression.

                                  BRENDA
                    Could you tell Mrs. Rossiter as soon as 
                    Emily's ride is finished we'll be right 
                    over?

      Brenda points to the ride where Emily is closing her eyes 
      as the whip gains in intensity.

                                  PARAMEDIC MAN
                    Why not let us wait for Emily and bring her 
                    over when her ride's done?

                                  JILL
                    Urgent means serious, doesn't it, Mom?

      Brenda nods, unsure of how to proceed, for a beat, then 
      decides, takes Jill's hand to assure her.

                                  BRENDA
                    You'll bring Emily right over?

                                  PARAMEDIC WOMAN
                            (warm)
                      Absolutely.

      Brenda and Jill walk towards the school building which is 
      far across the playground-carnival, well out of sight as:

      "The Whip" slows, gradually comes to a halt. The two 
      paramedics stand at the gate as the riders step shakily 
      from their seats, and even Emily is dizzy as she comes 
      through the gate.

                                  PARAMEDIC WOMAN
                    Emily, dear?

      Emily steadies herself, looks at the paramedics, as over 
      their shoulder a miniature ferris wheel begins to turn, 
      motivating our cut to:      A COURTROOM CEILING FAN

      criminal court, old building, late afternoon filtered 
      sunlight as:

      GEORGE, BUCK, SUSAN, SIKES, a JUDGE and a LAWYER all are 
      waiting as the Judge reviews the papers.

                                  JUDGE
                    I have reviewed the preliminary parameters 
                    of the case. Counsel please approach the 
                    bench.

      Buck stands quiet, attentive, wearing a conservative suit.

      Sikes sits behind the fence in the spectators gallery, 
      leans forward, anxious, his fingers rapping a staccato 
      beat.

      The D.A, a smooth operator named THORPE, our Roy Cohn, 
      great suit, bad skin, cold face, seems surprised at the 
      aside, looks tolerantly toward the elderly lady judge and 
      over at LAWRENCE DARROW, a young, very short Newcomer 
      defense attorney, all about him is threadbare, shopworn, 
      and must read "underdog" and "grind." From his poorly 
      pressed polyester shirt to his thick glasses, and ripple 
      soles.

                                  JUDGE
                    Despite the larger issue of co-existence 
                    and inter-species relations that are sure 
                    to be raised here, I believe it is 
                    incumbent upon us to handle this like any 
                    other case.

      Both attorneys indicate their assent.

                                  JUDGE
                      Therefore, based on the upstanding record 
                    of the defendant's father as an upholder of 
                    the law, and the family's role in the 
                      community, let the defendant be released 
                    into the custody of his parents.                                  THORPE
                    Your Honor, what guarantees does the State 
                    have?

                                  JUDGE
                    Mr. Darrow, would your client be amenable 
                    to a guarantee bond of, say fifty-thousand 
                    dollars?

                                  DARROW
                    May I confer with my client a moment, Your 
                    Honor?

      Thorpe is miffed at this, returns to his table, shuts his 
      attache a tad more loudly than usual, irritated.

      George and Darrow confer a beat (in tongue).

                                  GEORGE
                    All I have is in my house ...

      George's eyes meet Buck's here, a beat of tacit 
      communication, of understanding, of gratitude.

                                  DARROW
                          (to Judge)
                    Mr. Francisco will put up his house, Your 
                    Honor.

      Thorpe grunts, does not look up as he gathers his papers, 
      his time will come and he is content as his Ivy league-cut 
      ASSISTANT comes over.

                                  THORPE
                    Thurgood Marshall must be doing cartwheels 
                    in his grave.

                                  ASSISTANT
                    It's no joke. Our Mr. Darrow is a Harvard 
                    man. Number one in his class, law review, 
                    the whole nine yards. Finished in one 
                    month.

      Thorpe involuntarily draws in a breath at this. Darrow 
      becomes aware of Thorpe's gaze, shoots him a wide if almost 
      childish smile as he exits.                                  THORPE
                    One month? I'm going to enjoy this war.

      Thorpe exits and his assistant picks up both of Thorpe's' 
      alligator Hermes attache cases.


      As George walks ahead, towards their car, Sikes and Buck 
      share a beat of silence.

                                  BUCK
                    Sorry for the trouble I caused you, Mr. 
                    Sikes.

      Sikes extends a hand, smiles.

                                  SIKES
                    Matt.

      Buck takes Sikes' hand, they shake.

      HONK! HONK!

      Susan is at the wheel of the family station wagon and 
      George comes back around, cool, still embarrassed, unable 
      to deal with the entire spectacle.

      Buck and George pass one another, silent, unable to speak. 
      This is noticed by Sikes who waves to Buck as they drive 
      off.

      Sikes puts an arm on George's shoulder.

                                  SIKES
                    I'm buying ...


      As George crosses from the curb towards the front door, 
      nearly trips over one of Emily's skates which he picks up, 
      smiles, "kids."

                                  GEORGE
                    Emily, Emily ...

      Carries the skate through the front door.


      as several patrol cars come to a SCREECHING halt in front 
      of the building, officers rush from the cars, passing:

      ALBERT, who has paused up the block, a hundred feet, as he 
      was on his way in to talk to:

      RAPPER JACK, young, black, porkpie hat, mirrored shades, 
      gold chains, untied Reeboks, a tattered deck of cards 
      resting on an upturned box, fast hands, a 3-card Monte 
      artist who talks in lumbering rap jargon that doesn't jive.

                                  RAPPER JACK
                            (rhyming slang)
                    Yo, my man don be shy, Step up to Rappa-
                    Jack - just say hi, Find the black ace, an 
                    bust my case.

      Rapper Jack shuffles faster and faster, stops, Albert, 
      points, wins. Rapper Jack GROANS.

                                  RAPPER JACK
                    Makes me cry on his very first try.
                    Practice is over. Got some green, muffin-
                    head?

      Albert takes out a pile of bills, innocent to the 
      lascivious look it draws from Rapper Jack.

                                  ALBERT
                    I got paid today-

                                  RAPPER JACK
                    Lay it down, and make me frown.

      Rapper Jack nods, shuffles, stops, Albert picks. Loses. 
      Rapper Jack shows him the Ace of Spades, scoops up Albert's 
      money.

                                  RAPPER JACK
                    Mess with the bess, die like the ress ...

      SERGEANT DOBBS rounds the corner, on his way to the 
      precinct. Rapper Jack's cards vanish.                                  DOBBS
                    What is this?

                                  RAPPER JACK
                      Reagan-omics.

                                  ALBERT
                    Thank you for letting me play, Mr. Rapper 
                    Jack.

      Rapper Jack and his shill manage quick smiles.

                                  DOBBS
                    Play? You played with these scam artists?!

      Albert concedes this, Rapper Jack and shill bolt.

                                  ALBERT
                    And I lost, but they did promise I could 
                    play next payday. I think I've got the hang 
                    of gambling.

      Sergeant Dobbs rolls his eyes, casts a final look down the 
      street at the quickly retreating figures of Rapper Jack and 
      his shill, Dobbs walks Albert into the station house.


      as George comes down the steps, wrapping a towel around his 
      bloody hand, comes over to Captain Grazer who is climbing 
      into his car.

                                  GRAZER
                    That wasn't like you, Francisco. You're off 
                    active.

      George is stunned.

                                  GEORGE
                    But Captain, it wasn't my fault

                                  GRAZER
                    I'm not interested in explanations, just 
                    results. This is for your own good. You're 
                    too close to this case. It's personal. The 
                      inter-species thing could blow up in our 
                    far-, on this one. I don't you on the 
                    street seeing red.

                                  GEORGE
                    Captain, please

                                    CAPTAIN
                    It's an order, Francisco. It's regulations. 
                    It's for the best. Go home. Let us do our 
                    job.

      Grazer gets into his car.

                                  GEORGE
                            (blurts)
                    Do you believe the same men who make Slag 
                                  (MORE)                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    jokes are the same men to find my 
                      daughter?!

                                  GRAZER
                    Yes I do. Because when we put on these 
                    badges, we're not black, not white, yellow, 
                    green or blue we're cops.

                                  GEORGE
                    ...Cops.

                                  GRAZER
                    Cops, and that cuts across all lines ...

      Grazer drives out. George watches him leave. Down the steps 
      comes Sikes feeling his bruised jaw.

                                  SIKES
                    Is that what you call "chilled out?!"

                                  GEORGE
                    Grazer says I'm too personally involved, 
                    that it's regulation.

                                  SIKES
                    What is?

                                  GEORGE
                    He took me off the case!

      Sikes watches the captain's car drive off.


      Sikes exits, pulls his gun, looks about. Houses, trees, 
      darkness, it's the normalcy, the absence of activity that 
      motivates the tension here. Sikes cautiously approaches the 
      mailbox, touches an ear to it as if listening for a bomb, 
      hears nothing, pulls a stick from a nearby pile of leaves 
      and brush, flattens himself on the ground, slowly pulls 
      open the mailbox expecting an explosion and ... nothing. 
      Sikes quietly approaches the mailbox, inserts the stick, 
      curious, feels something, slides it out.

      A NEWCOMER BARBIE with an 8mm video-cassette taped around

      TV SCREEN - MOMENTS LATER

      Static, leader at the head of the tape, the set flashes 
      them several color and tint changes.

      Buck steps into frame, tries to manually adjust the color, 
      contrasts, etc.

                                  BUCK
                    It's locked in.

      Sikes, George, Susan, Moodri, Buck are in the family room, 
      watching TV as on the screen:      From the shadows there steps a hooded figure with the 
      PURIST SYMBOL on his grand wizard-like gown, the figure 
      LAUGHS.

                                  PURIST
                    Hello Slags and Slag lovers.

      The hooded figure lights a torch, casting illumination on 
      two more hooded figures flanking a chair holding Emily.

      Susan reacts.

                                  SUSAN
                    My baby!

      George comforts Susan, who begins to CRY.
                    Emily looks directly at the camera.

                                  EMILY
                    I'm okay. They haven't hurt me. They said 
                    for you to listen real good and...

      The main hooded figure gestures and a second hooded figure 
      clamps a hand over Emily's mouth.

                                  PURIST
                    Let's talk deal. Release Mrs. Brett from 
                    jail within 24 hours and we spring the 
                    little Slag. Jerk us around and we sell her 
                    for spare graft parts.

      Sikes leans back. For him the second shoe just fell.

      Hooded figure gestures, camera swings to:

      EMILY

      who though dirty, and scared, is courageous.

                                  EMILY
                    Don't worry, Mom, and take special care of 
                    my pet, Beedoes.

      The screen goes to static ... and a WHINING NOISE becomes 
      audible.                                  SUSAN
                    Who is Mrs. Brett?

                                  SIKES
                      A homegrown looney.

                                  BUCK
                    The leader of the Purist movement.

                                  GEORGE
                      Twenty-four hours. Ten P.M. tomorrow night. 
                    Where is she being held?

                                  SUSAN
                    It won't work. Their demand is impossible 
                    to grant, George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, do you realize what you're saying?

                                  SIKES
                    Susan's right, George. You know the drill. 
                    No deals with the kidnappers or terrorists.

                                  GEORGE
                    If we don't deal Emily dies.

      Susan understands, takes George's hand.

                                  MOODRI
                    In these matters there is no bargain to be 
                    made, no truce struck with evil.

      George turns to Sikes, who picks up the phone.

                                  SIKES
                    Operator, get me nine-one-one.

      The DOORBELL RINGS, Buck opens the door.

      THE PRINT TEAM, which consists of a chain-smoking, fast-
      talking pair of experts, dog-eared, perpetually tired, have 
      seen it all and then some kind of guys named "NICOTINE" 
      ROBERTS and PARKER. They are like an oldmarried couple 
      constantly bickering, at odds, and finishing each other's 
      thoughts.                                  NICOTINE
                    No. We're not with the census bureau. We're 
                    here to dust for prints, - er - Newcomer 
                    skin flakes, in the kids room.

      They enter, led by Buck. George sags onto the stairs, 
      cradles his head in his hand, desperate.


      Tall rusted buildings, piles of iron tailings, broken 
      windows, a faint light from within.      A checkers, a chess set, a tic-tac-toe all lined up.

      A small hand enters frame to win the chess game.

                                  EMILY
                      Checkmate.

      A Purist wearing a WOLF MASK shakes his head in amazement, 
      looks at the accomplices wearing a RABBIT, and FROG MASKS, 
      respectively.

                                  EMILY
                    Sorry.

      Rabbit, Wolf, Frog having been playing her at various games 
      being soundly trounced..

                                  EMILY
                    Excuse me, but how much longer must I stay 
                    here?

                                  WOLF
                    Depends how long it takes to trade you for 
                    our friend. By tomorrow at this time all of 
                    this turns into a bad dream.

                                  EMILY
                    I'd like to believe you...

      Emily triple jumps, wins the checkers game.

                                  WOLF
                    Well, thank you....-

                                  EMILY
                    But statistically speaking, kidnapping for 
                    ransom or a bargain toot has historically 
                    proven to be counterproductive.

      Rabbit and Frog look at one another as this little tidbit 
      of information sinks through, Emily wins the tic-tac-toe 
      game.

                                  WOLF
                    Button it, Slag!

      Emily jumps at the sudden assault as Wolf goes over to 
      huddle with Frog and Rabbit who are shaking their heads,       pointing to their watches and nodding to Emily whose eyes 
      mist with tears.

                                  EMILY
                          (to herself)
                    I must not cry. I cannot cry. I will not 
                    cry.


      as George walks the deserted streets of a dangerous 
      neighborhood, passes a bank clock that reads: 1:00 A.M. 
      Hustlers, street people, homeless, all of whom motion and 
      gesture at him as he comes to:

      A NEWCOMER SHRINE

      A small steel facade with the sign "OBJECTIVITY RETREAT", 
      the Newcomer version of a Christian Science Reading Room 
      where he sees:

      A SALVATION ARMY NEWCOMER

      passing out sandwiches to the poor and plastic bags of 
      bloody beaver. George declines, enters.


      as we arm down past an old neon clock that reads 4:30 A.M., 
      passing a stark Purist graffiti sign, "welcome to Earth - 
      now go home."

      A dark sedan pulls into the alley, from the sedan steps 
      Sikes,' who cautiously makes his way towards the basement 
      door with the Purist emblems splashed on it in day-glo 
      colors.

      Sikes looks about, KNOCKS TWICE on the iron door, a man 
      with a mission.

      A peephole zips open, raucous MUSIC and LAUGHTER are much 
      in evidence, a mean FACE fills the peephole.

                                  FACE
                    Get lost!

      ZIP! Peephole is closed. Sikes takes a hundred dollar bill 
      from his pocket, KNOCKS again, mean face again appears. 
      Sees the bill, an arm reaches out. Sikes seizes the arm. 
      Twists it. The bouncer SCREAMS, opens the door inwards.

      Sikes smiles sweetly as the bouncer tries to pull his 
      damaged arm from the peephole.


      The rides are idle, a lone NIGHT WATCHMAN strolls the 
      playground. George pulls up in his family station wagon.


      as Albert comes down the steps, WHISTLES to himself, gets a 
      half block and hears:

                                    A VOICE
                            (OS)
                    Yo, Gumby.

      Albert turns, blinks and sees Rapper Jack and his shill... 
      and the cards, looks at Dobbs twenty dollar bill.


      as George, beside a Mobile station, digital clock reads 10 
      A.M., is filling his car up at the pump, talking into the 
      walkie-talkie, exhausted as from within the car comes:

      CHEEP! Lower, more emphatic.

                                  GEORGE
                    Thank you. Keep me posted if there's 
                    anything I can do.

      George places the walkie-talkie on the pump as he takes out 
      his wallet, hands the attendant some bills, gets into his 
      car.


      One car, old, dented, bondo marks, sits outside the rusted 
      building.


      as George's car comes off the ramp in the Harbor district, 
      piers, warehouses, old buildings.


      George's car rounds the turn, comes to a halt across from 
      the only building in view.


      as George watches the car drive away, crosses the street, 
      walks to the old, rusted door, takes out his revolver. 
      CHEEP! CHEEP!

      Beedoes pokes out of his pocket, scares George who twists 
      off the rusty padlock, enters ...


                                      END ACT III                                        ACT IV


      deserted, dark, ominous, one open door, the door George 
      entered.


      Buck comes to a screeching halt outside a deserted phone 
      booth. Susan gives him change and he charges into the phone 
      booth.                                  WINO
                    Hey!

      Buck nearly jumps ten feet.

                                  BUCK
                    Sir, I need that phone!

      The Wino takes another gulp from his bottle.

                                  WINO
                    Beat it, Slag.

      Buck ignores the Wino's tone, reaches into the booth, takes 
      the headset off the receiver and it promptly falls in two 
      pieces, broken.

      Buck runs back to the car.

      The Wino CACKLES, amused, empties his Thunderbird, hurls 
      the bottle away... it shatters.


      as the black OWNER is pulling down the riot guards over his 
      windows, locking the pumps, putting out a "closed" sign.

      Buck and Susan SCREECH into the station, Buck jumps out, 
      comes running over to the owner who is feeding a mangy 
      looking dog on a chain who SNARLS at Buck.

      BUCK Sir, could I use a phone, it's urgent!

                                  OWNER
                    Closed.

                                  BUCK
                    But it's life or death!

                                  OWNER
                    Always is! You see that sign?

      Buck falls silent and nods.

                                  OWNER
                            (continued)
                    Now get out of here.

      SUSAN

      steps from the car and:

                                  SUSAN
                    Sir, I'm sure you can appreciate that 
                    sometimes events occur, events you can't 
                    foresee and

                                  OWNER
                    Yeah. So?

                                  SUSAN
                    So we will pay you for any Inconvenience, 
                    but we have to call the police and -

      The Owner cowers at the word "police", wants no part of it.                                  OWNER
                    Don't want no police around, don't want you 
                    around, lump, now slide and take your 
                    squeeze with you. Before I sic my dogs on 
                    you!

      Buck grows angry, reigns himself as they return to the car.

                                  SUSAN
                          (to Owner)
                    Thank you.
                          (to Buck)
                    Come on Buck.

      Susan and Buck drive off.


        A MOTORCYCLE COP checking licenses on parked cars, comes 
      upon the Purists' car.. COP double checks the license 
      plate, sees:

      "NEON", a steel facaded biker bar across the curb. The Cop 
      radios the address.


      A police car stopped at a light, inside are TWO VETERANS 
      listening to a Dodgers game as:

      SCREECH!

      Buck rounds the corner, stops fast. The two Cops turn, look 
      at Buck like "are you serious?"

                                  COP
                    License and registration, conehead.

      Susan leans across Buck, angry now.

                                  SUSAN
                    How dare you talk to my son like that? I am 
                    Susan Francisco, wife of Detective George 
                      Francisco, a fellow officer, who is in 
                    trouble rescuing our kidnapped daughter and 
                    he needs backup. After you both finish 
                    radioing them a code two, get to Pacific 
                      Ironworks, I want your badge numbers!

      Cops blink, "do you believe this broad?" read their 
        expressions.


      as the assembled cops, SWAT Team, Susan and Buck dive for 
      cover as the explosion sounds, windows blow out.

                                  SUSAN
                            (big)
                    Emily!

      Cops peer Lip, restrain Susan, slowly advance.


      as Sikes, dirty, catches the newspaper from the delivery 
      boy, reads the headline, "Kidnappers Foiled", smiles to
