A HUSBAND and his WIFE. He has suitcases by the front door.
WIFE
You'll never get away with this.
I'll sue you down to your last penny.
HUSBAND
Good luck - I transferred everything
we own into private accounts, where
you can't touch it. In fact, as of
now, you're broke.
WIFE
But...why?
HUSBAND
I've fallen in love with another
woman. A younger woman. Prettier,
with no cellulite. Actually, I think
you'd like her.
WIFE
You bastard.
The IMAGE FREEZES. Dave walks into the room.
DAVE
Now clearly, this woman is dealing
with a Man.

saw. Guys are more like this:
CUT TO:
A DIFFERENT HUSBAND sits across from his WIFE. Above and
behind her is a TV with SportsCenter on.
WIFE
I just want you to know, I've thought
about this a lot.
GUY HUSBAND
Mm.
WIFE
And I've talked it over with everyone
I know.
GUY HUSBAND
(NODS)
Good.
She looks down; stirs her soda.
WIFE
So there's nothing left to do now,
but leave you, forever, and only see
you from across a shiny conference
table with bloodthirsty lawyers all
around it.
GUY HUSBAND
(a beat; turns to her)
-- Okay.
WIFE
"Okay?" That's all you have to say?
(then watching him)
Well then I guess this is it.
She pushes back from the table, starts off.
GUY HUSBAND
Wait a minute.
(THEN)
This can't be happening...
The words she's waited for. She turns, relieved.
GUY HUSBAND
(to the tv)
How can you dQ that? How can you
trade Lupenza?
(then to the BARTENDER)
What's the matter with these people?
BARTENDER
Beats me. I saw this on the eight
o'clock.
GUY HUSBAND
He's the backbone of the whole team!
They're pikers without Lupenza!
WIFE
I'll see you in court.
GUY HUSBAND
-- I gotta call Lenny.
He takes out his cell phone. She levels a look.
WIFE
Maybe you should call your lawyer
too.
GUY HUSBAND
If he could hit left-handed pitching,
I would.
(THEN)
Lenny. Pick up -- the Yankees got
Lupenza!
The IMAGE FREEZES.
CUT TO:
A young, pretty, single SECRETARY.
SECRETARY
Let me put it this way. Everyone I
ever dated was a male. I mean they
were all men. But only some of them
were guys. You know?
DAVE (O.S.)
I see.
SECRETARY
(thinks about it)
-- The guys were funnier. But the
men were more responsible. You could
almost half-believe them when they
told you something sometimes.
DAVE (O.S.)
So, if you were to meet someone that
was funny and responsible...
SECRETARY
That would be a woman.
CUT TO:
ELAINE works at a window desk. ROGER watches NFL on FOX.
JOHN MADDEN

Oh man you gotta show that again
Shepauses; chews her pen...
ELAINE
Roger...I think I really love you.

ELAINE (CONT'D)
(looks over there)
But I can't bear the uncertainty
anymore, of where this relationship
is going.
Roger turns...
ELAINE
I'm not asking whether you want to
get married. Only whether you believe
that we have some kind of a future
together. That you, and I - have a
future.
JOHN MADDEN
Now this is just what you want in a
playoff game. You got snow, you got
mud, you got a lead that keeps
changing, you got two great teams
that just hate each other to the
bone and would rather die than give
up...
Roger looks...then takes the REMOTE and TURNS OFF THE TV -
waving Elaine over, who cuddles into him.
ROGER
I've been thinking too, Elaine. And
for the first time in my life, I'm
feeling like I might really be close
to a lasting commitment. I haven't
said anything up until now because
it's always been important to me
that I not mislead you. But yes,
Elaine. I want to think that we dQ
have a future. And with a little
more time, I think I could be sure.
ELAINE
Oh, Roger...
He smiles. Strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer.
They share a long deep sigh together, As the PICTURE FREEZES
and DAVE WALKS IN.
DAVE
If this was how you responded, you're
not a guy. You may not even exist.
(then taking the remote)
On the other hand...

ROGER AND ELAINE DIGITALLY REWIND BACK TO THEIR EARLIER
POSITIONS. DAVE RESTARTS THE ACTION AS ELAINE IS SAYING --

I'm not asking whether you want to
get married. Only whether you believe

together. That you, and I - have a
future.

What.
FREEZE on her look, and --

If that was you...you're a guy.
CUT TO:
SHERYL CROW talks to the CAMERA before going onstage. The
muffled SOUNDS of the warmup band O.S.
SHERYL CROW
Well there were always guys at my
shows - right from the beginning. I
mean you start out playing beer halls,
right? So when you have beer, you
have guys. And it sorta just grew
from there. But I was okay with it.
They didn't cause much trouble.
DAVE (O.S.)
And what about men.
SHERYL CROW
Men cause trouble.
(THEN)
But that's okay too. I get half my
songs from that.
DAVE (O.S.)
So it all works out.

SHERYL CROW
Long as they buy the records...
CUT TO:
Dave walks along the stacks in the ANTHROPOLOGY SECTION.
DAVE
So where did this all start? Many
experts now think they know where
men came from, but what about Guys?
where did they come from?
He stops, peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things.
DAVE
To answer this question accurately,
we might have to look something up.
So instead we'll travel back to
prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and
get there just in time for the Dawn

Please don't tell me you got rid of
your jagged rock slab.
PRIMATE ROGER
But these are great!
PRIMATE ELAINE
But you didn't kill anything.
PRIMATE ROGER
Nobody's going with jagged slabs
anymore.
PRIMATE ELAINE
But the kids are hungry.
PRIMATE ROGER
What about your pounded roots?
PRIMATE ELAINE
Pounded roots are a side dish. They
need balance in their diets.

And another thing - suppose you do
start bringing animals home using
this -- who's going to skin and clean
them?
He looks at her-the SOUND of TOMORROW'S ROOSTER CROWING as

Five hundred dollars?

It can hold a thousand addresses.
ELAINE
So can my address book.
ROGER
Can your address book pick up your
em-ail?
ELAINE
No but my computer can.
ROGER
Well this can do both.
ELAINE
For five hundred dollars it should
give me a manicure, Roger! It should
drive me home from work at night!
HOW could you spend that kind of
money without discussing it first?
On Roger's look...the PICTURE FREEZES. Dave walks in.

There's a whole list of things a guy
is supposed to discuss first.
Unfortunately, he never knows what

BURGER KING DAD
Stop punching!
BURGER KING KID
We're not punching!
BURGER KING DAD
You are too punching - now stop! We
didn't come here to punch!

They stop; look at him as if he's crazy. Then one of them
notices ROGER AT 8 looking O.S.
BURGER KING KID
Hey Roger's got a girlfriend.
ROGER AT 8
I do not!
BURGER KING KID
Then what're you looking at!
ROGER AT 8
Nothing!
And they start punching again. The Dad looks up - so weary...
DAVE
(AT COUNTER)
Here we can see where even at an
early age, guy behavior is already
well developed along complex patterns
that social scientists have called,
"jerks." While girls at the same
age are referred to by the same social
scientists, as "human beings."
ANGLE ON A TABLE FULL OF GIRLS - INCLUDING ELAINE AT AGE 8
They are all chatting nicely, passing out napkins and ketchup
packets making sure everyone has what they need. While the
MOTHER that brought them quietly reads a novel.
DAVE
See? Humans.
He walks past with his takeout order. As ELAINE at 8 notices
Roger, blushing, taking all this punishment because of her.

DAVE
Where are we in the area of Guy
Violence, Doctor.
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
Well first, one must understand the
inherent differences in DNA and cell
structure as relates to men and women.
(CLICKING SLIDES)
For example, all women have a gene
that makes them have the need for
meaningful conversations. Likewise,
all men have a gene in them that we
scientists believe is directly related
to violence.
DAVE
And what can be done about that.
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
well, some of my esteemed colleagues
are quite keen on the idea of
tampering with the DNA itself - an
idea with which I heartily disagree.
The bastards...
DAVE
Then what would you recommend.
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
Me? Well they can start by spreading
out the funding a little bit. Let a
few other scientists wet their beaks.
I mean what's the point of rewarding
the same tired old hacks, year after
YEAR --
DAVE
I meant about Guy Violence.
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
OH --
(then shifting back)
Well nothing, really. I mean, what
can you do. Short of lobotomizing
them, anyway. No I suppose we'll
just have to continue to channel
their aggression into socially
acceptable outlets. Like professional
wrestling, or the space program.
DAVE
I see. Can I ask you a question?

SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
Certainly.
DAVE
Where'd you get that laser pointer.
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
It's mine.

So when we see guys like Ed, and his
fireworks - or guys shooting marine

We should not assume these are just
pointless juvenile activities.
Instead we should be convinced they
are, and move on to Guys in the
Workplace.

Roger is slumped across the back seat; messed-up clothes and

You want to tell this?
ROGER
Its just a sprain.
ELAINE
(shakes her head)
I get on the phone and they say he's
okay - but maybe I should come down
to the paper and get him. Does he
look okay?
ROGER
It's a sprain. It just looks worse.
ELAINE
Not the way I heard it.

Why would there be an article about

ELAINE
I'm just saying. I don't see the

ROGER
So?
ELAINE
So no one gets hurt writing sonnets.

It's a sprain.

Roger listens more agitated as the argument mounts.
GENE
When did you last run the forty?
PATRICK
Hey. I could beat you in the forty
running backwards.

TOM
You couldn't even beat your butt
running backwards.
ROGER
(from his desk)
Will you guys cut it out?
They stop. Look at him.
ROGER
The kid in the story's in high school.
You're not. You're supposed to be
adults and you're bragging about who
can beat who in a stupid footrace.
TOM
No one's bragging.

She turns to the CAMERA.

British, white coat, stethoscope.
DOCTOR
Here's why.
He holds up a RUBBER GLOVE. Dangles it harmlessly.

KARLA E
You mean they have them?
MIA
Or they have them and don't
acknowledge them.
LILA
Or they don't think that others have
them.
SIDRA
Or they just don't think.
DAVE
(as they agree on
THAT)
-- Is it possible that they do have
feelings, they do acknowledge them
and they do know others have them -
but they just don't express it the
same way?
Four blank faces look at him. Then.
KARLA E
Sports. They have feelings about
sports.
LILA
And their underwear.
(POLLS THEM)
You ever try and throw out their
underwear?
MIA
Once. I nearly lost my life.
SIDRA
They act like it's so sacred. I've
seen pairs of briefs with holes in
them larger than the leg holes.
(as the others nod)
I tried to throw a pair out once?
And sneak it past him? He went out
into the garbage and found them. He
said he couldn't trust me after that.
KARLA E
Tell me what that's all about.
SIDRA
I don't even want to think about it.

So you agree then, that guys at least
have feelings.

Elaine and Kelly with magazines and writing pads.
ELAINE
Well I don't know. How do you think
she feels about getting older?
34
KELLY
I don't know... I know how I felt.
How did you feel about it?
ELAINE
How does anybody feel.
KELLY
(NODS)
So you think she'll want a smaller
gathering?
ELAINE
Well if we go that way, we know who
to invite.
KELLY
But then who do we not invite.
ELAINE
Exactly. And how are they going to
feel about that.
KELLY
So maybe we should make it a slightly
larger gathering.
ELAINE
-- Depends on the food, I guess. I
mean, if we go with a larger
gathering...
KELLY
Exactly.
ELAINE
(finds the right
MAGAZINE)
I saw something earlier in here about
low-fat hors d'oeuvres.
KELLY
Oh - I've seen that one too.
They open to the article, scanning it.
ELAINE
Hmm.
KELLY
Hmm.

ELAINE
You thinking what I'm thinking?
KELLY
That if we have low fat hors d'oeuvres
she'll think we noticed she's gaining
weight?
ELAINE
Exactly.
KELLY
(CONSIDERS THAT)
Maybe just blow it out, you know? I
mean it's a party. Go with the high
fat.
ELAINE
Thinking she won't think we've noticed
the weight gain.
KELLY
Unless she thinks that's insensitive.
You know, that we hadn't noticed...
ELAINE
Hmm...
They close the magazine, look through the others when:
KELLY
How about medium fat hors d'oeuvres?
ELAINE
And we could cut them into smaller
pieces?
KELLY

She could think we were being cheap.

Unless you get the turbo, then it's

No shit...Phil got a Porsche?

A few nights later, he asked her

ELAINE
Do you realize that, as of tonight,
we've been seeing each other for
exactly six months?
CAMERA HOLDS on her. She waits.
ELAINE'S INNER VOICE
Gee...I wonder if it bothers him
that I said that. Maybe he thinks
I'm trying to push him into some
kind of obligation that he doesn't
want, or isn't sure of. Maybe he's
been feeling confined enough by our
relationship as it is...
CAMERA PANS TO ROGER.
ROGER'S INNER VOICE
Six months...

CAMERA PANS TO ELAINE.
ELAINE'S INNER VOICE
He's worried.
(then thinking about
IT)
Well hey - you know? I'm not so
sure I want this kind of a
relationship either. Sometimes I
wish I had a little more space, so
I'd have time to think about whether
I really want us to keep going this
way. I mean, where are we going?
Are we just going to keep seeing
each other at this level of intimacy?
Are we heading toward marriage?
Toward children? Toward a lifetime
together? Am I ready for that level
of commitment? Do I really even
know this person?
CAMERA PANS TO ROGER.
ROGER'S INNER VOICE
So that means it was...let's see...
February when we started going out,
which was right after I had the car
at the dealer's, which means ... lemme
check the odometer...
(he looks down at it)
Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil
change here.
CAMERA PANS TO ELAINE. An OVAL IMAGE OF HER APPEARS in the
top corner of the screen; they watch him together.
ELAINE'S INNER VOICE
He's upset. I can see it on his
face.
ELAINE'S OVAL IMAGE
You know, maybe you're reading this
completely wrong - and he wants more
from the relationship.
ELAINE'S INNER VOICE
(CONSIDERS IT)
More intimacy...more commitment...
(AND THEN)
-- and maybe what's happening, is
he's sensing my reservations?
40
ELAINE'S OVAL IMAGE
Well don't bet the farm on it. But --
ELAINE'S INNER VOICE
-- And that's why he's so reluctant
to say anything about his own feelings -
he's afraid of being rejected...
CAMERA PANS TO ROGER.
ROGER'S INNER VOICE
And I'm gonna have them look at the
transmission again. I don't care
what those morons say, it's still
not shifting right. And they better
not try to blame it on the cold
weather this time. What cold weather?
It's eighty-seven degrees out, and
this thing is shifting like a goddam
garbage truck, and I paid those
incompetent lowlife bastards six
hundred dollars.
CAMERA PANS TO ELAINE.
ELAINE'S INNER VOICE
-- He's angry. And I don't blame
him. I'd be angry too. God, I feel
so guilty, putting him through this,
but I can't help the way I feel.
I'm just not sure.
ELAINE'S OVAL IMAGE
(TO ELAINE)
You know what your problem is? You're
too idealistic. You're waiting for
some knight to come riding up on his
white horse, when you're sitting
next to a perfectly good person, a
person you enjoy being with, a person
you truly do care about, a person
who seems to truly care about you.
A person who is in pain because of
this self-centered, schoolgirl fantasy
that you insist on clinging to.
CAMERA PANS TO ROGER. His OVAL IMAGE APPEARS; at the LOCAL
BAR with a beer in front of him and pool tables in b.g.
ROGER'S INNER VOICE
They'll probably say it's only a
ninety day warranty. That's exactly
what they're gonna say, the scumballs.

ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE
Let 'em say what they want. You
don't have to listen.
ELAINE
Roger?
ROGER'S INNER VOICE
You know you're right. They want a
warranty? I'll give them a goddam
warranty. I'll take their lousy
warranty and stick it right up their --
ELAINE
Roger.
ROGER
(STARTLED)
-- What?
ELAINE
Please don't torture yourself like
this. Maybe I should never have...
(BREAKING DOWN)
Oh God, I feel so...
ROGER
(looks over, alarmed)
WHAT --
She struggles to keep control. Her OVAL IMAGE disapproves.
ELAINE
I'm such a fool. I mean I know
there's no knight. I really know
that. It's silly. There's no knight,
and there's no horse.
ROGER
There's no horse?
He looks up; his OVAL IMAGE SHRUGS; gets up off the stool.
ELAINE
You think I'm a fool, don't you?
ROGER
(reacting to the Oval
ROGER)
-- no!
He looks over at her; not sure who he responded to...but it
appears he said the right thing anyway.
42.
ELAINE
It's just.. .well I need ...time, I
think. I think I need some time.
Roger looks up at his OVAL IMAGE: gone. He looks at Elaine.
ROGER
-- Time. Yes.
ELAINE
(moved, touches his
HAND)
Oh Roger, do you really feel that
way?
ROGER
What way?
ELAINE
About time. Do you feel that way
about time?
Roger looks confused. His OVAL IMAGE is off playing pool
now. He turns to Elaine; does his best to look decisive.
ROGER
Oh. Well. Yes. Yes I do, feel
that way. About time.
ELAINE
(MELTS)
Thank you, Roger.
ROGER
-- Thank you.
They smile. Look forward. He looks a little nervous. She
looks serene...

ROGER
Hey, Ref - look alive. Those guys

ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE

ROGER
Who, the Albanians or the Moroccans.
ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE
They both suck.
ROGER
I know.
He eats some more Doritos. But then suddenly-he pauses.
ROGER
I think I missed something back there.
ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE
Wait for the replay.

SHERYL CROW
I don't know - most of my songs are
about guys out of love.
DAVE
I see.
SHERYL CROW
Cause you know, a guy in love - a
guy who's where your friend's at,
anyway - they don't know where they
are. They're like an ant, standing
on a truck tire. They don't know
how they got there - all they know
is that's not where they were a minute
ago. But then they sort of get
vaguely okay with it, you know?
They start hangin' out there, they're
feelin' pretty good.
(THEN)
Until the thing starts moving.
DAVE
What happens then.
SHERYL CROW
Well then they get crushed.
Dave gulps. She shrugs.
SHERYL CROW
Rock and roll, my friend. Life in
the city.
CUT TO:
OLD MAN
November 8, 1960. The day John
Kennedy beat Nixon and won the White
House. That was the day I met her.
His WIFE turns, looks at him funny.
47
OLD MAN
It was close the whole way - it was
neck and neck by God. But then old
Kennedy Senior rode on in on that
big old pile of money of his, and
fixed the results in Illinois. And
that made all the difference.
Happiest day of my life, just about.
She watches him. The man is hopeless.
OLD MAN
I was walking away from a newspaper
stand, with my head buried in the
final edition. And I looked up, and
there she was.
(he looks over at his
WIFE)
You were wearing a yellow sun dress
and there was a smudge of makeup
just over your left eye.
He smiles at her. Gets a thin smile back.
OLD MAN
What.
OLD LADY
That wasn't me.
OLD MAN
Of course it was you. What are you
talking about?
OLD LADY
It was your first wife.
OLD MAN
Nonsense.
OLD LADY
(TO CAMERA)
We met in Sacramento. Eight and a
half years ago.
OLD MAN
Don't believe her.
OLD LADY
I've never owned a yellow sun dress
in my life. And even if I did, I
wouldn't be wearing it in November.
48.
OLD MAN
(off her look)
-- The point is, in 1960 an Irish
Catholic could be elected president
of this fine country, as long as his
father was a filthy rich rum-runner
with connections to the Mafia! And
when Nixon did get elected, he had
to quit!
His wife shakes her head.
CUT TO:
Kelly and Gene on the sofa.
KELLY
Well we didn't know each other. I
mean, of course we didn't - we hadn't
met yet. But we were both invited
to the same party, by different people
who we only knew marginally - only
the party got cancelled, and I guess
that's how marginal we were, because
no one told us. So we came in
different cars and found ourselves
at the same front door - with no one
home.
(then taking his hand)
So Gene asked me out to eat.
GENE
I was hungry.
KELLY
You were in love.
(then off his look)
You told me you loved me, that first
night!
GENE
I said I loved mashed potatoes.
KELLY
You were eating mashed potatoes.
You said you loved me. You said
because your name was Gene and mine
was Kelly, that that just proved it.
We were meant to be together.
49.
GENE
(off her look; then
TO CAMERA)
-- Does this have to go in the movie?
CUT TO:
Elaine and Roger are inside, looking at the front door.
ELAINE
What do you mean, it's 'supposed to
be that way.' It's stuck.
51
ROGER
It's basic physics, Elaine. Wood
expands. And then, later, it
contracts.
ELAINE
But we can't get out.
ROGER
Which also means other people can't
get in. That's part of the design -
it discourages burglars.
ELAINE
(looks at him)
The same way the toaster was designed
to discourage carbohydrate consumption
by bursting into flames?
ROGER
That was an outdoor toaster. It was
clearly not designed for indoor
situations.
The PICTURE FREEZES. DAVE steps in front, talks to CAMERA.
DAVE
I think it's obvious here, that Roger
has absolutely no idea what he's
talking about. But Guy Pride forces
him to keep acting like he does know,
for reasons I believe we've covered
in an earlier scene.
He nods his head over to the corner, where the CAMERA PANS
TO SEE HUDDLED VISIGOTHS, WAITING. Then BACK TO ROGER AND
ELAINE as the PICTURE UNFREEZES.
ELAINE
Okay. So now we have a broken water
heater and a stuck front door.
(CONTROLS HERSELF;
THEN)
I think it's time to call Steve.
ELAINE'S IMAGE FREEZES. Roger turns to the CAMERA.
52.
ROGER
"Steve."
CUT TO:
Elaine stands at the basement door. CLANGING down there.
ELAINE
Roger? Did you find anything?
INTERCUT WITH ROGER IN THE BASEMENT
He's in ankle deep water. Pokes a FLASHLIGHT into some of
the corners where the overhead bulb doesn't reach.
ROGER
Good news, honey! The basement's
level.
ELAINE
How can you tell?
ROGER
Because I know a well built floor
when I see one! We were right to
buy this house. Everything works
just the way it should!
53.
ELAINE
Except there's no hot water.
ROGER
(aiming the flashlight)
Sweetheart, don't you remember? The
power company talked about this.
ELAINE
How about calling Steve.
ROGER
(HATES THIS)
We'll call "Steve," when we have a
real problem. Okay?
(then more to himself)
A mouse gets the hiccups, you don't
have to call Steve every time.
ELAINE
(hears him whang
something down there)
But Roger you're such a good copy
editor. You don't have to be a good
repairman too! Honest!
ROGER
Okay I think I found it.
ELAINE
The problem?
ROGER
The water heater.
Elaine leans her head against the door jam.
CUT TO:
Roger waits at the counter. Talks to CAMERA.
55.
ROGER
Let me tell you something. If I had
a dollar for every time I heard
"Steve's" name, I could hire somebody
better than Steve, just to shake
things up. Get her one of these old
semi-retired guys - someone from the
pre-steroid days, with the hairy
shoulders, and the butt crack. They
won't be so quick to call him every
ten minutes.
The Clerk comes back. Hands over a 53-piece TOOL SET.
CLERK
Remember. Keep these away from
anything magnetic.
ROGER
(WINKS)
Got it.
He takes the tool kit from the Clerk and drops it. The Clerk
watches Roger chase down all the parts: what a dolt.
CUT TO:
Power's back on. Steve pulls the cover off the HVAC assembly.
Roger is sorting through the 53-piece tool set he bought and
has no idea what to do with.
STEVE
If you've got a minute, sir. I'd
like to show you something.
ROGER
(holds up tool kit)
Should I bring these?
STEVE
That won't be --
(then as all the parts
FALL OUT)
-- necessary.
57
ROGER
(LOOKS DOWN)
The latch broke.
STEVE
I can fix that.
Roger puts the tool kit down. Joins Steve.
STEVE
There's your problem right there.
(POINTS)
You got calcification in your pullet-
beam header grommets.
ROGER
I was afraid of that.
Steve looks at him. One of those sideways looks.
STEVE
What you gotta do is jack up your
laminate bolts and remove the
calcification on the stress points.
ROGER
(while Steve takes
SOME MEASUREMENTS)
Of course when he says "you," he
doesn't mean "me." I don't have jacks.
I don't have winches. And Steve has
got like fifty kinds of each, right
on his truck. If society collapsed,
the Steves of the world will be living
in nice sturdy shelters that they
built with their own hands, eating
food that they grew or caught. And
I'll be getting shredded to death by
wolverines.
STEVE
Here we go.
He reaches down. Pulls out a fuse assembly, holds it up.
58.
STEVE
Here we go. Back in business in no
time.
CUT TO:
Dave rides up front with Steve. Talks to CAMERA.
DAVE
Just because Steve can fix things,
doesn't mean he's shallow and doesn't
have any concerns. All guys have
concerns. Deep concerns.
STEVE
(LOOKS OVER)
You like SportsTalk? Mike the Moose?
DAVE
Hell yeah.
Steve gives him a look. Turns on the radio.
59.
CALLER
I'm just sayin' those owners better
never run into me. Because God help
'em, man.
MIKE THE MOOSE
-- and we'll pick up on that and
more, right after the news.
CALLER
I mean it, man.
CUT TO:
MIKE THE MOOSE flips a switch; turns to Dave.
MIKE THE MOOSE
Three months ago, the Marlins traded
a guy named Rufino Lupenza to the
Yankees, for some minor league players
and cash. I grant you it was a rotten
trade. I grant you the Yankees seem
to have this, this knack for making
brilliant deals year after year.
But three months?
(pops in a tape)
The Marlins are over it. The Yankees
are over it. The players and their
families are over it -- but just
check this out.
CALLER
(ON TAPE)
The guy was a workhorse! He filled
in wherever he was needed and he
never got hurt! And when he got
hurt, he played hurt.
MIKE THE MOOSE
(ON TAPE)
You know I got a post card from him
here at the station. He says they're
all doing fine: Lucita's got the
kids in their new school already and
they all seem happy. She even found
an Ecuadorean grocery she likes.
CALLER
Grocery -- the guy batted 340, from
both sides.
(MORE)
60.
CALLER (CONT'D)
His on-base percentage was in the
4's, with a rocket arm on defense
and an awareness of the field like
nobody's business. And they trade
him for minor leaguers? For untested,
greenhorn punks who can barely even --
MIKE THE MOOSE
(pauses the tape)
That guy's pretty normal.
He cues forward, plays. A GUY CALLER, fighting tears.
MIKE THE MOOSE
(ON RADIO)
You just have to move on, Stan.
CALLER
.I try to - I'm trying. But I
just can't make sense of this...
Mike the Moose stops the tape.
MIKE THE MOOSE
These are guys you wouldn't see crying
even at a funeral. Guys who can't
bring themselves to hug their own
children. And they're beside
themselves.
(shakes his head)
And all over a meaningless trade...
DAVE
Meaningless?
Mike the Moose looks at him.
CUT TO:
Roger and Gene are watching the KNICKS/HEAT game. Big bag
of Doritos between them.
TV ANNOUNCER
.seventy-seven per cent from the
line during the regular season, and
a red-hot eighty-three per cent during
the playoffs.
ROGER
Stop saying that!
61.
TV ANNOUNCER SIDEKICK
-- and in the fourth quarter of the
playoffs, that number is even higher --
GENE
Stop saying that!
TV ANNOUNCER
So they really picked the wrong guy
to foul, at this crucial point in
such a crucial game.
ROGER AND GENE
Stop saying that!
TV ANNOUNCER
He dribbles. He sets -- he dribbles
again...
Roger and Gene lean forward.
ROGER
Come on come on come on comeoncomeon --
GENE
Miss the shot miss the shot miss the
shot come on and miss the shot --
TV ANNOUNCER
-- and the Knicks call time out.
They lean back in their seats; breathe some relief.
CUT TO:
Elaine and Kelly are addressing INVITATIONS by hand. Dave
sits on the counter, listens in.
ELAINE
They don't know the players. The
players don't know them - yet they
idolize these people. They follow
them from team to team -- and they
know more about these teams than
they know about their own families.
They might not even know if they
have families.
KELLY
Not during the playoffs anyway.
62.
ELAINE
(amen to that; then)
And what gets me is, they think -
they really think - that whether a
team wins or loses or not depends on
how much they personally care about
them. Like if they don't care, the
team can't win.
DAVE
But that's true.
They look over - see him on the counter.
ELAINE
What's true.
DAVE
It's true that the level of concern
a guy shows for his team can affect
the outcome of the game.
(then off their looks)
I mean not just one guy - but lots
of guys. All the guys who care about
the team combined, if they really
care, can make a difference on the
scoreboard.
ELAINE
That's crazy.
KELLY
Who is he?
DAVE
(hops off the counter)
-- Follow me.
CUT TO:
Roger and Gene and the game are FROZEN IN PLACE. Dave stands
in the doorway with Elaine and Kelly.
DAVE
For the first time ever, through the
use of highly advanced technology,
we will be able to see the actual
Concern Rays emanating from the minds
of Roger and Gene, in their attempt
to affect the outcome of this upcoming -
and totally critical - foul shot.
63.
The PICTURE CHANGES as though a filter has been slipped over
the lens. Then we BEGIN TO SEE THE ACTUAL RAYS emanating
from Roger's and Gene's foreheads and traveling into the
screen. The rays are colored BLUE.
DAVE
These Concern Rays go straight into
the television screen where they
join the combined Concern Rays of
all the other guy fans watching this
game right now.
CUT TO:
A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES
Where all the CITIES representing major markets LIGHT UP and
FORM ARCS, like airline flight routes, connecting RED or
BLUE CONCERN RAYS from each city, and sending them to MIAMI.
DAVE
(in front of map)
Then the rays are transmitted to the
actual arena itself, all arriving at
the same moment regardless of any
geographic or time zone differences.
CUT TO:
Dave walks down a terminal corridor among hurrying PASSENGERS.
DAVE
If there's one thing women don't
know about when it comes to guys,
it's the public rest room problem.
And we're here to clear that up right
now.
He stops outside a MEN'S REST ROOM, which is currently closed
for maintenance.
DAVE
This room is a private hell for a
countless number of guys -- yet the
women in their lives are completely
in the dark about it.
(MORE)
65.
DAVE (CONT'D)
But before we go inside, let's talk
with a leading social scientist, so
that what we're about to show you
sounds a little more official.
CUT TO:
Dave is at the honor bar with the SAME BRITISH GUY. The
words "Leading Social Scientist" APPEAR under him this time.
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST
One has to understand that the act
of emptying one's bladder goes deep
to the very roots of masculinity.
It is an important territorial
statement that males are genetically
programmed to carry out.
DAVE
I see.
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST
In fact, many of my colleagues believe
the reason that dogs howl at the
moon is because they can't go up
there and urinate on it -- which is
not, however, a theory which I
embrace. But guess who gets all the
grant money every year. The
bastards...
He stares off into space. A bitter man.
DAVE
Um...you were saying?
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST
I didn't want this job. Twenty years,
in the social sciences? And what
was everybody else doing -- they
were getting laid. They were going
to bed with women. And what have I
been doing -- applying for matching
grants. And not getting them.
(MORE)
66.
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
Applying for any grants at all - and
not getting those either. Meanwhile
all the "cool dudes" are laughing!
CUT TO:
TECHNICIANS wearing headsets. Dave and John sit by a BANK
OF MONITORS. There's a TELESTRATOR for John.
JOHN MADDEN
Okay. Now this angle here, we're
outside the bathroom and the
maintenance guy's just about to open
it up.
We SEE THE AREA OUTSIDE THE MEN'S ROOM, WITH "CLOSED FOR
MAINTENANCE" SIGNS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. A JANITOR starts
removing the signs as a BUSINESS TRAVELER heads over.
DAVE
Here's our first candidate now --
INTERCUT WITH:
John diagrams the action, marking up the screen like a
football play while the action unfolds.
JOHN MADDEN
Okay now the leadoff guy, he's gonna
come in, he's gonna see the open
field and he's gonna swing wide right
to grab a spot against the wall.
He's got one flank covered this way
and for now he's feelin' pretty good --
and of course by doin' that, he's
also settin' the tone for everything
that happens after.
r . 68.
DAVE
What's the main thing we're looking
for, John. What does each individual
guy feel he needs to get out of this.
JOHN MADDEN
Well the crucial thing here, is makin'
sure there's no eye contact. I mean
none - zero. These guys'll look up,
they'll look down, they'll look
straight ahead -- but a guy would
rather have you poke both his eyes
out with burning hot fire tongs,
Dave, than to give the next guy over
a reason to think you might be lookin'
at him in a public bathroom. For
reasons that oughtta be pretty darn
obvious.
DAVE
Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy
Number Two --
The SECOND GUY comes in; John diagrams the call.
JOHN MADDEN
Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna
do is, he's gonna come in, see the
first guy in position along the wall
and right away he's gonna line up
wide on the opposite side. This is
a best case scenario here, something
both these guys can appreciate.
Plus they've opened up the middle
for the third guy --
The THIRD GUY comes in. John diagrams his path to the middle
urinal. The Guy goes there.
DAVE
What about eye contact in this
situation.
JOHN MADDEN
Well you're still not likely to
encounter any, but again if you do,
that's what that buffer zone on either
side of him's for. And all three of
'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have
it, I can tell you that.
DAVE
Okay. Now if things stay like this...
69.
JOHN MADDEN
If things stay like this, you're
fine - and if this were some small
commuter airport, y'know late at
night or somethin', then these guys
could possibly even be home free.
But we're talkin' Miami International
here, this is the big time, we're
talking about 747's, DC-10's, the
big jumbo jets dumpin' off three-
four hundred people at a clip. So
everybody's gonna be next to somebody,
which is the last thing any of these
guys want. You're in a critical
mass situation, and this is where a
lotta mistakes get made.
DAVE
Which brings us to Guy Number Four.
Here he comes --
JOHN MADDEN
-- and there he goes...
Guy #4 spins around and leaves. John and Dave watch; then.
DAVE
Now one thing that I know we're going
to get asked, John, especially from
women, is whether, as guys, we're
aware of how utterly stupid this
kind of behavior really is.
JOHN MADDEN
Well I think we know, Dave. Don't
you think we know?
DAVE
I think we do.
JOHN MADDEN
(NODS)
Have to be stupid not to.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "THE PUBLIC RESTROOM PROBLEM"
70.
DAVE (V.O.)
We did that.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "GUYS AT MIDLIFE"
A GUY IN A SUIT, alone in here. Faint ELEVATOR MUSIC plays.
ELEVATOR GUY
I got used to having the Beatles and
Stones called 'classic rock.' Then
I heard Elvis Costello on an Oldies
station. I figured, okay - who cares -
at least it's on somewhere. But
then I hear "London Calling," on
Muzak. By the Clash. On Muzak.
(SHRUGS)
But what the hell. I'm in a suit
and I go around all day explaining
peoples' 401K plans to them. And
Sting's doing commercials for Jaguar.
He shakes his head; it's hopeless.
CUT TO:
The BARBER talks while cutting Dave's hair.
71.
BARBER
The way I see it, it's like menopause,
right? Except men get it different.
It doesn't show, y'see? The cramps
don't come, the hot and cold flashes,
and you don't have your magazines
and drug stores filled with helpful
stuff to do about it. But something
comes, and it hits every guy who's
living whether he likes it or not.
Whether he knows it or not. Guy can
lose his bleepin' mind if he doesn't
watch out.
He gets a mirror to show Dave the back. Gives him time to
get philosophical.
BARBER
But you know? Maybe it's for the
better. Maybe whoever designed all
this, was afraid to let the men in
on what was gonna be happening.
Like if we knew, we'd bail or
something. You know, ahead of time.
CUT TO:
The BARTENDER wipes the bar down in front of Dave.
BARTENDER
I'm just telling you what I see.
Every lousy day. A guy'll come in
and sit down, right where you are.
He loosens up a little and then it
comes. The road not taken.
Unexamined choices. An unfulfilled
life. And other guys, they'll come
in and don't say a word. The ones
who just stare at the mirror.
DAVE
That sounds pretty bleak.
BARTENDER
(SHRUGS; THEN)
I think it goes back to the old times.
Ancient times, you know? When nobody
was expected to live past forty.
You got to forty? You died.
(MORE)
72.
BARTENDER (CONT'D)
But now that men aren't doing that,
there's a lot more shit up ahead,
and none of it looks good so they go
freak out and make a mess of things --
they'll quit their jobs or walk out
on their marriages or make some other
idiot grandstand move. None of them
are happy and every single one of
them wishes he did something else
with his life and can't figure out
how it got this way. Every single
one of them.
CUT TO:
A hotshot LAWYER is dictating a memo to his SECRETARY.
LAWYER
.therefore please be advised that
in reference to the aforementioned
subject matter, as per the original
agreement dated 7 March Two Thousand, --
His Secretary stops writing. Waits.
LAWYER

SECRETARY
Um. You said that already.
LAWYER
(shakes his head)
I started here on the 7th of March.
Fifteen years ago...
SECRETARY
Oh. Well - Happy Anni--
LAWYER
What the hell am I doing. Why did I
even think this would be a good idea --
to work my ass off every single day
of my life? So I could come in here
and dictate letters like this?
SECRETARY
They're not all like this. You do a
lot of good...
73
LAWYER
And what does it get me -- a twin-
turbo convertible that I don't even
get to drive, because I'm always
traveling and renting shitbox cars
in other cities where all I do is
take clients out to lunch and tell
them how to negotiate their golden
parachutes? You ever sit in the
driver's seat of one of those renta
cars?
SECRETARY
Well my husband usually does the --
LAWYER
Brand new cars, not even two thousand
miles on them, and already they drive
like camels. The seat's got no
cushion left already, and you're
lucky if you don't need a chiropractor
after twenty minutes in one. What
do people do in those things?
SECRETARY
Maybe I could get you something.
You want something?
LAWYER
Yeah. I want something. I want the
number of that hang-gliding place
out on Route 33.
SECRETARY
You want to go hang gliding?
LAWYER
I want to teach hang gliding.
SECRETARY
I'm sorry. I didn't know you did
that.
LAWYER
I don't do that. I want to do that.
I've always wanted to do that, and
lots of other things too -- only I'm
stuck doing this all day long. And
I don't even know what this is half
the time, just that I have to spend
every waking hour doing it. So you
tell me -- where the hell does hang
gliding fit into that.
74.
SECRETARY
Um. Saturdays?
LAWYER
Give me a break.
SECRETARY
(as he starts to leave)
Where are you going?
LAWYER
I should have done this a long time
ago.
SECRETARY
What about the letter?
LAWYER
Put in the usual bullshit. Nobody's
gonna read it anyway.
He's gone. She sits there.
CUT TO:
Johnny Lake waits on the examining table, holding ice against
his leg. The Lawyer sits on the extra chair reading EXOTIC
ISLANDS MAGAZINE.
76.
He holds up a PHOTO: a Guy in a hammock, in Paradise.
LAWYER
Look at this.
JOHNNY LAKE
You got that right.
The Lawyer shakes his head; flips the page.
JOHNNY LAKE
Hey.
(then on Lawyer's
look; he shrugs)
You don't think he's gonna...
LAWYER
What.
JOHNNY LAKE
You know. Have to use the --
LAWYER
Glove?
(then off his look)
You hurt your knee. He already took
the x-rays.
JOHNNY LAKE
What if something's broken.
LAWYER
Well he's not going in that way.
You don't do a rectal to set a guy's
leg.
Still the guy looks doubtful. The ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON -
British, familiar - comes in, with a fresh X-RAY.
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
Well you've done quite a number on
yourself. Want to see?
JOHNNY LAKE
Why should I. I wouldn't know what
the hell I'm looking at. You're the
one who went to medical school.
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
Don't remind me.
(then on their looks)
What. You think I like this?

ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON (CONT'D)

ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
Of courseIam - I'm an orthopedic
surgeon!Ijust don't like people
assumingit!
(THENASHIS BEEPER
GOESOFF)
And this -- I am so sick of this
bloody thing I can't even tell you!
Because every time it goes off it
means I have to stop doing one thing
I don't want to be doing, and start
doing another thing I don't want to
be doing. You call that a life?
They look at him. Don't know what to say.
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
-- Let me show you something.
(puts down the x-ray,
goes to a drawer)
I've been working on this during my
free time. Not like I get any.
He gets an accordion-style envelope; takes out a REAM OF
TYPED PAGES. Hands it over to Johnny Lake.
JOHNNY LAKE
What is it?
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
What is it? It's a screenplay!
This'll blow the lid off the
orthopedic surgery industry! Look -
look here --
(takes it back; flips
THROUGH)
-- no wait, this part's better. No --
here! Here you go. Read this and
tell me if you don't --
78.
He looks up. They're gone.
CUT TO:
Dave walks along all the COSMO'S, REDBOOKS, etc.
DAVE
Probably the fastest growing sector
of the U.S. economy is the sector
that conducts surveys asking women
(MORE)
DAVE (CONT'D)
what is wrong with men. And in all
those surveys, there is one main
area that shows up constantly at the
top of the charts.
(he stops, pulls a
MAGAZINE)
-- Euphemisms.
CUT TO:
Dave walks up the aisles filled with delectable things.
DAVE
when I say "euphemisms," I of course
am not suggesting that guys don't
have them. Guys have plenty of
euphemisms. Most guys have more
euphemisms in a single day - and
here I am thinking of a day that
occurred in the summer between ninth
and tenth grades - than some women
have in a lifetime - or longer, in
the case of certain Math Teachers.
CUT TO:
Dave walks past glassed-in DISPLAYS of CAVEMAN LIFE.
DAVE
Today, however, women want euphemisms
too -- and this ability in males is
no longer as prized as it once was.

DAVE (CONT'D)
In fact, when modern women describe
the qualities they're looking for in
the ideal man, the phrase "a real
fast shooter" is usually pretty far
down the list.
(THEN STOPPING)
Naturally, it fell to guys to do
something about this. So, naturally -
they did.
CUT TO:
They come in the room, shedding clothes. He lifts her,
carries her to the bed -- with nothing but pillows against
the wall. He stops, panicked...
GENE
There's nothing there!
CUT TO:
Roger and Elaine are under the sheets. Some good early
MOANING.. .as Dave comes in, holding a mike, interview style.
DAVE
One of the most time honored and
reliable mental delaying styles, is
the Baseball Method --
(taps Roger's shoulder)
-- how's it going, Champ.
Roger pokes his head out of the blanket; stays active from
the neck down.
ROGER
Oh - yeah hi.
(ACKNOWLEDGES CAMERA;
then to Dave)
Well, the baseball thing. I mean a
while ago I was into that - big time.
You know, fooling around with
different lineups, mixing up the
batting order - like thinking about
what would happen if you took your
cleanup guy and made him eighth or
something -- just something stupid
like that, you know? Stuff you'd
never really do.
DAVE
And that did the trick.
82.
ROGER
Oh hell yeah. I mean I could go all
night - literally all night - just
shuffling my pitching staff around,
or thinking about who I might try
and sign at the winter meetings.
Hang on --
He goes under the blanket; pays more attention to Elaine...
then comes back.
ROGER
The thing is, it got stale. And I
found after a while I wasn't enjoying
sex or baseball that much. And you
don't want to mess with that stuff.
DAVE
(CAN'T DISAGREE)
So what do you do instead?
ROGER
Math problems.
DAVE
Really?
(off his nod)
You mean like if a train leaves
Chicago at one o'clock and another
train leaves Denver at two o'clock
and they're going at different speeds?
ROGER
(shakes his head)
I can't do train ones. I always end
up imagining this beautiful girl on
the train - and it makes things even
worse.
Elaine stops. Pops her head out.
ELAINE
what beautiful girl.
ROGER
-- You, Elaine. The girl on the
train is always you.
ELAINE
Oh, Roger...
83.
Roger gives Dave a close call look...then goes back to work.
CUT TO:
Dave helps himself, makes a sandwich.
DAVE
As you can see, a lot of guys are
making a tremendous effort here -
and yet, according to certain
standards they are still, basically,
lame as hell on almost every single
count. The reason for this is simple:
women set the standards.
(takes a bite)
And not just bedroom standards --
all standards. Because women invented
standards. Remember the Dawn of Guys?
CUT TO:
Primate Elaine, picking up around the cave. She stumbles on
something gross... finally has had it.
PRIMATE ELAINE
(SUBTITLED)
That's it.
CUT TO:
Primate Roger watches Primate Elaine examine his NEW ROCK.
Her PRIMATE MOM AND DAD hover on the edge of the discussion.
PRIMATE ELAINE
I don't get it. What was wrong with
the other one.
PRIMATE ROGER
This one's better. It's an upgrade.
PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
What did he say it was called?
PRIMATE ROGER
An 'upgrade.' An improvement on a
previous design.
PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER
What? What'd he say?
PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
(to his wife)
An upgrade. An grade.
PRIMATE ROGER
(to Primate Elaine)
The guy said there are newer ones
coming out that'll make even this
one look primitive. They're getting
lighter and rounder every epoch.
87
PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
What guy.
PRIMATE ROGER
Primate Discount Manny.
PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
(MUTTERS)
Boy he must have seen this one
coming...
PRIMATE ELAINE
Dad.
(then to Primate Roger)
I just wanted to know what the
difference is between this one and
the one you had. You were so excited
about it when you got it, and now
you've gotten rid of it -- and the
only difference I can see is where
this one has these markings painted
on.
She holds it up; something like BASEBALL SEAMS going around.
PRIMATE ROGER
Those make it so it travels better.
PRIMATE ELAINE
Painted on?
(off his look)
-- What'd it cost you.
PRIMATE ROGER
Nothing. A couple wildebeeste steaks
and handful of seeds of some kind.
PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
I told you.
(then to his wife)
Did I say he was a bum?
PRIMATE ROGER
Who's a bum. Are you calling me a
bum?
PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER
No one's calling anyone a bum.
PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
I'm just visiting. You do what you
want.
88.
PRIMATE ROGER
Oh yeah? Who do you think killed
your dinner tonight?
PRIMATE ELAINE
Look. Just take it back. Please.
PRIMATE ROGER
But I can't do that! All sales are
final!
PRIMATE ELAINE
You can explain it to him. Tell him
he can keep the steaks, but we want
the seeds back.
PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER
(to Primate Roger)
I don't mean to meddle. But you
should listen to your wife.
PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
That's meddling! That's meddling!
(then to Primate Roger)
-- But in this case she's right.
PRIMATE ELAINE
(to her parents)
Look will you both stop?
(then to Primate Roger)
Just take this back. All right?
PRIMATE ROGER
This is totally unreasonable!
(THEN)
Oh I get it. Don't tell me -- it's
your time in the moon cycle again --
He stops cold. Stunned by her CERTAIN LOOK. History's first
in SLOW MOTION, FROM SEVERAL ANGLES, the way they do it when
buildings explode in much bigger movies.
PRIMATE ROGER
-- I'll take it back.
She smiles. FREEZE IMAGE.
CUT TO:
Dave goes up the escalator; walks through the kind of 'Home
Stylings' section where no other guy would go. Everything
he talks about is on display in some form.
DAVE
-- And there are thousands of
standards for domestic life, involving
even more totally un-guy concepts --
like curtains, bedspreads, napkins,
special hangers, little soaps shaped
like fruit, and decorative boxes
that hold tissues that already come
in a box. While guys, left on their
own in the wild, will develop
lifestyles that don't involve any of
these things.
CUT TO:
COLLEGE ROGER and COLLEGE GENE stand in their doorway. There
is one window, a lot of dust and nothing else.
COLLEGE GENE
I know just what this place needs.
COLLEGE ROGER
(NODS)
Hockey sticks.
They turn around to go buy hockey sticks.
CUT TO:
90.
A RABBIT on a lawn chair drinks beer out of an ashtray.
College Roger and College Gene play Indoor Death Hockey;
slamming into walls, scattering NEWSPAPERS and PIZZA BOXES -
as their IMAGE FREEZES.
DAVE
of course, even by the most basic
standards, these two are living like
savages. But they honestly don't
know this -- because Guys, in their
natural state, aren't any more aware
of domestic standards than a trout
would be aware of the stock market.
And this causes women a lot of
concern.
CUT TO:
Dave unloads a laundry basket on the bed. Starts folding
the clean clothes and making piles.
DAVE
Laundry's a big issue - and a deep
and puzzling mystery to guys. My
own wife Michelle, for instance, is
an accomplished sportswriter and
mother of an extremely young child,
yet she is still able to maintain a
vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen
bordering on the super-human. And
I'm not allowed near the stuff.
91.
MICHELLE
(comes in with more
CLOTHES)
He's right.
She dumps out the clothes, sees what he's doing and takes
over, doing it better. Dave picks up a random BLOUSE, shows
a LABEL with lots of printing on it.
DAVE
These are clearly secret codes, that
women intuitively understand but
cannot adequately explain -- just
like how a lot of guys understand
the Infield Fly Rule, without being
able to explain that.
MICHELLE
I can explain the Infield Fly Rule.
DAVE
Because you're special, Sweetheart.
