MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY
The Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns
and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.
The
sheer scope of it sinks in:
the blank slate of nature, the
absence of man.
On the screen superimpose:
MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.
CREDITS BEGIN.
A plume of dust comes into frame.
The dust is from a TRUCK,
orange and white and violet, with "FedEx" blazoned across the
side.
The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II
era Quonset huts and outbuildings.
Around the outbuildings
are large sculptures of wood and metal.
QUONSET HUT - DAY
The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.
Hair
pulled back, casual, an artist.
She hands the DRIVER a FedEx
BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS.
The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer
dangles from his belt.
The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer,
prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go.
But something on the box catches her eye.
She wants it back.
He glances at his watch.
She draws RINGS around the Wings,
uniting them.
She gives the box to the Driver, then hands
him a cup of coffee.
They've done this before.
He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.
He
jumps in and heads back onto the plains.
FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a
dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides.
A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the
container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt
of rollers onto a larger truck.
The doors of the truck
close.
The latch slams down.
A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.
MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT
The 737 lands.
SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
One of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737
taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.
The Hub is a vast
living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a
symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times.
Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected
activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.
Hundreds of
forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights
crisscrossing like a laser show.
Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.
MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT
A forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11.
CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY
SERIES OF SHOTS
The giant place touches down in Paris.
The Angel Wing Box
moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another
CONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE.
ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT
The plane lands.
The container is unloaded down a belt.
We
see our Angel Box.
Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX.
ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY
A FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.
The walls of the
warehouse are covered with graffiti.
The streets are slushy,
the buildings blanketed in snow.
ST. PETERSBURG - DAY
The Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.
He takes a last
sip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.
Walks slowly toward
an APARTMENT HOUSE.
ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
A beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.
A young
AMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes
the Angel Box.
We see Christmas decorations inside.
The
woman puts her arms around him as the door closes.
RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.)
(accented English)
It's pretty.
Who is it from?
AMERICAN MAN (O.S.)
My wife.
We stay with the Driver as he ambles back toward the truck.
ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
The Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI,
Russian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era
building.
Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone.
FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY
CHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly
colored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.
With him is a
Filipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.
Chuck
glistens with a thin layer of sweat.
CHUCK
My guess is we're talking fuel filters
here, Fernando.
The gas is dirty, these
jitneys get in the mountains, their
engines cut out.
FERNANDO
That could lose us half an hour.
CHUCK
Easy.
Each way.
His beeper goes off.
ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY
Christmas in Russia.
Snow everywhere.
Brightly colored
lights.
Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.
He has a
bag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm.
ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
A FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.
Chuck is
inside.
He notices the graffiti on the walls.
HOTEL - ST. PETERSBURG
A weary Chuck enters the hotel.
In the sky above him we see
the Northern Lights.
He doesn't even look up.
FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER
The last truck rolls in.
CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY
A FedEx MD-11 is being loaded with huge containers of

Chuck goes up the gangway next to the forklifts.
CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - NIGHT
The MD-11 takes off.
MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT - WIDE
The MD-11 arrives at its gate.
The cargo doors open.
Forklifts and a gangway roll up to the side.
CHICKASAW GARDENS - MEMPHIS - NIGHT
Chuck's car pulls into the driveway of a small cottage in an
older Memphis neighborhood.
The radio is playing the news.

spoon.
Drops the dead fish in.
Fills the hole.
MEMPHIS - NIGHT - LATER
Chuck drives in his car through the streets of Memphis.
UNIVERSITY - NIGHT
Chuck pulls up to a lab building at Memphis State.
FEDEX OFFICES - NEXT MORNING
A nondescript office park near the airport.
No sign.
Chuck's car screeches into the parking lot.
He jumps out,
glances at this watch, and heads for the building at a run.
KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATE THAT AFTERNOON
Chuck lugs a big package up to the door, knocks on it.
Kelly
opens the door.
KELLY
Merry Christmas eve.
CHUCK
Not if you work for FedEx.
KELLY'S HOUSE - HOUSE LATER
It's dark now.
Chuck returns.
The stars are putting on an
amazing show, but he doesn't notice as he heads for the door.
KELLY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
Holding Jango, Chuck walks out into the back yard.
CHUCK
Kelly?
A fire still smolders.
The packages have burned.
The tree
is a blackened mess.
Chuck stares at it.
CHUCK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
Chuck gets into his car, puts Jango on the front seat next to
him.
Pulls out of the driveway.
ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY
Chuck is in his car, with the dog on his lap.
FARM HOUSE - DAY
Chuck's car drives up to a typical Arkansas farm house.
His
MOM is setting some Christmas tree lights around the door.
Chuck gets out of the car.
There's a large wet spot on the
front of his pants.
MOM
What happened to your pants?
CHUCK
Mom, meet Jango.
Chuck displays the puppy.
FARM HOUSE - SHED - DAY
Chuck works on an old tractor in the shed.
Some small legs
appear in his vision, then a small face.
This is AMANDA, his
niece.
AMANDA
Dinner's ready.
FARM HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY
The children burst out the door, shrieking, chased by Jango.
MOM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY
Chuck fixes the drain pipe while Mom prunes the rose bushes
around the porch.
CHUCK
Maybe I should take a few days off.
Roger's working now, you could use some
help around here...
MOM
Don't you even think about it.
CHUCK
The place is falling apart.
MOM
I'm doing fine.
She looks pointedly at Chuck.
CHUCK
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
MOM
There's settled folks, and there's
nomads.
You're just not a settled folk.
You never belonged here.
Chuck finishes the drain pipe.
Gives it a thunk with his
finger.
CHUCK
Come on inside, Mom.
You've had a long
day.
FARM HOUSE - DAY
His mom waves to him as Chuck drives away.
CHUCK'S HOUSE - DAY
Chuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy
under his arm.
KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - MINUTES LATER
Kelly opens the door.
Chuck is there with the puppy.
KELLY
That's your dog.
CHUCK
It's our dog.
It belongs to us.
KELLY
There isn't any us.
CHUCK
Yes there is.
Kelly can't stay mad.
KELLY
I'm sorry about the presents.
I got a
little carried away.
CHUCK
No, it was great.
Maybe a little
overkill --
KELLY
I burned the Christmas tree.
She's half-laughing, half-wanting-to-cry.
KELLY
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me,
tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
CHUCK
I guess I hadn't thought through how I
felt.
KELLY
What, you were going to come over the
next day all calm and say, Kelly that
really made me mad?
Don't tell me you're
mad.
Be mad.
Be who you are right now.
CHUCK
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get
back.
KELLY
Don't even start.
And then it hits her.
KELLY
Get back?
From where?
CHUCK
Malaysia.
They're holding the sweep.
She stares at him for a long moment, then at the puppy.
KELLY
Give him to me.
He hands her the dog.
KELLY
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
CHUCK
A week, max.
Okay?
Okay?
KELLY
Go on.
We'll be fine.
I'll feed Jango
to the frogs.
She kisses the puppy.
FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT
The giant plane PLUMMETS down from the sky.
PACIFIC - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
The plane hits the ocean with a CRASH and a WAVE of water.
PACIFIC - NIGHT
Shrouded with fog and surrounded by debris, the tail of the
big plane slowly SINKS beneath the angry, storm-driven waves.
PACIFIC - DAY
A life raft is tossed on dark, storm-driven seas.
Inside it,
semi-conscious, Chuck hangs on.
PACIFIC - NIGHT
We catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the
storm continues.
BEACH - EARLY MORNING
The storm has ended.
Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a
scallop out of a rocky shore.
On the beach we see scattered
FEDEX BOXES.
And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a
MAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket.
Chuck.
The tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.
He chokes.
Slowly he gets to his knees.
Vomits seawater, big heaves.
He rolls over, sits down.
Dazed.
Still confused.
Where am
I?
What happened?
Chuck's first instinct is to check the time.
He looks at his
watch, taps it in frustration.
Then he looks around, and we look with him.
CHUCK'S POV - BEACH
The fog has thinned.
We can see palm groves and mangrove
thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing
up a steep, rocky hillside.
The rocks on the opposite point
end in a barren ridge.
Clouds hide the top of the hill.
ON CHUCK
as he takes in his surroundings.
He licks his lips.
He's
thirsty.
But something he sees is even more important.
We
stay with him as he WALKS.
He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in
the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther.
He picks up another package.
BEACH - WIDE
Chuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages,
leaving a trail of footprints in the sand.
Ahead of him we
notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS.
BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING
Chuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm
trees at the rim of the beach.
He examines the Angel Wing
drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack.
Chuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade,
makes himself comfortable, and waits.
BEACH - SUNSET
Chuck is still waiting.
He's a systems man, and the system
isn't working.
CHUCK
All right, guys.
I'm here.
Check the
GPS, get moving.
BEACH - NIGHT
The full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.
Trees
cast moon-shadows on the sand.
Chuck seems very, very alone.
We HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.
Rustling in
the leaves.
Something crashing in the trees, or is it a
wave?
A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.
He
lurches to his feet.
We HEAR the noises again.
Chuck edges toward the rocks at
the barb of the hook.
Keeping his eye on the thicket, he
bends down and picks up a stone.
His first weapon.
In the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.
He picks it up
in his other hand.
He backs between two rocks and stands
facing the thicket, every sense alert.
A cloud passes over
the moon.
The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face.
BEACH - MORNING
The morning TIDE is coming in.
We follow the tide as it laps
amidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.
The
empty sea.
CHUCK
Where the fuck are you?
But now he is really thirsty.
We WALK with Chuck up the
beach.
Beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.
He picks one
of them up and studies it.
It's heavy, almost the size of a
volleyball.
How to get in it?
He throws it down on a rock.
The coconut just bounces off.
He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock
down on it.
It bounces off.
He throws down a bigger rock.
It smashes on the rocks and chips.
Chuck picks up the rock.
OW!
Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.
It cuts
him.
CHUCK
Sonofabitch.
The blood stains the rock a bright red.
Chuck sucks on his
finger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man
first got when he discovered stone tools.
He picks up the rock, test the edge.
Sharp -- really sharp.
He throws another rock down, but it doesn't break.
He picks
up another rock and strikes the first one.
Then again,
harder.
And again.
A large flake shoots off.
This edge is
even sharper.
He has a knife.
OPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS
Chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.
No luck.
Chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock.
Chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut,
but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away.
Chuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then
SLAMS the coconut down hard on it.
Success!
The green nut
of the coconut splits.
The brown inner nut is free!
He
smashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!
-- he hits his hand!
Chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more
saliva.
He smashes again.
The shell breaks to smithereens.
Coconut milk splashes everywhere.
CHUCK
That was smart, really smart.
Rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his
fingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.
The shell
splits!
The precious liquid splashes out.
Left inside is a
swallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.
The milky white
liquid dribbles down his face.
CHUCK
Ahhh.
BEACH - SUNRISE
Chuck squints at the ocean.
His sunburn is bad -- his lips
are cracked.
A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him.
No one's there -- again.
CHUCK
Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.
That Korean
airliner did.
Clouds scud in front of the sun.
Beyond the reef the waves
are high and churning.
Chuck can see them pound onto the
reef.
CHUCK
Okay, do the math.
Maybe they know where
you are within, say 500 miles.
That's a
circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared.
So, uh, 250,000 times three point one
four, that's about 800,000 square miles.
Three times the size of Texas.
This sinks in.
Then Chuck gets an idea.
CHUCK
They could use a satellite.
But even that doesn't give him much hope.
CHUCK
Say each satellite photo is 30 feet
square, that's uh...fuck it...billions
and billions of photos.
That sinks in.
CHUCK
Aw, someone will come.
BEACH - NIGHT
Chuck sleeps by the coconuts.
The tide is coming in.
Chuck
stirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve
himself.
He stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.
Then not
so idly.
Something's out there, something floating on the
tide.
CHUCK
What the hell?
BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object.
It's a body.
Chuck turns it over.
It's Al, one of the
pilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead.
CHUCK
Oh Jesus.
BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses,
exhausted.
He sits by it, staring at it.
CHUCK
I'm so sorry, Al.
So sorry.
BEACH - MORNING
Chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the
palm trees.
He's been digging with a piece of driftwood
sharpened with his stone knife.
He drags the body into the pit.
Stares down at it.
That
could be me.
CHUCK
Got to cover Al up.
He wants to say more, can't.
He scoops some sand over the
body.
CHUCK
Got to cover Al up.
He scoops in some more sand.
It's eerily like burying the
tropical fish in his back yard.
BEACH - LATER
With a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the
sand.
BEACH - LATER THAT DAY
As Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks "Yellow
Submarine" very quietly to himself.
CHUCK
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow
submarine...
He looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point.
Comes to a decision.
He takes a drink of coconut, picks up
his club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants.
He's ready to go.
BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight.
He's still half-singing to himself.
CHUCK
Yellow submarine.
We all live in a
yellow submarine...
ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck's way is blocked by rocks and jungle.
He hesitates.
He picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad
things.
It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.
He takes
a step into the jungle.
JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER
Chuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle
canopy.
Vines and creepers reach out toward him.
There is
no path, nothing to show him where to go.
JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER
Chuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.
He takes a
drink from the coconut he is carrying.
The last drink.
CHUCK
Bad idea.
Should have saved some.
He throws away the husk.
He looks up, but the only sunlight
reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him.
ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.
He climbs
across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low
ferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep
gullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava.
The lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.
He
passes a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious
and scary.
He gives them a wide berth.
ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER
The land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high
cliff perched over the ocean.
Beyond this rock bridge the
path smoothes out to a summit.
Chuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves
breaking on the rocks far below.
To get any view, he will
have to cross the bridge.
He's thirsty.
The late afternoon
sun is hot.
CHUCK
Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did
you enjoy the play?
Hugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great
caution, he sets out across the bridge.
ISLAND - CLIFF
Step by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.
He reaches
a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a
slide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above
the waves.
Chuck tries to step across it, can't quite, tries
one foot first, then the other.
CHUCK
Shit!
He looks back, but that seems even scarier.
CHUCK
Got to get there.
Got to see.
C'mon...
c'mon.
Don't be such a wuss.
Be bold.
He looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and
jumps.
It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when he
lands on the other side.
He hugs the rocks, getting his
breath.
ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck looks to each point on the compass.
He is on an
ISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or
anything human.
On three sides the waves break against
steep, hostile cliffs.
A reef encloses the cove where he
came from.
CHUCK
No way on.
No way off.
Chuck stares out to sea in every direction.
Nothing.
CHUCK
This is bad.
Really, really bad.
The last rays of sun hit his face.
The ocean turns a deep
reddish gold.
CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER
Going down is even scarier.
It's dusk and the light is flat
and gray.
Chuck stares at the ledge.
CHUCK
Come on.
Crawl if you have to.
Chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.
ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck stumbles over the rocks.
The caves look ominous and
primal.
EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT
It's getting dark now.
The jungle seems impenetrable, the
dark wood of fable.
Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it.
JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER
The moon has just begun to rise, casting eerie light into the
jungle.
The shadows reach out to grab Chuck, then real
branches and vines tug at him.
He heads into thick
blackness.
BEACH - NIGHT - LATER
Chuck emerges around the rocks.
He reaches the stack of
familiar FedEx boxes -- Ahh, home!
He's breathing hard, from
both fear and exertion.
CHUCK
Got to drink.
Got to drink something.
With his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick.
He
bangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk.
He stares
at the stack of FedEx boxes.
What could be inside?
He
reaches out and touches one.
CHUCK
They don't belong to you.
Responsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes his
hand away.
BEACH - MORNING
Face red from the sun, Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his
stone knife.
He saws the palm frond off near the base,
leaving it about a foot long.
CHUCK
Got to have shade.
Got to have a hat.
He ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets it
upon his head.
It looks amazingly like some sort of
primitive cap.
He grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach.
BEACH - LATER
Chuck finishes the P on H E L P, which he has spelled out
with the FedEx boxes on the beach.
JUNGLE - DAY - LATER
Chuck scrambles down a ravine.
He kneels down and feels the
ground.
It is dry, completely dry.
LAVA SLOPE - DAY
Chuck traverses the slope, determined to find water.
A FLAT ROCK - LATER
With a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow.
Suddenly Chuck flops down into frame.
He tries to scoop up
some water in his hands, but he just splashes it around.
He
licks his fingers.
Then he gets down on his stomach and laps
up the water with his tongue.
Like an animal.
In the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud.
He
rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips.
CHUCK
Oh, God.
Thank you.
BEACH - NIGHT
Chuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon.
JUNGLE - DAY
Chuck is drenched in sweat.
He is at the bottom of a hole
six feet deep.
He takes one last dig with the flat stick,
then licks the moist clay that sticks to it.
BEACH - DAY
Chuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky
liquid.
With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of
the meat, but it's dry and chewy and fibrous.
He spits it
out, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first
stars.
Half sings to himself.
CHUCK
You deserve a break today...
He is desperately thirsty.
Hunger gnaws at him.
BEACH - DAY - LATER
Holding a sharpened stick, Chuck wades in the shallows at low
tide, looking for fish.
It's difficult to keep his balance.
Suddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning
sunlight.
Chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the
water and floats away.
Chuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare
hands.
The fish reverses direction.
Chuck leaps after it
and goes under.
He comes up spluttering, on his hands and
knees in the shallows.
Suddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in
unison, like one creature, splitting around Chuck like
mercury.
He grabs at them desperately.
Nothing.
CHUCK
Damn fish!
On some rocks he sees clusters of limpets.
He takes a rock
and tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.
BEACH - DAY
Discouraged, he sits down on the beach and gets his breath.
Idly, Chuck takes out his wallet.
The money is soaked.
He
lays it out to dry.
He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY, soaked
and mushy.
He tries to smooth it out.
For a moment he is overcome.
His
face tightens, his eyes get moist.
He stares out to sea.
CHUCK
Wait a minute.
Wait just a minute.
He picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card.
BEACH - MINUTES LATER
Chuck wades in the water, stops by a rock covered with
limpets.
He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet.
CHUCK
Don't leave home without it.
With his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat,
then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide
off the shell into his mouth.
CHUCK
Yuck.
He starts to spit it out.
Tries to make himself like it.
CHUCK
Yumm.
And he swallow it.
BEACH - SUNSET
Chuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile
of smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells.
He
checks his watch for a moment.
CHUCK
Got to get this fixed.
But what's the point?
Everything that was so valuable before
is useless now.
JUNGLE - LATER
Chuck digs yet another hole.
He chants to himself, almost
delusionally.
CHUCK
Water, water, everywhere, water, water
everywhere...
Covered in sweat, desperate and exhausted, he throws down his
wooden spade.
CHUCK
Where's the water on this fucking island?
He lies on his back, breathing hard.
Pulls his hat over his
eyes.
CHUCK
Just rest a minute.
JUNGLE - DAY - LATER
Chuck is lying in the hole.
We find his feet.
Slowly water
is oozing out of the clay, a puddle is building around his
toes.
JUNGLE - DAY - LATER
Chuck's eyes snap awake.
He looks down at his feet.
There's
a pool of muddy water there.
He dips his hand in it, touches
a finger to his lips to be sure he's not dreaming.
He grabs his sharpened stone, begins to attack the clay.
CHUCK
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
BEACH - SUNSET
Chuck carefully makes marks on a palm tree with his rock
knife.
One for each day.
Very neat.
Very precise.
Very
Chuck.
CHUCK
Let's see, I waited two days.
(makes marks)
Then I buried Al.
(slowly makes another mark)
Al.
You never made it home, buddy.
Then
American Express got me those clam
things...
(makes another mark)
I dug all those damn holes, the clouds
over the moon...
(makes more marks)
And today, the historic discovery of H,
Two, Oh.
(makes a tenth mark and
underlines it)
Ten days.
Shit.
For a moment, he feels the weight of his isolation.
Then he
allows himself a deep breath.
There is order now, after all.
Time is under control.
CLIFF - DAY
Very carefully, but standing this time, Chuck makes his way
across the ledge.
SUMMIT - DAY
He emerges on the top, takes a drink from a hand-made
canteen, and looks in all directions.
Again, he sees nothing
but ocean.
BEACH - DAY
He resumes his efforts at fishing.
A shape scuttles raggedly
beneath him.
CHUCK
A crab, it's a crab.
He freezes, holding his spear motionless.
Then he jabs at
the crab -- misses!
The crab scurries away toward the rocks.
CHUCK
Dammit!
Chuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling,
getting up, stabbing again.
Suddenly one stab feels different.
Chuck carefully lifts up
the spear.
On the end is a squirming crab.
CHUCK
I did it.
I did it!
He walks carefully with it to the beach.
Lowering the spear,
he lets the crab slip off.
It darts toward the water.
Chuck
heads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws.
He kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down on
it.
He twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky white
meat.
But a crab has an exoskeleton.
The flesh simply pours
out, like mucous.
CHUCK
Jesus.
This is too much.
He needs the next step, from the raw to
the cooked.
The crucial next step from primitive man to the
beginnings of civilization.
PALM GROVE SERIES OF SHOTS - TRYING TO MAKE FIRE
Chuck rubs two sticks together.
Nothing.
Chuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped
out in a piece of driftwood.
He spins the drill with great
effort.
Nothing.
CHUCK
Stupid fucking thing!
He quits, exhausted.
He looks at his hands.
They are raw
and blistered.
He feels like Job.
CHUCK
I don't know what I did, God, but
whatever is was, I am really, really
sorry.
You hear me?
Really sorry.
BEACH - DAY
Chuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the
ocean.
He dips his blistered hands into the sea water, then
looks over at the FedEx boxes that spell out H E L P.
CHUCK
Don't have a choice, do I?
He walks over and picks a few boxes up from the P.
PALM GROVE - DAY
With his stone knife and spear to help him.
Chuck begins to
open the FedEx boxes.
Chuck rips open the end of one box and
shakes it.
Out tumble some videotapes.
Chuck looks at them:
what good are they?
Chuck tears another box open.
Out slide some legal papers
covered with Post-its.
In quick cuts, we see him dump out computer memory boards,
some designer dresses, flowers, a pair of roller blades, a
script with a red cover -- which he never reads.
BEACH - LATER
By now he has taken all the boxes in the P.
Only H E L
remains.
He pauses to let the irony of that sink in, then
collects more boxes.
He is even more exhausted.
PALM GROVE
Two boxes remain.
One is the box with Angel Wings.
Chuck
sets it aside.
He opens the other box.
Out tumbles a
DOCTOR'S BAG.
Chuck can't believe it.
He opens the bag.
It's full of great stuff.
Medicine.
A scalpel.
A saw.
CHUCK
Okay.
Okay now.
PALM GROVE - LATER
Hands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller
blade wheel housing.
Tries over and over.
Nothing.
He takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.
His
tooth is starting to hurt.
He fishes some Tylenol out of the
surgeon's bag and takes two.
OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY
Chuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them.
They're
not bad.
He eats more.
Then more.
What a relief.
BEACH - NIGHT
Chuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his
stomach.
He drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet,
and throws up in great, violent heaves.
BEACH - DAY
Still looking a little green, Chuck marks another day on his
tree calendar.
SUMMIT
He stares out to sea.
Nothing.
WELL - DAY
Chuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has
filled with water.
Then he washes his face and splashes
water over his neck.
The surface of the well stills,
bringing CHUCK'S REFLECTION into focus.
He stares at
himself.
Very carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeon's scalpel.
Chuck checks out his new appearance in the water.
Much
better.
A clean start now.
BEACH - LATER THAT DAY
He sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire.
CHUCK
You're not getting it hot enough.
Got to
hold the heat.
Got to hold the heat.
BEACH - LATER
Chuck carefully shaves some tinder.
Puts it under a piece of
bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it.
BEACH - LATER
Chuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the
split half of the bamboo.
He saws back and forth with all
his might, pressing it down in the groove.
BEACH - LATER
Chuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly
defeated.
It's all too much.
CHUCK
Sonofabitch!
He starts to rub again.
He breathes hard, sweat pours off
his face.
He is really going for it, what the hell!
A tiny
wisp of smoke appears!
Chuck saws with even more energy.
CHUCK
Come on.
Come on.
The smoke increases.
Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the
nest of shavings, and blows on it frantically.
The smoke
flickers and dies.
Chuck can't believe it.
CHUCK
No.
No.
No.
BEACH - NIGHT
Chuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering.
He looks up
at the stars, which blaze furiously.
CHUCK
That's the big dipper...Orion...or is
that the Southern Cross...?
Kelly would
know.
And he misses her so much.
A shower of meteors streaks
across the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on
Chuck.
BEACH - DAY
Chuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins
sawing with tremendous energy.
He smells something.
Is it
smoke?
He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of
tinder.
There's nothing there.
CHUCK
Dammit!
He replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.
TIME CUT
The sun has moved in the sky.
Chuck is still sawing.
Again
the smoke appears.
Again sweat pours from his face.
The
smoke increases.
He saws even harder.
His breath comes in
anguished gulps.
Smoke is curling up now.
Chuck tears away
the bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it
gently.
The smoke increases.
He blows some more.
A fragile crimson spark appears.
CHUCK
Careful now, careful...
He gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then
blows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life
itself.
He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny
flame.
Suddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the
kindling.
Desperate, Chuck grabs it.
Trying to shield it
with his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into
the sand, trying to make a windbreak.
They rustle and shake
and blow over.
The wind blows harder.
Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to
make an eddy.
But the fire is out.
No words now, just a
loud, primal groan of pure despair.
And then, into his vision floats...smoke.
Chuck looks down.
A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of
tinder!
Chuck blows on it gently.
Suddenly a tiny tongue of
flame flickers and catches on the kindling!
CHUCK
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
He feeds in some more twigs, more tinder.
The flames lick
out, catch, grow.
CHUCK
If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I
am sure I did, thank you now.
BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT
The fire burns on the beach.
Chuck rushes about, piling on
driftwood.
BEACH - CLOSER
Chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log.
He throws it on the fire.
We see his face in the light of
the fire.
He is exultant.
He dances.
He sings at the top
of his lungs.
Papa-ooo-mow-mow!
Chuck throws another huge log on the fire.
Papa-papa-papa-
oooo!
The log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge
shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the
darkness...until they merge with the stars.
PALM GROVE - MORNING
Chuck makes a mark on the tree.
Around it he carves a flame
-- the day he mastered fire.
PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING
Chuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife.
Then he
sticks it in the flame to harden it, pulls it out, checks it,
scrapes some more.
BEACH - DAY
Chuck wades in the water with his spear.
Suddenly he stabs
it down.
A crab is on the end.
BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER
Chuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a
steaming crab claw.
Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white
meat.
Ahhh.
It tastes great.
He takes another bite -- and
flinches.
CHUCK
Damn tooth!
He fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills.
SUMMIT - SUNSET
Chuck stands on the summit, looking in all directions.
Then,
something on the island brings Chuck's eyes back from their
distant focus on the horizon.
From down on the beach,
beneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke.
Chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it.
He kneels down and begins to build a signal fire.
BEACH - NIGHT - LATER
Chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds.
The fire burns.
Around it is a large stack of crab shells.
He stares into
the fire.
PALM GROVE - MORNING
Chuck makes another mark on the tree.
He has circled the
tree with marks several times now.
BEACH - DAY
Using a safety pin and some suturing thread, Chuck fishes
carefully.
Suddenly he jerks his hand back.
On the end is a
flopping fish.
PALM GROVE - DAY
Chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some
breadfruit.
He eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but
his tooth hurts even worse.
There are only a few Tylenol
tablets left.
He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it.
SUMMIT - AFTERNOON
Chuck arrives with the wood for the night.
He stares out to
sea as usual, but this time he sees something different.
WHALES.
He sees whales.
Leaping.
Broaching.
Spouting.
Water pouring off fins and flukes.
Moving.
Going somewhere.
CHUCK
Beautiful.
So beautiful.
Chuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and he
can see them no more.
It's late now.
Leaving, he takes one last look, as he always does.
And
another remarkable sight greets his eyes.
There, on the
horizon, just below the evening star, is a...LIGHT.
He
stares at it, fixed.
CHUCK
A star.
It's a star.
But then he stares at it really hard.
CHUCK
It's a ship.
WOODS - TREE - NEXT DAY
A tree shakes and moves, quivers...
CHUCK
Timberrr!
...then slowly falls with a CRASH!
CHUCK
I heard that...
Chuck holds his surgeon's saw over the stump.
He walks to
another tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.
BEACH - SERIES OF SHOTS
Up above the high tide line, Chuck lashes a log to a row of
five logs already joined with vines.
CHUCK
No more waiting.
Take action.
Chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and
suturing thread for a sail.
CHUCK
That's right.
Take action.
He cuts bamboo for the mast.
He carves driftwood for an oar.
He fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut as
he sings "Fly Me to the Moon" to himself.
He ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo
boom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape.
He ties on
the doctor's kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings.
He examines his handiwork:
a finished raft.
He brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, then
grabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the
beach.
It doesn't budge.
He tries to pull it again.
Nothing.
He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs.
Nothing.
He collapses on the beach, his breath coming in
heaves.
CHUCK
How could I be so stupid?
He bangs himself on the head, over and over.
CHUCK
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
PALM GROVE - NIGHT
Chuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire.
It comes
back to life.
Meteors streak again across the sky.
He
stares at the indifferent stars.
The moon is almost full.
Shadows of palm trees sway on the sand.
BEACH - NIGHT
Chuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the
reflected light of the fire.
A wave come in, licks at his
toes.
Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.
Chuck
watches, gets an idea.
BEACH - NIGHT
He begins to dig in the sand by the raft.
He grabs the oar
and digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is.
BEACH - MORNING
The rising tide floods water into the trench.
Chuck rocks
the raft back and forth.
It floats!
As the wave recedes, it
takes the raft with it.
Chuck has to run beside it.
CHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE
Over and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.
The first
time he has a bandage on his leg.
He tries everything --
different rafts, different approaches, but each time the
ocean spits him back.
LAGOON - DAY
Defeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his
latest failure.
He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and
throws it on the ground by the palm tree.
He has tried so
hard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly
possible and beyond.
He rips off his life preserver, throws
it into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach.
CHUCK
You're too low in the water.
Too damn
low.
Chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep
sobs of despair.
And then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep
inside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.
The
Scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island,
the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves.
It is powerful, disturbing, primal.
The breeze picks up.
Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to
sway.
The tide is reaching up toward the beach.
The waves
crash louder.
The palm trees sway even more.
Chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.
CHUCK
Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure
-- and unto dust shalt thou return.
A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and
sizzling in the fire.
Chuck looks up:
clouds have obscured the sun.
The wind
blows harder.
The rain falls harder, streaking the sand
Chuck had rubbed on his body.
STEAM sizzles out of the fire.
Chuck looks up, disbelieving.
The bottom falls out of the
heavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen
before.
A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching
for the fire.
Forget the raft!
Forget despair!
The fire could go out!
This is disaster!
CHUCK
Shit!
He springs into action.
Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box.
With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out
of the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.
He slides
the coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood
and sets off on a run.
WOODS - DAY
Chuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.
Vines
grab at him.
The rain is so thick he can hardly see.
WOODS - MINUTES LATER
Chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.
Smoke
pours out of the FedEx box.
The coals are about to burn
through!
LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking
box.
His face is drenched, desperate.
CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER
Chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through
the FedEx box.
Using the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot
the coals into a dry spot.
One by one, THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT.
Dripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few
together with his fingers, ignoring the burns.
CHUCK
Please...please...please...
He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.
He
places this kindling on the coals.
They sputter and sizzle.
Barely catch.
He fans them with the box.
A tiny flicker
catches, then starts to grow.
CHUCK
Firewood.
I need firewood.
SERIES OF SHOTS
On the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the
driving monsoon.
He can barely see.
Driven by the storm,
the waves are licking at the palm grove.
He runs through the woods.
Branches whip at his face.
Roots
tear at his feet, tripping him.
He stumbles up the lava field.
Sliding.
Struggling.
Barely
able to breathe, the rain is so strong.
CAVE - NEXT DAY
Chuck emerges from the cave.
The rain has stopped.
This is
the absolute lowest.
His face reflects his pain and despair.
He's trapped.
It's hopeless.
Everything he tried to build
is gone.
LEDGE - DAY
Chuck slowly walks out on the ledge.
He stares down at the
waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below.
He lets go one hand.
Then lets go the other.
He is barely
balanced.
It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him
right off.
He slides one foot to the very lip of the
precipice.
Suddenly his foot slips!
Instinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!
One
hand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!
The other
closes, his fingers straining to hold him.
He breathes in deep gasps.
He had wanted to end it, come so
close.
CHUCK
What the fuck are you doing?
His deepest instinct was to survive.
And that is what he is
going to do.
CHUCK
Hang on.
Just hang on.
Slowly he pulls himself back from the edge.
BEACH - LATER
Chuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of
starting over.
The beach is littered with seaweed and
flotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles.
He picks up a
plastic bottle.
That will come in handy.
The Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with "Wilson" stamped on it in
big black letters.
He picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air.
Then he
kicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach,
trying to kick it and keep it out of the water.
Feeling joy
again, even here.
BEACH - DAY
Chuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water.
The pain is so
great his eyes water.
CHUCK
Whoo, pig.
Sooey!
He falls back in the water and floats there, looking up at
the sky.
OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER
The sky takes on the first colors of the day.
The ocean is
still dark, but a few waves catch the first light.
The
sunrise touches the summit, moves down the cliff, then lights
the cove.
On the screen superimpose:
"1000 DAYS LATER"
REFLECTION - WATER
A spear shimmers in the calm morning water.
Attached to the
spear is a man, standing completely still.
ON CHUCK
We move up out of the reflection to the real man.
His legs
are scarred.
The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle.
A stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt
made of videotape and woven fiber.
Necklaces of shark's
teeth and shells hang from his neck.
His hair is long.
A
coconut frond hat is on his head.
The hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a
berry.
It holds the spear perfectly still.
The watch is
gone.
We come around slowly until we see Chuck's face.
The eyes
say it all.
They stare out with a survivor's intensity,
staring at the water, unblinking.
This is the man who used
to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish.
This is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of
activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human
activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds
count.
Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.
And now he has all the time in the world.
Suddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the
spear forward at a low angle.
It quivers, stuck on the
bottom.
He pulls it out with a practiced twist.
On the end
is a struggling fish.
But this isn't a thrill anymore.
It's another day at the
office.
BEACH - LATER THAT DAY
Chuck makes a mark on a palm tree.
He has completely covered
three other trees with marks.
It sinks in how long he has
been here.
JUNGLE - LATER
Chuck carries the fish back from the beach.
Now there is a
well-worn trail.
CLIFF - SUNRISE
Chuck carries firewood up to the summit.
He mechanically
adds wood to the fire.
As he does so, something out to sea
catches his eye.
He stops and stands up.
CHUCK'S POV - WHALES
WHALES broach out past the rocky point.
Spouts of water
shoot into the air.
ON CHUCK
As he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.
He
grins.
There's a big gap where his teeth had been.
He turns
and strides down the hill.
CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER
He heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified
him, without losing stride.
It's second nature now.
SUMMIT - EVENING
The signal fire burns.
A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up
the sky.
Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit, a bowl of
mashed breadfruit in one hand, a bowl of roasted eel skin in
another.
As Chuck watches the sunset unfold, watches the whales going
by in the darkened water, he takes some roasted eel chips,
dips them into the breadfruit paste, and offers one to
Wilson.
His voice is flat, monotonal.
CHUCK
Chips?
Dip?
But Wilson declines.
CHUCK
No?
He takes a big crunchy bite.
CHUCK
Another fucking day in paradise.
PULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the
bowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip.
ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER
Torch in one hand, Wilson in the other, Chuck walks across
the rocky ledge.
He passes the flume without even noticing.
Suddenly his shoe breaks!
It's sandal made of woven yucca
leaves.
He bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge.
LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of
times, but this time the sandal comes loose.
It catches on a
rock, and CHUCK FALLS!
His hands are cut and bruised.
He tries to get up, can't.
Chuck sits back and examines his foot.
His fingers come back
covered with blood.
He reaches out to steady himself, and
leaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock.
BEACH - LATER
Chuck slowly wades into the water, favoring his injured foot.
But something feels different.
He glances around.
What is
it?
And then he sees something, perhaps the worst possible
sight.
CHUCK'S POV - SAIL
A SAIL is moving steadily away from the island.
CHUCK
Throws down the spear and waves his arms.
CHUCK
No!
Wait!
Come back!
He runs into the water and starts to swim.
He is so weak,
however, he can only make a few strokes.
He tries to yell as
he swims...
CHUCK
Wait!
Wait!
Choking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on the
beach.
In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance.
SUMMIT - LATER
Chuck struggles to the top of the hill.
His fire has been
extinguished by the rain.
In the distance, far against the
horizon, he sees a sail -- or is it a cloud?
The whiteness
shimmers against the horizon.
Chuck squints.
Whatever it
was, it is gone.
Above him some contrails from jets mark the
sky.
Furious, he kicks his signal fire, scattering the burnt-out
coals.
BEACH - LATER THAT DAY
Chuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree.
Then he stops.
He CUTS an angry big line under the last mark, then hacks
away at the palm tree, slashing it with the stone knife,
ripping and marking through all his dates.
Finally the stone
knife breaks in two.
Chuck drops the broken half and catches
his breath.
CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck enters the cave.
No signal fires burn.
The island is
dark.
SUMMIT - DAY
Chuck stands on the summit, staring out to sea.
Nothing, not
even a contrail, not even a whale spout.
CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER
He is on his way down, suddenly he sees something and stops.
It's the HANDPRINT, the bloody handprint, his own handprint.
He slowly extends his hand and covers it, then pulls it away.
Traces it with his fingers.
ISLAND - DAY
The monsoon pours down.
Wind whips the palm trees.
The
waves are gray and angry, tearing at the beach.
CAVE - LATER
The rains have stopped.
The island is washed bright and
green.
ON CHUCK
As he stands up in the cove.
His face is white with blue
stars.
Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning
bolts.
Braided cords circle his biceps.
Bone necklaces hang
from his neck.
Feathers jut out from his hair.
JUNGLE - DAY
Chuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his
path.
Chuck was here.
This is his mark.
PALM GROVE - DAY
He covers the calendar trees with handprints.
Then stops.
Sees something.
Eyes fixed on the beach, he walks toward the
shoreline.
BEACH - DAY
Chuck emerges from the palm trees, and now we see what he had
seen.
A FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM.
And another one.
TWO.
Chuck stares at the barrels.
CHUCK
Hello.
BEACH - LATER
Chuck sits staring at the oil drums.
It's almost as if he is
hesitating to take advantage of them.
That he may not want,
really, to leave now.
Then his inner struggle ends.
CHUCK
What the hell are you waiting for?
BEACH - LATER
Filled with determination, Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach.
BEACH - LATER
Using a palm tree as a fulcrum, Chuck hauls hard on a rope
made of vines, pulling the barrel up off the beach.
JUNGLE - DAY
Chuck throws aside palm leaves, revealing...the remains of
his raft.
JUNGLE - DAY
Chuck lashes the barrels onto the raft.
Checks the knots.
Lashes more rope.
BEACH - DAY
Chuck digs a channel toward the raft.
BEACH - DAY
Chuck loads the raft, which rocks gently in the cove.
He has
a sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber
thread.
A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together
into a rope.
Plastic bottles filled with water.
A signal
kite made of FedEx paper.
Then comes the FedEx box with the angel wings.
Then Wilson.
CHUCK
Wilson, my main man.
Time to go.
And he gently leads the raft into the lagoon.
CHUCK
Wonder what odds Stan would give me on
this.
I'd say 90-10.
Against.
He jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where the
surf crashes onto the reef.
LAGOON - DAY
Waves break against the reef.
With his paddles Chuck
maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef.
Boom!
The
wave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes
with a whoosh.
Chuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad.
He's
committed.
SCRAPE goes the first barrel, then the second,
riding the receding wave.
He's out!
But the next wave is already surging forward.
It smashes the
raft against the reef!
Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off
the raft!
The barrels cushion the impact.
The raft tilts, spins, but
stays outside the reef!
The ropes holding the jugs of water
break!
The water sweeps overboard!
The wave recedes again.
Chuck recovers, paddles with all his
strength, and then he's clear of the breakers!
For a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his
breath.
The water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the
lagoon.
Chuck could go back and get them.
If he were being
prudent, he definitely would.
But he's out.
He might never get back out again.
He stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs.
Then he
stares at the island.
Goodbye to all that.
CHUCK
Wilson, we're out of here.
He turns and begins raising the sail.
OCEAN - WIDE - MINUTES LATER
Powered by its multicolored makeshift sail, trailing its
gently flapping signal kite of FedEx paper, the raft slowly
moves away from the island, out toward the open ocean.
And we pull back until the ocean swallows the tiny raft and
then we TILT DOWN AND...
DISSOLVE TO:
OCEAN - DAY - FOUR WEEKS LATER
The ocean again, low.
The raft floats into frame.
A trace
of a breeze flaps the signal kite, which barely stays aloft,
its rope frayed and tattered.
The still is set up in the
middle, plastic with a rock weighting down the center.
Chuck is gaunt, his clothes rotted.
He lies looking over the side of the raft, spear in one hand,
staring intently at the water.
Dorados swim like specters, flashing and darting.
Chuck
stabs with his spear.
Stabs again.
CHUCK
Slow down, damn you!
Exhausted, he sinks back to the raft.
Two Dorados leap into
the air ahead of him.
Chuck tries to stare again into the water.
He spots another
fish, a flash of silver under the surface.
Chuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear.
SPLAT!
Something strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him into
the water.
On the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue.
A
FLYING FISH.
Chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.
CHUCK
Catch it catch it catch it --
He catches it again just as it almost flops over the side.
RAFT - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck sucks the juice out of the head.
He chews meat off the
tiny rib bones.
Chuck is in the stage of malnutrition, vitamin deprivation,
salt insufficiency, and exposure where the personality splits
and becomes external.
Like all castaways, he has
conversations with the two sides of himself.
GOODCHUCK
Save some for tomorrow.
BADCHUCK
Catch another fish tomorrow.
BadChuck wins.
Chuck keeps eating.
He stares up at the sun,
which beats down unmercifully.
RAFT - DAY - LATER
The raft drifts.
Chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it
as a canopy.
Drenched with sweat, Chuck lies on the raft,
trying to sleep.
He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating
his body and won't let him get comfortable.
Plus, there's a
chaffing, squeaking sound.
He looks around for the source.
We see it with him.
One of the ropes is frayed and about to
break.
If it does, the logs will come apart from the floats.
BADCHUCK
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
GOODCHUCK
Stay calm, identify the problem.
Problem, rope fraying.
Solution, fix
rope.
BADCHUCK
With what?
There's nothing to fix it
with.
This rope comes undone, you're
going to drown.
GOOD CHUCK
Just get up and fix it.
BADCHUCK
Too tired.
GOODCHUCK
Get up.
BADCHUCK
Feels so good to lie here.
GOODCHUCK
Get up, damn you.
Chuck comes to his knees.
Then sinks back down.
BADCHUCK
Can't.
Need water.
GOODCHUCK
You've had today's water.
BADCHUCK
Thirsty.
GOODCHUCK
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do
it.
BADCHUCK
No water, no work.
Chuck tries another tack.
Sweet reason.
GOODCHUCK
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know
you're thirsty, but give it one more
shot, you've just got to do a little
more.
BADCHUCK
Do too much, I'll die.
GOODCHUCK
Do too little you'll die.
BADCHUCK
Going to die anyway.
That stops GoodChuck for a moment.
GOODCHUCK
Okay, look have an extra swallow.
He holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of
murky water.
BADCHUCK
No more water, you said.
GOODCHUCK
Take it.
BADCHUCK
No.
GOODCHUCK
Take it, damn it.
BADCHUCK
No.
GOODCHUCK
Wilson, do you believe this?
Take the
damn water.
Slowly Chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a
swallow.
Then another.
GOODCHUCK
Stop.
Enough.
Then another.
RAFT - DAY - LATER
Chuck works to braid a new rope.
He is focused,
concentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and
hard and he's weak and clumsy.
He tests the rope, but it
doesn't hold.
GOODCHUCK
Think.
Got to use something else.
He gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.
BADCHUCK
If they can't see you, what's the point?
GOODCHUCK
Survive today, that's the point.
The kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to
tie the logs, but it's all he has.
He ties the log with the
kite rope.
Exhausted, he lies back down.
RAFT - NIGHT
The moon is full.
The waves cast off shadows on the ocean.
Chuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to
navigate by.
GOODCHUCK
Polaris, where are you?
Maybe I'm too
far south.
BADCHUCK
You don't know where you are.
You missed
the shipping lanes.
GOODCHUCK
Moon's too bright.
We hear the fraying sound again.
RAFT - DAY
Chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife.
Across the
water comes a storm.
We can see it like a waterfall moving
toward us.
BADCHUCK
You're putting off the inevitable.
GOODCHUCK
I'm putting it off.
He looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.
BADCHUCK
That's what's happening to you.
Chuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope
and begins to lash it around the center logs.
BADCHUCK
You're rotting away.
The raft is rocking.
The waves are stronger.
It's hard to
tie the logs together.
Rain falls like a sheet on Chuck.
BADCHUCK
Get water!
GOODCHUCK
Fix raft first.
BADCHUCK
Water water water --
Chuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope.
Finally he does.
Then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles
to pull it up.
One corner is stuck and collapses.
Desperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up.
Drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar.
Soaked, Chuck stares at the water as it rises.
Then the rain stops.
We see the line of rain recede away from Chuck, spattering
the ocean.
But all around him the ocean is calm again.
And out comes the sun.
OCEAN - DAY
The raft floats on quiet seas.
The sky is blue, with few
high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on.
Chuck lies on the raft, sick and weak.
Suddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge
shape.
A SPERM WHALE, still mainly submerged.
The blow hole is near
Chuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips.
The eye of the whale
is only a few feet away.
It looks upon Chuck out of an
intelligence deep and alien.
He slowly comes to his knees and stares at it.
The blow hole opens and WHOOSH, out shoots a geyser of fine
spray which settles on Chuck in a mist.
The whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft.
From the whale
comes a deep sound like a foghorn.
Startled, Chuck jumps back, rocking the raft.
He catches
himself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale.
The whale blows again, drenching Chuck in more spray.
Chuck touches the whale again.
GOODCHUCK
You like that?
Very slowly it drifts along with the raft.
GOODCHUCK
Lost your mate?
We look right into the whale's eye.
Beneath the surface we
can see the huge jaws open and close.
GOODCHUCK
You're beautiful.
Marry me.
BADCHUCK
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the
raft.
Very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body
passing Chuck.
GOODCHUCK
No, don't go.
Look, I've got fish.
Chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of
the whale, which ignores it.
GOODCHUCK
Please don't dive.
Please.
The whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back
and heads straight for the bottom.
For a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and
vertical against the dark blue sky.
With one swoop, those
flukes could destroy Chuck and his raft.
But they don't do
anything except slowly sink.
Then it is gone.
We are on Chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had
been, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples
that reach out and gently rock the raft.
OCEAN - DAY
Chuck checks the water.
It is green and full of floaties.
It looks awful.
He takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and
drinks.
Instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely
keeps from dropping it.
BADCHUCK
Look what you've done.
He dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on
his face, splutters it out, then licks his lips.
He is so
thirsty.
He looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns
away, begins to work on the sea anchor again.
But the work makes him even thirstier.
He looks at the jug
again.
Picks it up.
Takes a long drink.
OCEAN - DAY
The fish return.
Chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it
down.
BADCHUCK
What are you doing?
GOODCHUCK
Can't kill another one.
Can't.
Can't
kill my friends anymore.
BADCHUCK
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or
you die.
GOODCHUCK
Why do they have to die for me?
BADCHUCK
They'd eat you if they could.
They're
laughing at you.
Listen.
Chuck listens.
Doesn't hear anything.
GOODCHUCK
Got to eat.
Chuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses.
Suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.
It
struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its
head, twists the stone knife into its spine.
The struggling
stops.
Chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.
GOODCHUCK
I am so sorry.
He cries uncontrollably.
As he cries he cuts off the head,
pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one.
Then he sucks the
marrow out of the head.
Then takes the heart and eats that.
Then eats the liver.
As he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips.
When he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks
on it.
Fish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.
OCEAN - NIGHT
The raft rocks gently.
Chuck looks up.
The strips of fish
are glowing.
So is the deck where he killed the fish.
He reaches out to touch the fish strips.
His hand is glowing
too.
CHUCK
I'm an angel.
Suddenly he sees other lights.
A ship.
A ship is out there.
And he hears it, a humming in deep register.
He waves his hands.
He yells.
CHUCK
Here!
Here!
His voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean.
The lights move on.
CHUCK
No...no...no...
His raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard.
Chuck is thrown
into the water!
He comes to the surface, sputtering.
Where is the raft?
He looks one way, then another.
Darkness.
This is the worst.
He turns again in the water.
There, dimly, he can see the
glow from the fish he killed.
The glow saves his life.
He swims toward it.
He pulls himself back on the raft.
He lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence
casting a greenish light on his face.
OCEAN - DAY
Clouds are building up.
In the distance lightning flashes.
The clouds come closer.
Little bits of electricity jump off the mast.
Saint Elmos
fire jumps around Chuck's hand.
Fascinated, he holds out his hand.
The fire jumps from his
hand to the mast.
Suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean!
A huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge.
The
CRACK is intense, then rolls away.
Chuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself
down on the raft.
Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him
and the ocean begins to roll.
The thunder is deafening.
Lightning flashes bursts through the rain.
CHUCK
Sea anchor!
Let out the sea anchor!
Frantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down
a huge wave.
The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it
rides the wave down.
The waves come at him high as houses.
The raft rides up one
side, then plunges down the next.
All Chuck can do is hold on.
OCEAN - DAY
The storm has passed.
The raft floats on big dark rollers.
We hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins.
They come
close to the raft.
Chuck watches them play.
Then realizes
they are chasing his fish.
They drive them along, into the
path of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the
dorado, turning the water around the raft into churning,
bloody foam.
CHUCK
Stop!
He takes his oar and begins beating the water.
The killing
continues.
CHUCK
You fucking murderers!
Suddenly the water is still.
One dolphin sticks its head out
of the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking.
Another dolphin lifts its head up, then another.
They squeak
to each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck.
CHUCK
I know you're talking about me!
He splashes the water with his oar.
They dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.
CHUCK
(very softly)
Take me with you.
They're gone.
CHUCK
Why me?
Why me, God?
He begins to laugh.
BADCHUCK
Listen to this, Wilson.
(deep voice: God)
Because you piss me off.
OCEAN - DAY
Chuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga.
Each movement
takes forever.
He rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup.
He
can't.
Collapses onto the raft.
BADCHUCK
You're falling apart.
Tries to do another pushup.
Can't.
BADCHUCK
First you eat your fat, then you eat your
muscle.
He rolls over.
BADCHUCK
Then you eat your mind.
He looks at the ocean.
They're in a line of garbage, a thick
slick of debris dumped off of ships.
GOODCHUCK
Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean
roll.
He closes his eyes.
After a minute they come open.
GOODCHUCK
I'm late, I'm late, for a very important
date.
They slowly close again.
BADCHUCK
I'm lost.
Goodbye.
GOODCHUCK
No!
His eyes come open again.
BADCHUCK
Look, just slip off the raft.
The ocean
would feel so good, the water's so soft
and warm.
Take a little swim.
Sleep.
GOODCHUCK
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
BADCHUCK
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
GOODCHUCK
But I have promises to keep.
(rolls over)
And miles to go before I sleep.
(props himself up)
And miles to go before I sleep.
(purpose now)
Got to fix the sea anchor.
Use the sail.
BADCHUCK
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you
won't move.
GOODCHUCK
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll
capsize.
BADCHUCK
Die tomorrow or die today.
He hums Beethoven's fifth.
BA BA BA BUM.
BADCHUCK
That's death knocking, knocking on your
door.
Crazy little woman come knocking,
knocking at my front door...
GOODCHUCK
Grow up, stop being such a baby.
Other
people get through a lot worse.
BADCHUCK
Yeah, sure, what?
He hums to himself, begins to sing, Beatles.
BADCHUCK
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink...
He pulls in the loose sea anchor rope, which is covered with
barnacles.
He scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug, then
sips it.
The sun is setting, huge rays shoot out across the sky.
Out of the empty ocean the Dorados suddenly appear, leaping
flashes of silver right by the raft.
One Dorado swims right by the raft, broadside.
Chuck looks at it, uncomprehending.
Then slowly reaches for
his spear.
GOODCHUCK
What?
Are you sacrificing yourself for
me?
Carefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear into
the fish.
Flapping and struggling, it lands on the deck.
Chuck pounces
on it.
RAFT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
He cuts it open.
The other Dorados ram the raft in fury,
like a lynch mob.
GOODCHUCK
Damn it!
I had to do it!
The banging continues.
GOODCHUCK
I'm sorry!
He concentrates on his work, then sits back on his heels in
amazement.
There's another fish inside.
He holds that fish
up, stares at it, then cuts it open.
There's a smaller fish inside it.
GOODCHUCK
I know there's a moral here, God, but
right now I'm just going to eat.
He pops out an eyeball, then another, and crunches them
between his teeth.
He takes the heart and liver, starts to eat, then stops.
GOODCHUCK
Forgot to say grace.
Sorry Mom.
He struggles to remember.
GOODCHUCK
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and
Christ and the bounty about to receive,
or something...amen.
He eats them.
RAFT - NEXT MORNING
Chuck splashes sea water on his face.
Adjusts the water
still.
GOODCHUCK
Please don't leak.
Please.
Chuck picks up the smallest fish.
It's half digested.
He
washes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble at
his fingers.
GOODCHUCK
Don't look at me.
It was that Dorado.
He cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.
GOODCHUCK
You know, Wilson, every now and then we
should say thank you.
Thank you God.
BADCHUCK
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Suddenly something bumps the raft.
Hard.
Then again.
GOODCHUCK
Not again.
Fins cut the water.
SHARKS.
A big hammerhead bumps the
raft.
BadChuck hums the theme from "Jaws."
Chuck takes his
spear stabs at the shark.
BADCHUCK
He's going to get you, going to get
you...
Another one circles in, bumps the raft.
GOODCHUCK
Get away from me!
The shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a
nightmare.
GOODCHUCK
Get him get him get him.
He stabs at it with his spear.
He might as well have stabbed
concrete.
The shark circle, Chuck stabs again.
But the shark is gone.
GOODCHUCK
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stabs again and again at the empty ocean.
GOODCHUCK
Stop!
You're using energy.
Move slowly.
Be patient.
Chuck kneels, wavering, on the raft.
The ocean is calm.
Suddenly, BUMP.
The raft tilts.
Chuck hangs on.
Then a shark appears, just out of spear range.
Its lifeless
black eyes seem to stare right through Chuck.
If the Dorado was a gift from God, this is a message from
Hell.
Then the shark is gone.
RAFT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck lies back on the raft.
He is humming.
BADCHUCK
What are you smiling about?
They'll be
back.
GOODCHUCK
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody
Hotel.
With Kelly.
He smiles at the thought.
GOODCHUCK
The music ends.
We go back to the table.
The waiters have brought dinner.
New
York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce.
Mushrooms in brown gravy.
Roasted
potatoes with garlic and rosemary.
Green
Beans with almonds.
Fresh biscuits and
cornbread, dripping with butter.
A nice
salad with ranch dressing.
A jumbo
shrimp cocktail.
Thinks about that, it spoils the picture.
GOODCHUCK
No shrimp.
(then)
We eat.
He closes his eyes.
This is the greatest fantasy.
GOODCHUCK
(as the waiter)
For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode,
we have a double chocolate cake with
creme anglaise, we have a nice pear
torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if
you care to wait a few minutes, a grand
marnier souffle?
Chuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.
GOODCHUCK
Why, bring them all, bring them all.
He rolls over.
There, square in his vision, is a ship, its
form coming in and out of a low haze.
Chuck jumps to his feet.
Waves.
Screams.
GOODCHUCK
Here!
Over here!
The ship moves on.
We can see the decks the rigging, the
vastness of it.
Chuck realizes he is naked.
Struggles to pull on the remains
of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand
as he continues to wave.
On the ship no one is to be seen.
It is a spooky sight.
The big tanker moves on.
We are on Chuck's face.
Passed up again.
Then he realizes what is about to happen.
He throws out the
sea anchor.
He throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he
can, wiggles his feet into the ropes.
CHUCK
Oh, shiiiittt!
Then comes the wake of the ship.
It rocks the raft like a
piece of flotsam.
The raft rides high up on the wave, then
shoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows
and rides along with the wave.
And then the sea is calm again.
Slowly Chuck sinks to his knees.
His hand lets loose his
pants.
He lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with
the ship's captain.
CHUCK
Permission to come aboard, sir.
CHUCK/CAPTAIN
Permission granted.
CHUCK
May I ask, where are you bound?
CHUCK/CAPTAIN
San Francisco.
And you?
CHUCK
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco
myself.
CHUCK/CAPTAIN
Would you do us the honor of joining us?
We're just sitting down at mess.
Pork
chops and gravy, cranberries, baked
potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh-
baked bread, apple pie...
CHUCK
No please, join me.
Some sundried fish
strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to
munch on.
The depression comes back again.
BADCHUCK
They're never going to see you.
You're
just another piece of trash in the ocean.
GOODCHUCK
They're on autopilot.
BADCHUCK
They're always on autopilot.
Or else
it's night, or you're in the sun, or
you're in the trough of a wave.
They'll
never see you.
GOODCHUCK
Damn it!
Don't be so negative!
Chuck picks up Wilson.
GOODCHUCK
Wilson, what's your story?
He holds Wilson close to his chest.
BADCHUCK
I float.
You sink.
End of story.
GOODCHUCK
I'm serious.
I'm always going on about
me, me, me.
Enough about me.
Your turn.
BADCHUCK
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
GOODCHUCK
Shut up.
He lies on the raft and holds Wilson close.
We move up until we see --
OCEAN - AERIAL - EVENING
Chuck lying curled up on the raft, Wilson cradled in his
arms, and all around the vast empty ocean.
OCEAN - NEXT MORNING
Chuck slowly wakes up.
Sets Wilson aside.
GOODCHUCK
Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't
be lazy.
We're okay today.
We're okay
today.
And the other Chuck begins to laugh.
GOODCHUCK
Shut up.
The laughter goes on.
GOODCHUCK
Shut the fuck up!
I mean it.
He stands up and checks the horizon.
GOODCHUCK
What's so damn funny?
BADCHUCK
You are.
Suddenly Chuck sees something on the horizon.
A bank of
clouds.
A cone of -- land.
He squints, stares again.
The clouds part.
It looks like --
his island.
Chuck doesn't know whether to feel joy or despair.
GOODCHUCK
Jesus.
BADCHUCK
Look again, asshole.
It's a mirage.
Chuck squints.
GOODCHUCK
It's real.
BADCHUCK
Nothing out there but ocean.
GOODCHUCK
Let's get a second opinion.
Wilson?
What do you see?
Chuck picks up the soccer ball, holds it up, and stares out
at...ocean.
RAFT - DAY - LATER
Chuck slowly writes on the sail.
CHUCK
Chuck Noland.
Born October 8, 1958.
Died -- pick a date -- July 11, 1998.
And now the epitaph.
Met deadlines.
Kept appointments.
Lost without a trace.
He sits back, looks at the mock headstone.
BADCHUCK
What did it matter if FedEx was five
minutes late one day?
The next day we
just start over again.
GOODCHUCK
It matters.
We do the best we can,
that's all we have.
BADCHUCK
Then we've just got shit.
He goes on writing.
CHUCK
I am writing this to remind myself to
live a better life.
If I am lost,
perhaps you who find this will be
instructed to live a better live
yourself.
Live each day.
Love your
children.
Don't take anyone for granted.
BADCHUCK
Is that it?
Life is a fucking Disney
movie?
The waves begin to grow, the ocean turns a slate gray.
Far
above him, great frigate birds circle.
Suddenly one dives on
a booby which has caught a fish.
The great frigate bird
swoops all around the booby until, panicked, it drops the
fish, which plummets toward the sea.
With a graceful dive, the huge bird grabs the fish and then
soars up on a thermal, high into the sky.
Lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon, which is
turning black and dark.
Thunder rolls.
RAFT - NIGHT
The raft goes up and down huge waves.
Every few seconds
lightning flashes, illuminating the raft and Chuck holding
desperately to it, his eyes wild with fear.
RAFT - MORNING
The waves continue.
Chuck holds on, his face pale.
BADCHUCK
You can't make it.
GOODCHUCK
Shut up.
I don't feel like dying today.
OCEAN - DAY - LATER
The sky clears.
The waves are still big.
The fish are back.
And then come the sharks, cutting through the water.
Chuck
can't get up to get his spear, he just has to watch as blood
darkens the water.
And then the sharks are gone.
Chuck comes to his knees slowly, then a big wave hits.
Wilson is swept into the ocean!
For a moment Chuck is uncomprehending.
He watches as Wilson
slowly floats away.
CHUCK
Please, no sharks.
Then he dives in to the water!
Swims frantically after
Wilson.
Wilson floats away from him.
He swims, but he's so weak.
Finally he gets to Wilson.
He reaches out, but only pushes
the ball farther away.
It bobs on the waves.
Chuck treads water, exhausted.
Where is the raft?
CHUCK
Jesus.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Then he turns back the other way.
The raft has drifted by
him.
He can go after Wilson, or he can go after the raft.
CHUCK
Shit!
Wilson!
He swims toward the raft, barely moving.
No matter how hard
he swims, the raft seems to recede from him.
Finally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard,
choking, crying.
He struggles to pull himself on board.
But he is weak, so weak.
He can't do it.
Summoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again.
This time he slides on.
He lies on the raft, panting.
Then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet,
holds on to the mast, scans the ocean for Wilson.
CHUCK
Wilson!
Nothing but waves.
This is too much.
Chuck starts to cry.
RAFT - DAY - LATER
Chuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his
mouth, then swallows.
With his wet tongue he licks his
cracked lips.
The sun breaks through the clouds.
With what strength he has left, Chuck raises the canopy,
fastens it.
He sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees.
Closes his eyes.
Just for a minute.
OCEAN - DAY - LATER
A different sort of shadow crosses Chuck's face.
He opens
his eyes.
There, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty
tanker.
Someone shouts down in a language we don't
understand.
Chuck sits up, can't believe it.
Struggles to cover himself.
OCEAN - DAY - LATER
Chuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a
Jacob's ladder.
SHIP - DAY - LATER
Chuck steps on board, can't support himself.
The crew gathers around.
None of them speak English, but
there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection.
One man brings some water.
Another a blanket.
Another some
warm tea.
Chuck sits there, shivering now.
CHUCK
Thank you.
Oh thank you.
Deliriously happy.
Delirious.
PHONE CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER
We can see Chuck inside, staring at the phone.
PHONE CUBICLE
Stan answers the phone.
STAN (V.O.)
Hello?
CHUCK
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
The laughter again.
STAN (V.O.)
Whoever you are, you are one sick fucker.
And again we hear the dial tone.
HAWAII - BEACH RESTAURANT
A terrace by the ocean.
Tables filled with diners.
Food
being delivered by waiters.
So simple, eating.
So taken for
granted.
At one table sits Chuck, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
shorts, with a half-dozen plates in front of him.
He
gestures to the waiter.
Bring me more.
It all tastes so
damned good.
Behind him is the ocean.
Chuck doesn't glance at it.
HAWAII - DAY
Chuck's raft sits up on a dock.
Kelly stands staring at it.
How small and fragile it looks.
STAN
This stinks really bad.
CHUCK
You should have smelled me.
Stan examines the ropes around the logs.
STAN
Cool ropes.
CHUCK
I braided them.
STAN
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
CHUCK
Time I had lots of.
Kelly points at something on the raft.
KELLY
What's that?
CHUCK
That's my sea anchor.
My second one.
Made it out of part of the sail.
It
keeps you from capsizing in a storm.
In
theory.
(picks up his still)
And this, this I used to collect water.
About half a cup a day.
He's not feeling sorry for himself.
It's just a fact.
STAN
You were how long on this?
CHUCK
Forty-three days.
They look at the tiny raft.
It speaks for itself.
KELLY
All that time I waited to go on a cruise,
and you went without me.
CHUCK
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Kelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it.
KELLY
What's that, written on the sail?
CHUCK
My epitaph.
Kelly reads it to herself.
Her eyes are moist.
CHUCK
Bad body chemistry.
Made me a little
morbid.
But I'm all over that now.
And he seems really to believe it.
STAN
I'll be at the car.
(to Kelly)
Take you to the airport.
And he leaves.
KELLY
I buried you, Chuck.
They had to pry my
fingers off your coffin.
This interests Chuck to no end.
CHUCK
There was a coffin?
KELLY
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
CHUCK
What was inside?
KELLY
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo
pig sooey hat, some pictures of that
ketch you wanted.
CHUCK
That about sums it up.
KELLY
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
CHUCK
The plane went down.
My friends died.
I
washed up on an island.
Then I found
these barrels, built the raft, and here I
am.
KELLY
Yeah?
CHUCK
The tide came in, the tide went out.
I
survived.
That's the headline.
I
survived.
KELLY
Don't overwhelm me with the details.
(she smiles remembering)
You know how I hate that.
He tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how.
KELLY
(gently)
Come on.
Try.
CHUCK
Cliches, mainly.
Don't take anyone for
granted.
Don't sweat the small stuff.
Live each day like it's your last.
KELLY
So simple to say, so hard to do.
CHUCK
Not when you have no choice.
Kelly looks down at the raft.
It's so small.
KELLY
You hated being alone.
Couldn't stand
it.
Busy every minute.
Always plugged
into something.
CHUCK
I didn't know what really being alone
was.
No one back here does.
He has something more to say.
She waits.
CHUCK
We're not meant to be alone.
Not like
that.
Share life, that's what came to me
out there.
Be with someone.
And that's the point, isn't it?
We are social animals.
No
man is an island.
KELLY
This is so unfair.
CHUCK
That's what I told the fish I caught.
But I ate them anyway.
And the laughter comes again.
Kelly grins, embarrassed, a
little worried.
KELLY
You okay?
CHUCK
Great.
Really.
She stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, this
time with great tenderness.
He nods, her touch feels so good.
A wave of emotion comes over her:
pity?
love?
KELLY
What will you do?
CHUCK
I don't know.
I really don't know.
We hear a distant beep-beep, discrete as a car horn can be.
KELLY
I've got to get back to Memphis.
Hannah's babysitter has finals.
CHUCK
It means a lot...that you came.
KELLY
I had to come.
To be sure you were okay.
They hold each other.
For a long time.
KELLY
I love you, Chuck.
CHUCK
You too.
KELLY
I'm so glad you're alive.
Chuck grins.
CHUCK
You too.
Then she heads for the waiting car.
Chuck stands by his
raft, watching her go.
MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT
A FedEx MD-11 lands.
MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - MOMENTS LATER
The MD-11 taxis up.
As usual, the SuperHub is a frenzy of
activity.
A loading crew stands ready, forklifts poised.
Even this plane carries packages.
PHIL STEELE, the chairman of FedEx, Leslie, Becca, Dick, and
other executives wait on a special podium near the gangway.
Everyone looks different -- older, a mustache here, a
thickening around the belly there.
Behind a barrier a cluster of cameras film the scene.
The plane cuts its engine.
The stairs are rolled out.
Forklifts and gangways move forward.
Cargo doors open.
Chuck appears in the door.
He holds the FedEx Package and a
small travel bag.
Chuck blinks against the lights and the glare.
Stan is right
by him.
Everyone bursts into APPLAUSE AND CHEERING.
After four years of total solitude this is completely
overwhelming.
STAN
Smile.
Chuck smiles.
STAN
Wave.
And Chuck waves.
He's overwhelmed by all the input.
Stan
steers Chuck down the steps as the cheers continue.
At the bottom of the steps Roger steps forward.
The two
brothers embrace each other.
After a moment Roger
disengages.
Mary gives Chuck a hug.
MARY
Oh Chuck --
CHUCK
Where's Mom?
ROGER
Waiting for you.
At the farm.
This was
too much --
He looks around at the crowds.
CHUCK
Tell me about it.
Stan nudges Chuck.
Time to go to the podium.
ROGER
Glad you made it, big brother.
Stan and Chuck head for the podium.
All the loaders and
operators and package scanners begin to applaud.
Chuck
smiles, then laughs, getting into the emotion.
He keeps up
an almost indecipherable babble underneath the cheering.
Occasionally he sees someone he knows.
CHUCK
Wow.
Thank you.
Great.
Thank you.
Hey, Rasheed, how you doing?
Thank you
all.
SUPERHUB - WIDE
Chuck makes his triumphant way through this amazing
collection of cheering people like Moses parting the Red Sea.
SUPERHUB - PLATFORM
With a big smile Phil Steele holds out his hand to Chuck.
STEELE
Welcome home.
He steps to the microphone and addresses the SuperHub.
STEELE
This is an extraordinary moment.
And it
should be marked in an extraordinary way.
With something we have never done since
this company was founded.
(pause)
Stop the line!
SUPERHUB - SERIES OF SHOTS
All over the SuperHub, belts come to a halt.
Forklifts stop.
Tracking stations shut down.
The vast flow of packages is
suddenly still.
The incredible din of activity is suddenly
quiet.
The stillness and the silence are unexpected and
palpable.
Thousands of workers stop as well, staring either
up at Chuck directly or at his image on video screens.
We
hear Phil's voice piped in.
SUPERHUB - PLATFORM
Phil holds a plaque.
STEELE
Four years ago we placed this plaque in
honor of Charles Noland, and two just
like it in honor of Al Morris and John
Durham, the two brave pilots who went
down with him.
As he talks, we stay on Chuck, who is taking in this amazing
scene, not really listening.
STEELE
Chuck endured years of hardship and
loneliness.
Like Lazarus, Chuck has come
back from the dead.
Chuck, this is your
family, all of us.
So it gives me great
pleasure...to take this plaque...and to
present it to our long lost son.
Welcome
home.
He hands the plaque to Chuck.
Chuck acknowledges the cheers
of the crowd.
CHUCK
Thank you.
Thank you very much...
Everyone applauds.
CHUCK
Give me a minute.
I've spent four years
looking out at an empty ocean.
He laughs, a short brittle laugh, composes himself.
CHUCK
It's all so -- big.
You never think
you'll miss -- all this.
But I did.
I
really, really did.
And I missed all of
you.
He looks over at the hub.
CHUCK
You've added some new belts, and what's
that?
He points at some high tech equipment on the edge of the
shed.
STAN
Digital laser readers.
CHUCK
Digital laser readers.
Wow.
Terrific.
He looks around at everyone, doesn't know what else to say.
CHUCK
I've never heard it this quiet.
Shouldn't you all be getting back to
work?
The tension is broken.
Everyone laughs.
Phil Steele motions
with his hand.
Let it be done.
ANOTHER ANGLE - WIDE
The vast, incredible machinery creaks to a start.
Everyone
shakes Chuck's hand as he leaves the podium.
As he heads for the car, REPORTERS shout questions.
CHUCK'S MOTEL - THAT NIGHT
Chuck leaves the motel, the Angel Box under his arm.
He ties
it into a pannier on the side of a bicycle.
MEMPHIS - CHICKASAW GARDENS - NIGHT
Chuck sneaks up to a craftsman cottage and stands by a tree
with a swing on it.
Inside we see Kelly making dinner for
her husband, who plays with their daughter.
For a moment
Chuck watches through the window, and we watch with him.
Then the dog begins to bark.
CEMETERY - NIGHT
Chuck walks through the cemetery late at night.
He comes to
his gravestone, stares for a long moment at the inscription,
then takes out a spray can of paint and puts a HANDPRINT on
it.
He gets back on his bicycle and rides away.
HIGHWAY - DAY
Chuck rides his bicycle down a road leading into the South.
FREEWAY - DAY
Chuck negotiates an overpass crossing an Interstate Highway.
Headed in both directions, cars whoosh by beneath him.
HIGHWAY - DUSK - LATER
Chuck rides down a narrow road, shrouded in mist.
Moss drips
from the trees reaching over the road.
A car goes by.
Then
another, their lights like halos in the fog.
It's a mystical
scene, a passage.
ARKANSAS - NIGHT
Chuck gets off his bicycle in the rain and walks toward a
roadside cafe.
ARKANSAS - DAY
Chuck rides away from the small neat frame house, down a
country lane with trailers up on blocks.
GULF COAST - DAY
Chuck leaves a cheap motel as the sun comes up.
MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST - DAY - LATER
Chuck rides on a ferry, the wind blowing his face.
The sky
is gray and drizzly.
He smells the salt water.
Watches the
waves.
GAS STATION - DAY
Chuck asks for directions.
A kid in baggy pants and no shirt
points him down the road.
GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck pulls some clothes out of his saddle bags.
GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck emerges from the restroom wearing a FedEx shirt and
shorts.
BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER
A classic beach house.
Sand dunes, stilts.
Carrying the
Angel Wing Box under his arm, Chuck checks the address in his
hand.
Mounts the steps.
A light mist falls.
You can see
the Gulf behind the house, gray and moody.
A WOMAN, BETTINA, answers the door -- THE woman from the
beginning.
She wears cut-off jeans and a blue work shirt
covered with paint.
There's a tattoo on her ankle.
CHUCK
FedEx for Bettina Peterson.
The woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasn't seen
in years and never expected to see again.
BETTINA
Where did you get that?
Chuck displays a FedEx badge.
CHUCK
Charles Noland.
FedEx Special Projects.
Bettina notices Chuck's bicycle.
BETTINA
You came on a bicycle?
No wonder it's so
late.
CHUCK
There was an unavoidable delay.
Bettina stares at the package, her own memories coming back.
BETTINA
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.
You
never gave up.
CHUCK
No.
She holds the box and studies him for a long moment.
Something -- the look on his face, the extraordinary
reappearance of this long-lost package -- makes her curious.
BETTINA
You know what happened to this?
CHUCK
As much as anybody.
BETTINA
Want to come in?
Get dry for a minute.
CHUCK
Okay.
Sure.
She lets Chuck in the door.
BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER
Arms around each other, the Man and the Woman say goodbye to
Chuck.
In the front yard is a panel truck painted with two
angel wings.
The Man grins at Chuck, an easy, friendly grin.
MAN
Come back anytime.
Coffee's always on.
Don't even have to bring us a package.
CHUCK
That was my last one.
Bettina hands Chuck a sheet of paper.
BETTINA
The list of paints and brushes I did for
you.
He takes it, not exactly sure he wants it.
BETTINA
Keep painting.
Promise me.
CHUCK
Sure.
BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck rides his bicycle away, along the shore.
BEACH - MINUTES LATER
Chuck rides along the beach.
Up ahead we see a FedEx truck.
BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck gets off his bike as a female FEDEX DRIVER puts chocks
under the wheels, which have stuck in the sand.
CHUCK
Need some help?
DRIVER
You bet I do.
High tide comes right up
to this road.
BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck pushes on the truck as the driver gives it gas.
The
truck slowly pulls back onto the pavement.
BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
The Driver gets out of the truck with a grin.
She has an
open, friendly face.
There's an instant connection between
them.
DRIVER
Hey, thanks.
I'd never have got that out
by myself.
Looks at his uniform.
At the bike.
DRIVER
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
CHUCK
No.
Where is he from, anyway?
CHUCK
I used to drive one of those.
A long
time ago.
DRIVER
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.
You
want a lift?
I've just got one more
pickup.
CHUCK
Sure.
He picks up his bike.
BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
We are wide on the beach, watching the truck move along the
water, kicking up wisps of sand.
CHUCK (V.O.)
Yeah, a long one.
ERICA (V.O.)
I've got lots of time.
CHUCK (V.O.)
So do I.
The truck goes down the beach and then turns inland, away
from the ocean.
Away from all that.
CHUCK (V.O.)
So do I.
And we pull back, taking in the sweep of the beach, the
estuaries, and the green forest stretching back into America.
The end is the beginning.
FADE OUT.
