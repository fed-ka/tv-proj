      Two figures lie in a tangle of sheets.  A man and a woman.  
      He holds her from behind.  We see her face.  Intelligent.  
      Awake.  Something huge on her mind.  This is HOPE FOSTER, 25.

                                  HOPE S MOM (V.O.)
                    Dear Hope, if you re reading this, 
                    then I m gone...

      She stares at the cross-shaped medallion that she wears on a 
      long chain around her neck.  

                                  HOPE S MOM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...There are so many things I 
                    wanted to tell you while I was 
                    alive, but couldn t...

      The guy rolls away, and Hope's on the move.  Trying not to 
      wake him.  Picking up her clothes, as she heads for the door. 



      Hope, now dressed, makes her way down the stairs with a 
      suitcase.  Flower arrangements are everywhere        Sympathy 
      cards.  There was a memorial here last night.  

      She stops to look at A PHOTOGRAPH of her mother that sits on 
      the mantle beside the urn containing her ashes. 

                                  HOPE S MOM (V.O.) 
                    ...I hope you ll understand why.   
                    I hope you ll forgive me.  But most 
                    of all, I hope you won t make the 
                    same mistakes I did.

                                  DAVID (O.S.)
                    Don t go.

      She turns to see the man from the bed standing on the stairs.

                                  HOPE
                    Seconds from a clean getaway.

      She watches him approach, suddenly torn.  

                                  DAVID
                    Your life is here, Hope... with me.

                                  HOPE
                    I have to do this, David.        
                    There are things I need to know.                                                                                      2.


                                  DAVID
                    At least, tell me what the hell her 
                    letter said so I can understand.

      She stares, wishes she could, doesn t...

                                  HOPE
                    I m sorry.  

                                  DAVID
                    No, you re not.

                                  HOPE
                    David --

                                  DAVID
                    This big mystery of yours is just 
                    an excuse, isn t it?

                                  HOPE
                    That s not true.

      He studies her face, not sure what to believe...

                                  DAVID
                    Then tell me when you re      
                    coming back.

      Again, all she does is stare.  Clearly, she doesn t know.  
      Tears in both of their eyes now.  Finally...

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    I m not gonna wait forever

                                  HOPE
                    I m not asking you to.



      Hope reads a letter, nervously fingering her medallion, the 
      urn riding next to her.  This is the start of a long journey.

                                  HOPE S MOM (V.O.)
                    You know how I always told you that 
                    no one ever really knows anyone?  
                    That everyone has a secret?  
                    Well... this is mine.                                                                                      3.



      Cosmetics are spread everywhere  Now dressed in a suit, Hope 
      stares into the mirror.  The girl staring back is a stranger. 



      Jessica s eyes are on her Blackberry.  Adamson s are on her 
      thighs.  

                                    ADAMSON
                    She s right, you know?  One more 
                    seat and we could ve told them to 
                    stick their filibuster where the 
                    sun don t shine.

                                    JESSICA
                    I think you just did that, sir.

      Sensing his eyes on her legs, she crosses them, which, of 
      course, only reveals more of her thighs.  The garters come as 
      a surprise.  She never looks up from the Blackberry...

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Until you re confirmed, you really 
                    should try to be more... political.

                                    ADAMSON
                    Stop worrying.  You ll get your 
                    office at Justice.  The republicans 
                    couldn t stop my confirmation now, 
                    even if they wanted to.  
                          (then)
                    Are those the garters I gave you?

      She finally looks over, smiling slightly, then...

                                    JESSICA
                    I do have others, Senator.  And I m 
                    not worried about my office,     
                    I m worried about yours.

      The Senator slides closer.  Jessica s smile widens.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?                                                                                      5.


      He runs his hand along her calf.  She removes it. 

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    I told you... I m seeing someone.

                                    ADAMSON
                    And I m married.

                                    JESSICA
                    Good point.  Last time.

      With that, she closes the partition on their insouciant       
      DRIVER.  They kiss.   Hands tear at clothes.  And...



      Hope reaches the front of the long line, steps through the 
      metal detector.  BEEP.  

                                    CAPITOL POLICEMAN
                    Jewelry, keys, cell phone.

      She removes the medallion from her neck, dropping it into a 
      bowl, before trying again.  This time, there s no beep. 



      Hope stands before a large oak door, gazing at the placard:  

                        SEN. ROBERT WEBSTER -- (R) MICHIGAN

      She s working up the nerve to go inside, when she hears:

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    Tell him you like baseball.

      She spins to see CHARLIE MORRIS, 27, a very enthusiastic 
      reporter, waiting behind her.  He smiles.  

                                  HOPE
                    I hate baseball. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    No one hates baseball.

                                  HOPE
                    What are we talking about here?

                                    CHARLIE 
                    Your job with Senator Webster. 
                          (off her confusion)
                    You wanna get hired, you gotta 
                    impress Sperlock.  Chief of staff.  
                    Huge Tigers fan.                                                                                        6.


                                  HOPE
                    How did you know I was --

      He points to the resume in her hand.  She LAUGHS at herself.

                                  HOPE (CONT D)
                    Right.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Charlie Morris.  Washington Post.

      He offers his hand.  She shakes it...

                                  HOPE
                    Hope Foster... Intern wannabe.

      With a smile, he holds open the door.  She finally has no 
      choice but to step inside.  And...



        Post-coitus.  Jessica and Adamson pull themselves together. 

                                    ADAMSON
                    So do you love him?

      The question stops her.  Just for a moment.  Then...

                                    JESSICA
                    I d have to have a heart for that.

                                    ADAMSON
                    Careful, kiddo.  He s a player now.  
                    The West Wing ain t the senate.

      She looks out the window to hide the fact that she s already 
      thought of this...

                                    JESSICA
                    Trust me.  It s handled.  Now let s 
                    go over your testimony before we -- 

      He suddenly leans into her.  Smiling, she looks over.      
      The vacant stare surprises her.  She pushes him upright...

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    ... Senator?

      He falls limply into the seat.  She shakes him...

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Jack!

      Still nothing.  It s bad and she knows it...                                                                                      7.


                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    ... Oh God no.  

      She scrambles to the partition, BANGS on it...

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Vince!!  Help!!

      The partition slides.  The driver, VINCE, looks back, 
      instantly registering the crisis.  

      Jessica stares with growing horror at the Senator, as Vince  
      pulls to the curb, jumps out and rushes for the back door. 

      In seconds, he s inside, checking for breath, a pulse.  
      Finding neither, he throws his phone to Jessica...

                                  VINCE
                    Call 911!  

      He starts CPR.  Quickly realizes it s no use.  He pulls back, 
      looks at her.  Shakes his head.  Jessica can t believe it.  
      She lets out an involuntary SOB, then pulls it together...

                                    JESSICA
                    ... Oh God.  I can t be here.

      She hands back the phone.

                                  VINCE
                    What?  Why not?  You re his aide.  

                                    JESSICA
                    You know goddamn well why not!  
                    When they examine him, they ll  
                    know what we were doing.  

      With that, she wipes her lipstick off Adamson s cheek.



      Charlie and Hope wait.  STAFFERS, on computers, ignore them.

                                    CHARLIE
                    So how republican are you?

                                  HOPE
                    What?                                                                                      8.


                                    CHARLIE
                      Evangelical.  Fiscal conservative.    
                    Neocon.  All of the above.

                                  HOPE
                    Is that really what passes for 
                    small talk around here?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I could ask what you majored in.

                                  HOPE
                    Right.  Because that s much better.

                                    CHARLIE
                    So what did you major in?

      She looks at him, sees that he really wants to know.

                                  HOPE
                    Mixology.

                                    CHARLIE
                      Bartending?  Is that a doctorate 
                    program, or...

      Makes her smiles.  Which makes him smile.  

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                      Seriously.  All the hiring is on 
                    the other side of the aisle.  The 
                      republicans who didn t lose are 
                    bailing out, cashing in.  Your 
                    timing s all wrong.

                                  HOPE
                    Story of my life.

      There s truth in it.  Charlie s curious, but before he can 
      press Senator Webster s over-caffeinated chief of staff,   
      JIM SPERLOCK, 40, bursts from his office, headset on.

                                  SPERLOCK
                          (to his assistant)
                    Quick, Zeke.  The Lincoln quote we 
                    used at West Point.  What was it?

      The doughy ZEKE scrambles to a computer. 

                                  SPERLOCK (CONT D)
                          (tapping his headset)
                    New York Times!  New York Times!

                                  HOPE
                          (low, to Charlie)
                    I know this.  I just watched that  
                    speech on YouTube.                                                                                      9.


                                    CHARLIE 
                    Jim!

      Sperlock looks to Charlie.  Charlie looks to Hope.        
      Hope takes a deep breath, then...

                                  HOPE 
                     Nearly all men can stand 
                      adversity, but if you want to test 
                    a man s character, give him power.  

      All eyes are on Hope, as Sperlock repeats the quote into his 
      headset.  Charlie is impressed.  Zeke hates her already.   

      Sperlock hangs up, then steps toward them.  Both stand.

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Don t tell me you re with this guy.
                          (holding out a hand)
                    Jim Sperlock.

                                  HOPE
                    Hope Foster.  Actually, no...     
                    I m here about a staff position.

      She hands him her resume.  He doesn t look at it...

                                  SPERLOCK 
                    And they said there weren t any 
                      republicans left under 30.  
                          (then)
                    Zeke, are we hiring?

      Zeke, still stung, shakes his head...  

                                  ZEKE
                    No, sir.  Our waiting list has a 
                    waiting list.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You re gonna listen to Zeke?    
                    This girl bartended her way through 
                    school.  That s real world 
                      experience.  How many of these 
                    Facebook Activists can say that? 
                          (as heads turn)
                    No offense, guys.

      Before Sperlock can respond, his Blackberry CHIMES.   
      Charlie s plays T-PAIN.  The JAMES BOND THEME comes from 
      somewhere in the office.  Then MOZART.  RING TONE madness.  


              CHARLIE (CONT D)SPERLOCK
      Turn on CNN.Turn on Fox!

      Zeke turns on the tv: stock footage of Adamson on the stump.                                                                                      10.


                                    SHEPARD SMITH (ON TV)
                    Florida Democratic Senator Adamson, 
                    the President s nominee for  
                    attorney general suffered a massive 
                    coronary, and was pronounced dead 
                    only minutes ago at...

                                  SPERLOCK
                          (to Zeke)
                    Get me the boss!  Now!

      Hope looks to Charlie, sees him pull out a tape recorder.



      Jessica stops outside the door to Adamson s office.  The tv 
      inside is audible.  Here, it s CNN:

                                  WOLF BLITZER (O.S.)
                    Because Senator Adamson was riding 
                    alone in the back of the limousine, 
                    it s unclear how long he was... 

      Jessica takes a deep breath before striding through the door.



      The stunned STAFF is gathered around the tv.  Some turn.

                                    JESSICA
                    I just heard.  What do we know?

      She s looking around at the tear-lined cheeks when her 
      Blackberry BUZZES.  She checks it:

              From Evans, Lucky:  Just saw the news.  You okay? 

      Suddenly, A WEEPY STAFFER turns to face her...

                                  WEEPY STAFFER
                    ... Jess, what do we do?

                                    JESSICA
                    We take care of each other.   
                    That s what he would ve wanted.

      Then, without pause, she thumbs a response on her Blackberry:

                                        I NEED A JOB! 



      Eyes are still on the tv.  Zeke turns sharply to Sperlock...                                                                                     11.


                                  ZEKE
                    I have Senator Webster.

      Sperlock moves for his office, as he takes the call...

                                  SPERLOCK (INTO PHONE)
                    Hey, boss.  You watching this?

      He leaves the office door open.  Charlie angles closer.          

                                  SPERLOCK (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Sir, I know he was a friend, and 
                    I m sorry for your loss, but this 
                    means Justice is open again.  
                    They ll go back to their short 
                    list.  If the president reaches 
                    across the aisle this time, do we 
                    still wanna take his hand?

      Sperlock moves the phone from his ear to save his hearing.  
      Before the Senator can finish shouting, Sperlock s Blackberry 
      DINGS.  He checks it.  Again, the name  Lucky Evans  appears.

                                  SPERLOCK (CONT D)
                    You re right.  I m a cold bastard, 
                    but they re already calling.    
                    What do we say?

      He listens for another moment, then answers the Blackberry...

                                  SPERLOCK (CONT D)
                    The answer s yes.

      He hangs up, frozen for a moment, before pumping his fist.  

      That s when he sees Charlie and Hope watching through the 
      doorway.  Hope struggles to keep up.  Charlie is riveted.

      Sperlock smiles, as he approaches, takes the recorder from 
      Charlie, pops out the tape, then tosses back the recorder...

                                  SPERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Off the record.
                          (then; to Hope)
                    Stick around, barkeep. We may have 
                    something for you after all.

      Before Hope can respond, the door SLAMS.  She looks to 
      Charlie, shocked that she may have just gotten a job.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Timing is everything

                                            ACT ONE



      The subterranean hall BUZZES with the events of the day.  
      Hope waits in a pick-up line, feeling out of place, nervous. 

                                  WOMAN BEHIND COUNTER
                    Senator Webster!

      She steps up, takes a box filled with lunches and hurries 
      off.  Charlie falls into stride...  

                                    CHARLIE
                    So aren t you gonna thank me?

                                  HOPE
                    Thank you.  I now work for free.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Intern today, staffer tomorrow.  
                    Who knows, if they like you, maybe 
                    they ll take you to Justice. 

                                  HOPE
                    Justice?  

      He looks at her, realizes she s not being coy.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What do you think that phone call 
                    was about?  I m betting it was 
                    Lucky Evans.  Man, getting Webster 
                    would be his masterpiece.

      He looks over, sees Hope s confusion...

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    You have no idea what I m talking 
                    about, do you?

                                  HOPE
                    Yes, I do.  Lucky Evans.  The 
                      President s adviser.  He s cute.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Cute?  He s a killer.  Or was until 
                    he took this job.  I m talking 
                    about what he s doing.  You don t 
                    think it s brilliant?

      She walks a little faster.  Charlie hurries to keep up...

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Hey, slow down.  I have a question.                                                                                    13.


                                  HOPE
                    Yes, I have a boyfriend.

                                    CHARLIE 
                    Wrong question, but nice ego.  
                    Besides, I don t date my sources.

      It stops her.

                                  HOPE
                    I m not your source.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I was kinda hoping you would be.  
                          (then)
                    Sperlock put everything off the 
                    record.  You could put it back on.

      She s walking again.  So is he.

                                  HOPE 
                    An hour ago, you helped me get a 
                    job, now you want me lose it?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Trust me.  You ll be protected.  
                    I ll call you an unnamed staffer. 

      She steps into a waiting elevator, pushes a button.

                                  HOPE 
                    I m not a staffer.  I m an intern.



      Charlie follows.  Doors close.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Please, Hope.  This could be my big 
                    break.  The new President reaches 
                    across to the republicans to fill a 
                    huge job in his cabinet.  Webster s 
                    seat gets filled by the democratic 
                    governor of Michigan, putting the 
                    dems at sixty, and a filibuster 
                    proof super-majority.  It s genius.

                                  HOPE
                    I don t know.  I really don t think 
                    I should get involved.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Come on, I help you, you help me.  
                    That s the way the game is played.                                                                                    14.


      Before she can respond, the doors open, revealing a striking, 
      young naval officer.  Meet BEN MCGRATH, 27.  Without the 
      uniform, he d be a heartbreaker.  With it, it s unfair.

                                  BEN
                    Don t say a word.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I guess you re not done playing 
                    dress up, after all.

                                  BEN
                          (looking to Hope)
                    You think anyone would care if I 
                    killed a reporter?

      Hope s smile is a bit too wide.  Charlie notices this... 

                                    CHARLIE 
                    Hope Foster, Ben McGrath.  Ben 
                    works for Senator Buckley.  During 
                    the primaries he was her military 
                      credentials.  Now, he s an errand 
                    boy.  That s what happens when you 
                    pick the wrong horse.
                          (looking back to Ben)
                    Hope's got a boyfriend.

                                  BEN
                    That true?  Or were you just trying 
                    to let our boy down easy?

                                  HOPE
                    It s a long story.  

      He holds her stare.  She looks away...

                                  HOPE (CONT'D)
                    So how do you two know each other?

                                    CHARLIE
                    He lives in my building.

                                  BEN
                    He lives in mine.
                          (then; to Charlie)
                    Too bad about Adamson, huh?      
                    Jessica must be freaked.  How long 
                    you think until she s asking 
                    Buckley for a job?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Why Buckley?

                                  BEN
                    Who else they gonna give     
                    Justice to?                                                                                    15.


      Charlie and Hope exchange a knowing glance.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    What?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Nothing.

      Before Ben can press, the elevator stops, doors open.     
      Hope steps out, turning to Charlie before he can follow...

                                  HOPE
                    Thanks, I can take it from here.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You never answered my question.

                                  HOPE
                    The answer s  no .

      The doors slide closed.  Ben LAUGHS.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Shut up.  It s not what you think.

                                  BEN 
                    It s cool, bro.  If you like her,    
                    I ll leave her alone.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Leave her alone?  You saw her.   
                    She didn t even recognize you.

                                  BEN
                    You like her.

      The elevator stops at the next floor, and Ben strides out.



                                    CHARLIE
                          (following)
                    How could I like her?  She s been 
                    here five minutes.  Another one of 
                    these kids who woke  up one morning 
                    and thought it would be fun to 
                    change the world.

                                  BEN
                    Wait a second.  Isn t that what we 
                    think, too?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yes, but we ve thought it for a 
                    while.  Besides, she has a 
                      boyfriend.                                                                                    16.


                                  BEN
                    Should never stop you.
                          (then)
                    Why you following me?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Freedom of the press.

      Ben shakes his head, as they angle through a door marked:

            SENATE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING & URBAN AFFAIRS                                  
                ELLEN J. BUCKLEY (D-CA) -- CHAIRMAN           



      A hearing is underway.  At the witness table, a working class 
      family, THE LUNDS, is being questioned by the FULL COMMITTEE.   
      Behind them, the gallery is full of families just like them.

      We dip in to the testimony as Ben and Charlie head quietly 
      for the group of STAFFERS gathered near an anteroom door:

                                  SEN. SHAY
                    While I appreciate you all making 
                    the trip, and I understand why the 
                    President would want to have you 
                    here today, I would be remiss if I 
                    didn t ask why it is you think the 
                      government should be bailing you 
                    out of a loan you entered into 
                    knowingly and willingly.

      Ben and Charlie reach the staffers, stopping on either side 
      of RUBY COOKE, 27, pink suit.  Despite the seriousness of the 
      hearing, she s perky.  Just can t help it.  They WHISPER...

                                  RUBY
                    Nice uni.

                                  BEN
                    Yours, too.  

                                  MR. SHAY
                            (continuing)
                    Why not me?  I have a mortgage.  
                    Should the government help me?

                                  RUBY
                    Either of you talk to Jessica yet?       
                    She must be devastated.

      Before either of the boys can respond, JACK LUND, the man 
      with his family at the witness table suddenly stands.                                                                                      17.


      A HUSH falls over the room, as he struggles with what he s 
      about to say.  It looks like he might sit back down.  
      Instead, he finds strength in the faces of his kids, then...

                                  JACK LUND
                    Don t compare yourself to me, 
                    Senator.  No disrespect, but 
                    something tells me, if you got into 
                    trouble, the bank might make an 
                      exception.  Banks don t make 
                      exceptions for people like us.   
                    We re not asking for charity.  None 
                    of us are.  We just need a pause.  
                    A time out.  We ll get the money.  
                    We ll figure out a way to scrape 
                    by.  We always have before.  We 
                    just don t wanna lose our home.    

      His voice trails off in emotion, as he takes his seat.     
      His wife squeezes his hand under the table.  For a moment, 
      it s dead quiet, then...

                                  MR. SHAY
                    I see that my time is up.      
                    Thank you, Mr. Lund, for your 
                      testimony...  Madam Chairman?

      He looks back to the chairman s seat.  It s empty.  Eyes go 
      to the anteroom.  Charlie leans in to Ruby...

                                    CHARLIE
                    Where is Buckley anyway?

                                  RUBY
                    In with Mullin.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What did the Maverick from Memphis 
                    do to piss her off, this time? 

      Before Ruby can respond, a staffer opens the anteroom door in 
      time for this:

                                    SENATOR BUCKLEY (O.S.)
                    You re a democrat, goddammit!    
                    Act like one for a change!  

      The chamber quiets.  A moment later, the handsome SENATOR 
      MULLIN strides out, managing a smile.

      The tough-as-nails SEN. ELLEN BUCKLEY follows close behind.  

                                    BUCKLEY
                          (low)
                    No wonder the only place we lost 
                    was the south.                                                                                    18.


      Mullin s smile dies.  He whispers back, without stopping...

                                  MULLIN 
                    We lost the south when we lost  
                    God, Ellen.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    This might come as a surprise to 
                    you, Mark, but God doesn t vote.

      With that, they split.  He continues out of the chamber with 
      Ruby on his heels, as Buckley retakes her seat on the dais,  
      already wearing her most compassionate expression...

                                    BUCKLEY (CONT D)
                    Sorry about that.  We lost one of 
                    our most cherished friends and 
                      colleagues today.  Where were we?



      Mullin moves heatedly, a worried Ruby just behind.  She 
      manages to mind her own business for another few steps...

                                  RUBY
                    Sir, if you don t mind me asking, 
                    what was that about back there?

                                  MULLIN
                          (after a beat)
                    The President s going with Webster 
                    for Attorney General.

      Ruby nods, beginning to understand...

                                  RUBY
                    I take it Buckley thinks she d be a 
                    better choice?

      Mullin smiles.  Clearly, he likes being around Ruby.

                                  RUBY (CONT D)
                    I don t see why she d be mad at you 
                    for that.  Unless...
                          (as it hits her)
                    You re endorsing him, aren t you?

                                  MULLIN
                    The White House wants me to. 

                                  RUBY
                    They re smart.  You re a democrat.  
                    He s a republican.  Your 
                      endorsement gives both sides cover.                                                                                    19.


                                  MULLIN
                    She won t be a scheduler for long, 
                    ladies and gentlemen.

      Ruby beams, thrilled by her mentor s approval, then...

                                  RUBY
                    Oh my gosh.  Wait a second.  
                    Webster s from Michigan.  The 
                      governor s a democrat.  He ll 
                    appoint a democrat to fill the 
                    seat.  We ll get to 60.  We ll be 
                      filibuster-proof.  Why wouldn t 
                    Buckley be happy about that?

                                  MULLIN
                    Because Buckley wouldn t be the 
                    Attorney General.



      Jessica is feeding things into a shredder:  A holiday card 
      signed  Love Jack ; A note on the Senator s letterhead.

      Her assistant, the high-strung, perfectly tailored MILES, 25, 
      pokes his head in.  Before he can get a word out --

                                    JESSICA
                    Miles, I m sure on the campaign 
                    trail everybody just barged into 
                    each other s offices, and it was 
                    like  totally fun , but this is a 
                    real job now.  You will knock or 
                    you will die.  Is that clear?

      Miles nods.  Jessica starts to close the door, when she sees 
      the STAFF behind him huddled around a computer.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    What s going on?

                                  MILES
                    That s what I wanted to tell you.  
                    Check out the Huffington Post.

                                    JESSICA
                    What for?

                                  MILES
                    The Senator wasn t alone.

      Fear flashes in her eyes, but just for a moment...

                                    JESSICA
                    What are you talking about?                                                                                    20.


                                  MILES
                    There was a girl.

      She heads calmly for her computer, letting her deepening fear 
      surface, as she types in the web address...

                                    JESSICA
                    Arianna s as bad as Drudge.  If the 
                    driver says he was alone, then --

      The HUFFINGTON POST pops up.  The headline is bad: 

                                       WHO IS LADY X? 

      The photograph is worse:  A time-stamped, traffic camera shot 
      of A WOMAN S LEGS climbing from the Senator s limo. 

                                  MILES
                    Who do you think she is?

      Jessica shakes her head, struggling for composure.  And...



      Hope stands at her new desk, forcing smiles, as the JUNIOR 
      STAFFERS step up, dumping stacks of unwanted constituent 
      mail, before taking their lunches.  Zeke is last...

                                  ZEKE 
                    We should probably talk.

      Before she can ask why, her cell phone RINGS:  DAVID. 

                                  ZEKE (CONT'D)
                    Got something better to do?

                                  HOPE
                          (hitting  ignore )
                    No.  Sorry.

      Suddenly, Sperlock bursts from his office...

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Battle stations, people!  He s in 
                    the building.

      Everyone rushes back to their desks.  Hope tidies herself.  

                                  SPERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Zeke, coffee.

      Zeke nods, waits for Sperlock to disappear again, then...

                                  ZEKE
                    Hope, coffee.                                                                                    21.



      Hope s making coffee, craning to see into the office, excited 
      to get her first look at her new boss.  

      Finally, the outer door opens and SENATOR ROBERT WEBSTER 
      strides in.  Late 50 s.  Even his walk is charismatic.  

      That s about all Hope sees before Zeke fills the doorway...

                                  ZEKE
                      Star-struck much?

      She turns back to the coffee-maker.  Zeke studies her for a 
      moment, before stepping the rest of the way inside...

                                  ZEKE (CONT D)
                    You really wanted this job, huh?

      She looks back, as he holds up the papers in his hands.

                                  ZEKE (CONT'D)
                    Bad enough to lie on your 
                      background check?

      She reaches for it, but he pulls it away...

                                  ZEKE (CONT D)
                    Something you wanna tell me, Hope?

      Hope swallows.  This could be bad.  And...



                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    22.


                                            ACT TWO



      Hope stares at Zeke, her mind racing... 

                                  HOPE
                    I don t know what you mean.

                                  ZEKE
                    Oh, I think you do.  But before I 
                    show this to anyone, I thought I d 
                    give you a chance to explain.

      Hope s nervous, looks like she s about to confess to 
      something, when Sperlock strides in...

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Zeke?  My coffee?
                          (off Hope s expression)
                    What s going on?

      Hope looks to Zeke for mercy.  Instead, he hands Sperlock the 
      papers.

                                  ZEKE
                    Something came up on Hope s 
                      background check.  Seems she didn t 
                    really graduate from Michigan State 
                    after all.

      That stops her.  She looks relieved, but swallows it quickly.

                                  ZEKE (CONT D)
                    She still owes them 2000 dollars.

                                  HOPE
                    For parking tickets.  I finished 
                    all my course work, but --

      Sperlock holds up a hand, cutting her off, as he scans the 
      document.  Zeke smirks in anticipation of the firing.

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Guess we ll have to give her a 
                    paying job then, huh, Zeke?

      Zeke s face falls.  Hope tries not to smile.

                                  SPERLOCK (CONT'D)
                    And if I don t have a cup of coffee 
                    in my hand in thirty seconds, the 
                    job she gets will be yours.                                                                                    23.

                                  RUBY
                    Sorry, Mrs. Mullin.  Today was --

                                  MARTHA
                    I know all about it.  Now go on.  
                    The doctor s already here.  

                                  RUBY
                    Yes, ma am.  

      Ruby starts up the stairs, catching a glimpse of the Senator 
      in his study.  He sees her, too, mouths  thank you.   



      Ruby sits on the edge of the tub, staring disapprovingly at 
      her reflection in the mirror, when Martha slips in...

                                  MARTHA
                    Sorry, the doctor wouldn t shut up.

      Ruby forces a smile, pointing to the urine cup on the vanity. 

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                    You re an angel.  
                          (then; taking the sample)
                    Three months down.  Nine to go. 

      She looks back, smiles, doesn t leave.  Killing time...                                                                                      24.


                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                    Could ve been worse, right?  The 
                    judge could ve been a republican.

      Ruby forces another smile.  Martha checks her look in the 
      mirror, primps, decides that enough time has passed for her 
      to have filled the cup, then...

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                    Gimme five minutes to get the 
                    doctor gone, then you can get back 
                    to feeding the poor.

      With that, she breezes out.  Ruby shakes her head.  And...



      Ruby moves down the stairs alone.  The house is quiet save 
      for VOICES from the senator s study.  She stops to listen.  
      Can t quite make it out.  Wants to move closer.

      Instead, she thinks better of it, and continues for the front 
      door, when she hears...

                                  MULLIN (O.S.)
                    Ruby, is that you?  Come here.



      Ruby steps into the shadowy man cave, as Mullin stubs out a 
      cigarette.  He s bathed in the glow of the flat screen tv.  

      On it, C-SPAN is paused.  We recognize the earlier hearing.  
      Jack Lund stands, right hand up, taking the oath.

                                  RUBY
                    Does Mrs. Mullin know you re 
                    smoking again, sir?

                                  MULLIN
                    I lie to her about that.  She lies 
                    to me about the pills.  

                                  RUBY
                    Doesn t she smell it on you?

                                  MULLIN
                    She d have to get close for that.

      Ruby s pulse quickens.  Mullin s eyes linger on her a moment 
      too long.  He knows this, changes the subject...  

                                  MULLIN (CONT D)
                    Can I ask you something, Ruby?                                                                                    25.


                                  RUBY
                    Of course, sir.  Anything. 

                                  MULLIN
                    You think Bobby Webster would make 
                    a good Attorney General?

      She hesitates, surprised both by the question, and by the 
      fact that he seems to genuinely care what she thinks...

                                  RUBY
                    Yes.  I do.

                                  MULLIN
                    Better than Buckley?

                                  RUBY
                          (taking another beat)
                    Party aside?  Much better, yes.  
                    He s compassionate.  He s decent.  
                    He s brilliant.

      Mullin agrees, but after a moment shakes his head in dismay.

                                  MULLIN
                    I envy your generation, Ruby.  
                    Change is so easy for you.  
                      Unfortunately, my generation isn t 
                    going down without a fight.

      Ruby looks confused, but before she can respond...

                                  MULLIN (CONT D)
                    I m not endorsing Webster.

      Ruby is confused, tries to hide her disappointment

                                  MULLIN (CONT D)
                    If I do, then Buckley will kill the 
                      foreclosure freeze. 

                                  RUBY
                    ... What?  She wouldn t do that.  
                    It s a democratic bill.  For God s 
                    sake, people will lose their homes.

      He nods.  There s nothing she can say that he hasn t thought 
      about a hundred times.  Finally...

                                  MULLIN
                    Look on the bright side.  If she s 
                    running the Justice Department, 
                    she s not in the senate.  
                          (then)
                    Good night, Ruby.                                                                                     26.


      With that, he pushes play on the remote.  BUCKLEY S VOICE is 
      heard administering the oath...

                                  BUCKLEY S VOICE (ON TV)
                    ...so help you God?

                                  JACK LUND (ON TV)
                    I do.

                                  BUCKLEY S VOICE (ON TV)
                    Have a seat, please.  Tell us who 
                    you are.

                                  JACK LUND (ON TV)
                    Jack Lund.  I m a machinist.  We 
                    live in Pittsburgh.  At least we do 
                    for the next two months.

      Ruby just stands there, watching the senator watch the tv.

                                  JACK LUND (ON TV) (CONT D)
                    Once we get foreclosed, we ll be 
                    moving in with my wife s mother 
                    down in Scranton.

      Mullin shakes his head, genuinely moved by the pride 
      swallowing display.  Ruby wishes she could comfort him, 
      instead, she heads for the door.  And...



      CLOSE ON an original Warhol of Ted Kennedy.  

      We find Jessica on the sofa below, barely covered, her foot 
      in the lap of the handsome and equally naked LUCKY EVANS, 40.  
      He massages her feet.  The tv news is on without sound.  

                                    JESSICA
                    ... God, that feels good.  I 
                    usually don t go this far so soon.

                                  LUCKY
                    Me neither.  I usually draw the 
                    line at sex.

      Their eyes meet.  She s falling hard.  Scares her to death.  
      That s when something on the tv steals her attention:                                                                                    27.


      Adamson on the Capitol steps with Dana Bash earlier today.  
      Jessica at his side.  

                                    JESSICA 
                    Change this, Lucky.  

      Instead, he turns up the volume.

                                    ADAMSON (ON TV) 
                      ...Cynical politics like that cost 
                    them the White House and put them 
                    out in the cold.

                                  LUCKY
                    That would ve lost him a few votes 
                    for confirmation.

      Jessica nods sadly.

                                  ANDERSON COOPER (ON TV)
                    That was the three term senator s 
                    last public statement.  He was 51.

      Lucky turns it off.  Jessica swallows her emotion...

                                    JESSICA
                    What the hell am I gonna do now?

                                  LUCKY
                    We got seven freshmen staffing up.

                                    JESSICA
                      A freshman?  I had an attorney 
                    general.  A man who could ve been 
                      president.

                                  LUCKY
                    When?  In 8 years?  

                                    JESSICA
                    He could ve been president this 
                    year.  He s sure as hell more 
                    qualified than your guy.

                                  LUCKY
                    They didn t think so in Iowa.  

      She smacks him playfully in the arm.

                                  LUCKY (CONT D)
                    I m just saying, if you want I 
                    could make a call.

                                    JESSICA
                    Oh, you re cocky.                                                                                    28.


      Her hand disappears under the blanket as she says it.    
      Lucky writhes slightly from her touch.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Mm hmm.  Must be all the good press 
                    you re getting,  boy wonder. 

                                  LUCKY
                    You ain t seen nothing yet.

                                    JESSICA
                    Meaning what?

      Before Lucky can respond, there s a KNOCK at the door.  

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Go away.

                                  RUBY (O.S.)
                    It s Ruby.  I really need to talk.

                                    JESSICA
                    Later.  I ve got my hands full.

                                  RUBY (O.S.)
                    Please, Jess.  Something happened 
                    between Mullin and Buckley and I m 
                    not sure how to handle it.

      Lucky s expression changes.  He s curious.  Jessica sees it.

                                    JESSICA
                    Be right there, Ruby.

      But here eyes stay on Lucky.  Her mind races...

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    You re going with Webster for AG.

                                  LUCKY
                          (a weak attempt at denial)
                    What?  What are you --

                                    JESSICA
                    Shut up.  Buckley deserves the job.  
                    If she s pissed at Mullin, that 
                    means the little traitor s 
                    endorsing across the aisle.  
                    Webster was the only republican on 
                    the short list.  Tell me I m right.

                                  LUCKY
                    See what she wants.                                                                                    29.



      Ruby smiles as Jessica, now in her robe, opens the door.

                                  RUBY
                    Sorry to bother you.  I know it s 
                    been a rough day, but --

                                    JESSICA
                    Thanks.  So what s your drama?

      Ruby takes a moment to find the right words, then...

                                  RUBY
                    Okay.  What would you do if a 
                    senator was getting blackmailed by 
                    another senator not to do something 
                    they thought was in the best 
                    interest of the people.



      Lucky is sitting up, listening closely.

                                    JESSICA
                    First of all, grow up.  It s not 
                      blackmail, it s governing.    
                    Second of all, what the hell are 
                    you talking about?

      Ruby says nothing, still not sure how much to tell her.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Let me save us some time, okay?  
                    Because Mullin s a goddamn traitor 
                    he wants to endorse Webster for AG.  
                    Buckley wants the job, she deserves 
                    it, so she s holding a gun to 
                    Mullin s pretty little head.  

      All Ruby can do is stare, beyond impressed that she knew.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    What s in the gun, Ruby?

                                  RUBY
                    What?

                                    JESSICA
                    It s a metaphor, honey.

                                  RUBY
                    Oh.  Right.  Of course.  
                          (then)
                    The foreclosure freeze.                                                                                    30.


      It hangs there.  Just for a moment.  Jessica is impressed.

                                    JESSICA
                    Damn.  Buckley s an animal.  Unless 
                    you wanna get eaten, I d advise you 
                    to leave it the hell alone. 

                                  RUBY
                    Is that what you would do?

                                    JESSICA
                    I know what I wouldn t do.

                                  RUBY
                    What?

                                    JESSICA
                      I wouldn t fall in love with the 
                    married man I was working for.

      Ruby can t keep the shock from her expression.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    And we re gonna have to work on 
                    that poker-face. 

      With that, she closes the door.  The sound of ANOTHER DOOR 
      CLOSING turns her around.    

      Lucky s gone.  Momentarily stung, Jessica hurries across the 
      room, into the kitchen, and out the back door.  



      She emerges onto the service stairs, just as Lucky reaches 
      the door at the bottom...

                                    JESSICA
                    Where the hell do you think you re 
                    going?

      He stops, looks up at her, as she descends...

                                  LUCKY
                    Sorry, babe.  Politics never 
                    sleeps.

                                    JESSICA
                    That bill is Mullin s signature 
                      accomplishment.  You re never gonna 
                    get him to change his mind.

                                  LUCKY
                    I don t change minds.  I get people 
                    to realize what s in their own best 
                    interest.                                                                                      31.


      Jessica grins.  That s the sexiest thing he s said all night.  

      Lucky pushes through the door, smiling.  Jessica watches him  
      go, about to head back upstairs, when she spots a limo parked 
      on the street, Adamson s driver, Vince, behind the wheel.



      Hope stares out the window at the Capitol dome.  TV NEWS 
      plays in the background.  A RINGING on the line, then:

                                    DAVID S VOICE (OUTGOING MESSAGE)
                    Hey.  You ve reached David and 
                    Hope.  Please leave a message. 

      The familiar sound of his voice makes her smile... 

                                  HOPE 
                    Hey.  It s me.  Where you at so 
                    late?  Out with the guys, or trying 
                    to get lucky...
                          (the idea makes her sad)
                    Anyway... Sorry I couldn t talk 
                    today.  Things are crazy.  I got a 
                    job on Capitol Hill, can you 
                    believe it?  The people are 
                    actually pretty cool.  Well, most 
                    of them...  

      A photo of WEBSTER on the news steals her attention...

                                  HOPE (CONT'D)
                    Anyway, I m rambling now.       
                    Miss you.  Bye.

      She hangs up, instantly turning up the volume...                                                                                    34.


                                  MSNBC ANCHOR
                      ...According to an article on 
                      WashingtonPost.com, Michigan 
                    Senator Robert Webster will be the 
                      President s choice to replace 
                    Senator Adamson as his nominee for 
                    attorney general.  If true, this 
                    will have major political 
                      ramifications.   The story, written 
                    by the Post s Charlie Morris, is 
                      attributed to an unnamed 
                      congressional staffer...

      Hope s jaw drops.  Shock spins first into fear,         
      before giving way to anger.  And...




                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    35.


                                          ACT THREE



      Opulent.  Crowded with SENATORS and their GUESTS.  
        Conversation is WHISPERED.  The sound of deals being made.

      Mullin is being escorted to a table in the back, when Lucky 
      excuses himself from another table, and stands to meet him...

                                  LUCKY
                    Hello, Senator.  

                                  MULLIN
                    Mr. Evans.

                                  LUCKY
                          (lowering his voice)
                    We still a go on Webster?

      Mullin simply stares, torn.

                                  LUCKY (CONT D)
                    If you think there s someone better 
                    for the job --

                                  MULLIN
                    It s not that.

      Mullin s eyes find Buckley watching across the room.     
      Lucky follows his gaze, then...

                                  LUCKY
                    Don t worry about her.  You just do 
                    what you think is right.  Trust me.  
                    Your bill s gonna sail.

                                  MULLIN
                    How do you know?

                                  LUCKY
                    It s my job to know.

                                  MULLIN
                    That s cute.  But I m gonna need 
                    more than that.  This bill is 
                      important.

                                  LUCKY
                    Yes, it is.  Which is why you re 
                    gonna have to trust me when I tell 
                    you she s not gonna do anything to 
                    stop it.  Do you trust me?

      A look passes between them.  Clearly, Lucky knows something 
      that Mullin doesn t.  Finally, Mullin nods.                                                                                      36.


                                  LUCKY (CONT D)
                    Good.  Then enjoy your breakfast.

      With a smile, he moves back to his table, and sits back down.  
      Mullin hesitates a moment, before continuing to his.  

      All the while, Buckley looks on.  And...



      Talk about upstairs/downstairs.  The subterranean coffee shop 
      is a beehive of sleep deprived STAFFERS.  

      We find Charlie in line behind Ben, Miles and Ruby.  Each is 
        pre-caffeinated, and reading the paper, when Hope appears 
      from the front, carrying coffee and a paper of her own.

      Charlie sees her, blocks her path, touches the brand new 
      security pass dangling from a chain around her neck...

                                    CHARLIE
                    Look at you.  I was wondering if 
                    you survived your first day.

      Hope moves around him without a word.  He grabs her arm... 

                                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Hope, wait --

      She rounds on him, SLAPPING her paper into his chest... 

                                  HOPE
                    Nice scoop.  You re a bastard.

      It gets stares.  The paper drops, as Charlie leads her aside, 
      and lowers his voice...

                                    CHARLIE
                    You weren t my source.

                                  HOPE
                    Didn t stop you though, did it?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Slow down.  Just listen.

                                  HOPE
                    No, you listen!  I may not know how 
                    the game is played, but I do know 
                    right from wrong. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    You don t understand --                                                                                    37.


                                  HOPE
                    Thanks for helping me get the job, 
                    Charlie.  Have a nice life.

      With that, she marches off.  Charlie wants to go after her, 
      but before he can, Ben has his elbow...

                                  BEN
                    Whoa.  Trust me.  Let her go.

      The others fall in around them...

                                  RUBY
                    What d you do to that girl?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Nothing.

                                  BEN
                    He likes her.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Shut up, Ben.

      That s when Miles sees that Hope s newspaper has fallen   
      open to the classifieds.  Apartment ads have been circled.  
      He picks it up, wheels turning.  The others see it, too.

                                  MILES
                    What do you guys think?

                                  BEN
                    She s not a redhead, but --

      Ruby smacks his arm.  All of them now watch Hope as she 
      continues down the endless hallway. 


      ANGLE ON HOPE - 

      as she comes to a security checkpoint.  Still angry, she 
      holds her pass up to the CAPITOL POLICEMAN, before stepping 
      through the metal detector.  

      BEEP!  

      She removes the medallion, drops it in the bowl.

                                  POLICEMAN
                          (impressed)
                    Hey, a Navy cross.  You a war hero, 
                    or something?

                                  HOPE
                    Me?  No... It was my father s.

      She steps through again, takes back the medal.                                                                                    38.


                                  HOPE (CONT D)
                    First official day.

                                  POLICEMAN
                    Then do your father proud.

      Hope smiles, letting sadness show as she walks off.  And...



      Hope s  making clips , combing through periodicals looking 
      for any mention of Webster, and clipping the articles.  

      She s cutting out Charlie s article from today, jaw clenched, 
      when suddenly there s Sperlock addressing the group...

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Today s a good day.  I m in no mood 
                    for witch hunts.
                          (eyes on Hope)
                    But the next time an unauthorized  
                    leak comes from this office, I ll 
                    fire every last one of you just to 
                    make sure I get the right one.    
                    Is that clear?

      Nods all around.  Sperlock strides back into his office and 
      SLAMS the door.  Hope finally remembers to breathe.  And...



      Hope steps from the register, cheeseburger and fries on a 
      tray, looking for an empty table.  There are none.  

      She spots Zeke and her OFFICE MATES.  Although they know 
      she s there, they never look away from the tv.    

      Just when she s starting to feel like an outsider in high 
      school, there s Ben.  Sitting with Ruby, he waves her over.

                                  BEN
                    It s Hope, right?  This is Ruby.

                                  HOPE
                    Hi.  Yes.  Sorry you had to witness 
                    that little scene this morning.

                                  RUBY
                    Not a problem.  You get used to 
                    conflict around here.

      Hope sits, digs into her burger.  Ben digs into her fries.

                                  BEN
                    Fries for the table.  Nice.                                                                                    39.


      Hope looks to Ruby, follows her stare to another table, 
      catches Miles gesturing at her.

                                  HOPE
                    Wasn t that guy with you at the 
                    coffee shop this morning?

                                  RUBY
                    Miles, yeah.  He s great.  Total 
                    neat freak.  But in a good way.

      Hope catches Miles gesturing at her again...

                                  HOPE
                    What does he want?

                                  BEN
                    He wants to know if you ve had any 
                    luck finding a place yet.

                                  HOPE
                    How does he know I m looking? 

                                  BEN
                    You dropped your newspaper after 
                    you assaulted Charlie.  We kept it 
                    as evidence.

      Hope smiles.  Ben smiles back.  Ruby takes note.

                                  HOPE
                    Actually, I just started.  It s 
                    insane.  One number I called.    
                    The landlord asked for three months 
                    plus security.  I m thinking it 
                    must be pretty nice, right?  I get 
                    there.  It s in the projects. 

                                  BEN
                    So did you take it?

                                  HOPE
                    I m on the waiting list. 

      Ruby LAUGHS, likes her already.  

                                  BEN
                    Should we tell her, Ruby?

                                  HOPE
                    Tell me what?

                                  RUBY
                    Miles has an extra bedroom for 
                    rent.  It s in our building.

      For a moment, Hope looks excited, then she looks to Ben...                                                                                    40.


                                  HOPE
                    Wait a second.  If you live there, 
                    that means Charlie does, too.

      Before Ben can respond, it s RING TONE madness again.  
      Everyone is checking Blackberries, Ruby and Ben, too...

                                  RUBY
                    ... Oh my God.  He s doing it.    
                    How could no one tell me?!

      With that, she bolts for the door.  Ben and Hope are the only 
      two people in the room not on the move.  

                                  HOPE
                    So I guess I need your address.

                                  BEN
                    Thought you d never ask.  

                                  HOPE
                    To see the apartment, wise ass.  

      He smiles, knew what she meant, jots it down.  As she takes 
      it and rises, a PAGE delivering mail drops a letter in front 
      of Ben.  Hope glances at the envelope.

                                  HOPE (CONT D)
                    Or should I call you, First 
                      Lieutenant Wiseass?

                                  BEN
                    Just call me.

      She tries to hide her smile as she walks off, leaving Ben to 
      open the envelope.  His face falls.  A single, typed phrase:

                             TELL THE TRUTH.  OR I WILL. 



      As the press conference breaks up, Webster and Mullin head 
      inside, Sperlock and Ruby trailing behind.                                                                                      42.


      The sight of Senator Buckley watching at a window, waiting to 
      pounce stops her.  Jessica emerges at her side...

                                    JESSICA
                    Oh, this should be good.

      Ruby gives her a look, as the three senators come together 
      with forced smiles.  Buckley never looks at Mullin...

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Hello, Bobby.

                                    WEBSTER
                    Ellen.  We gonna have some fun at 
                    my confirmation hearing?

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Don t quit your day job just yet.

      Webster smiles for real this time, then...

                                    WEBSTER
                    I m gonna miss you, Ellen.
                          (then; to Mullin)
                    Thanks again, Mark.  Don t forget 
                    about Saturday. 

                                  MULLIN
                    Martha s looking forward to it.

        A handshake, and Webster walks off, taking Sperlock with him.  
      Mullin and Buckley stand there.  She still won t look at him.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Saturday?

                                  MULLIN
                    A party for his wife s charity.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    My invitation must ve gotten lost.

      Mullin smiles slightly.  Buckley finally looks at him...  

                                    BUCKLEY (CONT D)
                    Your foreclosure bill will be dead 
                    by Monday, I hope you know that. 

      With that, she puts an arm around him, posing for gawking 
      TOURISTS, before striding off.  Mullin hesitates, then moves 
      in the other direction.  Jessica looks to stricken Ruby...

                                    JESSICA
                    What are you waiting for?

      Ruby hurries after Mullin.  Jessica moves after Buckley.                                                                                    43.



      Jessica waits for Buckley to sign an autograph, then falls in 
      stride as she continues toward the cloakroom...

                                    JESSICA
                    Senator Buckley, hi, Jessica Sharp, 
                      legislative director for --

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Adamson.  I know.  I m sorry.

                                    JESSICA
                    Yes.  Awful.  Senator, I hope this 
                    isn t too presumptuous of me, but 
                    I d really like to join your team.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    You re asking me for a job? 

                                    JESSICA
                    Yes, ma am, I think you re an 
                      inspiration.  After Iowa, when 
                    Senator Adamson dropped out, I did 
                      everything but get down on my knees 
                    and beg him to endorse you-- 

                                    BUCKLEY
                    So that s what you do on your 
                    knees.

                                    JESSICA
                    Excuse me?

      Buckley suddenly stops just short of the cloakroom door.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Do you think I m stupid, Jessica?

                                    JESSICA
                    No, ma am.  I think you re -- 

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Ellie Adamson is my friend.

      Jessica pales, knows where this is going...

                                    JESSICA
                    With all due respect, Senator --

                                    BUCKLEY 
                    Don t you dare talk to me about 
                    respect.  Ellie devoted her life to 
                    that man.  She gave him three 
                    beautiful kids.  Perhaps you know 
                    them.  They re about your age.                                                                                    44.


      They re starting to draw stares.  Jessica s dying inside.

                                    BUCKLEY (CONT D)
                    So I m just asking... do you think 
                    I m stupid?  Because you must, if 
                    you think for one second that I 
                    would hire a woman like you.  Women 
                    like you are the reason there s a 
                    glass ceiling for women like me.  
                    Now, please excuse me...

      With that, she steps into the cloakroom, leaving Jessica 
      reeling.  Just before the tears come, she reigns it in.  
      Suddenly, there s a new resolve in her face.  A decision. 

      She whips out her Blackberry, and types to Lucky:     

           You re right.  It s different this time.  Call Webster. 




                                        END ACT THREE                                                                                    45.


                                          ACT FOUR



      Jessica pours a big glass of wine, phone to her ear.                                                                                    46.


                                    JESSICA
                    I m not nervous.  But you try 
                    having a job interview at a 
                    cocktail party.  

      We INTERCUT Lucky on the other end.  At his desk, he pours 
      over a file labeled with a single word:  BUCKLEY. 

                                  LUCKY
                    Relax.  Webster s gonna love you. 

                                    JESSICA
                    So what did Sperlock say?  Did he 
                    start foaming at the mouth?

      Lucky doesn t respond.  Something in the file stops him.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    That bad, huh?

                                  LUCKY
                    What?  No.  Sorry.  Just reading 
                    some opposition research.

                                    JESSICA
                    I didn t know we still did that in 
                    the new world. 

                                  LUCKY
                    Sometimes I really hate my job.

                                    JESSICA
                    Ooh.  Sounds juicy. 

      Just then, the door bell RINGS.  



      Charlie stands on the landing with Hope.  Jessica opens the 
      door.  Hope recognizes her from her arrival at the Capitol. 

                                    JESSICA
                    I m on the phone.  What?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Jess, this is Hope Foster.     
                    Miles isn t here to show her the 
                      apartment, so --

                                    JESSICA
                    That s because he s out getting my 
                    dry cleaning.

      Annoyed, she looks to Hope for the first time...                                                                                    47.


                                    CHARLIE
                    Can she see yours?  It s the same 
                    layout.

                                    JESSICA
                    Democrat or republican?

                                  HOPE
                      Republican.

                                    JESSICA
                    Good.  You d be the only one in the 
                    house.  We lost two in November. 
                      Evangelical or neocon?

                                  HOPE
                    Neither.  Moderate.

      Jessica looks her up and down for another moment, then...

                                    JESSICA
                    You ll pay your rent to Miles.  
                    You re his problem.
                          (looking to Charlie)
                    She s cute.  I don t see this 
                    ending well for you.

      With that, she SLAMS the door on them.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I think she liked you.

      Hope takes a moment to recover, then looks over at him...

                                  HOPE
                    You re not gonna believe this,   
                    but she s the first person I saw on   
                    the Hill.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You re kidding?

                                  HOPE
                    No.  Right before I met you.  I was 
                    standing at the steps, afraid to go 
                    up, already thinking I d made this 
                    huge mistake coming here, when I 
                    see this gorgeous, perfectly put 
                    together woman escorting a senator 
                    as if she was his boss.

                                    CHARLIE
                    That s Jessica.
                          (struck by a thought)
                    Wait a second.  That must ve been 
                    right before Adamson died.  Were 
                    they coming in or going out?                                                                                    48.


                                  HOPE
                    I don t know.  Why?

                                    CHARLIE
                    But they were together?       
                    You re sure about that?

      Hope nods, wondering about his sudden intensity.  Before she 
      can ask, he RINGS the bell again...

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    This ll just take a second.

      Jessica yanks open the door...

                                    JESSICA 
                    I m busy, Charlie.

                                    CHARLIE
                    She just needs to see the layout.  
                    It s the same as downstairs.

      With that, he steps right past her, into the apartment. 

                                    JESSICA
                          (into the phone)
                    Call you right back.
                          (then; to Hope)
                    Make it fast.



      Hope follows them in.  Charlie points to another door...

                                    CHARLIE
                    That would be your room through 
                    there.  This one has a better view.

      Hope looks to Jessica for permission.  Jessica gestures for 
      her to go ahead.  Charlie waits until Hope is gone, then...

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    I m doing a follow-up on Adamson.  

                                    JESSICA
                    How nice for you.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Any ideas on Lady X?  

      That stops her.  Just for a moment...

                                    JESSICA
                    I heard the photo was a fake.                                                                                    49.


                                    CHARLIE
                    I heard that, too.  Still, I was 
                    thinking I d give the driver a 
                    call.  You have his number?  

      Jessica looks at him.  The vulnerability in her face 
      surprises the hell out of Charlie. 

                                    JESSICA
                    If I ask you to drop it, will you?

                                    CHARLIE
                    That depends on why you re asking 
                    me to drop it.

                                    JESSICA
                    I m worried about his legacy.

      Charlie stares, doesn t believe her.  She knows it...

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    I d owe you one, Charlie.

                                    CHARLIE
                    A big one.

      She nods. The deal hangs there in the air between them for a 
      moment, before Hope steps back into the room...

                                  HOPE
                    It s really great.  Thank you.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hope s working for Webster.

                                    JESSICA
                          (suddenly interested)
                    Really?  Any sense in the office 
                    how far left he s willing to move 
                    to get confirmed? 

      Hope looks lost.  

                                    CHARLIE
                      Yesterday, was her first day.

                                    JESSICA
                    Oh.  Well, don t worry, honey, 
                    brains and boobs are a rare 
                      combination in this town.  
                          (opening the door)
                    Show her the roofdeck.  That s the 
                    deal closer.

      Hope leaves.  Charlie notices the BLANK WALL above the sofa.                                                                                    50.


                                    CHARLIE
                    Hey, what happened to Teddy?

                                    JESSICA
                    Sold it.  Unemployment s expensive.



      Charlie is helping Hope carry her mattress into her new 
      bedroom, when the phone RINGS.  They stop.

                                  HOPE
                    My first call!  Oh my God!

      Her enthusiasm is contagious.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You gonna get it?

      She stands there for another moment, then rushes into the 
      bedroom for the phone.  

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    I ll go for the next load.

      With that, he walks out grinning, excited she s moving in.



      Charlie struggles to get a box up the stairs.                                                                                    57.



                                    CHARLIE
                    Last one.  Where do you --

      That s when Hope breezes through the door in a little black 
      dress, heels in her hand, clearly in a hurry... 

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    ... Wow.  You look... wow.

                                  HOPE
                    Yeah?  That was Zeke.  The whole 
                    staff s invited to a party at the 
                    Senator s house.  I gotta go.  
                    Sorry.

      Just like that, she s gone.  Charlie takes a beat, then...

                                    CHARLIE
                    You re welcome.

      He sets the box down, when the phone RINGS again.  He looks 
      into the hall, but she s already gone.  The machine BEEPS...

                                  DAVID (ON THE MACHINE)
                    It s David.  You there?  Pick up. 

      Charlie can t resist listening, moves closer. 

                                  DAVID (ON THE MACHINE) (CONT'D)
                    Okay, look.  Some guy called from 
                    Senator Webster s office asking  
                    questions about you and your mom.  
                    What the hell s going on?  You in 
                    trouble?  God, I hate that I can t 
                    take care of you there!    
                          (a heavy SIGH; then)
                    You know what, screw it.  I should 
                    just get on a plane.

      Beat.  Beat.  CLICK.  Charlie s mind races.  Against better 
      instincts, he looks at the caller ID, jots down the number.



      POP!  Champagne flows.  The black tie party is in full swing.    

      Zeke works the door, guest list in hand.  He smiles at Hope 
      as she makes her way up the steps.  She smiles back...

                                  HOPE
                    Thanks for calling, Zeke.       
                    Very cool of you.

                                  ZEKE
                    You clean up nice, Foster.  That 
                    dress ll go great with your apron.  

      Her face falls.  She should ve known.    

                                  ZEKE (CONT D)
                    We re short a server.  Use the 
                    kitchen entrance, okay?  



      Hope carries a tray of hors d oeuvres through the elegant 
      crowd.  The apron now hides the dress.  

      She comes to Jessica and Lucky chatting conspiratorially.

                                  HOPE
                    Jessica.  Hey.

      Jessica considers her for a moment, then simply places her 
      empty glass on the tray and leads Lucky toward Webster. 

      Hope watches, curious, as Lucky introduces the Senator to 
      Jessica.  The charm offensive is clear, even from here.

      Sperlock appears beside Hope.  He s watching them, too...

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Thanks for helping out.                                                                                    59.


                                  HOPE
                    No problem, sir.
                          (then; re: Jessica)
                    If you don t mind me asking... 
                    isn t she a democrat?

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Yep.  Kinda like inviting the fox 
                    into the henhouse, isn t it?

      With that, he moves to join the conversation.

      As Hope angles closer, Zeke appears, an unopened bottle of 
      Dom in each hand.  He sets them on the tray, then... 

                                  ZEKE
                    Too many empty glasses.  Go.

      Hope forces a smile, then moves to ditch the tray.  As she 
      passes the group around Webster, WE STAY BEHIND. 

                                    WEBSTER
                    It s a big change, Jessica.   
                    You ll be making lots of enemies.  

                                    JESSICA
                    That makes two of us, sir.

      There s a beat, as Sperlock and Lucky wait to see how the 
      Senator will react.  When he smiles, only Lucky is relieved

                                    WEBSTER
                    Think they ll trust us eventually

                                    JESSICA
                      Absolutely.  In the meantime,     
                    we can tap their phones.

      That s when the RING TONE chorus begins.  There s a BUZZ in 
      the room, as the news spreads.  Sperlock turns to Lucky.

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Best laid plans, huh?

                                    WEBSTER
                    What s happening?

                                    JESSICA
                          (looking at Lucky)
                    Politics.

                                  SPERLOCK
                    Looks like the democrats won t get 
                    to 60 after all.                                                                                    60.


                                    WEBSTER
                    The Governor named a republican?  
                    Can he do that before I ve stepped 
                    down?

                                  LUCKY
                    It s not your seat, sir, it s 
                      Adamson s. 
                          (gesturing to the TV)
                    Would you mind?

      Webster turns on the TV, already tuned to CNN.  The entire 
      room goes silent, gathers to watch a press conference: 

      A MAN and a WOMAN pose for pictures at a podium.  She s the 
      democratic Governor of Florida.  He s about to become their 
      republican senator.  If he looks straight out of central 
      casting, that s because he is.

                                    JESSICA
                    Oh my God.  Lance Mann?

                                  SPERLOCK
                          (to Lucky)
                    What did you do to piss her off?

                                  LUCKY
                    She s being investigated.  The 
                    President won t drop it.

      That s when the Governor fields an unheard question...

                                  GOVERNOR MITCHELL
                    That s ridiculous.  Lance Mann is 
                    more than an actor, he s an icon.  
                    And while I realize the expectation 
                    was for me to appoint a democrat to 
                    fill Senator Adamson s seat, it s 
                    in the spirit of bipartisanship 
                    sweeping this nation thanks to our 
                      President, that I offered him the 
                    role of a lifetime, and he 
                    accepted.

      Jessica looks to Lucky, knows he s dying inside.  

      Jessica wants to go comfort him, but doesn t.  Instead, she 
      looks back to her new boss, Webster...

                                    JESSICA
                    How come all the action heroes are 
                      republicans?

      Nervous LAUGHTER.  As the press conference continues, 
      Jessica s eyes return to Lucky.  And...                                                                                    61.



      Hope emerges from the kitchen with two more bottles of 
      champagne, nearly back to the party, when she hears:

                                  BILLY WEBSTER (O.S.)
                    Hey, can I get one of those?

      She turns, sees the relentlessly cute BILLY WEBSTER, 17, 
      standing in the doorway of his father s study.  Obviously 
      drunk, he likes what he sees...

                                  BILLY   
                    Well, hello.  I m Billy.
                    Lose the apron, and come hang.

      He gestures over his shoulder to the PACK OF TEENAGERS 
      visible on the lawn beyond the study s French doors.

                                  HOPE
                    Aren t you like 17?

                                  BILLY
                    18 next month.  I ll be legal.

      He reaches for a bottle.  She pulls it back...

                                  HOPE
                    Not to drink, you won t.

                                  BILLY
                    Oh, man, you re not one of my dad s 
                    narcs, are you?  

                                  HOPE
                    Go outside and play, Billy.

                                  BILLY
                    You sure?  Last chance.

      Hope LAUGHS, shaking her head.  Billy backs into the study, 
      grabbing a crystal decanter of whiskey, as he struts outside 
      to join his FRIENDS.

      Hope s about to return to the party, when something on the 
      wall in the study steals her attention.



        A photograph of A YOUNG WEBSTER in the cockpit of a Vietnam 
      era fighter jet draws her inside.  

      She smiles at the striking young soldier, then, realizing 
      where she is, spins to hurry back out.

      This time, the frame that stops her sits on a shelf.                                                                                      62.


      In it, Webster s military medals and ribbons are on display. 

      She picks up the frame.  There s AN EMPTY SPACE IN THE SHAPE 
      OF A CROSS where one of the medals should be.

      Her eyes FILL, as she pulls her father s medallion from her 
      shirt, and holds it up to the empty space.  

      It fits perfectly.

      Suddenly, the PARTY NOISE gets louder.  Someone s coming.

      Hope puts the frame down, and hurries back to the door.

      She checks the hallway, eyes widening, when she sees Webster 
      slipping from the party.  For the moment, his back is turned.



      Hope seizes the opening, and steps out, remembering to tuck 
      the medallion back into her shirt, just as the Senator turns. 

                                    WEBSTER
                    You wouldn t happen to have seen my 
                    son?  17.  Dark hair.  Dangerous 
                    look in his eyes.

      Hope s heart is in her throat, finally she manages...

                                  HOPE
                    Um... No, sir.  I... haven t.

      He looks more closely now, recognizes her...

                                    WEBSTER
                    You work in my office.

                                  HOPE
                    Yes, sir.  I started this week.

      His eyes look her up and down.

                                    WEBSTER
                    You hoping to come with us to 
                    Justice?

                                  HOPE
                    Yes, sir.  Hoping.  Absolutely.

                                    WEBSTER
                    Why?

      Hope stares, doesn t have an answer, mentally kicks herself.  
      Webster smiles warmly...                                                                                    63.


                                    WEBSTER (CONT D)
                    It s alright.  You can get back   
                    to me.
                          (holding out his hand)
                    Thanks for your hard work...

                                  HOPE
                    Hope.  Hope Foster.

      It s all she can do not to cry, as she takes her father s 
      hand for the first time.

                                    WEBSTER 
                    Hope.  Beautiful name. 

      With that, he heads for his study, looking back to the 
      practically trembling Hope...

                                    WEBSTER (CONT D)
                    If anyone asks, you didn t see me.

                                  HOPE
                    Yes, sir.

                                    WEBSTER
                          (with a wink)
                    I hope I can trust you.

      She forces a smile.  He moves into his study, closes the 
      door, and she s alone.  As she stands there, we hear her 
      mother s voice...  

                                  HOPE S MOM (V.O.)  
                    We met during his first campaign.  
                    I was a volunteer.  He was married.  
                    He never knew I was pregnant, or 
                    where I went after he won...



      Just home from the party, Hope stands at a dresser, opens a 
      drawer.  In it, we see the urn holding her mother s ashes. 

      She removes her father s medal, and sets it beside the urn.

                                  HOPE S MOM (V.O.) 
                    ...I never wanted to hurt him.    
                    He had the potential for so much 
                    good.  I wonder if he still does?

      Suddenly, there s a KNOCK, and she turns, surprised to see 
      Miles watching her from the doorway.  He holds up a beer...

                                  MILES
                    C mon.  We re all up on the roof.                                                                                    64.
