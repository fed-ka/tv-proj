      Zach.  An unhappy Zach.  He comes down the steps of the 
      school, onto the sidewalk, when...  Honk-honk.  Zach looks 
    up, sees a dusty second-hand Mini-Coop pulling up.  He goes 
      over to it, leans down.  

                                  BECCA
                    Zachary.

      Becca in the driver s seat. 

                                  ZACH
                    Hey.

                                  BECCA
                    So how s Martin Luther King?

                                  ZACH
                    He s good.

                                  BECCA
                    Want to come over?  My parents are 
                    into compartmentalized living.

      Zach shrugs, looks back toward school.  

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    I got a cell-- if you wanna see if 
                    it s alright.

                                  ZACH
                    It s alright.

    And Zach gets in the car.  It takes off into traffic.
