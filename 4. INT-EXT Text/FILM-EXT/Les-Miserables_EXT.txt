RISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean, seething
in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air.
Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest
of tall masted warships.
The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their
rigging.
Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships
under construction, and warships being refitted.
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
Toulon
Home port of the French navy

1
Storm-lashed sea and driving rain. A great wave rises up
and hammers down. As it recedes we see the figures of men
heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over
their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal:
these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved,
wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched
onto them.
Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being
hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts
broken, rising and falling on the surge.
As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we
follow the straining ropes down into the base of the
slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist
in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and
spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he
seems to feel nothing.
2.
The convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the
rope -
CONVICTS
Ha - Ha -
CONVICT 3
Ha - Ha -
Look down, look down
Don't look them in the eye
CONVICTS
Look down, look down
You're here until you die.
CONVICT 4
No God above
And Hell alone below
CONVICTS
Look down, look down
There's twenty years to go.
The camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge
of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed
and expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of
the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the
steep steps of the dock wall.
Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of
half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in
the mist.
FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is
almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.
CONVICT 2
I've done no wrong
Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!
CONVICTS
Look down, look down
Sweet Jesus doesn't care.
CONVICT 5
I know she'll wait
I know that she'll be true -
CONVICTS
Look down, look down
They've all forgotten you.
CONVICT 1
When I get free
You won't see me
Here for dust!
3.
CONVICTS
Look down, look down
Don't look'em in the eye.
CONVICT 3
How long, O Lord
Before you let me die?
CONVICTS
Look down, look down
You'll always be a slave.
Look down, look down
You're standing in your grave.
With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the
damaged ship onto the slipway.
CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust
of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean.
Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent
command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he
drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the
great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks
water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the
mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.
Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the
chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm
is passing now, blown by the driving wind.
Javert approaches Jean Valjean.
JAVERT
Now Prisoner 24601.
Your time is up
And your parole's begun.
You know what that means?
VALJEAN
Yes. It means I'm free.
JAVERT
No! It means you get
Your yellow ticket-of-leave.
He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper.
JAVERT
This badge of shame
You'll show it everywhere.
It warns you're a dangerous man.
VALJEAN
I stole a loaf of bread
My sister's child was close to
death
And we were starving.
4.
JAVERT
You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of
the law.
VALJEAN
I know the meaning of those
nineteen years
A slave of the law!
JAVERT
Five years for what you did,
The rest because you tried to
run.
Yes, 24601!
VALJEAN
My name is Jean Valjean!
JAVERT
And I'm Javert!
Do not forget my name.
Do not forget me -
24601!
He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're
marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in
that he is free at last.
The convicts sing as he goes.
CONVICTS
Look down, look down
You'll always be a slave.
Look down, look down
You're standing in your grave.

Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on
his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and
there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide
vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the
distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and
below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the
musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first
time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope.
VALJEAN
Freedom at last -
How strange the taste!
Never forget the years - the waste,
Nor forgive them for what they've
done.
They are the guilty - Everyone!
The day begins

VALJEAN (cont'd)
And now lets see
What this new world
Will do for me!

Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin
coat close round him against the cold winter wind.
He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches
the OVERSEER.
VALJEAN
Monsieur can I help? A day's work?
The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap.
OVERSEER
Take your hat off.
Valjean takes his hat off, revealing his shaved and scarred
head.
OVERSEER
Passport.
The overseer scans the yellow paper, and hands it back.
OVERSEER
No work here.

SCENE OMITTED

Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains.
Snow on the ground here, and darkness falling.
He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff,
its lights twinkling, the snowy mountains rising behind.
The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of
refuge. This is Digne.
6A
6A
Valjean enters Digne. As he drinks from the fountain, he sees
a guard standing outside the Mairie.
6.
6B
6C
Valjean walks down the high street, spies the warm glow of an
inn and enters.
7
7A
Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes
down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways,
but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure
follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'.
Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a
stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his
heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife
before him, his children on either side. Nothing special,
and yet everything he's never had.
8
8
He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell
hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open.
7.
VALJEAN
Jailer. Would you let me stay here
for tonight?
JAILER
This is a prison, not an inn. Get
yourself arrested. Then we will
open up for you.
The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some
children who have been following begin throwing stones at
him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter.
8A
8A
He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret.
Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some
straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an
enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel.
8B
8B
Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry,
weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from
where the dog has bitten him.
At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a
dark churchyard.
9
9
Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean
collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the
shelter of a doorway.
A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches,
throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest
on the crumpled figure of Valjean.
He stirs and opens his eyes.
VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness.
Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The
BISHOP.
BISHOP
Come in, sir, for you are weary
And the night is cold out here.
Though our lives are very humble
What we have we have to share.
Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes
with the Bishop into the house by the church.
8.
10
12
Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He
crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's
gone.
13
15
Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and
reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies
the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley
below.
VALJEAN
Another story must begin!
He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces
out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind.
FOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind
then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper
dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and
accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne
far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the
heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to
tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through
time and space - down to discover -
16
16
The camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long
muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of
Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out
to the sea. We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of
the estuary along the dockside of the town, and red brick
factory buildings.
13.
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
Eight years later
Montreuil-sur-Mer, 1823.
The camera closes in to ground level to reveal the
horseriders:
Javert, flanked by two policemen.
16A
16A
As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered
around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to
get in.
BEGGARS' CHORUS
At the end of the day you're
another day older
And that's all you can say for
the life of the poor.
It's a struggle! It's a war!
And there's nothing that anyone's
giving.
One more day standing about -
What is it for?
One day less to be living.
Javert sees the destitution of the people. Expressionless
as ever.
BEGGARS' CHORUS
At the end of the day you're
another day colder
And the shirt on your back
doesn't keep out the chill.
And the righteous hurry past
They don't hear the little ones
crying
And the plague is coming on fast
Ready to kill -
One day nearer to dying!
TRACK PAST a plague victim, wrapped in a shroud, being thrown
onto a cart.
The police enter the harbour.
17
17
The beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for
the police.
14.
BEGGARS' CHORUS
At the end of the day there's
another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is
waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any
second
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning still to be
reckoned
And there's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day!
Javert looks round at the factory buildings, the boats in
the harbour, the poor clamouring behind him, and rides on.
18
SCENE OMITTED

19
Heavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods.
Workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the FOREMAN
strides in through the doors, gesturing to a cart driver,
FAUCHELEVENT, who's taking a quick rest on a crate.
19A
24
Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and
down the muddy track beyond to discover -
A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver -
Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a
crate.
The
cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart
off
the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is
too
soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in
the
mud.
Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help,
but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground.
All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing
Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him.
Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart
have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws
himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces
himself to lift it from beneath.
VALJEAN
Get back! It may fall!
FOREMAN
No, Monsieur le Mayor!
CROWD
It'll kill you as well!
21.
Javert stands back and looks on. As he looks, we see a
memory stirring in him.
JAVERT'S POV - Valjean's posture beneath the cart is
exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast.
The same crouching power. The same almost-suicidal
determination.
Valjean sees Javert looking at him, and knows exactly what
he's thinking. For a moment he hesitates. Then he hears
Fauchelevent's choking scream as the mud gags his mouth.
Valjean strains every muscle, and slowly one end of the
cart begins to rise. As soon as it clears the crushed and
gasping man, the others pull him clear.
Valjean lets the cart down again, and climbs out. As he
brushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him.
JAVERT
Can this be true?
I don't believe what I see!
A man your age
To be as strong as you are!
A memory stirs...
You make me think of a man
From years ago
A man who broke his parole..
He disappeared.
He shakes his head, realising how absurd his suspicions
are.
JAVERT
Forgive me, sir.
I would not dare -
VALJEAN
Say what you must.
Don't leave it there.
Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more.
Javert is not yet confident enough to continue.
Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent.
VALJEAN
Let me help you up.
Fauchelevent groans as he rises.
FAUCHELEVENT
Monsieur le Mayor, you come from
God!
You are a saint!
VALJEAN
No more cart driving for you!
22.
Javert stares. He can't rid himself of his suspicion.
JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor.
He draws himself up and gives a bow. As he walks away, he
discusses something with his assistant.

Fantine makes her way to the harbour wall. Beggars shelter in
the tunnels under the red brick buildings.
26
26
Fantine makes her way down
wet slimy steps. This leads to an
alleyway that runs down to
the harbour and three ships lying
on the mud at low tide. At
the far end, the largest is the
rotting hulk of a vast old
warship. A single whore sits in a
doorway.
FANTINE
Excuse me, is this where the
Pawnbrokers is?
WHORE 1
(pointing)
It's just there.
FANTINE
Thank you.
Drunken sailors spill out into the alleyway below. The
first sailor is trying to find the whorehouse.
SAILOR 1
I smell women!
Smell'em in the air!
Think I'll drop my anchor
In that harbour over there!
They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. Fantine presses
on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors.
SAILOR 2
Lovely ladies!
Love `em till your broke!
Seven months at sea can make you
Hungry for a poke!
The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows
of warehouse doorways.
SAILOR 3
Even stokers need a little stoke!
23.
A man with no legs, reacting to the sailors, cranks up an
organ-grinder and from doorways and overhead windows
harbour whores appear and tout for business.
A man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear
fragments of his sales pitch.

During the above chorus, Fantine sells a locket containing a
cutting of Cosette's hair to the pawnbroker.
PAWNBROKER
Hello sweetheart, I'll give you
four francs.
FANTINE
It's worth at least ten.
The pawnbroker goes back in his shop and Fantine watches the
whores.
FANTINE
Alright, five.
The pawnbroker takes the locket in exchange for the money.
An old woman leers at Fantine from the shadows, beckoning.
She approaches Fantine, reaching out to stroke her hair.
HAIR CRONE
What pretty hair!
What pretty locks you've got
there!
What luck you got.
It's worth a centime, my dear!
I'll take the lot!
FANTINE
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!
HAIR CRONE
Let's make a price.
I'll give you all of ten francs.
Just think of that!
24.
FANTINE
It pays a debt...
HAIR CRONE
Just think of that.
FANTINE
What can I do? It pays a debt.
Ten francs may save my poor
Cosette.
The hair crone leads Fantine down to her shop at the base of
the stairs.
Fantine is sat on a low stool. She bows her head before the
hair crone, who at once whips out a razor blade and cuts
off her hair at the roots.
26A
26A
Fantine walks down the steps with short hair, mocked by the
voices of the whores on either side.
A PIMP and the HEAD WHORE watch her progress as the organ-
grinder grinds out the music.
Whores sing from the warehouse doorways, from on top of the
spars of the ships, writhing around figureheads and from the
rotting ship.
The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear
by the end of the chorus.

The hair crone points at the head whore and the tooth man.
25.
HAIR CRONE
Go and see them.
Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore.
TOOTH MAN
HEAD WHORE
Come over here,
Come here my dear.
I'll pay well for your youth.
I pay ten francs for a tooth.
Fantine heads to the tooth man.
TOOTH MAN
You have, my dear,
The clear advantage of youth.
HEAD WHORE

Just the back ones.
TOOTH MAN

You'll still be able to bite.
She grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to
inspect her teeth.
TOOTH MAN
I do it fast,
I know my business all right.
It's worth a go.
The pimp pushes her down.
FANTINE
You'll pay me first

TOOTH MAN

She opens her mouth, and the pincers go in, as everyone
gathers round to watch. Fantine screams as the first tooth
is removed.
26B
26B
The pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they're
all fit for business.
WHORES
God, we're weary,
Sick enough to drop!
LOVELY LADY 1
Belly burns like fire,
Will the bleeding ever stop!
26.
PIMP
Cheer up, deary!
Show a happy face!
Plenty more like you here
If you can't keep up the pace.
LOVELY LADY 1
Only joking!
Deary knows her place!
The pimp gestures at Fantine, now slumped in a doorway, her
cropped head in her hands.
A shy captain watches Fantine. The pimp notices.
PIMP
Gimme the dirt -
Who's that bit over there?
WHORE 1
A bit of skirt,
She's the one sold her hair.
HEAD WHORE
She's got a kid,
Sends her all that she can.
PIMP
I might've known
There is always some man.
He moves in on Fantine.
PIMP
Lovely lady, come along and join
us!
Lovely lady!
Fantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her
mouth. The whores cluster round her, hands reaching out to
draw her in to their world. On the rotting warship, more
whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the
chorus.
WHORE 1
Come on, dearie, why all the
fuss?
WHORES

Whore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge
Fantine's cheeks.

WHORE 3

The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders
of the head whore, as the head whore leads her towards the
hulk.
WHORES
Old men, young men, take'em as

Harbour rats and alley cats
And every kind of scum!

The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to
Fantine who wears a filthy white dress. The pimp joins the
captain and Fantine's hands as the head whore officiates -
like a twisted wedding ceremony.
WHORES

28.
WHORES (cont'd)

Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain
into the ship's hulk, which is a brothel.
FANTINE
Come on, Captain, you can wear your
shoes.
Don't it make a change to have a
girl who can't refuse?
27
29
Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside,
shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly,
but still attempts an alluring smile.
She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits,
trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a
stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some
way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to
a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money.
As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-
dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives
with two friends and a valet.
30.
BAMATABOIS
Here's something new. I think
I'll give it a try.
Come closer, you! I like to see
what I buy.
The usual price
For just one slice of your pie.
FANTINE
I don't want you! No! No,
M'sieur! Let me go!
BAMATABOIS
Is this a trick? I won't pay
more!
FANTINE
No, not at all!
BAMATABOIS
You've got some nerve, you little
slut!
You've got some gall!
It's the same with a tart as it is
with a grocer
The customer sees what he gets in
advance
It's not for the whore to say "yes
sir" or "no sir"
It's not for the harlot to pick and
to choose or to lead me a dance!
He pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down
her cleavage. Fantine reacts with fury. They fall over in the
snow and Bamatabois laughs.
FANTINE
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Try any of that!
Even a whore who has gone to the
bad
Won't be had by a rat!
Fantine scratches Bamatabois across the face. Bamatabois
touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. His
friends drag Fantine against the harbour wall.
BAMATABOIS
(furious but aroused)
By Christ you'll pay for what
you've done!
This rat will make you bleed,
you'll see!
I guarantee I'll make you suffer!
For this disturbance of the peace
For this insult to life and
property!
31.
Bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived.
FANTINE
I beg you, don't report me, sir.
I'll do whatever you may want.
BAMATABOIS
Make your excuse to the police!
Bamatabois' friend drags Fantine towards the police. It's
Javert.
JAVERT
Tell me quickly what's the story.
Who saw what and why and where?
Let him give a full description,
Let him answer to Javert!
In this nest of whores and vipers
Let one speak who saw it all.
Who laid hands on this good man
here?
What's the substance of this
brawl?
BAMATABOIS
Javert, would you believe it?
I was walking, it was dark
When this prostitute attacked me
You can see she's left her mark!
He shows the blood. Javert turns to Fantine.
JAVERT
She will answer for her actions
When you make a full report.
You may rest assured, M'sieur,
That she will answer to the
court.
Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with
occasional spasms of coughing. Unseen by her, Valjean is
approaching from behind. Javert's assistants pick Fantine
up. Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he
approaches Fantine.
FANTINE
There's a child who sorely needs
me,
Please, m'sieur, she's but that
high.
Holy God, is there no mercy?
If I go to jail she'll die.
JAVERT
I have heard such protestations
Every day for twenty years.
Let's have no more explanations,
(more)
32.
JAVERT (cont'd)
Save your breath and save your
tears.
Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away.
Valjean steps out of the shadows.
VALJEAN
A moment of your time, Javert.
I do believe this woman's tale.
JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor!
VALJEAN
You've done your duty. Let her
be.
She needs a doctor, not a jail.
JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor!
Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches
out a hand to Fantine. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to
her in a dream -
FANTINE
Can this be?
VALJEAN
Where will she end -
This child without a friend?
He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face.
VALJEAN
I've seen your face before.
Show me some way to help you.
How have you come to grief
In such a place as this?
FANTINE
M'sieur, don't mock me now, I
pray
It's hard enough I've lost my
pride.
You let your foreman send me
away.
Yes, you were there
And turned aside.
I never did no wrong.
VALJEAN
Is it true what I've done -
FANTINE
My daughter's close to dying.
33.
VALJEAN
- to an innocent soul?
FANTINE
If there's a God above -
VALJEAN
Had I only known then!
FANTINE
He'd let me die instead.
VALJEAN
In His name my task has just begun.
I will her to the hospital.
Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms.
Javert is quietly coldly furious.
JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor!
FANTINE
Bring Cosette back to me.
VALJEAN
Where is she?
FANTINE
At an inn in Montfermeil...
JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor!
VALJEAN
I will see it done! I will send
for her immediately!
As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them,
then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow
after them.
30
30
As Javert walks up the steps to his police station his
assistant stops him with an urgent letter.
JAVERT'S ASSISTANT
From Paris, Monsieur.
Javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his
expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a
terrible mistake.
34.
31
31C
Close on two horses panting. A stopped carriage in a wide
night landscape. The driver is Valjean, hesitating.
Must I lie?
How can I ever face my fellow
men?
How can I ever face myself again?
31D
31D
Valjean hesitates outside the courtroom and in the lobby of
the courtroom, pacing back and forth.
VALJEAN
My soul belongs to God, I know,
I made that bargain long ago.
He gave me hope when hope was
gone!
He gave me strength to journey
on!
Who am I?
Who am I?
I'm Jean Valjean!
Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the
courtroom.
32
34A
Javert and various police search the harbourside with
lanterns.
Valjean, dripping wet, watches from a tunnel under a factory,
as Fantine's body wrapped in a shroud is dumped on a cart.
They sing to themselves, continuing their duet without
knowing.
VALJEAN
And this I swear to you tonight -
JAVERT
There is no place for you to
hide.
VALJEAN
Your child will live within my
care -
JAVERT
Wherever you may hide away -
VALJEAN
And I will raise her to the
light.
JAVERT/VALJEAN
I swear to you, I will be there!

The village street is bright with booths set up for a Frost
Fair. Families and visitors are out buying baubles, or
laughing at the antics of travelling players. Small girls
cluster round a stall that displays prettily-dressed dolls.
Amongst them is a prettily-dressed girl of 8 or 9 years:
EPONINE.
Across the road from this stall stands a shabby inn. A
sign lashed to an old cart swinging in the wind reveals the
inn to be `The Sergeant of Waterloo'. The inn is still
closed despite the small crowd at the fair.
MOVE IN on the frosted window of the inn, through which we
see a little girl, COSETTE, gazing out at the display of
dolls.
42.
36
36A
Madame Thenardier is trying to sell something unappealing
from her stall to a portly looking man when slushy snow
from the stall's roof falls on the man's head. Madame
Thenardier ushers him inside.
37
37C
At Madame Thenardier's stall, a frost fair customer is
covered by snow, only this time we realise Madame Thenardier
is responsible for pushing the snow off the awning with a
stick.
THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS
Master of the house!
Quick to catch your eye

46.
THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS (cont'd)
Never wants a passer-by
To pass him by!
Madame Thenardier ushers the customer inside.
37D
39
Thenardier comes out of the inn, backed by a posse of his
gang of loyal customers, and takes control of a brass band to
sing to the Frost Fair.
THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS
Master of the house!
Quick to catch your eye
Never wants a passer-by
To pass him by!
48.
Further down the street, carrying her empty buckets, Cosette
turns to look sadly back at the cheery sight.
THENARDIER
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher and
lifelong mate
Everybody's boon companion
Gives'em everything he's got -
The Portly Customer has discovered he's been robbed. He
comes out to protest, holding out his emptied wallet. At
once two of Thenardier's thugs grab him and hustle him off.
THENARDIER
Dirty bunch of geezers
Jesus! What a sorry little lot!
39A
42
Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood, and
is now heading back. Through the dark trees ahead we glimpse
the cheerful lights of the Frost Fair and the distant inn.
She goes slowly, because the buckets are heavy. She hums to
herself to keep her spirits up, a wordless verse of `Castle
on a Cloud'.
After a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the
buckets.
Strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her
hands. She looks up, amazed. There's Valjean.
VALJEAN
Hush now, do not be afraid of me.
Don't cry. Show me where you live.
(more)
50.
VALJEAN (cont'd)
Tell me, my child, what is your
name?
COSETTE
I'm called Cosette.
VALJEAN
Cosette?
She gazes up at him. Hardly knowing why, the little girl
trusts this stranger. Valjean picks up the heavy buckets, and
they head back towards the inn. As they go, they hum `Castle
on a Cloud' together.
43
44
Valjean lifts Cosette into the waiting cab.
VALJEAN
Where I go, you will be.
COSETTE
Will you be like a Papa to me?
VALJEAN
Yes, Cosette!
This is true!
I'll be father and mother to you!
The cab sets off down the road.
45
46
Valjean's cab, moving fast, passes down the road into the
city.
IN CAB - Valjean has one arm round Cosette to protect her
from the jolting of the cab. He gazes at her as she slips
into a fitful sleep.
VALJEAN
Suddenly I see
Suddenly it starts
When two anxious hearts
Beat as one.
Yesterday I was alone
Today you walk beside me
Something still unclear
Something not yet here
Has begun.
Suddenly the world
Seems a different place
Somehow full of grace
(more)
54.
VALJEAN (cont'd)
And delight.
How was I to know
That so much love
Was held inside me?
Something fresh and young
Something still unsung
Fills the night.
How was I to know at last
That happiness can come so fast?
Trusting me the way you do
I'm so afraid of failing you
Just a child who cannot know
That danger follows where I go
There are shadows everywhere
And memories I cannot share
Nevermore alone
Nevermore apart
You have warmed my heart
Like the sun.
You have brought the gift of life
And love so long denied me.
Suddenly I see
What I could not see
Something suddenly
Has begun.
He brushes the hair from her face, and satisfies himself
that she's comfortable. Then he puts his head out of the
window. At the gate into Paris, soldiers are checking
documents of occupants of carriages.
Valjean slips out of the carriage with Cosette and makes
his way along the wall, away from the gate.
46A
46A
Valjean finds a section of tumble down wall and climbs over.
46B
46B
Valjean and Cosette make their way down a darkened street.
46C
46C
Valjean and Cosette turn down a narrow street, no longer
hurrying.
The narrow street turns, and opens out onto the river.
Valjean stops. There, on the other side of the river, in the
light of a lamp, stands Javert.
55.
47
SCENE OMITTED
47
48
48
Now Valjean and Cosette are running - down narrow alleys,
into small dark courtyards, not knowing which way to turn.
Whenever Valjean thinks they've thrown their pursuer, there
he is, not far behind. And he's no longer alone. With him
are a detachment of soldiers.
Javert and his team never seem to run. But he's always
there.
49
49
Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by
high windowless houses. They follow it round a corner to
find - a dead end. A high wall before them. They're
trapped.
Valjean looks round. No way out. Then he sees a nearby lamp
bracket. Hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower
the oil lamp for lighting. He tears off the rope and ties
one end round Cosette, beneath her armpits. Then holding
the other end, he scales the wall, using the corner to
brace himself as he rises. Once on the top, he hauls
Cosette up by the rope. Only then does he turn to look down
onto the other side.
A cloister. A building in the middle, windows glowing.
Grave stones black against the white snow. The sound of
women's voices, singing a psalm.
NUNS
Te lucis ante terminum
Rerum Creator poscimus
Ut pro tua clementia
Sis praesul et custodia...
Valjean lowers Cosette down into the garden, and drops down
after her.
Javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
Nine years later
The dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT. The monument,
made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands
on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far
side, the remains of the great fortress that was the
Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built
triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the
new regime.
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
Paris, 1832.
The streets that run from the square lead in one direction
to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction
into the slums.
The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant.
A head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes -
GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At
once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from
every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey,
Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band.
52
52
FOLLOW GAVROCHE in as he races down a grand boulevard,
dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars,
weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to
make their way in either direction. These are the
conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched
horses and footmen on the back. Virtually at a standstill,
they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to
coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite.
As he goes, the poor on the pavements sing to the stony-
faced rich in their golden high-sprung glory -
BEGGARS CHORUS
Look down and see the beggars at
your feet!
Look down and show some mercy if
you can!
Look down and see the sweepings
of the street!
(more)
58.
BEGGARS CHORUS (cont'd)
Look down, look down,
Upon your fellow man!
The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert
their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows
to shut out the sight of the losers of their world.
Gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of
liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one
particularly grand carriage and begs/taunts the RICH
OCCUPANT.
GAVROCHE
`Ow do you do? My name's
Gavroche!
These are my people, here's my
patch.
Not much to look at - nothing
posh!
Nothing that you'd call up to
scratch.
This is my school, my high
society!
Here in the slums of St Michel.
We live on crumbs of humble piety
Tough on the teeth - but what the
hell!
Think you're poor? Think you're
free?
Follow me! Follow me!
BEGGARS CHORUS
Look down and show some mercy if
you can!
Look down, look down, upon your
fellow man!
STILL RUNNING WITH Gavroche as he hops onto the back of
another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at
last, hitching a ride on the back - one or two of his gang
hop on back of carriage with him, the others run panting
after to hear his political lecture.
GAVROCHE
There was a time we killed the
King
We tried to change the world too
fast.
Now we have got another King,
He is no better than the last.
This is the land that fought for
liberty -
Now when we fight we fight for
bread!
Here is the thing about equality -
Everyone's equal when they're
dead.
Take your place!
(more)
59.
GAVROCHE (cont'd)
Take your chance!
Vive la France! Vive la France!
53

The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a
crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of
sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch
what is going on. The street is padded with straw. Many eyes
gaze up at the draped windows. People cross themselves. A
priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two
altar boys.
Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd.
The crowd is made up of citizens of Paris, student
revolutionaries, the poor and beggars. The students hand out
printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd.
STUDENTS/BEGGARS CHORUS
Look down and show some mercy if
you can!
Look down, look down, upon your
fellow man!
COURFEYRAC
When's it gonna end?
BEGGAR 1
When we gonna live?
JOLY
Something's gotta happen now!
BEGGAR 2
Something's gotta give!
STUDENTS AND BEGGARS
It'll come, it'll come, it'll
come...
It'll come, it'll come, it'll
come...
A student, ENJOLRAS, stands on a raised step, making an
impassioned speech with fellow student MARIUS. The occupant
of the stopped carriage is MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND, Marius'
Grandfather. He is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson
engaged in such an activity.
In the crowd a young street girl, EPONINE, has her eyes fixed
longingly on the handsome Marius.
ENJOLRAS
Where are the leaders of the
land?
Where are the swells who run this
show?
60.
MARIUS
Only one man, General Lamarque
Speaks for the people here below!
Marius looks towards Lamarque's house behind him.
ENJOLRAS
Lamarque is ill and fading fast -
Won't last a week out, so they
say.
MARIUS
With all the anger in the land,
How long before the Judgement
Day?
ENJOLRAS
Before we cut the fat ones down
to size?
STUDENTS
Before the barricades arise?
Mounted Police ride in to break up the crowd.
POLICE
Look down, look down, don't look us
in the eye!
Look down, look down, stay here and
you die!
The crowd breaks up. The students shout to the crowd:
ENJOLRAS
Tomorrow we will return!
MARIUS
Tell everyone you know
COURFEYRAC
We will show them!
COMBEFERRE
Lamarque is the only leader on our
side!
COURFEYRAC
We have a right to pray for
Lamarque!
JOLY
We need more people, then the
police will not dare ride against
us!
MARIUS
Vive le General Lamarque!
61.
Marius turns to see his Grandfather staring him down,
furious.
GILLENORMAND
Do you have any idea of the shame
you bring on your family! You're
behaving like a child.
Gillenormand spies a gun poking out of his jacket.
Gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage.
54
55
Marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau
Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes Marius sees
two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman,
Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The
two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from
evening church service.
Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen
anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental
foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'.
As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets
his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he
already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held
gaze.
Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back,
at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again.
Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her
jealously from this distant boy's gaze.
We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the
Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's
approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon,
Clacquesous, Montparnasse.
THENARDIER
Everyone here, you know your
place -
Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous -
You, Montparnasse, watch for the
law -
With Eponine - take care.
(Montparnasse hurries over
to the doorway where
Eponine was watching
Marius)
You turn on the tears!
(to Madame Thenardier who
is holding a baby)
No mistakes, my dears!
Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth
of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the
ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps
behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius.
63.
THENARDIER
Please, M'sieur, come this way.
Here's a child that ain't eaten
today.
Save a life, spare a sou!
God rewards all the good that you
do.
As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier she
recognizes him.
MADAME THENARDIER
Wait a bit! Know that face!
(to Monsieur Thenardier)
Ain't the world a remarkable
place!
THENARDIER
Men like me don't forget -
You're the bastard who borrowed
Cosette!
VALJEAN
What is this? Are you mad?
No, Monsieur, you don't know what
you say!
Thenardier pulls off his disguise. Valjean recognises him.
THENARDIER
You know me! I know you!
And you'll pay what I'm due.
He signals to his gang. A door opens in the alleyway
revealing the huge Brujon. The gang move in on Valjean
menacingly.
EPONINE
(shouts from up the
street)
It's the police! Disappear!
Run for it! It's Javert!
The gang spill out into the street to find themselves
confronted by Javert now with his men. Marius watches, as
does Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus.
JAVERT
Another brawl in the square!
Another stink in the air!
Was there a witness to this?
Well, let him speak to Javert!
He sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does
not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face.
64.
JAVERT
Monsieur, these streets are not
safe.
But let these vermin beware,
We'll see that justice is done!
He turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage.
JAVERT
Look upon this fine collection
Crawled from underneath a stone.
This swarm of worms and maggots
Could have picked you to the
bone!
I know this man over here,
I know his name and his trade.
And on your witness, m'sieur,
I'll see him suitably paid.
He turns back to find Valjean and Cosette gone.
JAVERT
But where's the gentlemen gone?
And why on earth did he run?
THENARDIER
You will have a job to find him!
He's not all he seems to be -
And that girl he trails behind
him
She's the child he stole from me!
Marius, equally baffled, goes off in search of them.
JAVERT
Could it be he's that old
jailbird
That the tide now washes in?
Heard my name and started
running...
All the omens point to him.
Thenardier, listening, hears this all with great interest.
So Valjean is a crook like him.
JAVERT
And the girl who stood beside
him,
When I turned they both had gone.
Could he be the man I've hunted?
Could it be he's Jean Valjean?
THENARDIER
In the absence of a victim,
Dear Inspector, may I go?
And remember when you've nicked
him
It was me what told you so.
65.
JAVERT
(to himself)
Let the old man keep on running
I will run him off his feet!
(to the crowd)
Everyone about your business!
(to Gavroche)
Clear this garbage off the
street!
Gavroche is sitting on a horse trough and falls back into it
when Javert surprises him.
He is furious. He sings to Javert's departing back, and to
Marius who is close by.
GAVROCHE
That inspector thinks he's
something
But it's me who runs this town!
And my theatre never closes
And the curtain's never down!
Trust Gavroche! Have no fear!
You can always find me here!
EPONINE
Cosette! Now I remember...
Cosette! How can it be?
We were children together.
Look what's become of me.
She turns back to find Marius gazing down the street.
MARIUS
Eponine! Who was that girl?
EPONINE
That bourgeois two-a-penny thing!
MARIUS
Eponine, find her for me!
EPONINE
What will you give me?
MARIUS
Anything!
EPONINE
Got you all excited now,
But God knows what you see in
her.
Aren't you all delighted now?
No, I don't want your money, sir.
66.
MARIUS
Eponine, do this for me,
Discover where she lives.
But careful how you go -
Don't let your father know.
Eponine! I'm lost until she's
found.
EPONINE
You see? I told you so!
There's lots of things I know!
Eponine, she knows her way
around.

WIDE of the Police Headquarters on the Isle de la Cite: a
huge bureaucracy. The camera finds Javert standing inside
looking out of a door leading onto the roof. As he sings
he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the
HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights
reflected in the river below. Then up at the great city.
Javert too has a God, and this is his prayer.
JAVERT
There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Running from God
Fallen from grace -
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face -
Till we come face to face...
He knows his way in the dark
Mine is the way of the Lord
Those who follow the path of the
righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall
As Lucifer fell -
The flame!
The sword!
Stars in your multitudes!
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light -
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night -
Keeping watch in the night...
You know your place in the sky
You hold your course
(more)
67.
JAVERT (cont'd)
And your aim
And each in your season
Returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall
As Lucifer fell
You fall
In flame!
And so it must be, and so it is
written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter
And those who fall
Must pay the price!
Lord, let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind bars!
I will never rest till then!
This I swear
This I swear by the stars!
Javert stands silhouetted against the stars, his arms
raised up to the night sky.
63
63
Marius comes down the street, his mind full of thoughts of
Cosette.
64
66
Marius rushes down the street, Eponine following. At the
far end is the walled garden behind which lies Valjean's
house.
MARIUS
In my life
She has burst like the music of
angels
The light of the sun!
And my life seems to stop
As if something is over
And something has scarcely begun!
Eponine, you're the friend
Who has brought me here.
Thanks to you I am one with the
Gods
And heaven is near!
And I soar through a world that
is new,
That is free!
EPONINE
Every word that he says
Is a dagger in me!
In my life
There's been no one like him
anywhere,
Anywhere, where he is
If he asked... I'd be his!
MARIUS/EPONINE
In my life
There is someone who touches my
life -
MARIUS
(sees Cosette in the
garden)
Waiting near!
74.
EPONINE
Waiting here!
MARIUS
A heart full of love!
Cosette sees Marius. She comes up the garden path towards
him. She sees Eponine by Marius's side.
MARIUS
A heart full of song!
I'm doing everything all wrong -
Oh God, for shame -
I do not even know your name.
Dear Mad'moiselle,
Won't you say?
Will you tell?
Cosette holds the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both
hands, eyes on Marius. Eponine looks on and suffers. Marius
wraps his hands round Cosette's.
COSETTE
A heart full of love!
No fear, no regret!
MARIUS
My name is Marius Pontmercy.
COSETTE
And mine's Cosette.
MARIUS
Cosette... I don't know what to
say -
COSETTE
Then make no sound.
MARIUS
I am lost -
COSETTE
I am found!
MARIUS
A heart full of light -
COSETTE/MARIUS
A night bright as day -
MARIUS
And you must never go away,
Cosette - Cosette!
COSETTE
This is a chain we'll never
break.
75.
MARIUS
Do I dream?
COSETTE
I'm awake.
MARIUS
A heart full of love -
EPONINE
He was never mine to lose
Why regret
What could not be?
COSETTE
A heart full of you -
EPONINE
These are words he'll never say
Not to me, not to me
Not for me!
MARIUS
A single look and then I knew!
COSETTE
I knew it too!
EPONINE
His heart full of love...
MARIUS
From today -
EPONINE
He will never feel this way.
COSETTE
Every day...
MARIUS/COSETTE
For it isn't a dream -
Not a dream
After all!
Valjean comes to the door.
VALJEAN
Cosette! Cosette!
Cosette turns and runs in to the house.
Valjean walks down the overgrown garden path to the gate.
Marius moves quickly away, instinctively nervous of
discovery, and hides behind the wall.
76.
Valjean peers into the shadows. He senses that perhaps
Cosette has been talking to someone. He looks pensive.
Valjean returns inside.
Cosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate. Marius picks
it up.
Marius makes his way back down the street, filled with
thoughts of his love. Completely forgetting Eponine is there.
Shadows move up the street from the other direction. It's
Thenardier and his gang. They gather at the wrought-iron
gate.
MONTPARNASSE
This is his lair!
I've seen the old fox around.
BABET
He keeps himself to himself
He's staying close to the ground.
THENARDIER
I smell profit here!
Ten years ago
He came and paid for Cosette.
I let her go for a song.
It's time we settled the debt.
This'll cost him dear.
BRUJON
What do I care
Who you should rob?
Gimme my share!
Finish the job!
THENARDIER
You shut your mouth!
You'll get what's yours!
Brujon starts working on the gate lock. He finds Eponine
lurking in the shadows.
BRUJON
What have we here?
THENARDIER
Who is this hussy?
BABET
It's your brat Eponine!
Don't you know your own kid?
Why's she hanging about here?
77.
THENARDIER
Eponine, get on home!
You're not needed in this.
We're enough here without you.
EPONINE
I know this house, I tell you!
There's nothing here for you!
Just the old man and the girl.
They live ordinary lives.
THENARDIER
Don't interfere!
You've got some gall!
Take care, young miss,
You've got a lot to say!
BRUJON
She's going soft!
CLACQUESOUS
Happens to all!
MONTPARNASSE
Go home, Eponine!
Go home, you're in the way!
They huddle round the garden gate, which is now broken
open.
EPONINE
I'm gonna scream! I'm gonna warn
them here!
THENARDIER
One little scream and you'll
regret it for a year!
He goes to the gate and opens it.
Eponine screams.

Thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows, as
Eponine's scream ends at last.
78.
THENARDIER
Make for the sewers!
Get underground!
Leave her to me,
Don't wait around!
He turns on Eponine and slaps her hard across the face.
THENARDIER
You wait, my girl!
You'll rue this night!
I'll make you scream!
You'll scream all right!
His men have levered up a grating, and now Thenardier and
the gang disappear down into the sewers.

Cosette hurries down the
garden to the gate, and goes to
put the folded letter in
the grill where her and Marius'
hands entwined. Then she
sees Eponine. Eponine steps
forward. She thrusts her
letter into her hand.
COSETTE
Please give this to Marius! He
must know where to find me.
She runs back inside.
73
73
Eponine crumples up the letter.
She walks sadly away down the street.
Rain is just starting to fall.
EPONINE
And now I'm all alone again -
Nowhere to turn, no one to go to.
Without a home, without a friend,
(more)
80.
EPONINE (cont'd)
Without a face to say hello to.
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head.
On my own
Pretending he's beside me
All alone
I walk with him till morning
Without him
I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my
eyes
And he has found me.
She crosses a bridge over the river.
EPONINE
In the rain
The pavement shines like silver
All the lights
Are misty in the river
In the darkness the trees are
full of starlight
And all I see is him and me
forever and forever!
And I know it's only in my mind -
That I'm talking to myself and
not to him.
And although I know that he is
blind,
Still I say there's a way for us.
I love him
But when the night is over
He is gone - the river's just a
river.
Without him the world around me
changes -
The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of
strangers.
I love him
But every day I'm learning
All my life I've only been
pretending.
Without me, his world will go on
turning
A world that's full of happiness
That I have never know.
I love him
I love him
I love him
But only on my own.
81.
Her solitary journey has brought her to the Gorbeau slum.
She goes inside.
73A
74
Marius finds the gate broken open, sees the house beyond
dark and deserted. He pushes in to the garden, up to the
house windows, sees the rooms empty within. He stands
staring, in shock.
Eponine has followed him, and watches him in silence.

MARIUS
I did not live until today -
How can I live when we are parted?
78

INTERCUT between Eponine at the gate, Cosette and Valjean
in the carriage, and Marius in the dark garden.
EPONINE
One more day all on my own...
MARIUS/COSETTE
Will we ever meet again?
EPONINE
One more day with him not
caring...
MARIUS/COSETTE
I was born to be with you!
EPONINE
What a life I might have known...
MARIUS/COSETTE
And I swear I will be true!
EPONINE
But he never saw me there.

CHANVRERIE - NIGHT
Enjolras and the students have a production line under way
for making bullets. The rifles are now stacked and ready
for the uprising. Grantaire is downstairs flirting with a
BARMAID. MADAME HUCHELOUP the proprietress of the Cafe
Musain is sewing a red revolutionary flag to help the
students.
ENJOLRAS
One more day before the storm!
83.
INTERCUT WITH Marius walking back sadly through the Rue de
la Chanvrerie. Eponine follows him at a distance.
MARIUS
Do I follow where she goes?
ENJOLRAS
At the barricades of freedom!
MARIUS
Shall I join my brothers there?
ENJOLRAS
When our ranks begin to form -
MARIUS
Do I stay and do I dare?
ENJOLRAS
(from top of stairs, for
Grantaire's benefit)
Will you take your place with me?
Grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs.
ALL
The time is now!
The day is here!
One day more!
81
84
MUSAIN GROUND & 1ST FLOOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Valjean and Cosette arrive at their new hideout -
Marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole -
VALJEAN
One day more!
COSETTE/MARIUS
I did not live until today
How can I live when we are
parted?
Eponine outside the caf, gazing longingly towards Marius -
EPONINE
One more day on my own...
85.
Javert in the police station to his men -
JAVERT
I will join these people's heroes
I will follow where they go.
I will learn their little
secrets,
I will know the things they know.
VALJEAN/JAVERT
One day more!
MARIUS/COSETTE
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you my world has
started.
JAVERT
One more day to revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these
schoolboys -
THENARDIERS
Watch'em run amuck
Catch'em as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all!
VALJEAN
Tomorrow we'll be far away.
VALJEAN/JAVERT
Tomorrow is the judgement day.
ALL
Tomorrow we'll discover
What our God in heaven has in
store -
One more dawn!
One more day!
One day more!
We pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at
the first floor window with the students beyond them to see
that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the
street and have all joined in the final chorus.
85
85
All is still. Then comes the soft beating of draped drums.
The tramp of feet.
All down the streets, waiting, the silent faces of the
poor. Among them we see Enjolras, Marius, and the radical
students.
86.
Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds.
Now into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL
PROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with
weapons reversed. A column of black-suited dignitaries
carrying branches of laurel. A division of Cavalry rides in
front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a
military tatoo.
INTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly,
black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage
draped in the tricolour flag. On the carriage stands a
COFFIN.
Softly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin
to sing.
CROWD
Do you hear the people sing
Singing the song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!
The police and guardsmen look round to see who is singing
so subversively, but they can't be sure where it's coming
from. The singing grows stronger.
CROWD
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!
The dignitaries become aware of the singing, and glance
uneasily from side to side.
CROWD
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with
me?
Beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
As the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students,
Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses drawing
the carriage and waves the red flag, stopping the horses and
the procession.
ENJOLRAS
Then join in the fight
That will give you the right
To be free!
The students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the
coffin carriage.
87.
STUDENTS/CROWD
Do you hear the people sing
Singing the song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!
Enjolras, Marius and Courfeyrac and other students climb
onto the top of the carriage as the horses and led by
Combeferre.
ENJOLRAS
Will you give all you can give
So that our banner may advance?
COURFEYRAC
Some will fall and some will live
Will you stand up and take your
chance?
ENJOLRAS/MARIUS/COURFEYRAC
The blood of the martyrs
Will water the meadows of France!
The crowd supports them and surround the coffin carriage,
blocking the attempts of the police to intervene, singing
with passion.
STUDENTS/CROWD
Do you hear the people sing
Singing the song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!
Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now
become the procession. They turn off the main street away
from the expected course of the funeral procession.
Gavroche's elephant looms over this side street. Gavroche
and his gang jump down from the elephant to join in.
As the procession turns off, the calvary division gallop
ahead and disappear round a corner.
STUDENTS/CROWD
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with
me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
(more)
88.
STUDENTS/CROWD (cont'd)
Say, do you hear the distant
drums?
It is the future that we bring
When tomorrow comes!
The students and crowd come face to face with the calvary. On
one side, muskets of the infantry poke through the broken
down fence surrounding the elephant. Other infantry have
taken up position in a cafe opposite, upending tables to
provide cover.
There is a tense, prolonged silence. Then suddenly one
nervous SOLDIER lets off a round. It hits a middle aged
kindly looking WOMAN CITIZEN in the crowd around the coffin
carriage. The crowd is furious. Students charge the soldier,
grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun.
More shots ring out. The cavalry charges. The funeral
explodes into a riot. The people of Paris turn on the
dragoons, the National Guards, the police. More squadrons
of dragoons charge into the crowd, sabres unsheathed. Women
run screaming in terror.
ENJOLRAS
To the barricades!
STUDENTS/CROWD
To the barricades! To arms! To
arms!
Some students fire weapons into the air, some into the
cavalry and at the infantry. Enjolras knocks a calvary
officer off his horse and Marius jumps on the horse.
The students break away and race off through the cafe into
a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade. A
cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the
students and falls through the window of an upended
carriage. The students, with Marius on horseback, race to
the slums.
86
86
FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street.
They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens
including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF
who works as hard as anyone. They raid a fencing shop and a
gun shop for weapons, they force wives to give up their
husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution
on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to
contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to
help overcome any reluctance. Soon the street is raining
tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. They smash streetlamps.
They set to work to build their barricade. Students
commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the
barricade's heart. Three students arrive in the street
hauling an uprooted tree.
89.
They pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front
doors from house and shop-fronts, pull down buttresses, and
raid the Cafe Musain, systematically stripping it of every
item of furniture despite the lamentations and
protestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid.
As the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor
of the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to
prepare to defend their chosen ground. A student stands on
a stone post distributing weapons. They line the first and
second floor front rooms with paving stones to create
protected shooting positions. The inside of the barricade
is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. The
outside is a crazy knarled mess.
ENJOLRAS
Here upon these stones
We will build our barricade.
In the heart of the city
We claim as our own
Each man to his duty
And don't be afraid.
A man in worker's clothing is helping build the growing
barricade,. He wears the insignia of the rebels, and keeps
his head down.
ENJOLRAS
Wait!
I will need a report
On the strength of the foe.
The man who's just arrived looks up. It's Javert.
JAVERT
I can find out the truth!
I know their ways,
Fought their wars,
Served my time
In the days
Of my youth.
He slips away through the barricade, which is still rising.
PROUVAIRE
See! The people unite!
GRANTAIRE
Pray your right
COMBEFERRE
Dogs will bark!
GAVROCHE
Fleas will bite!
LESGLES
They will do what is right.
90.
87
87
The barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to
twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can
be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades
protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras
climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his
little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame
Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing
armchair - and adds it to the barricade. As the men sing
she steals it back defiantly.
ENJOLRAS
Red, the blood of angry men!
ALL
Black, the dark of ages past!
Red, a world about to dawn!
Black, the night that ends at
last!
87A
87A
It is night. The students have been waiting for hours.
A single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles
underlights a fluttering red flag.
There is no sign yet of any opposition.
A boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade. Marius
realizes its Eponine. She sits down with her back to him.
MARIUS
Hey, little boy, what's this I see?
God Eponine the things you do!
EPONINE
I know this is no place for me,
Still I would rather be with you!
MARIUS
Get out before the trouble
starts!
Get out, `Ponine, you might get
shot!
EPONINE
I've got you worried now, I have!
That shows you like me quite a
lot...
MARIUS
Get Out!
Joly, sentry on the main barricade, sees a figure approach.
91.
JOLY
He's back!
Javert, still in his disguise as a rebel, is let back
through the guarded `gate' into the barricaded street.
JAVERT
Listen, my friends,
I have done as I said.
I have been to their lines,
I have counted each man.
I will tell what I can.
Better be warned
They have armies to spare
And our danger is real -
We will need all our cunning
To bring them to heel.
ENJOLRAS
Have faith!
If you know what their movements
are
We'll spoil their game.
There are ways that a people can
fight -
We shall overcome their power!
JAVERT
I have overheard their plans.
There will be no attack tonight.
They intend to starve you out
Before they start a proper fight -
Concentrate their force,
Hit us when it's light -
GAVROCHE
Liar!
They all look up. There's Gavroche, on the top of the
barricade.
GAVROCHE
Good evening, dear Inspector.
Lovely evening, my dear!
I know this man, my friends.
His name's Inspector Javert!
So don't believe a word he says
Cause none of it's true.
This only goes to show
What little people can do.
Guns swing round to aim at Javert. He stares back in
defiance.
Gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyrac's
delighted embrace.
92.
COURFEYRAC
Bravo, little Gavroche!
You're the top of the class!
Gavroche grabs Grantaire's red cap and puts it on his own
head, mimicking the students.
PROUVAIRE
So what are we going to do
With this snake in the grass?
Enjolras faces Javert.
ENJOLRAS
Tie this man and take him
To the tavern in there!
The people will decide your fate,
Inspector Javert!
JAVERT
Shoot me now or shoot me later -
Every schoolboy to his sport!
Death to each and every traitor!
I renounce your people's court!
ENJOLRAS
Take this man. Bring him through.
There is work we have to do.
Javert is led into the cafe. As they pass through the front
door only one student is holding Javert. Seizing his
opportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to
subdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied
to the staircase.
ENJOLRAS
When are they coming!?
Silence.
Suddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at
the barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of
marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First
soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer.
Boots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the
street.
Enjolras and all the students man the main barricade.
Silence.
They peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all
they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These
are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection
from the torch.
A voice shouts out from the darkness.
93.
ARMY OFFICER
Who's there?
At the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled.
ENJOLRAS
French Revolution.
ARMY OFFICER
Fire!
A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as
though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut.
A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag
falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the
cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound
several men.
ENJOLRAS
(as students return fire)
Comrades, do not fire back! Do not
waste powder!
In the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop
reloading weapons.
Enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up
when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many
insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the
top of the barricade.
ARMY OFFICER
Who's there? Get down!
MABEUF
Vive la France!
ARMY OFFICER
Fire!
A second volley.
Father Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to
the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from
noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of
darkness to creep down the street.
All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the
rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over
the barricade. The students run for their guns and return
fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the
first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the
barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce
resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier
aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of
Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe.
94.
They are being
overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is
fierce. Marius
in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost
unless they do
something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to
the top of the
barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of
deadly resolve
he tips the torch towards the barrel.
MARIUS
Clear out or I'll blow up the
barricade!
Everyone freezes.
ARMY OFFICER
Blow it up then and take yourself
with it!
MARIUS
And myself with it!
Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg.
But already the soldiers have cleared out.
Marius comes down from the barricade.
FEUILLY
(to Marius)
Thank you!
LESGLES
What were you thinking!
As everyone surrounds Marius in amazement he spots Eponine
lying propped against the barricade.
MARIUS
Eponine! What have you done?
He kneels by her side. Eponine is dying.
EPONINE
Here... It's from Cosette...
I kept it from you...
With a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket, and
pushes it into his hand.
EPONINE
Don't be too hard on me...
Marius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound.
MARIUS
Eponine, you're hurt!
You need some help!
Rain begins to fall.
95.
EPONINE
Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius -
I don't feel any pain.
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now.
You're here - that's all I need
to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers
grow...
MARIUS
But you will live, Eponine - Dear
God above!
If I could close your wounds with
words of love -
EPONINE
Just hold me now, and let it be.
Shelter me... Comfort me...
MARIUS
You will live a hundred years
If I could show you how...
I won't desert you now...
EPONINE
The rain can't hurt me now...
This rain will wash away what's
past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
I'll sleep in your embrace at
last.
Marius tries to comfort Eponine in his arms.
MARIUS
Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine
You won't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt you now
I'm here.
EPONINE
So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now...
MARIUS
I will stay with you
Till you are sleeping.
EPONINE
That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
(more)
96.
EPONINE (cont'd)
And you will keep me close
And rain..
Will make the flowers...
Grow...
Eponine dies in Marius's arms.
Marius looks up at the others, his eyes full of tears.
ENJOLRAS
They were the first to fall.
The first to fall upon this
barricade.
MARIUS
Her name was Eponine!
Her life was cold and dark, yet
she was unafraid!
COMBEFERRE
We fight here in her name...
PROUVAIRE
She will not die in vain...
LESGLES
She will not be betrayed...
They pick up Eponine's body and carry her into the tavern.
COURFEYRAC
(to Gavroche)
Are you alright?
GAVROCHE
That was my sister.
88
88
Marius reads the letter Eponine has given him. He takes out
pencil and paper and writes a note. Looking round, he sees
Gavroche.
MARIUS
Gavroche! Do you know the Rue de
l'Homme Arm?
GAVROCHE
Course I do!
MARIUS
Will you take this for me?
He holds out his note.
97.
89
91
Valjean walks the streets, not caring where he goes,
struggling with his tormented thoughts. He sees a barricade
being dismantled. And bodies.
Suddenly he knows what he's going to do. He sees a dead
soldier. He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on.
He continues on his way in the dark.
Looking up he sees that he's been walking all the time
towards the very barricade where Marius waits.
Now looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through
their lines, and into the shadows.
As he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the
rooftops.
92
92
Glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching
from the far end of the narrow street.
The figure comes into lamp light. It's Valjean, in the
soldier's jacket. The student sentries level their guns.
Gavroche jumps up.
VALJEAN
Don't shoot!
JOLY
Here comes a man in uniform!
What brings you to this place?
VALJEAN
I come here as a volunteer.
JOLY
Approach and show your face!
PROUVAIRE
You wear an army uniform.
VALJEAN
That's why they let me through.
The student sentries open the slot in the barricade to let
Valjean enter.
JOLY
You've got some years behind you,
sir.
VALJEAN
There's much that I can do.
99.
JOLY
You see that prisoner over there?
He points to Javert, in a dark corner, his hands tied.
GRANTAIRE
A volunteer like you!
COMBEFERRE
A spy who calls himself Javert!
GRANTAIRE
He's going to get it too!
Javert looks up and meets Valjean's eyes. A steady shared
look.
GAVROCHE
Don't shoot! I know him! He's no
soldier!
Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the
roofs to gain an angle of attack on them. They are aiming at
Enjolras. Swiftly Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them
sending them scattering. Quickly other students join in and
the snipers are driven back.
There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a
brief fire fight ensues.
The snipers have disappeared.
Enjolras turns to Valjean.
ENJOLRAS
For your presence of mind,
For the deed you have done,
I will thank you, M'sieur,
When our battle is won.
MARIUS
Thank you, M'sieur.
VALJEAN
Give me no thanks, M'sieur.
There's something you can do.
ENJOLRAS
If it is in my power.
VALJEAN
Give me the spy Javert!
Let me take care of him.
Javert hears this with grim satisfaction.
100.
JAVERT
The law is inside out.
The world is upside down.
ENJOLRAS
Do what you have to do -
The man belongs to you.
He turns to his little army.
ENJOLRAS
The enemy may be regrouping!
Hold yourselves in readiness!
Come, my friends, back to your
positions!
The dawn is breaking fast.
Valjean takes Javert out the back of the Cafe Musain. He
carries a knife.
VALJEAN
We meet again...
JAVERT
You've hungered for this all your
life.
Take your revenge.
How right you should kill with a
knife.
Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free.
VALJEAN
You talk too much.
Your life is safe in my hands.
JAVERT
Don't understand...
VALJEAN
Get out of here.
JAVERT
Valjean, take care!
I'm warning you.
VALJEAN
Clear out of here!
JAVERT
Once a thief, forever a thief.
What you want, you always steal.
You would trade your life for
mine.
Yes, Valjean, you want a deal!
Shoot me now for all I care -
If you let me go, beware!
You'll still answer to Javert!
101.
VALJEAN
You are wrong, and always have
been wrong.
I'm a man no worse than any man.
You are free, and there are no
conditions -
No bargains or petitions.
There's nothing that I blame you
for.
You've done your duty, nothing
more.
No doubt our paths will cross
again.
He raises his gun and points it at Javert.
VALJEAN
Go!
As Javert goes, he raises the gun barrel and fires a single
shot into the air.
ENJOLRAS
Courfeyrac, you take the watch -
They may attack before it's
light.
Everybody keep the faith,
For certain as our banner flies,
We are not alone -
The people too must rise!
Marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the
smaller barricades.
ENJOLRAS
Marius, rest.
Grantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song and it is
taken up more seriously by Feuilly. Bottles are passed round.
GRANTAIRE
Drink with me to days gone by!
FEUILLY
Sing with me the songs we knew!
PROUVAIRE
Here's to pretty girls
Who went to our heads!
JOLY
Here's to witty girls
Who went to our beds!
102.
STUDENTS
Here's to them -
(Marius sings to
Valjean)
And here's to you!
GRANTAIRE
Drink with me to days gone by!
Can it be you fear to die?
Will the world remember you when
you fall?
Can it be your death
Means nothing at all?
Is your life just one more lie?
Grantaire glares at Enjolras and enters the cafe.
ALL
Drink with me
To days gone by!
To the life
That used to be!
At the shrine of friendship
Never say die...
Let the wine of friendship
Never run dry!
Here's to you
And here's to me!
Valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius
through a window. He moves to the window. Marius sits beneath
it.
MARIUS
Do I care if I should die
Now she goes across the sea?
Life without Cosette
Means nothing at all..
Please don't weep, Cosette,
Should Marius fall.
Will you weep, Cosette,
For me?
Valjean listens to Marius's song, and he's moved.
93
93
Look-outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded
street. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping.
Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe. Dead
bodies are lined up on the ground floor. He comes to a
stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window.
VALJEAN
God on high
Hear my prayer
(more)
103.
VALJEAN (cont'd)
In my need
You have always been there.
He is young
He's afraid
Let him rest
Heaven blessed.
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home!
He's like the son I might have
known
If God had granted me a son.
The summers die
One by one
How soon they fly
On and on
And I am old
And will be gone.
Bring him peace
Bring him joy
He is young
He is only a boy.
You can take
You can give
Let him be
Let him live,
If I die, let me die
Let him live
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home!
Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius.
CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded
street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets
round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many
that we know the little band can never win.
CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that
entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the
centre of the bright lights of Paris.
94
94
The sun still below the rooftops. Every house is tightly
shuttered.
95
96
Enjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate.
He has been on a reconnaissance. He looks at the street. No
one is stirring, but for a single shutter which opens a
crack - a face peeps - and it closes again. Below him the
students are up and getting ready.
ENJOLRAS
The people have not stirred.
COURFEYRAC
Yet we will not abandon those
Who still live in fear.
ENJOLRAS
The people have not heard,
Yet we will not abandon those who
cannot hear.
Let us not waste lives!
Let all who wish to
Go from here!
There is silence. Uncertainty. Yet no one moves to go.
GAVROCHE
(from top of barricade)
Do you hear the people sing
GAVROCHE/COURFEYRAC
Singing the song of angry men
STUDENTS/CITIZENS
(joining)
It is the music of the people
Who will not be slaves again
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!
Under this:
FEUILLY
Enjolras! Ammunition's short.
MARIUS
I will go into the streets.
There are bodies all around.
Ammunition to be had.
Lots of bullets to be found.
ENJOLRAS
I can't let you go.
105.
VALJEAN
Let me go!
He's no more than a boy.
I am old.
I have nothing to fear.
Gavroche is already climbing the barricade under cover of
the smoke.
GAVROCHE
I volunteer!
COURFEYRAC
Come back, Gavroche! Don't you
dare!
JOLY
Someone pull him down right now!
GAVROCHE
Look at me, I'm almost there!
GAVROCHE
Little people know
When little people fight
We may look easy pickings
But we've got some bite!
So never kick a dog
When he's just a pup -
We'll fight like twenty armies
And we won't give up!
The rays of the rising sun break through, lighting up
Gavroche.
GAVROCHE
So you'd better run for cover
When the pup grows -
Crack! A musket shot. Gavroche falls face down onto the
barricade.
COURFEYRAC
No-o!
He runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his
arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the
gate in the barricade.
At the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees
this gate. And talks to the Army Officer.
As the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed
drawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is
lining up the big guns carefully.
106.
ARMY OFFICER
You at the barricades listen to
this!
The people of Paris sleep in
their beds!
You have no chance,
No chance at all!
Why throw your lives away?
Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group.
ENJOLRAS
Let us die facing our foes!
Make them bleed while we can!
COMBEFERRE
Make'em pay through the nose!
COURFEYRAC
Make'em pay for every man!
ENJOLRAS
Let others rise to take our place
Until the earth is free!
The sun now appears above the rooftops of the city.
And the big guns fire - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
The bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. In its wake
a massive barrage of musket fire.
The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst
right through in the first hit.
Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball
smashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among the
attackers.
Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the
barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles
down to others to be re-loaded, firing again.
Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting
down the dead, regardless of his own safety.
Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs
towards him -
CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade
and now the soldiers are storming through. The hard core of
student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Caf
Musain.
107.
97
98
Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the
onrush of the soldiers -
99
100
Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. A soldier
challenges him. One violent blow from Valjean sends the
soldier flying -
101
102
Enjolras falling backwards out of the window, until he
hangs upside down, the red flag still in his hands,
streaming like blood down the wall.
108.
PULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses, and the
remains of the barricade, and soldiers scouring the rubble
for any last pockets of resistance.
BACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene.
INTO FRAME walks Javert, grimly surveying the victory of
law over rebellion.
103
103
Valjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs
between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner -
and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of
soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out.
Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the
ground. A storm drain.
ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the
end of the alley. They look round. It's empty.
SOLDIER
Nothing here!
The soldiers depart. A moment of silence.
Then into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily
fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round.
He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the
grating has been lifted.
He stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for
him.
He straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does
the drain lead?
104
105
Valjean, crusted with slime, heaves Marius out of the sewer
onto the embankment that runs beside the river.
He looks up. There, staring at him, is Javert.
Valjean rises slowly. Heaves Marius up onto his back once
more. The strain of the night is showing. He's a man near
the end of his strength.
VALJEAN
It's you, Javert!
I knew you wouldn't wait too
long.
The faithful servant at his post
once more.
This man's done no wrong.
And he needs his family's care.
JAVERT
I warned you I would not give in!
I won't be swayed!
VALJEAN
Another hour yet
And then I'm yours
And all our debts are paid.
JAVERT
The man of mercy comes again
And talks of justice!
111.
VALJEAN
Come, time is running short -
Look down, Javert!
He's standing in his grave!
He starts to move past Javert.
Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head.
JAVERT
One more step and you die.
Valjean meets his eyes. That old battle of will against
will.
VALJEAN
Then I die.
He starts walking past Javert. Javert's hand trembles as it
holds the pistol.
Valjean keeps walking. Javert wills himself to shoot, but
he just can't do it. Frustrated, enraged with himself, he
lowers the gun.
JAVERT
Take him, Valjean,
Before I change my mind!
I will be waiting...
24601!
He turns away, trembling now all up and down his body. He
stares into the river. Valjean is gone now. He's alone.
JAVERT
Who is this man?
What sort of devil is he?
To have caught me in a trap
And choose to let me go free?
It was his hour at last
To put a seal on my fate
Wipe out the past
And wash me clean off the slate!
All it would take
Was a flick of his knife
Vengeance was his
And he gave me back my life!
He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps,
towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the
turmoil in his brain.
JAVERT
Damned if I live in the debt of a
thief!
Damned if I yield at the end of
the chase!
(more)
112.
JAVERT (cont'd)
I am the law and the law is not
mocked!
I'll spit his pity right back in
his face!
There is nothing on earth that we
share!
It is either Valjean or Javert!
How can I allow this man
To hold dominion over me?
This desperate man that I have
hunted...
He gave me my life! He gave me
freedom!
I should have perished by his
hand
It was his right...
It was my right to die as well...
Instead I live... But live in
hell!
He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. Here he
stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river.
The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents
swirl round the piles of the bridge.
JAVERT
And my thoughts fly apart
Can this man be believed?
Shall his sins be forgiven?
Shall his crimes be reprieved?
And must I now begin to doubt
Who never doubted all those
years?
My heart is stone and still it
trembles...
The world I have known is lost in
shadow
Is he from heaven or from hell?
And does he know
That granting me my life today
This man has killed me even so?
He climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the
night sky.
JAVERT
I am reaching but I fall
And the stars are black and cold
As I stare into the void
Of a world that cannot hold...
I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean
This is nowhere I can turn...
There is no way to go on...
113.
He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he
wants some angel from on high to save him - and so,
turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close
over him. And he's lost.
106
106
Soldiers are dismantling the last of the barricade. Women
move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among
the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both
the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolras's
mother, Grantaire's sister - and the working women of the
slums for whom they died, united now in their grief.
WOMAN 1
Did you see them
Going off to fight?
WOMAN 2
Children of the barricade
Who didn't last the night.
WOMAN 3
Did you see them
Lying where they died?
Someone used to cradle them
And kiss them when they cried.
WOMAN 4
Did you see them lying side by
side?
WOMAN 5
Who will wake them?
WOMAN 6
No one ever will.
WOMAN 2
No one ever told them that
A summer day can kill.
WOMAN 7
They were schoolboys
Never held a gun
Fighting for a new world that
Would rise up like the sun.
WOMAN 3
Where's that new world
Now the fighting's done?
The women move off to go about their day's business.
114.
107
111
A waiting cab. Valjean comes out of the modest lodging
house and gets in. The cab rattles away down the street.
IN THE CAB - Valjean sits gazing far away at nothing. Then
his weary eyes close.
112
112A
Marius and Cosette, newly married, are walking towards
Marius' house through an aisle created by wedding guests.
Carriages line the street.
WEDDING GUESTS
Ring out the bells
Upon this day of days!
May all the angels
Of the Lord above
In jubilation
Sing their songs of praise!
And crown this blessed time
With peace and love!
113

IN ON A WINDOW - Where two candle burn.

116A
Cosette and Marius rush round the cloisters and enter the
chapel in the middle of the cloisters.
116B
117
THE CAMERA MOVES over the cobbles as the light of the
rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street
battle. Past the remains of a barricade.
The distant sound of an approaching march.
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
Sixteen years later
Paris, 1848.
From far off, the swelling sounds of the approaching march
become the words of a song.
MARCHERS
Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light
For the wretched of the earth
(more)
126.
MARCHERS (cont'd)
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise.
As THE CAMERA RISES we see we're in the Place de la
Bastille. The triumphal column has long been completed, but
the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become
incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories
high, seven hundred feet long. Down all the streets that
converge on the square we now see the multiple victory
marches approaching. They cheer and beat drums as they
climb up to the top of the barricade.
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTIONS:
The people of Paris have risen in
their tens of thousands.
The King has fled. A new Republic
is born.
There in the forefront of one column march Marius and
Cosette.
MARCHERS
They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
They will walk behind the plough-
share
They will put away the sword
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their
reward!
As the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many
there are: thousand upon thousand. And there marching among
them we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the
students who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -
And out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the
grinning face of Gavroche. He climbs out to dance on the
elephant, as the crowd fill the square.
MARCHERS
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with
me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
As the marchers converge, there watching them are
Thenardier and his wife. Thenardier gives the marchers a
wave of greeting. Survivors to the last.
MARCHERS
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant
drums?
(more)
127.
MARCHERS (cont'd)
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!
Now among the marchers we see the ghost of Valjean, singing
with the rest atop the barricade, amongst the waving red
flags.
MARCHERS
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with
me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant
drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes...
Tomorrow comes!
