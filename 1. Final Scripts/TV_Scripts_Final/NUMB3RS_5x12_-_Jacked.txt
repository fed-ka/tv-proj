11EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET - DAY   

      A SIGHTSEEING BUS idles (the LOGO on the side reads 
       HOLLYWOODLINE TOURS ).  PANNING ACROSS  Walk of Fame  stars 
      WE FIND a PAIR OF GOOFY SHOES belonging to...

22EXT./INT. SIGHTSEEING BUS - DAY   

      The BUS DRIVER (40), who ushers TOURISTS on board the bus, 
      trying his best to make the 10,000th time he s done this seem 
      like the first --
                                  BUS DRIVER
                    Welcome to Hollywood, folks.  Watch 
                    your step.   Breakin  a leg  here 
                    doesn t mean good luck...

      A MOTHER (38) boards with her son, TODD (14) --

                                  TODD
                    This blows.  At least the hotel had 
                      video-games --

                                  MOTHER
                    You ve shot enough mutants today.
                          (through gritted teeth)
                    This is going to be fun.

      The Driver gives her a sympathetic look.  OTHER TOURISTS get 
      on, mostly couples.  A single male -- HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY 
      (JACK SHULER), 35 -- shoots the Driver a look...

                                  HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY
                    Hope your A/C s working.

      More TOURISTS board.  Among them... FOUR MEN WITH BACKPACKS 
      (BUCKLEY, KIROV, HAYS, CRAYPO), their packs bulging more than 
      you d expect for just a day-trip.  KIROV stumbles, an edgy 
      vibe.  BUCKLEY grabs his bag, helps him on.  The Driver gives 
      them the once-over.  BUCKLEY smiles it off --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     2.  

      CONTINUED:22

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Little too much partying last night.

                                  BUS DRIVER
                    Got his whole suitcase in there?

                                    BUCKLEY
                    We re staying at a hostel downtown.  
                    Didn t want our stuff walking out.

      The Driver nods.  The FOUR MEN grab seats.  An exchange of 
      looks between them tells us the Driver may ve bought the 
      story, but something here is definitely not right.  The LAST 
      TOURIST gets on.  OFF the Driver closing the doors, CUT TO:

33INT. SIGHTSEEING BUS - DAY - TRAVELLING  

      The BUS on the move.  The Driver launching into his patter.

                                  BUS DRIVER
                    Hope you folks have your cameras.  
                    The next two hours, we ll be hittin  
                    all the spots.  Walk of Fame, Sunset 
                    Strip, homes of the stars... a little 
                    excursion down Rodeo Drive... 

      He throws a smile back at the MOTHER of the teen --

                                  BUS DRIVER (cont d)
                    ...for the Pretty Woman in the back.

      The MOTHER smiles back.  The SON rolls his eyes.  The MOTHER 
      eyes KIROV beading sweat, looks to BUCKLEY --

                                  MOTHER
                    Your friend okay?

                                    BUCKLEY
                    He doesn t like crowds.

                                  BUS DRIVER
                          (resuming his patter)
                    ...So sit back and relax.  And keep a 
                    sharp eye.  Any of you sell a photo 
                    to the Enquirer, I get ten percent.  
                    First stop, Kodak Theatre, home of 
                    the Oscars --

      The TOURISTS press noses to the glass. On BUCKLEY s nod, the 
      MEN open their packs. BUCKLEY and HAYS pull guns. KIROV takes 
      out an ARRAY OF ELECTRONICS. CRAYPO grabs a PAINT PUMP 
      SPRAYER. BUCKLEY advances on the Driver, gun levelled. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     3.  

      CONTINUED:33

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Just keep driving.

      The TOURISTS  attention is drawn to the gunmen.  They react -- 
      some panic, some pray.  The MOTHER tries to calm her son --

                                  MOTHER
                    It s OK, everything s gonna be okay.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Stay in your seats.  Do what I say, 
                    no one will get hurt.

      KIROV deploys his ELECTRONICS.  CRAYPO spray-paints the 
      windows.  HAYS grabs a bag, starts down the aisle --

                                    BUCKLEY (cont d)
                    My associate s coming down the aisle.  
                    Place all items -- wallets, cameras, 
                    cell phones, everything -- in the bag.

                                  MOTHER
                    If it s our money you want, take it.

                                    BUCKLEY
                          (gun in her face)
                    I don t want your money.

                                  HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY
                    You don t need to do that.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    You want to stop me?

      A hard look between them.  BUCKLEY moves on.  The MOTHER 
      spies HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY palming his cell.  He puts a finger 
      to his lips -- shhh.

      ANGLE ON THE BUS DRIVER... an odd STATIC NOISE directs his 
      attention to KIROV, deploying a LOW-LEVEL NOISE CANCELLATION 
      MACHINE, as... CRAYPO paints the windows with the PUMP 
      SPRAYER (cocooning all except or small strip across the 
      windshield and on the driver s side window, enough to see the 
      road and side view mirror).  BUCKLEY turns to the Driver --

                                    BUCKLEY (cont d)
                    Cut the A/C.  Crank up the heat.
                    Take the next right, the alley.

      The Driver hits the turn signal.  His hand lingers near a RED 
      PANIC BUTTON under the dash.  He steals a look at BUCKLEY.  
      OFF the Driver, eyeing the BUTTON, debating his next move.             NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     4.  



44INT. FBI - HALLWAY - DAY   

      DAVID briefs DON, on the move --

                                  DAVID
                      Dispatcher received a panic button 
                    distress call 20 minutes ago from one 
                    of his company s sightseeing buses.  
                    He radioed the driver, guy s not 
                      responding.  With a busload of 
                    tourists missing, they called us.

      They move into...

      INT. FBI - WAR ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS55

      Where they find the company s Head of Security, LEN WALSH, 
      45, and a BUS TECH, 25.  David does the introductions --

                    These guys want to make a statement,

                    engineers added cow manure to a

                    Don.  They have the edge.

                    We ve got an edge they don t know 
                    about -- the video.

      Charlie s eyes land on the STREAMED VIDEO on his laptop...

                                    CHARLIE (ON VIDEO)
                    Yeah...
                          (light bulb going off)
                    Maybe I could use a Voxel-Based 3-D 
                    Capture.  
                          (then, explaining)
                    I created a CAD program for the 
                      Architecture Department last year...

      BEGIN AUDIENCE VISION

      A CAD  room,  filled with virtual furniture, lamps, etc...

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    It allows designers to see what a 
                    space will look like from different 
                    angles, using different floorplans.

    The POV and the objects in the room now move around (and move 
      around Charlie) -- light, shadow and perspective changing...

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    As the observer and the objects move 
                    around, the CAD algorithm calculates 
                    light, shadow, perspective...

      FOCUS now on one object (a floorlamp) -- vectors and numbers 
      emerge from the light and shadow, calculating its position...

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    ...Working backwards, those same 
                    elements can provide an exact 
                      measurement of an object s location 
                    in the room, down to the millimeter. 

      BACK TO SCENE

                                    CHARLIE (ON VIDEO) (cont d)
                    Using the streamed video and the bus 
                      manufacturer s specs, I could run a 
                    CAD program on the bus s interior.

                    Right now, the kidnappers have the 
                    advantage.  They ve studied our

      REVEAL that DON s cards are facing out, BUCKLEY can see them.

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    They know our hand.  And they re 
                    playing accordingly...

      BUCKLEY wins, sweeps the pot toward him.  New deal...

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    But what they don t know is, the more they 
                    play, the more they reveal their own game --

      BUCKLEY gathers his hand, but this time one of his cards is 
      facing out (so DON can see it).

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    -- giving us a clearer picture of 
                    their own decision-making process.

                    Shuler? -- You gotta be kidding me.

                                  DAVID
                    Buckley s the brains, but Shuler put 
                    the crew together.

                                  LIZ
                    I don t get it.  Shuler s the one who 
                    sent us the video, he tried to stop 
                    these guys.

                                  DAVID
                    Second thoughts, maybe.  Buckley 
                    starts threatening women and 
                    children, the cop in him comes out...

      Charlie enters, joining them (having heard this last) --

                    Guess again.

                    I was struggling with my model of the 
                      kidnappers  strategy.  There were too 
                    many inconsistencies in their 
                    otherwise high level of play.  Then 
                    it hit me -- the best way to cheat is 
                    to not seem like you re cheating.

                                  DON

                    They ve been showing us their hand.  
                    But only the cards they wanted us to 
                    see.  Think about it -- the driver 
                    hitting the panic button, the obvious 
                    route to the airport, all their 
                       mistakes  we thought we were 
                      capitalizing on... it was a cheat.  
                      Stagecraft.  And they saved the best

      The TECH runs the VIDEO in EXTREME SLO-MO... final seconds

      The TECH plays it back, ZOOMS IN ON KIROV (the Hacker).  We

                    And somewhere they re still holding a busload 
                    of hostages with guns to their heads.

                    So far, every step of the way, their 
                    strategy has shown a marked 
                      inclination toward non-violence.  In

      CRAYPO, pacing.  He looks down, sees a $20 bill on the 
      ground.  The wind blows it toward the line of pillars.  

      CRAYPO can t help himself.  He chases the bill, slides his 
        trigger-hand off the gun to reach for it.  A HAND GOES ACROSS 
      HIS MOUTH, GUN TO HIS HEAD.  It s King.  Colby and the TWO 
      SWAT GUYS have guns pointed at him.  OFF CRAYPO, giving up --

      ANGLE ON DON with the TWO OTHER SWAT GUYS.  They close in.

      BAD GUYS #2 and #3 (HAYS and KIROV) follow a HISSING SOUND to

      Don s phrasing sets Buckley on edge -- no acting this time.

      No response, STATIC.  Buckley peers through the windshield,

      INT. ND WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER8080

      Don, joined by Colby and King, FOUR SWAT GUYS with them, 
      hunker down and take cover behind a wall.  They watch as...

      BUCKLEY advances on foot toward them, into a pool of light.  
      He s encircled by the PASSENGERS, using them as a shield.  He 
      holds the MOTHER closest to him.

                                  KING
                    Nice work, Eppes.  You got us a 
                    visual...

      He nods to THREE SNIPERS in position along the upper walkway.

                                  KING (cont d)
                    ...My boys are ready.

                                  DON
                    No one takes a shot  til I say so.

      Off King s hard look... BUCKLEY calls out to Don --

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Back your guys off, Eppes.
                          (nods to MOTHER)
                    She and I are driving out of here.

                                  DON
                    It s not gonna happen.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    How many people do you want to see 
                    die?

                                  DON
                    No one s dying.

      Don steps out, hands stretched out away from him, no gun.  As 
      Colby, King, SWAT and the SNIPERS cover him, he edges toward 
      BUCKLEY, addresses the PASSENGERS surrounding him.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     55A.

                    to step away, one by one.  As soon as 
                    you re clear, make your way to the 
                    SWAT guys.  You ll be safe with them.

      The PASSENGERS look around confused.  BUCKLEY reacts --

                          (to the Passengers)
                    I ll kill the first one who tries.

                                  DON
                    He s not going to kill anyone.

      The MOTHER speaks up, frightened --

                                  MOTHER
                    He killed a cop, we saw him.  They 
                    dragged his body off the bus.

                                  DON
                    You mean the guy over there.

      Don throws a look to a PILLAR.  TWO SWAT GUYS step out from 
      behind it.  SHULER, in cuffs, is with them, clearly visible.  

                                  DON (cont d)
                    It was all a show.  He had blanks in 
                    the gun, same gun he has now.

      Again, Don makes his plea to the PASSENGERS --

                                  DON (cont d)
                    Walk away.  He s not gonna stop you.  
                    Just take that first step.  You ve 
                    gotta trust me.

      A beat, as the PASSENGERS trade confused looks...

      The SNIPERS  fingers are on the triggers, ready to fire...

      Colby and King watch as...

      ONE OF THE PASSENGERS makes his choice.  He peels away 
      slowly, then runs to a waiting SWAT GUY.  

      BUCKLEY does nothing.  Seeing this, one by one, the 
      PASSENGERS test the waters themselves, start to peel away and 
      run.  The trickle becomes a flood.  BUCKLEY watches, helpless 
      to stop them.  

      He tries to hang onto the MOTHER.  But it s no use.  She 
      shoves him away, breaks free and runs to a waiting SWAT GUY.  
      Her SON falls into her arms.

      BUCKLEY is left exposed, gun at his side. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 512/91 - "Jacked" - Rev. Goldenrod - 11/25/08     56A.

                    Why would I do that?

                    stand there, the better the chance 
                    one of these guys is gonna shoot you.

      A beat, as BUCKLEY holds Don s look.  A thin smile crosses 
      his face.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    You win.

      He slowly puts the gun down on the ground.

      Don, Colby, King and TWO SWAT GUYS move in to take BUCKLEY 
      into custody.  Colby checks Buckley s gun, looks to Don --
