A 5-year old girl wearing pajamas wanders alone down the
street.
FRANKIE
(BARELY AUDIBLE)
Me-gan!
The back door opens and Dean carries Frankie to the yard. The
first yellow rays of sunlight hit their faces.
He looks over the lawn, an empty bowl, water tin and a
doghouse posting the name MEGAN. He peeks inside the
doghouse. There's no one home. Dean moves to the fence. The
gate is open.
Dean carries Frankie to the front yard. They look around.
FRANKIE
When's she going to get back?
DEAN
She probably just went out for a run.
She'll be back soon because she's going
to get thirsty.
FRANKIE
She's going to be thirsty?

DEAN
You know what we should do? We should
leave her bowl full of water and her dish
full of food. Because she's gotta get
hungry and thirsty sometime. You know?
Dean's optimism is infectious. Frankie nods slowly.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Like me. I'm hungry. I'm so hungry I
could eat your toes.
Dean pretends to gnaw at Frankie's toes. Breaks her sadness.

Cindy backs their minivan out of the garage. Frankie is
strapped in her carseat. Dean comes up to the window, knocks.
Cindy brakes. Dean hands Frankie her backpack.
DEAN (to Frankie)
You be good today for Miss Alex, okay?
Frankie, dressed like a little leopard, nods.
DEAN (to Frankie) (cont'd)
Love you.

DEAN (to Cindy)

He kisses her on the corner of her mouth. A hesitation.
CINDY
...Love you.
Dean pulls his head out of the window.
DEAN
Put your seat belt on.
She starts to back up.
DEAN (CONT'D)
C'mon. What's the big deal?
Cindy does as she's told, looks over her shoulder, scrapes
the curb.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Watch...
Cindy cranks the wheel straight, puts on the gas and burns
down the road.
Dean stands there in his driveway, muttering to himself. He
watches the car disappear down the street.
Another car, headed the opposite direction, barrels down the
road, past the Periera home.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Slow that piece of shit down!
A12 A12
Cindy drives, fast food wrapper in hand, sees something out
the window. She slows down, waits for opposing traffic to
pass, then pulls a wide u-turn. She rises up out of her seat
to look at something.
CINDY
Oh no...
She pulls the car to a stop, puts on the hazzards, takes a
moment to compose herself, unbuckles her seatbelt. Gets out.
ELLIPSE: A blanket covers a dead Border Collie mutt in the
gutter. Cindy puts Megan's body into the back of her van.
A13 A13
Cindy sits in her car, checking her eyes in the rear view
mirror. They are puffy. Frankie runs full speed into Dean's
arms. He picks her up and walks her to Cindy's car.
DEAN
You were great.
FRANKIE
Did you find Megan?
DEAN
No. But... I was thinking... Maybe she
got a job or something... You know? So
she could make some money and buy some
food. Or maybe she moved out to Hollywood
to become a movie dog!
Frankie nods. Dean gets her to the car. Straps her in.
DEAN (CONT'D)
I was thinking...you should have some fun
tonight1 Don't you think?
FRANKIE
Yeah!
Cindy listens in the front seat. She doesn't approve.

The door opens to a grandpa in shorts and a bathrobe wearing
navy scuba gear, JERRY HELLER - early 70's. He has a tube
under his nose attached to an oxygen tank. His porch and
front yard are overloaded with Fourth of July decorations.
FRANKIE
Pa!
Jerry growls at Frankie. She screams, scared but delighted. A
yapping dog named SAMMY jumps on her. Jerry nods at Dean who
keeps his distance by the van.
CINDY
Aren't you coming up?
Dean gives a sour look and lights a cigarette.

What? I can't smoke around his oxygen.
Cindy gives Dean a slow look of contempt, grabs the backpack
and walks toward the house. Jerry stands over the hose spigot
with Frankie at his side.
JERRY
...Want me to show you a magic trick?
Here's how you turn the grass green. You
can teach it to your dad.
The sprinkler jets on. Cindy comes up and kisses her dad on
the cheek. She straightens Frankie's ears.
CINDY
Go say goodbye to Daddy. You're not going
to see him until tomorrow.
Jerry holds Frankie back.

Frankie runs to Dean, dodging the water stream. She hugs his
leg. He picks her up.
DEAN
Hey leopard. You be good now. You
remember what to do when Pa snores?
FRANKIE
Cover his mouth and hold his nose.
DEAN
That's my girl. Gimme a squeezer.
Dean hugs her and she squeezes back as hard as her arms
allow. Dean plays as if his neck was being pinched off. He
sets her on the ground running back to the porch. She gets
caught in the diameter of the sprinkler spray. She screams as
the water chases her.
JERRY
It got you! Go right! OTHER RIGHT!
Dean and Cindy both laugh. Their eyes meet for the first time
in days, maybe weeks. They exchange a brief smile, filled
with mutual love, pride and respect - connected by their
little girl. Frankie stands in front of Cindy, water drips
from her bangs.
CINDY
Come on silly. Let's go in and get dry.
FRANKIE
I don't wanna take off my costume!
CINDY
You don't have to. Let's just go in.
Cindy leads Frankie with one hand and pulls Jerry's oxygen
tank with the other. Jerry takes Frankie's free hand.
Dean smokes and watches... Cindy hold the screen open with
her foot and maneuver father, tank and child inside. The
screen door closes. Sammy barks at Dean through the screen
door. He tugs his smoke, memories flood. He drifts...

Bags of garbage dump into a 20' rented dumpster out in the

dumpster. - Barren home reveals a sagging floor. Ghostly
impressions on walls where pictures used to hang. - The truck
takes off, leaving a full dumpster behind.

has seen nature in the longest. Breathes deep.

Dean buries Megan by the fence. He places a stone on the
mound as a marker. He stands over it, smoking a cigarette.
Cindy looks on from the porch, arms hugging her body. Dean
walks to her and wraps his arms around her. Her arms fall and
move up to touch his side.
CINDY
What are we going to tell her?
DEAN
We'll tell her Monday. After the weekend.
Let's not ruin her Holiday.
Dean turns Cindy around, closes his eyes, and hugs her.
CINDY
She would have wanted to say goodbye.

frozen dog poop with a little shovel, rinses out Megan's
bowls with the hose. - He watches Cindy inside, cleaning. He
looks at his house. Remembers something.

He comes in through the sliding glass door and steps over
Cindy who is on the floor picking up Frankie's Hotwheels. He
yanks open a junk drawer and pulls out items.
DEAN
You remember where we put...
Cindy stops and watches him. He holds up a gift certificate
in an old anniversary card.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Here! Let's get the fuck out of here.
Dean grabs the phone and dials.
DEAN (on phone) (cont'd)
Hello, I want to see if I can reserve a

CINDY
What are you doing?
DEAN
Taking us away. We gotta get outta this
house.
(Back to phone)
It's still good? Good... Well, what rooms

You're not going to decide? I'll decide.
That's how decisions get made.
Dean gets a shit-eating grin.

the bags next to their luggage, slams the hatch closed and
snatches the keys from Dean's hands.
CINDY
Let's go.
DEAN
You're drivin'?
Cindy hops in the driver's seat. Dean rides on the end of the
buggy and crashes it into the buggy corral. She fires up the
engine and honks. He throws his hands up.
43 43
CINDY
I gotta go.
Cindy jogs across the road. Dean sees traffic coming.
DEAN
Goddamnit Cindy!! Pay attention!!!
On the side of the road, she stares into the woods. Cars pass
behind her, headlights flood the night. She descends into the
thicket until the sound of the highway is faint. Wind through
the leaves. She drops her pants and pees. Something rustles
and she looks into the woods.
CINDY
...Hello?
She stands up and zips up her pants. Eyes search the shadows.
...Cindy is ALONE. A leaf falls to earth. She stares at it and
her mind drifts back to...

A YOUNGER CINDY - 22, smart - wheels herself down suburban
sidewalks. Faces of passing people look at her with pity -
what a shame that such a pretty girl be in a wheelchair.
Cindy wheels herself across the campus quad. Students hurry

Dean counts his pay, opens his wallet - packs it with bills.
CURTIS (V.O.)
Sure, it's a great feeling at first, all

moving a little slower.

Still wearing his work clothes, Dean rides the train out of
the city, pulls out the locket. Reads the inscription on the
back - "you are my sunshine."
Dean gets off the train. Asks some people for directions.
87 87
The bus drives away. Inside, Dean stands. He is a little
down. He feels around in his pocket. Finds the locket. He
puts it on. The bus comes to a stop. A few passengers get on.
One of them is Cindy. Dean watches her pay her fare and move
to the back of the bus without noticing him.
She finds a seat, pulls her hoodie low, anonymous. She
underlines passages from a textbook using a highlighter. Dean
is frozen. He gathers the courage to walk toward her. The
moving bus throws his balance. He stands over her for a
moment. Cindy senses somebody in her space. She looks up.
Recognizes him, but can't place it.
DEAN
Hi.
CINDY
Hi.
DEAN
I just had a long talk with your
gramma... is that, is that your gramma?
Cindy remembers him now - he's just dressed nicer - he
doesn't look like a mover

Dean feels for the locket around his neck. He shakes his

DEAN
That's exactly what happened to my dog.
My parents moved out of our house and
three days later she was a goner.
He pulls the locket out from behind his shirt. He unclasps
it. Shows her the pictures.
DEAN (CONT'D)
He was so handsome, wasn't he? I was
trying to give it back to him.
Cindy looks at it.
CINDY
She was pretty too..
Dean thinks about the old man. The bus drives.
DEAN
She must have been crazy.
CINDY
Why do you say that?
DEAN
Cause there's one thing I know... the
prettier a girl is the more nuts she is.
I mean, look at you... you must be
insane.
CINDY
Excuse me?
DEAN
It's okay, I mean, I get it. It's not
your fault.
Cindy pulls the chain to stop the bus.
DEAN (CONT'D)

don't want to walk with me no more, then
just speed up.
Doors to the bus open. Cindy thinks about it.

Dean and Cindy wander side by side down the sidewalks and
streets of the town. They walk and talk about - small towns
and big cities, school and work, dreams and nightmares, being
old and being young, etc.

Dean looks back. He sees a bunch of houses that all look the
same. They keep walking.
ELLIPSE: Cindy smokes one of Dean's cigarettes, calls her dad
A89 A89
on a pay phone and tells him she won't be home for dinner
because she is studying.
ELLIPSE. DEAN tells Cindy about his childhood, the
B89 B89
sexualizing of his mother, and his fascination with women's
purses. It makes Cindy a little uncomfortable.
DEAN
Do you think it would be okay if I looked
in your purse?
CINDY
No.
DEAN
Why?
Cindy thinks about it for a moment. Against her better
judgement, she hands over her bag. It weighs a lot.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Jeez... What you got in here?
CINDY
Books. Mostly.
DEAN
Lot of books. You doing good?
CINDY

CINDY
Don't do it.
DEAN (rubbing his head)
You're gonna be a good doctor. I can
tell.
He digs through text books, pens, a wallet, asthma inhaler.
Then he comes to a bottle of lotion. Opens the cap, sniffs.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Mmm. This is what you smell like?
Cindy nods, "I guess so."
DEAN (CONT'D)
I wanna smell like you. Can I?
CINDY
You wanna put on my lotion?
Dean nods, applies a little lotion to his fingertips, rubs it
in circles on his hands, applies it to his forearms, neck,
face. He enjoys the feeling of it, offers her some. She say's
no. He digs through her purse and finds lip balm, smells it.
DEAN
This is what your lips smell like? They
must smell good.
He puts some on his lips.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Mmm. Your lips must taste good.
CINDY
Are you fucking with me?

They walk to an old playground. Cindy gets an idea.
CINDY
There!
Cindy runs to an old, creaky merry-go round, jumps on.
CINDY (CONT'D)
I used to love these things.
DEAN
Oh God... I hate these things.
CINDY
Push me.
Dean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow,
but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up
speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't
keep up with the centrifugal force.
CINDY (CONT'D)
Get on!
Dean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The
world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to
insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair
snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile
away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets
off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps
falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on
all fours, laughing.

She refuses.
DEAN (CONT'D)
It's the only way. It will make you feel
better. Don't be embarrassed. I'll do it.
He sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to
vomit. The sound of it is too much for her. She gags. Side by
side, they puke into the gravel. They finish their business
and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side,
looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We
see their breath.
CINDY
I'm still spinning.
DEAN
Me too.
CINDY
Maybe it's just the Earth that's
spinning.
DEAN
Yeah. We're flying.
They laugh. Birds begin to awaken and fly.
DEAN (CONT'D)
You should come visit me in the city
sometime.
The morning air chills their bodies. Dean takes off his
jacket and uses it as a blanket. They get close together to
get warm and watch the stars spin above them.
95 95
Drunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is
cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each
other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy
makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape
of his chest, his abdomen, his back.
CINDY
Are my hands cold?
DEAN
Yes.

Dean and his buddies, file out of the garage, he notices
Cindy across the street, he looks both ways, crosses the
street toward her. The closer he gets to her, the more
nervous she gets.
DEAN
Are you okay?
Cindy nods.
CURTIS (O.S.)
See you later, Elvis!
Dean turns around and sees his work buddies busting him for
being a Romeo. He waves goodbye to them, turns back to Cindy,
embarrassed but happy. She smiles, concealing something.

CINDY (CONT'D)
I want a divorce!
She has emptied herself. Her whole body is numb and it feels
as if she is floating in space. Anger overcomes Dean. He hits
the dashboard with concrete fists.
DEAN
I know!
He grabs the suitcase next to him and opens the door. He
throws it through the air into a FIELD - trying rid himself
of pain, longing, and desperation. He clutches his wedding
ring, but can't yank it off of his fat finger. Finally, he
gets it off and tosses it into the field. The moment he
releases it, he wishes he hadn't.
MOMENTS LATER - Dean and Cindy search for the ring. It is
lost. Music begins to play in reverse.

Various Scenes of the Periera family together...

All kinds of flowers. Colors, smells. Freshly arranged. Dean
studies them. Finds the one's he likes. And steals them.
132 132
We follow Dean from behind - walking down the middle of the
street. He holds the flowers. Meanwhile, we hear Cindy asking
her gramma questions about love and life. "What's it like to
be old?" - "when did men stop looking at you?" She confides
her feelings for Dean. (The responses will be real responses -
a real conversation).

Dean finds the house. He straightens himself, walks to the
front door, rings the BELL, checks the smell of his hands.
Jerry, bourbon in hand, opens the door. Dean's face is purple
and swollen from the fight.
DEAN
I didn't know if it was pot luck so I
brought an eggplant.
He points at his face. Behind Jerry, Cindy peeks out from the
kitchen at the end of the hallway. It is the first time she
has seen Dean since the fight. She is shocked.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Face looks like an eggplant, don't it?
How you doing sir, I'm Dean.
Dean holds out his hand. Jerry looks Dean up and down.
CINDY
Oh God.
Cindy squeezes by her father to Dean. The expression on her
face says it all. Dean hands her the flowers, leans in and
kisses her. While he's there he whispers.
DEAN
I stole these for you.
CINDY
Are you okay?
Dean nods. She leads him down the hall. Jerry stops, turns.
JERRY (to Cindy)
Tell him to take off his shoes.
Dean removes his boots. A toe wiggles out of a holey sock. He
gathers the hole and tucks it between his big toe and his
second toe. Cindy leads him by the hand to the kitchen.

The front door bursts open and Frankie, still in her leopard
costume, charges down the walkway.
FRANKIE
Daddy! Daddy! Mommy!
Cindy's car sits in the driveway. Cindy gets out, grabs her
suitcase. Jerry emerges from the house. Cindy kneels down and
hugs Frankie. She is electricity in her arms.
CINDY
Who had candy for breakfast?

Frankie doesn't answer and squirms out of Cindy's arms. She
runs to Dean who gets out of the car like a wounded soldier.
DEAN
Hey sweetheart.
Frankie leaps into Dean's arms. Cindy walks up to the house.
CINDY
How was Frankie?
JERRY
She was good. Are you OK?
CINDY
I'm OK.
Cindy kisses her father on the cheek, closes the screen door.
DEAN (holding Frankie)
I can't play right now, okay?
He releases his wired daughter who runs circles around him.
Dean walks up to the porch. He and Jerry stand face to face.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Do you want to get out of my way.
Jerry backs away. Dean walks past him into the house.
JERRY
I don't know what happened up there. But
please Dean, come on. Don't push it. Let
it be...
Dean closes the screen door behind him and locks it. Jerry
pulls on the door.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Hey! You can't lock me out of my own
house!
Dean calls back.
DEAN
Keep an eye on Francis.
JERRY
I don't have my oxygen! Hey!

Frankie tries to squirm out of her mother's arms.
FRANKIE
Daddy!
Dean walks out the front door where he passes Jerry who
stands on the porch. He moves across the lawn to the
sidewalk. Vermillion light falls in the sky.
Cindy sets Frankie down and she runs out the door. Jerry
catches the little girl by the arm and holds her tight.
Dean walks toward the horizon.
FRANKIE (SCREAMS) (cont'd)
Daddy!
Dean stops and turns. Cindy walks to the porch.
CINDY
Let her go, Dad.
Jerry releases her and Frankie runs fast to Dean. She jumps
at him to go into his arms. He doesn't pick her up. From the
porch Cindy and Jerry watch Dean as he points to them.
Frankie doesn't move. Dean yells for her to go back. Frankie
heads back to her mother, confused. Cindy kneels down and
takes her in her arms.
Families light fireworks off in the middle of the streets.
DEAN continues down the street that connects with other
streets, all lined with pretty houses.

The houses form neighborhoods that join with other
neighborhoods forming towns. Beyond the towns, hills stretch
far into to the horizon. Fireworks explode against dark blue
on blue.
