          A RED FLASH back-lights the silhouetted forms of TWO MEN
          engaged in a desperate fight, smashing into furniture and
          walls before tumbling to the floor.  This sequence is
          shot hand-held, a chaotic one-er that keeps us from seeing
          either man clearly as they continue to be intermittently
          backlit by COLORED FLASHES accompanied by distant BOOMS.

          Still, one man is clearly the AGGRESSOR, pinning his
          opponent by the neck with one hand while punching him
          repeatedly with the other.  His VICTIM instinctively
          reaches for something to defend himself with, his fingers
          inching past several items that have fallen to the floor --
            including a MOTEL KEY with the number 14 etched on the
          fob, and an open blood-encrusted CLASP KNIFE -- before
          gripping the base of a broken LAMP.  He smashes it into
          Aggressor's head, stunning him, and at the same time
          causing him to roll over on his back, so their positions
          are now reversed.

          Victim thinks it's over when suddenly Aggressor grabs him
          by the throat with both hands, choking him.  Victim tries
          to remove Aggressor's hands, can't, and in self-defense
          starts choking him as well.  And now fear and anger drive
          Victim over an emotional edge.  He lifts Aggressor by the
          neck a few inches off the floor and then slams his head
          back down:  once, twice, then a third time with increasing
          force.  Finally Aggressor's grip weakens; his hands slip
          away from Victim's throat.  But Victim continues choking
          him.  He's crossed a line, lost himself to the violence.

          Finally it's over; Aggressor lays still.  Victim stands,
          takes a few wobbly steps into the bathroom, splashes some
          water on his face, then reaches to turn on --


          A LIGHT SWITCH

          His hand leaves a bloody imprint, then we PAN to the
            MIRROR... and see a bloody haggard face.  Johnny's face. 
          As he stares at himself with fatigue, then dawning horror --



          Johnny starts to pull on his seat belt as Bruce fishes
            something out of his coat pocket.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, look what I found.

          It's a FOLDED TWENTY; he drops it in Johnny's coat pocket.

                                        BRUCE
                        From my coat pocket to yours.
                                (beat)
                        By the way, I could've beat that
                        cast.  Just didn't want you to
                        look bad in front of your boy.

          As Johnny forces a smile and drives off...



          An old RICHARD BACHMAN novel, then a door chime jingles
          and the book is lowered, revealing the face of the motel's
          slacker MANAGER.  He eyes Johnny, who's just entered.

                                        MANAGER
                        Can I help you?

          JOHNNY eyes the RACK OF KEYS behind the Manager's head. 
          The key to Room 14 hangs there with a few others.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No one's checked into Room 14?

          The Manager glances over his shoulder at the key, then
          back at Johnny.

                                        MANAGER
                        Doesn't look like it.

          He watches curiously as Johnny touches the pen tethered
          to the guest register, then the register itself, running
          his fingers down the column of signatures.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know this may sound like an odd
                          request, but I need to take a
                        look in that room.

                                        MANAGER
                        You forget something?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's more like I'm trying to find
                        something.  It's hard to explain,
                        but it'll just take a minute.

          The Manager plucks the key off the rack, slaps it down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          But as he takes the key, again failing to have a vision --

                                        MANAGER
                        Our nightly rate is forty two
                        fifty, plus tax, which also happens
                        to be our minute rate.
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Cash or charge?



          POV ANGLE as door numbers 12 and 13 pass by.  Then 14
          looms.

    13CONTINUED:13

          JOHNNY pauses outside the door before inserting the key;
          pauses again before turning it; then enters.



          As Johnny shuts the door, then stands still for a beat,
          taking in the perfectly ordinary room, his mind trying to
            reconcile the innocuous setting with:


  1515MEMORY FLASHES (BLACK-AND-WHITE SEQUENCE)

          Jarring cuts of Johnny and the other man fighting, dimly
          backlit by fireworks flashes, ending with Johnny on his
          back being pummeled.


  1616RESUME

          Johnny reacts to the memories, then sees a table lamp.


  1717MEMORY FLASHES:  MORE JARRING CUTS (B&W)

          Johnny hits the man with the lamp, stunning him; then
          he's stabbed and begins to smash the man repeatedly.


  1818RESUME

          As Johnny tentatively touches the lamp, but doesn't get a
          new vision.  He curses under his breath, frustrated.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Damn it.

          He walks into the bathroom, eyes his reflection in the
            mirror...


  1919MEMORY FLASHES (B&W):  JOHNNY'S BLOODY FACE IN THE MIRROR


  2020RESUME

          Johnny touches the LIGHT SWITCH but again nothing happens;
          his Dead Zone is drawing blanks, even as memories of his
          original vision assail him.  Moving back to the main room,
          he finds himself by a window.  He looks out... and sees
          the strip club.          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/12/04 - YELLOW       13.



          The establishment's operating at a decidedly languorous
          daytime pace, a dancer onstage crouching to perform before
          a pair of unemployed men, one of whom almost reluctantly
          parts with a dollar to tuck in her G-string.  A few more
            customers are at the bar, along with Linus, the bouncer,
          who sips coffee as he scans a racing form.  He glances up
          as Johnny enters.

          Johnny looks around, checking out the handful of customers,
            wondering if one could be the man from his vision; he
          notes Linus, the bouncer, then stops a Cocktail Waitress.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is Tyler working?

          She nods toward a booth, where a dancer with LONG BROWN
          HAIR is trying to engage a morose drunk, her back to us. 
          Johnny's puzzled, remembering her as a blonde.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tyler?

          He's about to touch her elbow when she turns.

                                        TYLER
                        Hi.  I guess we know each other.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Someone told me to look you up. 
                          I thought you were a blond though.

          She swings her hair; we realize her blond look was a wig.

                                        TYLER
                          Brunette by day, blond by night. 
                        And your name is...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Johnny.

                                        TYLER
                        Well, Johnny, would you like to
                        buy me a drink?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually...

          Tyler holds up a finger, shushing him.

                                        TYLER
                        Say no more.  I know what you
                        want.

          She crooks the finger as she turns and starts away,


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/10/04 - PINK         14.


    21CONTINUED:21

            beckoning Johnny to follow as she smiles back at him. 
          Johnny reluctantly follows, ill at ease in this setting.


          NEW ANGLE - LAP DANCE ALCOVE

          as she leads Johnny into an adjoining alcove open to the
          nearby stage and the more distant front door, then
            indicates a banquette as she picks out a music tape.

                                        TYLER
                        Just make yourself comfortable,
                        Johnny, and then I'll make you
                        more comfortable.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sitting)
                        Tyler, I really just want to talk --

                                        TYLER
                        Oh, I love to talk.

          She's already gyrating to the music, pulling open the top
          of her gown.  (She'll continue to strip and gyrate closer
          to an uncomfortable Johnny as the scene continues.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to know if a man came in
                        and hit on you, then asked you to
                        go back to his place.

                                        TYLER
                        Every day of my life.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Today?

                                        TYLER
                                  (seductive)
                        Not yet.

          Now she's dancing very close.  Johnny reaches for her
          waist, hoping to get a vision, but she warns him off.

                                        TYLER
                        Uh-uh, tiger, no touching.

          Embarrassed and frustrated, Johnny shoves his hands into
          his coat pockets.  Somehow that triggers --


2222A VISION:  SPLIT REALITY - DAY/NIGHT

          While the lap dance alcove remains in the present, the


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/10/04 - PINK         15.


    22CONTINUED:22

          rest of the club transforms into a hopping night-time
          scene:  music pumping, dancers mingling on the crowded
          floor, while another Tyler, in her blond wig, is dancing
          on stage, spinning around the pole...

          Johnny reacts to this new seemingly unprompted vision,
          then reacts again as he SEES HIMSELF enter and intently
          scan the crowd, then begin stopping customers, cocktail
          waitresses and dancers and shouting questions we can't
          hear over the din, at times gesturing to his right forearm,
          at other times grabbing them, seemingly trying to force
          visions.

          In the alcove, Johnny cranes to look over Tyler's shoulder
          as she now strips off her top (seen from behind).  The
          music in the alcove clashes with the music in the main
          room, creating a cacophonous collision of vision and
          reality.  Johnny is sweating, uncomfortable; he doesn't
          want to be here but it's as if his visions are demanding
          it.  He watches as --

            Vision-Johnny approaches the stage, now within earshot as
          he shouts to Vision Tyler, who has finished dancing and
          is collecting loose bills.  Meanwhile, Johnny's attracted
          the attention of Linus, who approaches from behind.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Hey!  You seen a white guy, about
                        five eleven, short light-colored
                        hair, with a tattoo on his right
                          forearm? 

          Vision Tyler looks confused; Linus grabs his arm.

                                        BOUNCER
                        That's it for you, buddy.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        I'm looking for someone.

                                        BOUNCER
                        You're bothering the girls.  You're
                        outta here.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        The man I'm looking for, he's
                        dangerous.  Maybe you can help
                        me.

                                        BOUNCER
                        You want my help? 

          And now he grabs Johnny and starts muscling him toward
          the door.

                        I said back off!  

          And the vision ends, exactly where the previous one began.


  2323RESUME:  LAP DANCE ALCOVE - DAY

          Johnny still reacting as Tyler stands, slipping back into
          her gown, as she shuts off the tape player.

                                        TYLER
                        Feeling more relaxed I hope? 
                        That's twenty, by the way.

          Johnny stands, takes out his wallet, still very rattled.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tyler, have you seen a white guy,
                        about five eleven, with short
                          light-colored hair and a tattoo
                        on his right forearm?

                                        TYLER
                        You are a strange one, aren't
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have you seen him?

                                        TYLER
                        No, I don't think so.
                                (as Johnny gives her
                                  a twenty)
                        The dance costs twenty, but that
                        doesn't include my tip.

          Johnny checks his wallet; just a few singles.  Then he
            remembers something and reaches into his coat pocket,
          fishes out Bruce's folded twenty.  Tyler takes it.

                                        TYLER
                        Thanks.  I've got to go on stage
                        now, but maybe I'll see you later.

          Another disturbing remark in the context of Johnny's
          visions.  He moves off, glancing around again to see if
          anyone fits the new description.  A man at the bar seems
          a rough match, but as Johnny passes him, we see his sleeves
          are rolled up:  no tattoo.  Meanwhile, Linus approaches.

                                        BOUNCER
                        Sir, there's a two-drink minimum. 
                        Can I have a waitress take your
                        order?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, that's fine.  I'm leaving.

          Under Linus's watchful eyes, Johnny heads for the front
          door, glancing back at the bouncer as he's about to exit. 
          As a result, he almost bumps into another man who's
            entering:  a frazzled SALESMAN carrying a battered
            BRIEFCASE in his left hand, a sports jacket draped over
          his right shoulder obscuring his other arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me.

          Johnny gives the man a quick glance as he exits, but he
          seems innocuous enough.  Camera stays with the man as he
          now turns to look after Johnny, the jacket shifting to
          expose his right forearm.  We see part of a tattoo: 
            something an ex-Marine might have (the words "Semper Fi"
          and maybe some sort of colorful design or symbol, possibly
          an all-seeing eye in a pyramid, like on a dollar bill).

          Then he turns, his anxious (and perhaps indeed hurt and
          lonely) eyes peering into the gloom of the club, fastening
          on the comely figure of Tyler.

          Off the irony:  Johnny has just walked past the man he
          may kill, but remains oblivious...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                              ACT TWO

          FADE IN:


          Starting close on an agitated Johnny as he enters from
          the kitchen with a glass of water --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm telling you, they're out of
                          control!

            Revealing Bruce seated at one end of the couch, swiveling
          to watch Johnny as he pops a prescription pain pill.

                                        BRUCE
                        They?

                                        JOHNNY
                        My visions.  I have no idea what's
                        triggering them.  It's like they're
                        just happening spontaneously.

                                        BRUCE
                        How is that possible?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  But that's not
                        all.  This morning, I had a vision
                        of myself killing a man.  Later I
                        saw myself being thrown out of
                        this strip club where I went
                        looking for him.  And soon after
                        that, I'm seeing myself walking
                        into that same club.
                                (beat)
                        I'm having these visions of a
                          terrible night ahead of me... but
                        the visions are marching backwards --
                        towards me.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's going to happen when they
                        meet?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  But in these
                          visions, I'm angry, shouting at
                        people, grabbing at them.  I'm
                          carrying a knife, a knife with
                        blood on it.  And then I kill a
                        man, Bruce.  I kill a man.

                                        BRUCE
                        In self defense... right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had the knife, Bruce.  Maybe he
                        was defending himself from me.

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't know that.  You don't
                        know how that fight starts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know how it ends, with me
                        strangling a man.  And I don't
                        stop.  I don't stop until he's
                        dead.

                                        BRUCE
                                (beat, at a loss)
                        So when is this supposed to happen?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Tonight.  What I don't know is
                        how it starts or why I get a knife
                        and hunt a man down.

          He pauses at the other end of the couch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That isn't me, Bruce.  It can't
                        be.

          He jabs the top of the couch for emphasis, triggering --

          Sarah is gardening, J.J. helping by digging holes with a
          trowel.  She reacts to the alarm in Johnny's voice.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?  What is it?

                        Yes, he's helping me in the garden.

                        I want you to take him inside and
                        lock the doors.  I'll call Walt,
                        have him send a patrol car over.

          Sarah glances nervously back toward the house.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, what's going on?  Are we
                        in danger?

                        It's probably nothing, but I just
                        want you to sit tight until I
                        make sure.  I'll explain later,
                        but for now please just do this.

                                        SARAH
                        Sure.  Of course.

                        I'll call you soon.

          We end the intercut as Johnny hangs up and grabs his coat.

                                        BRUCE
                        So where are you going now?  Make
                        that where are we going now?

                        To report a murder.



          CLOSE ON A DESK CLOCK sandwiched between a PHOTO of Roscoe
          with his wife and two young daughters, and a novelty
            NAMEPLATE that says "World's Best Deputy."  The clock
          reads after five (assuming this is late spring, sunset
          will come late).

            REVEALING Roscoe at his desk, taking a report from an
          exasperated robbery victim -- it's the Salesman Johnny
          passed by at the strip club.

                                        SALESMAN
                        I just went into a... bar for a
                        drink.  And when I got back...

                        The car, it was a rental, right?

                        Screw the car!  They took my
                          luggage, my sample cases,
                          everything.

                        All I've got left is this lousy
                        briefcase.

                        about all.  We're pretty swamped

          as Walt leads them to his office.  Johnny again passes
          the Salesman having no clue it's the same guy he saw
          himself fighting and killing in the motel room.

                        For Chrissakes, John.  I've got
                        local cops camped outside my house. 
                          Meanwhile Sarah's inside scared
                        to death, and now you're telling
                        me this is all because of some
                        crime that may happen some place
                          sometime tonight?

                        And you think the victim could be
                        Sarah or J.J.?

                        Roscoe implied it involved family.

                        beginning.

          Johnny and Bruce trade looks.

                        The "beginning."  That's a little
                        tricky, huh?

                        Because my visions haven't shown
                        me that murder.  They began with
                        me killing a man, in revenge.

          Walt's taken aback, but Bruce is still concerned by the
          way Johnny is presenting this.

                                        BRUCE
                        You keep acting like you're a
                          murderer too, but you don't know
                        that.

                        I know what I saw.

                                        BRUCE
                        Sure.  Just don't assume it's the
                        whole story.

          He puts a reassuring hand on his friend's shoulder.  It's
          the first overt contact we've seen between them, and as
          Johnny turns to Bruce, BRUCE DISAPPEARS.  Johnny's in --



          Johnny turns now at Walt's voice to see Walt now on the
          phone, wearing the same uniform but looking tired and
          drained.  His words have an edge that masks his own pain.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT TWO - 4/13/04 - GREEN        27.

                                        WALT
                        Tell County we're sending them
                        over tonight, and I want them in
                          separate cells, separate wings if
                          possible.  Less chance they have
                        to compare notes the better.

          He hangs up as another Johnny (Vision-Johnny) bursts in.

                                        WALT
                        John... 

            Vision-Johnny gestures angrily to the window that connects
          to the main office.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Are those your suspects? 

          Walt opens the Venetian blinds to reveal TWO WHITE STREET
          PUNKS with SHORT BLEACHED HAIR giving statements on
          opposite sides of the office.  Both have tattooed arms,
          one with the words "White Power" on his forearm.  Observer-
          Johnny moves beside Walt to peer at them too.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah.  We grabbed them up in a
                        biker bar about five blocks away. 

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Well you grabbed up the wrong
                        guys.  They didn't do it.

            Normally, Walt would take him at his word, but Vision-
          Johnny's manic, angry attitude raises doubts.

                                        WALT
                        Well, that's what they said before
                        they clammed up, but I've got
                        reason to believe they did.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        I saw the killer, Walt, remember? 

          Walt picks a police report off his desk, reads --

                                        WALT
                        "Caucasian male; approximately
                        five eleven; short light-colored
                        hair; tattoo on right forearm;
                        age indeterminate."

          Clearly adding up to a less than specific portrait.  Vision-
          Johnny reacts defensively.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT TWO - 4/13/04 - GREEN        28.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        It was dark, it was...
                                  (frustrated)
                        It wasn't like a line-up, okay,
                        but I saw enough. 

                                        WALT
                        Yeah?  Well maybe you should take
                        another look.

          He indicates the window again, through which we can see
          the two punks being stood up, about to be taken to jail. 

                                        WALT
                        Either of those two could match
                        your description, right down to
                        the tattoos.  Plus, we've got
                          witnesses who put them at the
                        scene, they both have records
                        that include assault, and one of
                        them even had blood on his shirt. 
                        We're still waiting on the DNA,
                        but the blood type's a match.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                                (emphatic)
                        It's not them. 

                                        WALT
                        Look, I know what you're going
                          through.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Do you? 

          Walt's stung.  But then again we may be wondering why he
          can be any cooler about this than Vision-Johnny.  It can
          only mean that neither J.J. nor Sarah was the victim.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, I do.  And bad as this is,
                        I know you're making it worse by
                        blaming yourself. 
                                (beat)
                        John, you did everything you could.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Are you gonna listen to me or
                        not? 

                                        WALT
                        Right now I think you're too close
                        to this to be objective.

                        Now you're gonna interpret my
                        visions for me?  

                                        WALT
                        I'm just saying, based on that
                          description, you could be wrong
                        about those two.
                                (as Johnny scoffs)
                        Look, why not go home for a while,
                        try and get some distance?  At
                        least wait until the lab results
                        come back before jumping in.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        If I don't jump in, this guy could
                        get away.  You want to wait around,
                        fine.  I'll get him myself.

          He starts for the door, but Walt grabs his arm. 

                                        WALT
                        You'll "get him"?  I thought that
                        was something else you were trying
                        to avoid.
                                (releasing him)
                        I've already had one hate crime
                          tonight.  Doing something rash
                        isn't going to bring Bruce back.

            Vision-Johnny eyes him a beat, then exits.  And off our
          Johnny's stunned expression...

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        John?



          As he finds himself still looking at Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it, man?

          Johnny doesn't reply, the pieces starting to fall into
          place as he relives the moments that triggered the earlier
          visions -- and now realizes they all involved indirect
          contact with Bruce.



          Bruce drops a folded twenty into Johnny's jacket pocket.



          Tyler tells Johnny not to touch, and he shoves one of his
          hands into the same pocket.

          Johnny jabs the couch to make a point as Bruce sits at
          the opposite end.



          Bruce puts a reassuring hand on Johnny's shoulder,
          triggering Johnny's latest vision.  And now we --



          Johnny still eyeing Bruce, who's now alarmed.  Walt looks
          puzzled and concerned too.

                                        WALT
                        John, did you just have another
                        vision?
                                (when Johnny nods)
                        Do you know who the victim is?

          And as Johnny turns back toward Bruce, fixing him with a
          troubled gaze, and Bruce reacts, we...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:


          Having learned the awful truth, Bruce is doing the pacing
          now, trying his level best not to lose it.

                                        BRUCE
                        This is... this is... par for the
                        course with you, right?
                                (off their looks)
                        I mean you've seen people die in
                        visions before, and almost every
                        time you were able to save them.
                                (then)
                          "Almost."  I had to say "almost,"
                        didn't I?

                        The only times Johnny couldn't
                        save someone, it's because they
                        ignored his warnings.

                        And my ears are wide open.  So
                        why are we freaking?

                                        WALT
                        We're not.

                        Only here's the problem...

                                        BRUCE
                        Now I'm freaking.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Remember how we say, "change one
                        detail and all of life changes"?

                                        BRUCE
                        Meaning the future, sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only I've already taken any number
                        of actions, changed any number of
                          details, and so far the future
                        hasn't changed.  It's still headed
                        right for us.

          Johnny nods reluctantly, turns to Walt --

                        You thought it was a hate crime,
                        and you'd arrested a couple of
                        young street punks.  But I thought
                        the killer was someone else.

                                        WALT
                        Did you describe him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not too well.  White, about five
                        eleven, short light-colored hair,
                        and some kind of tattoo on his
                        right arm.

                                        BRUCE
                          A tattoo, great, we're making
                          progress.  In fact, just by talking
                        about this we've probably changed
                        the future.  But aren't you two
                        detectives forgetting something
                          obvious?
                                (off their looks)
                        Me.  You said I was the cause of
                        all these visions.  Well here I
                        am.  You want to fill in the
                        blanks, just touch me again.

          He holds out his arm like a challenge, but we sense he's
          really aching to be reassured.  When Johnny hesitates --

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't worry about me.  I don't
                        think the news can get much worse.

          Johnny grasps his arm, triggering --



          As Johnny releases Bruce's arm as he reacts to this psychic
          barrage, putting a hand on the wall to steady himself.

                        It's still happening.

                        You saw it?  You saw me being

          His anger, another natural reaction to this unnerving
          situation, is beginning to trump his fear.  But not
            Johnny's.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Please, for my peace of mind,

                        So how you gonna do that?

                        By getting a step ahead of my

          Moving with Johnny as he pushes open a swinging door,
          holding onto it for an extra beat as he tries to get a
          vision.  He walks through the crowded waiting area,
          glancing at a WALL CLOCK that shows the time to be 6:15
          (still daytime, again assuming this is late spring).  He
          heads toward the admissions desk where --

          A HEAD NURSE is doing paperwork.  She sees Johnny
            approaching, pausing to touch an empty gurney, and figures
          him for a loon.  Without looking up from her work:

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Can I help you, sir?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hope so.  This hospital's the
                        designated trauma center for the
                        entire Bangor area, am I right?

                                        HEAD NURSE
                          Mmm-hmm.  And as you can see,
                        we're pretty busy, so unless you're 
                          suffering from some trauma of
                        your own... a physical trauma...

          But meanwhile Johnny has noticed her paperwork --

                                (when she looks up)
                        When does the night shift begin?

          Now the Nurse is getting genuinely peeved.

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        It began at six.

                        be working all night?

                        I need to speak with the attending
                        physician.

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        I'm afraid I can't have you
                          bothering the doctors.  Now unless
                        you have a genuine medical
                          emergency --

            Impatient himself, Johnny grabs her arm, triggering --



          Once again, we're moving with Johnny through the double
          doors, only now CAMERA is HAND-HELD, and though our
          subjective P.O.V. is somewhat less frenetic than the
          earlier one-er visions, it mirrors Johnny's anxiety.  

          He glances at the WALL CLOCK -- it's now 9 P.M. -- as he
          approaches the Head Nurse, who's standing with a clipboard
          and directing traffic in the much busier E.R.  She stops
          two paramedics who are wheeling in a car accident victim:

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Take her to Curtain Three.

                        we've got more victims coming in
                        from that highway pile-up.

          They move off as Johnny reaches her.

                          friend... Bruce Lewis... I think
                        he may've been taken here.

          The Nurse checks her clipboard...

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Was he in the accident? 

                                        JOHNNY
                          Accident?  No, he was assaulted. 
                        I was with him but we became
                          separated... and when I got back,
                        he'd already been taken away.

          The Nurse finds Bruce's name on her list; her expression
          becomes grave.

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Yes... I see we did have an assault
                        victim.  Are you a family member?

                        No!  I told you I'm his friend. 
                        John Smith.  My name's John Smith. 
                        Now where is he?  Is he in surgery? 

          The Nurse can't stop herself from glancing at a curtained-
          off bed. 

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Mister Smith, I'm sorry.

                        No...

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Our trauma team did everything it
                        could --

                                        JOHNNY

                        -- but his wounds were just too...
                        Mister Smith?

          Ignoring her, Johnny crosses to the curtain and jerks it
          open, revealing Bruce's body, all but his face and
            shoulders covered by a blood-stained sheet.

                        afraid I have to ask you some
                        questions.  Someone will have to
                        contact his family...

          She goes on talking but her voice fades under as Johnny
          moves to Bruce's side.  Devastated he looks at his friend,
          speaks to himself...

                        to you?  Who did this?  

          He reaches out and grips Bruce's arm, then reacts to a
            wrenching vision, a vision that can only be Bruce's murder. 
          As he squeezes Bruce's arm tighter and tighter...

                        Let me go! 



          Johnny comes out of the vision to find himself squeezing
          the nurse's arm.  He releases her and steps back, still
          reeling from the vision.  Then, as she and other hospital
          workers and patients watch, he rushes out.

                        We'd be wasting time.
                                (glancing again at
                                the clock)
                        If this is gonna happen, it's
                        gonna happen soon.

                                        BRUCE
                        How do you know that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        In my last vision at the hospital,
                        it was 9 o'clock, so we're talking
                          sometime in the next two hours.

                                        WALT
                        Only it can't happen, can it,
                        long as Bruce stays here.

          Johnny nods uncertainly, still rattled by his last vision
          of Bruce dead at the hospital.  Roscoe approaches.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Walt.  Got a big pile-up on I-95. 
                          Tractor-trailer jackknifed and
                        about five cars plowed into it.

                                        WALT
                        Send Rafferty and Mitchell.

                                        ROSCOE
                        They're already out at the
                          Fairgrounds doing crowd control. 
                        State police are asking for you.

          Walt sighs and grabs his jacket, turns to Johnny and Bruce.

                                        WALT
                        Look, I gotta go deal with this,
                        so just sit tight.  Both of you. 
                        I'll be back as soon as I can.

          He exits.  Bruce turns to Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        So what now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You heard the man.  We wait.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT THREE - 4/10/04 - PINK       40.

          But as he glances nervously at the wall clock...



          A BIG BIKER in handcuffs struggles as he's muscled to a
          desk by a couple of deputies.  PULL BACK to reveal Johnny
          and Bruce watching as they sit on a bench, on the periphery
          of the busy action of the station.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, at least we picked a good
                        spot for people watching.

          He catches Johnny glancing up at the clock again.

                                        BRUCE
                        You might try it yourself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  Guess I'm a little antsy.

            Suddenly, the biker rears up, having pulled a KNIFE from
          one of his boots.  The deputies grab him amidst ad-libbed
          shouts of "knife!"  "Hold him down!"  Etc.

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn!

          Johnny instinctively grabs Bruce's elbow, prompting --



          In the b.g., the knife is wrestled away and Roscoe berates
          the other officers.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Who frisked him?  Who frisked
                        him?

                                        BRUCE
                        Well that was exciting.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT THREE - 4/10/04 - PINK       41.


    46BCONTINUED:46B

          Then he notes Johnny's expression, sees his hand letting
          go of his elbow.

                                        BRUCE
                        You just saw something, didn't
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah... someone being assaulted.

                                        BRUCE
                        Me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think so.  But I saw the
                        same knife.

          It only takes Bruce a moment to see the significance of
          this.  In his mind at least.

                                        BRUCE
                        The same knife but a different
                        victim?  John, your visions just
                        made my point.  We hide out in
                        here, we're just letting someone
                        else get hurt or even killed in
                        my place.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We don't know that.  All my visions
                        have shown me --

                                        BRUCE
                        All they've shown you is that one
                        way or another, we can't avoid
                        Fate, and sitting here isn't
                          helping.  I mean does this feel
                        right to you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't matter how it feels.

                                        BRUCE
                        No?  Since when?  You're not acting
                        like yourself, man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe I'm acting like a guy who
                        just saw his best friend lying
                        dead under a sheet soaked with
                        his own blood.

                                        BRUCE
                        Nice.  Thanks for sharing that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I don't want to scare you
                        any more than I already have, but
                        if that's what it takes to keep
                        you safe, I will.

                                        BRUCE
                        Keep me safe.  Sure that's the
                        only reason we're here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you talking about?

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm remembering something you
                        told me back at your house, how
                        the Johnny Smith you saw killing
                        that other man couldn't be you.

          Johnny doesn't answer, but it's clear he's hit a nerve.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're thinking if we leave here,
                        you could end up killing someone
                        in revenge, and that scares you
                        almost as much as the thought of
                        me dying.  But I'm telling you
                        now, whatever you think your
                        visions are showing you, that man
                        isn't you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then maybe you don't know me as
                        well as you think.

          A beat, then Johnny begins to confess something that's
          been preying on him all day.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Remember that magazine from the
                        future, the one Wey showed me?

                                        BRUCE
                        The one with you on the cover...
                        and the headline, "Will This Man
                        Destroy the World?"

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods)
                        It made me wonder how all of this --
                          Armageddon... this mission I seem
                        to be on -- might change me.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe I'll be fighting so hard to
                        save the world that at some point
                        I'll cross a line and become as
                          dangerous as Greg Stillson, maybe
                        even more dangerous.

                                        BRUCE
                        John, you're never gonna become
                        Greg Stillson.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't think so either.  Or at
                        least as long as that fear was
                        tied to some distant future, I
                        could push it to the back of my
                        mind.  But now I've seen how I
                        could cross that line in one night. 
                        Tonight maybe.  And that changes
                          everything.

                                        BRUCE
                        So don't cross that line.  Promise
                          yourself, promise me, that you
                        won't, no matter what happens.
                                (beat)
                        And maybe the best way to make
                        sure of that is to face the future --
                        our future -- head on.

          On Johnny as the truth of this sinks in.  Then:

                                        JOHNNY
                        If none of this had happened, any
                        idea where would you'd be right now?

                                        BRUCE
                                  (considers, then)
                          Probably would've gone for a run,
                        like I do most nights.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You always run the same route?

          Johnny tosses Bruce his jacket.

          FADE IN:


          Bruce gives directions while Johnny keeps an eye out for
          anything familiar from his visions.  Both men are jumpy.

                                        BRUCE
                        Make a right by that bookstore.

                        big runner.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, well it's not just for the
                          exercise, it's a great way to get
                        to know your neighborhood... long
                        as you don't get stabbed to death.

          Johnny stops the car.

                        This park goes along the river

                        Looks like we just missed it.

          But he makes no move to exit.  Bruce eyes him.

                                        BRUCE
                        We're doing the right thing, man. 
                        You gotta believe that.

          Johnny nods, tries to push aside his fears for both of
          them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then let's do it.

          And as he opens his door...

          An alarmed Walt on the phone.

                                        WALT
                        John?  Where are you?  I was about
                        to put out an APB on your car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm in a park by the river, at
                        the end of Sixth.
                                (anticipating his
                                next question)
                        We're both okay, but there's
                        someone else who needs an
                        ambulance.

                                        WALT
                        It's on it's way and so am I. 
                        Don't do a thing 'till I get there.

          Johnny hangs up, thinking he's got things under control,
          only to react as he sees --

  7171HIS POV - THE PUNKS

          Starting toward the Salesman, Punk 1 taking out his knife. 
          Apparently the skin color of their prey doesn't matter as
          much to this pack of hyenas as Johnny thought.


          JOHNNY

          realizes he has no choice but to intervene to protect a
          man who in different circumstances would've killed Bruce. 
          He rushes toward --

          THE SALESMAN

          As Johnny arrives ahead of the approaching Punks, who
          react as though he's trying to cut in line.  He holds up
          his phone --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey!  I've already the called the
                        police.  Everything's under
                          control.

                                        PUNK 1
                        What's your problem?  We were
                        just going to help the guy.

                                        PUNK 2
                        Yeah, what'd you think, we were
                        gonna rob him?

          Johnny can't help but eye the closed knife Punk 1 still
          has in his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Please, just back off and give
                        him some room.

          The Punks exchange looks, then Punk 1 flips out the blade.

                                        PUNK 1
                        How about you back off, gimp?

          He holds out the blade, expecting Johnny to run, then
          cries out in surprise and pain when Johnny instead whacks
          it out of his hand with his cane.

                        Kick his bitch ass!

          Now the other two punks attack Johnny as meanwhile --


          THE SALESMAN

          gets to his knees, only to be inadvertently knocked down
          again by Johnny just as he was by Bruce in the vision. 
          Once again he's panicked and enraged, thinking now that
          it's Johnny who mugged him.  Once again, he sees the knife
          on the ground, grabs it, and turns, slashing Johnny in
          the arm.  Johnny cries out and wheels, grappling with the
          man as meanwhile he's hit by --



          The fight from the first vision:  the two shadowy figures
          smash into walls and furniture, then tumble to the ground.


  7373RESUME - JOHNNY AND THE SALESMAN GRAPPLE ON THE GROUND

          Johnny's managed to knock the knife loose but his attempt
          to defend himself is just making the panicked Salesman
          flail more wildly.  Johnny tries to get through to him --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stop it!  I'm trying to help you!

          But the man is beyond reason, and we sense that Johnny
          too is being pushed toward an emotional edge, both by
          this increasingly desperate fight and his memories of the
          one it parallels.  Forced onto his back, he sees --


          THE PUNKS LOOMING OVER THEM

          like bloodthirsty spectators at a dog fight, egging the
          Salesman on as he pins Johnny by the throat with one hand,
          then pulls back his fist...

                                        PUNK 1
                        Go for it, man!

                                        PUNK 2
                        Bash his head in!



          A FIST smashes Johnny in the face.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT FOUR - 4/10/04 - PINK        56.


    74CONTINUED:74

          Johnny's shadowy assailant, now revealed to be the
            Salesman, has him pinned in the same way and is pummeling
          him.  Johnny reaches for something to defend himself with,
          his fingers about to close on the lamp when we cut back
          to --


  7575THE PRESENT

          Where Johnny's outstretched fingers now grasp the PIPE
          the mugger used to club the Salesman.  He swings it up,
          just as --



          Johnny smashes the Salesman with the lamp, briefly gaining
          the upper hand, and then pauses, only now --


  7777THE SALESMAN'S HANDS GRAB HIM AROUND THE THROAT

          In self-defense, Johnny begins choking the Salesman as
          well.  It's as though the future that Johnny's foreseen
          is somehow catching up with him in the present; he may've
          changed the time and place, but he can't escape this
          appointment with destiny, as we continue to INTERCUT:



          Johnny and the Salesman choking each other, Johnny becoming
          more violent, slamming the Salesman's head on the floor --


  7979AS IN THE PRESENT

          Johnny slamming the Salesman's head on the pavement as he
          gives in to that same empowering rage, starts to cross
          that awful line as the Punks, changing sides without
          missing a beat, now egg him on --

                                        PUNKS
                        Kill him!  Kill him!  Kill him!

          CAMERA pushes in on Johnny, until all we see of the
          Salesman are his fingers ineffectually clawing at Johnny's
          face, then falling away.

          PUSHING IN CLOSER, until Johnny's eyes fill the screen
          and we can HEAR his rage, like an amplified ROAR, against
          which --

          A LONE VOICE struggles to make itself heard:


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT FOUR - 4/10/04 - PINK        57.

                        gotta remember...

          As Johnny's eyes blink --


  8080MEMORY FLASH: (B&W)

          Johnny hovers over Vision-Johnny, who's cradling the dying
          Bruce, and this time -- whether by coincidence or some
          strange design -- it indeed seems as though Bruce is
          talking to him. 

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                          ...remember your promise, John. 
                        No matter what happens remember...
                        who you are.


  8181RESUME TIGHT ON JOHNNY

          As something changes in Johnny's eyes.  The ROARING sound
          abates somewhat and now he sees --

          THE SALESMAN, eyes bulging from fear and lack of oxygen,
          his hands weakly trying to break Johnny's death grip --

          JOHNNY'S EXPRESSION registers awareness of what he's doing --
          what he's doing to another human being, and to himself. 
          The roaring fades, he releases his grip and sits back,
          pale and spent, while the Salesman remains sprawled on
          his back, gasping.

          A POLICE SIREN scatters the Punks as the CAMERA moves up
          and away, framing the two men in the arena-like circle of
          concrete lit by the street lamps, then finding the larger
          ring of surrounding trees, then the curve of the dark
          river, until finally we...

                                                                              FADE OUT.
