A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
surround it.
CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.
The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
WORLD OF LIQUOR.
TITLE CARD:
BIG SPRING, TEXAS
109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER
A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.
It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
off duty for the day.
The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth
They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
flames.
SETH
What did I tell you? What did I tell
you? Buy the road map and leave.
RICHARD
What am I supposed to do, Seth?
He recognized us.
SETH
He didn't recognize shit.
Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.
RICHARD
Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
looked at us -- you especially --
I knew he knew.
They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
hear Seth mumbling under the motor.
SETH
Low profile. Do you know what the
words "low profile" mean?
CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.
The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
the street, and speeds off down the road.
We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
behind it, as the store burns out of control.
OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.
Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.
CUT TO:
The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.
Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.
The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:
AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.
The rest of the titles play over black as the song
continues.

Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
and drives them to their room.
RICHARD
Do they have cable?
SETH
No.
RICHARD
Do they have an X-rated channel?
SETH
No.
RICHARD
Do they have a waterbed?
SETH
They don't have anything except four
walls and a roof, and that's all we
need.
Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
trunk close to the door.
The two brothers get out of the car.
SETH
(tossing Richie the motel keys)
Open the door. We gotta do this fast.
Richie opens the door.
Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
empty.
CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.
TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.
SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
up in the trunk.
She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
scared and looks an absolute mess.
SETH
Don't say a word.
The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
see any, slams the door.
Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans
the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside.
A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the
middle of a conversation with the party on the other end.
SETH
Things are real hot here. Crossing's
gonna be a bitch.
(pause)
Don't worry, we'll get across. But
when we do, where do we go?
(pause)
Can we make it as close to the border
as possible? Texas wants our balls.
The quicker we're in your protection,
the better I'll feel.
(pause)
Okay, where?
(pause)
The Titty Twister?
(he laughs)
I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll
see you and your men at the "Titty
Twister" tomorrow morning.
(pause)
Bye, my friend.
Seth hangs up the phone, lights up a cigarette with his
Zippo lighter and exits frame. After Seth exits, leaving
the frame empty, a subtitle appears:

KELLY HOUGE
Heading the case to bring these
fugitives to justice is FBI agent
Stanley Chase. We talked with agent
Chase earlier this afternoon.
CUT TO:
VIDEO INTERVIEW
Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.
STANLEY CHASE
For the time being we are very
confident we will apprehend the
fugitives in the next forty-eight
hours. The Bureau, local law
enforcement and the Texas Rangers
have all joined forces in forming a
dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
Gecko.
KELLY HOUGE
Agent Chase, does it appear that they
are heading for Mexico.
STANLEY CHASE
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
alerted the Mexican authorities. They
intend to cooperate every way possible
in bringing these fugitives to
justice.
KELLY HOUGE
Are you optimistic about the safety of
the hostage they took in Abilene,
Gloria Hill?
STANLEY CHASE
We've received no news one way or the
other. We can only hope for the best.
KELLY HOUGE
What about the report from an
eyewitness at the liquor store who
said one of the brothers was shot?
STANLEY CHASE
This can't be confirmed at this time,
but we do believe it to be true. We
have reason to believe it was the
youngest brother Richard, and he was
shot in the vicinity of his neck and
shoulders by the store's clerk.
KELLY HOUGE
Is it safe to assume that because the
death count involved and the loss of
life of law enforcement officers, that
the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
force are taking this manhunt
personally?
STANLEY CHASE
I would say that's a very safe
assumption.
CUT TO:
RICHARD SMILES.
RICHARD
(Newscaster's voice)
Is it safe to assume since the law
enforcement authorities in the great
state of Texas are homosexuals of a
sick and deviate nature, that they
will be too busy fucking each other
up the ass to actually catch The
Gecko Brothers?
(in an FBI voice)
I would say that's a very safe
assumption.
He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.
CASPER
Would you play with me?
A big burly COP turns around.
COP
Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!
The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.
Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.
RICHARD
Shit, I started to get worried. Where
the fuck ya been?
SETH
Sight seein'.
RICHARD
What'd ya see?
SETH
Cops.
RICHARD
Didya look at the border?
Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
the TV
SETH
Yeah, I saw the border. Through
binoculars from on top of a high
building. That's about as close as I
risked getting. What's the TV say?
RICHARD
They're going to apprehend us in
forty-eight hours.
Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.
SETH
(to himself)
I gotta figure a way to get across
that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
around El Paso our lives ain't worth
a shit.
RICHARD
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
in and wait for things to cool down.
SETH
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
worse before it gets any fuckin'
better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
find us, and when they find us,
they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
very personal when ya kill their law
enforcement officers. The El Paso
police have already started a motel
and hotel search for us.
RICHARD
How do you know?
SETH
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
rendezvous on the other side, then
Carlos and his boys will escort us to
El Ray and --
Seth stops talking and looks around.
SETH
Where's the woman?
RICHARD
What?
Seth's out of his chair.
SETH
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
is she, Richard!?
RICHARD
She's in the other room.
SETH
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
He goes to the door of the adjoining room.
RICHARD
Seth, before you open the door, let
me explain what happened.
Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
Then he BURSTS open the door.
The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
obvious Richard raped her and killed her.
Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
room with the dead body.
SETH
(to himself)
Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?
Richard rises from the bed.
RICHARD
Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
just explain what happened.
Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.
Richard backs up.
SETH
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
explanation. What's the matter with
you?
RICHARD
(low and calm)
There's nothing wrong with me,
brother. That woman tried to escape
and I did what I had to do.
SETH
No.
(pause)
That woman wouldn't of said shit if
she had a mouthful.
RICHARD
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
became a whole different person.
SETH
(slowly approaching)
Is it me? Is it my fault?
RICHARD
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
holding tightly to his wrist.
SETH
Is this my fault? Do you think this
is what I am?
RICHARD
What?
SETH
This is not me! I am a professional
fucking thief. I steal money. You try
to stop me, god help you. But I don't
kill people I don't have to, and I
don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
how it's done. Do you understand?
RICHARD
Seth, if you were me --
SETH
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
yes.
RICHARD
Yes.
SETH
Yes, Seth, I understand.
RICHARD
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.
SETH
(whispers in Richie's ear)
We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
and rice and beans. None of this
shit's gonna matter.
Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
thinking about how he's going to get over the border
tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
Fuller's motor home.
Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
THUD... THUD...
KATE
Owww, my head.
Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
window.
JACOB
Watch where you're going!
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
up at the giant motor home.
JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL
Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.
SCOTT
What's this guy's problem?
JACOB
I have no idea.
Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
move. Not threatening, just looking at them.
HONK!
JACOB
Anytime, man.
The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
side to let them pass.
Pass they do!
KATE
Creepy guy.
SETH
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
room #9.
The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
the Lone Star night.
Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
Fuller's mobile home.
The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
Mexico.
The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
outside reading things like:
"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
TWISTER DANCERS."
In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.
CHET
Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
go. At the Titty Twister we're
slashing pussy in half! This is a
pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
vast selection of pussy! We got white
pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
it, you don't want it!
The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
lot and stops.
The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
Fuller family step out into the night.
They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.
JACOB
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
SETH
Shit, I been to bars make this place
look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
RICHARD
I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
been to some fucked up places in my
time, but that place is fucked up.
Seth can't believe it.
SETH
(in a baby talk voice)
Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
baby too afraid to go into the big
scary bar?
The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
personal.
RICHARD
That's what you think?
SETH
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
RICHARD
I'm lookin' scared?
SETH
That's what you look like.
RICHARD
You know what you look like?
SETH
No, Richie, what do I look like?
RICHARD
You're lookin' green.
That's not what Seth expected to hear.
SETH
How?
RICHARD
Where are you right now?
SETH
What do you mean?
RICHARD
Where are you?
SETH
I'm here with you.
RICHARD
No, you're not. You're sippin'
margaritas in El Ray. But we're
not in El Ray. We're here --
getting ready to go in there.
You're so pleased with yourself
about getting into Mexico, you
think the job's down. It ain't.
Get back on the clock. That's a
fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
there for a coupla hours, in all
likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
So get your shit together, brother.
SETH
My shit is together.
RICHARD
It don't look together.
SETH
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
just not used to seein' me happy,
'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
years since I been happy. But my shit
is forever together.
Richard believes Seth's response.
RICHARD
Okay, just checkin'.
They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
the microphone.
CHET
(yelling into the microphone)
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
price, you get another piece of pussy,
of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
If you can find cheaper pussy
anywhere, fuck it!
Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.
CHET
(in microphone, towards Kate)
What's this? A new flavor approaching.
Apple Pie Pussy.
SETH
Step aside, asshole.
Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.
CHET
Not so fast, Slick.
Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
the BONE SNAPS in two.
Chet lets out a SCREAM.
Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
NOSE.
Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.
Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.
After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.
Chet is OUT.
The whole altercation took two seconds.
Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
everyone.
SETH
Now, is my shit together, or is my
shit together?
Richard and Seth laugh with each other.
RICHARD
(slappin' Seth five)
Your shit is forever together!
They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,
The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
inside.
Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
Carlos's Mercedes.
CARLOS
(to Seth)
What the fuck was going on in there?
Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.
CARLOS
(in Spanish)
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
SETH
Why the fuck, outta all the god
forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
have us rendezvous at that place?
CARLOS
I don't know, one place's as good as
another.
SETH
Have you ever been there before?
CARLOS
No, but I passed by it a couple of
times. It's out in the middle of
nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
And it's open from dusk till dawn.
You said meet you in the morning.
SETH
Well, because you picked that place
out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
And this girl's family's dead.
Carlos stands up again.
CARLOS
I'm sorry to hear that. What were
they, psychos?
SETH
Did they look like psychos? They
were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
don't care how crazy they are.
Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
themselves again.
CARLOS
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
to you?
SETH
You can't, but fifteen percent instead
of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
good start.
CARLOS
Twenty-eight.
SETH
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
dead and he's not coming back, and
it's all your fault. Twenty.
They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.
SETH AND CARLOS
(in Spanish)
Twenty-five.
Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
to a red 1990 Porsche 911.
CARLOS
You like the car?
SETH
I said new, this is an '90.
CARLOS
It's hardly been used at all. I got it
from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
times in as many years. Swear to God.
That's like new.
SETH
So do I just follow you?
CARLOS
Yeah, follow us.
SETH
So let's do it.
CARLOS
(to Danny and Manny)
Vamanos!
Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.
Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.
Kate stands alone.
The whole desert seems between them.
So much to say ... but no words.
SETH
I'm sorry.
KATE
Me too.
Long pause.
SETH
See ya.
KATE
Later.
Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
says behind him:
KATE (O.S.)
Seth.
Seth turns around.
KATE
You want some company?
Seth smiles.
SETH
Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
I'm not a fuckin' bastard.
He blows her a kiss across the desert.
She blows one back.
Seth's in his car and GONE.
Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
begins her long walk home.
