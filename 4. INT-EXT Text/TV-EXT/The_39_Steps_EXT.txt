    The sound of heavy breathing, a man running. It s early 
      morning. SCUDDER, 40 s, outdoor coat is fleeing down the 
      street at speed. A lamplighter is putting out lights. A 
      horse drawn vehicle trundles down the street. A police 
      CONSTABLE stands on a corner. SCUDDER, aware of the 
      CONSTABLE, slows down. Moves on then SCUDDER looks behind 
      him, is he being followed? As he turns back he bumps into a 
      lone passerby. SCUDDER instantly alert. He pushes the man 
      violently to one side. The passerby says  Watch out. 
      SCUDDER doesn t apologise.He turns and runs across the 
      road. A car comes down the road as SCUDDER rounds a corner, 
      disappears from view.



      HANNAY is walking down a different street. His bow tie is 
      undone, he s slightly squiffy. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    Bored, I d taken to staying out 
                    at night, seeking entertainment.

    On the streets newspaper boards are going up. Reading them 
    as he walks past - TENSIONS RISE IN BALKANS.



      SCUDDER rounds the corner at speed. And runs towards a 
      large apartment block. He rushes up to the revolve of the 
      entrance. And goes through it.



    The CONSTABLE comes out on to the fire-escape. Looks 
      around, no sign of HANNAY. The CONSTABLE looks to the side 
    of the building and an alley which runs to the front of the 
      building. The CONSTABLE runs down the fire escape and 
      disappears into the alley.

      A moment. Then  - under the fire escape to find HANNAY 
      hanging by his hands from the metal rung of a step. It s 
      quite a feat. The strain on his face. The sound of 
      something being beaten. HANNAY turns his head and his face 
      changes briefly to horror. Then he composes it.

      Looking at him through an open window opposite him is a 
      maid with a beater in her hand. A rug lies over the 
      windowsill of the open window. The maid is obviously very 
      frightened. HANNAY smiles at her with devastating charm.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.12.


                                  HANNAY
                    I m so sorry, did I startle you? 

    The maid says nothing but travels down his face to look at 
    the blood stains on his shirt.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (charming)
                    I ve been in a bit of a dust-up, 
                    I m afraid.
                          (with as much emotion as 
                          he can muster)
                    An affair of the heart. Her 
                    brother is determined to separate 
                    us. 

    He looks to the maid. She still just stares at him. HANNAY 
    is beginning to sweat. His hands are slipping on the iron. 
    He looks down to the courtyard below. It s quite a fall.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (trying to win her over)
                    Still, who can blame him? I have 
                    nothing to offer but love. My 
                    rival comes with 10, 000 acres 
                    and a herd of prize pigs.

    The maid smiles.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (seeming totally 
                            sincere)
                    How comforting to see such an 
                    enchanting smile. Thank you.

    The maid smiles, blushing. HANNAY still hanging there.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    I don t suppose.. ? No...I 
                    couldn t possibly impose upon 
                    your good nature.

    The maid looks like she d love to be imposed upon.



    The maid comes out of the main entrance. She looks around. 
      Sees the CONSTABLE scanning the road talking to another 
      constable. The maid goes up to them. She begins talking to 
      them. She points in the opposite direction to the apartment 
      building. As she does HANNAY looks out of the entrance. He 
      sees the CONSTABLE looking in the opposite direction. 
      HANNAY comes out of the building at speed. And heads off.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.13.



      HANNAY walking down the street, his jacket pulled around 
      him. His head down. He looks across the street, 2 different 
      policemen in uniform are walking down the other side. He 
      turns away quickly, frightened.



      A brass-plate saying - THE COLONIAL CLUB. A doorman stands 
      outside. HANNAY walks head down to towards the club as -  

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    Suddenly I was facing the 
                    hangman s noose. I had no pals in 
                    town to testify on my behalf and 
                    I could think of only one person 
                    who might save me. Scudder s 
                    Captain Kell at the Secret 
                    Service Bureau.

      HANNAY checks he isn t being followed then acknowledging 
    the doorman, goes in.





      HANNAY is still staring puzzling at the Roman numerals in 
      Scudder s notebook in his hand. He rubs his eyes and looks 
    out through the window. The sign NEWCASTLE. HANNAY looks 
      over to the VICAR who is reading his Bible.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.18.


      HANNAY replaces the notebook in his inside pocket.  A 
      newspaper vendor stands on the platform. His news-board 
      reads - ARCHDUKE FERDINAND ASSASSINATED. BOSNIANS ARRESTED. 

      HANNAY s face as he remembers SCUDDER s warning. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    The assassination of a royal 
                    figure, just as Scudder had 
                    predicted. 

      HANNAY takes some money out of his pocket. He opens the 
      window. The news vendor sees this. Comes forward. HANNAY 
      gives him the money and the vendor hands him a paper.

      HANNAY closes the window then reads the headline - ARCHDUKE 
      FRANZ FERDINAND, HEIR TO AUSTRO-HUNGARIANTHRONE, MURDERED 
      YESTERDAY.

    He opens the newspaper. Then horror on his face as he reads  
    on the second page.Murder Portland Place London. Killer on 
    the run.AND next to it an artist s impression of HANNAY.

                                  VICAR (O.S.)
                    May I possibly take a quick look 
                    at the cricket scores?

      HANNAY quickly closes the paper and looks up. The VICAR is 
      smiling at him. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (sharp)
                    No.

                                  VICAR
                          (taken aback)
                    I beg your pardon?

                                  HANNAY
                          (having to recover fast, 
                          with great charm)
                    I thought I might read them 
                    aloud. I m quite a cricket fan 
                    myself.

    The VICAR smiles in gratitude. HANNAY opens the back of the 
      paper to the sports pages. List after list of all the 
      cricket tables. This is a long job. 



      HANNAY slips out of the compartment onto the platform and *
      heads out of the station.



      Evening. In the distance the sound of a train and the faint 
      puff of smoke in the valley. The map - the village 
        Kirknairnringed. HANNAY stands on open moorland.     The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.22A.


      He s holding the map. He looks over. In the distance is a 
      stone barn.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.23.



      HANNAY comes out of the barn without his hat and coat. He 
      runs along the side of a stone wall to give him cover. Then 
      breaks away and heads off in the opposite direction to the 
      police. Suddenly, behind him, he hears the dogs  barking 
      become fiercer. Cries from the police as they spot him. The 
      sound of whistles being blown.

      HANNAY looks behind him, still in the distance but heading 
    his way, the police. HANNAY sets off at a lick.



    The police pursuing HANNAY seen through the lens of a pair 
    of binoculars. ACKERMAN lowers them. He and ENGEL are 
      observing the chase from a ridge above the open moorland.



      HANNAY running. He can hear the barking of the dogs getting 
      louder. He looks behind him, the police are still on his 
      tail. He thinks, stops, then turns round and does a special 
      long 2 note whistle. Nothing happens. He whistles again. 
    And - the police dogs all sit down. The police men try to 
      rouse them. Nothing, the dogs remain seated. HANNAY takes 
    the opportunity to turn and run for his life. 

      HANNAY spots a small brow of a hill. HANNAY ducks down then 
      runs down the other side of the hill.

    On the moor the policemen have managed to get the dogs up 
    and moving.     The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.23A.


      HANNAY slides down the side of the vale. He hears the sound *
    of the dogs resuming barking. In the vale at the bottom is 
      a stream. HANNAY swiftly takes his shoes and socks off.*      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.24.


      Ducking down, he walks into the stream in his bare feet. 
      Although he winces from the rocks, HANNAY moves at speed 
      upstream. The sound of the dogs getting more and more 
      distant.



      HANNAY walking up the stream. He stops, listens, no dogs. 
    He scans the vale top. No sign of police. HANNAY gets out 
    of the stream. 

    He sits down on the bank of the stream to recover.

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    I couldn t spend the rest of my 
                    days being hunted for a murder I 
                    didn t commit. I needed evidence. 
                    What was it Scudder had 
                    discovered that cost him his 
                    life?

      HANNAY pulls out the notebook from his jacket pocket and 
      opens it. A page of Roman numerals. HANNAY staring at it.

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    I had to find the key word to the 
                    cipher. I d tried Scudder on the 
                    train. Marie Lloyd, even Titanic. 

      HANNAY thinking hard. Then suddenly - HANNAY writing in the 
      notebook.

      CLOSE UP of the words FRANZ FERDINAND. Underneath each 
      letter of FRANZ, HANNAY writes  - AEIOU.

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    I had it. The Fof Franz 
                      represented A, the R, E and so 
                    on.

      Then under the AEIOU- written as he speaks the Roman 
      numerals, VI, XV111, 1,X1V, XXV1as -

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    Fwas A, the sixth letter of the 
                    alphabet, so A was represented by 
                    the roman number for six V1, R
                    was E so represented by the Roman 
                    numeral XV111.If the word 
                    Ferdinand gave me my key 
                      consonants, then I had the 
                    cipher.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.25.


    CUT TO HANNAY as he looks at the notebook. He takes the 
      pencil he d stolen from the hotel out of his pocket. He 
      starts to de-cipher the code.

                                                                      TIME JUMP



      HANNAY finishes writing, he puts the pencil back into his 
      pocket. He is a very worried man. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    According to Scudder s notes, 
                    Archduke Franz Ferdinand s 
                      assassination was about to 
                    trigger a war of a magnitude 
                    never seen before. 

      HANNAY replaces the notebook in his inside jacket pocket. 
    He starts to put his shoes and socks back on -  

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    As soon as hostilities were 
                    declared the Germans planned to 
                    destroy the vastly superior 
                    British navy. Every ship and 
                    submarine would be sunk. Leaving 
                    the Germans free to invade this 
                    country.



      HANNAY s worried face as he climbs up the bank of the vale. 
    The faint sound of a monoplane. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    I was on the run, I didn t know 
                    who I could trust. How was I 
                    supposed to save Great Britain 
                    from invasion? All I wanted was 
                    to be back on the veldt in 
                    Africa.

      HANNAY comes out on to the open moorland. The sound of the 
      plane getting closer and closer. HANNAY turns back to see a 
      monoplane heading towards him.

      From the POVof the plane, HANNAY exposed on the open 
      moorland. No other human life.

      HANNAY seeing the plane get closer and closer. It is 
      heading low towards him. Horrified he realisesit s chasing 
      him. He starts to run. The plane chasing him, swooping low. 
      HANNAY s panicked face.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.26.


      Then all around he is being strafed by machine gun fire. 
      HANNAY weaving as he runs forward trying to avoid being 
      hit. 

      Ahead he sees a wall. Beyond it a road. HANNAY jumps over 
    the wall and into the road. 

      HANNAY sees a car heading towards him. He stands in the 
      middle of the road and waves his hands desperately to get 
    the car to stop. Suddenly he sees through the windscreen 
    the faces of the passengers. It s ACKERMAN and ENGEL. He 
      looks to see the plane bank away in the sky.

      Back to see the car nearly upon him. ENGEL leaning out of 
    the window, holding a gun. HANNAY turns, runs towards the 
      bank on one side of the road. HANNAY trips, and he s 
      rolling, rolling down the bank. He tries to stop himself 
    but fails. 

      Then HANNAY rolls out on to the continuation of the road 
      that curves down the hillside and now runs parallel with 
      itself below.

      HANNAY lying on the road. The glimpse of another car 
      heading towards him in the opposite direction (to ENGEL and 
      ACKERMAN). The terrible screech of car brakes. HANNAY curls 
      into a ball to minimize damage waiting for impact. 

      Nothing. A moment then he uncurls. Looks up in fear. HANNAY 
      sees, looking down at him, 2 people. VICTORIA, 20 s, 
      beautiful, hair pins in her hair. HARRY, 20 s, her brother 
    in driving goggles. 

                                  HARRY
                    Good lord, Are you alright? I am 
                    so sorry.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What are you apologisingfor? He 
                    rolled out in front of you.
                          (to HANNAY)
                    Are you the Liberal spokesman?

      HANNAY looking at her warily.

                                  HANNAY
                    I beg your pardon?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Are you Tommy Twisdon?

      HANNAY hears a car coming from the direction ACKERMAN and 
      ENGEL would be approaching. He gets up quickly. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (quickly)
                    Yes. Yes, I am.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.27.


    He heads towards their car. VICTORIA and HARRY no choice 
    but to follow.



      HARRY is in the driver s seat, driving. VICTORIA in the 
      front passenger seat. HANNAY in the back. HARRY half 
      talking over his shoulder to HANNAY as he drives. (VICTORIA 
    has a ring on her right hand.)

                                  HARRY
                            (introducing them)
                    I m Harry Sinclair, this is my 
                    sister Victoria. Sisrang your 
                    hotel, they said you left an hour 
                    ago. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    What happened to your car? Did 
                    you break down?

                                  HANNAY
                    Yes.

                                  HARRY
                    Good job we came to find you. 

      Coming down at speed, the other way on the road, is 
      ACKERMAN and ENGEL S car. 

                                    HARRY(cont d)
                    That was some header you took.

    As the two cars pass, HANNAY ducks down pretending to do 
    his shoelace.  HARRY drives on. HANNAY looks back to see 
      ACKERMAN s car carrying on away down the road.

                                  VICTORIA
                    HHsaid you come highly 
                    recommended.

                                  VICTORIA
                    He better not have been. I love 
                    my brother Harry dearly, but 
                    he ll never win a seat in 
                    Parliament on his own.

      HANNAY s face. What is this? *



    An agitated middle aged man, Sir GEORGE SINCLAIR, paces up 
    and down on the front steps of the town hall, smoking a 
      cigarette. He sees the car with HANNAY, HARRY and VICTORIA 
      pull up. He stands on the cigarette and runs down the steps 
    to the car as they disembark.

                                  GEORGE
                      Where veyou been?

      VICTORIA kisses GEORGE on the cheek, then introduces him.

                    Tommy Twisdon.

      GEORGE takes HANNAY s hand. Shakes it. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Pleased to meet you, MrTwisdon.
                    You ve got a..twig..in your..

      VICTORIA removes a twig from HANNAY s hair.

                                  HANNAY
                    Perhaps if you could point me to 
                    a telephone. There s someone I 
                    have to contact in London.

      From inside the hall the sound of - WHY ARE WE WAITING? And 
      a slow hand clap.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.29.


                                  GEORGE
                    Sorry, no time for that. You 
                    better get in there fast before 
                    there s a mutiny.

      GEORGE and HARRY set off up the stairs. HANNAY hesitates. 
      VICTORIA turns and looks at him. He has no choice but to 
      join them.



      HANNAY is running down the corridor. He gets to a rear 
      door, opens it. Looks out. In the rear yard, two policemen 
      heading towards him.

      HANNAY ducks back into the corridor. He closes the door and 
      bolts it. He turns AND runs straight into VICTORIA -       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.33.


                                  VICTORIA
                          (furious)
                    How dare you talk to me like 
                    that, MrTwisdon?Women sacrifice 
                    themselves every day for this 
                    country.

      Hammering on the other side of the locked door - let us in. 
      Someone let us in.

                                  HANNAY
                          (to VICTORIA)
                    Believe me, this is really not 
                    the ....

      Suddenly POLICEMAN 1 appears in the corridor behind them. 
    He raises his truncheon menacingly.

                                  POLICEMAN 1
                    Stay where you are, sir. Stand 
                    aside please, Miss. 

                                  VICTORIA
                          (annoyed)
                    I am completely within my rights 
                    to talk to this man.

                                  POLICEMAN 1
                          (threatening)
                    I said, stand aside, miss.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (indignant)
                    I m a suffragette not a criminal.

    The POLICEMAN moves forward. He makes the mistake of taking 
      VICTORIA s arm. 

                                  POLICEMAN 1
                          (hard)
                    I m warning you...

                                  VICTORIA
                    Unhand me, you bully.

      VICTORIA kicks him viciously in the shins, POLICEMAN 1 
      screams. HANNAY takes this opportunity to run towards the 
      stage area. VICTORIA sees him go. VICTORIA yells at HANNAY -  

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    Wait for me.

    She turns and heads after him..       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.34.



      HANNAY looks out, left and right into a small alleyway. All 
      clear. He comes out. He starts to move off at speed. 
      VICTORIA comes out of the door, looks both ways. Sees 
      HANNAY, pursues him at speed. HANNAY looks back, sees her.

                                  HANNAY
                    Go back.

      A moment then police come out of the door.  Spot VICTORIA 
    and HANNAY, the police blow their whistles. Much - stopand 
      after them. The police give chase. HANNAY and VICTORIA 
      round the end of the alley. VICTORIA spots a side street. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Down here.

    She runs down a side street. HANNAY hesitates then follows. 
      They turn another corner. And they face a high stone wall. 
      Dead end. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (angry)
                    Damn. Now look what you ve done.*

                                  VICTORIA*
                    This isn t my...(fault).*

                                  HANNAY*
                          (cutting her off)*
                    So much for emancipation. Find 
                    yourself another hobby.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I didn t become a suffragette 
                    because I m bad at needle point. 

      VICTORIA is pulling up her skirt.

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    All that twaddle about freedom. 
                    How can we be living in a free 
                    society when so many people are 
                    viewed as second class citizens?

                                  HANNAY

    She tucks her skirt (pelt effect) into her belt to create a 
      shorter skirt, revealing the edges of a pair of bloomers.  
      HANNAY can t help looking at VICTORIA s legs, but affects 
      annoyance. The sound of whistles getting closer. She takes 
      a running leap at the wall. Gets her hands on the top then 
      begins to heave herself over. HANNAY has no choice - he 
      takes a running leap. Gets his hand on the top. Heaves 
      himself over. And - 



      HANNAY looks out of the alley into the street. A moment 
      later VICTORIA pops her head out too. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Stop following me.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I have no choice, thanks to you 
                    I m a fugitive from the Law.

      Across the road VICTORIA spots ACKERMAN and ENGEL s car.   

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    Why don t we steal that car? 
                    Leave it in the next town.

      HANNAY looks up the road. ACKERMAN and ENGEL stand at the 
    end looking in the wrong direction. They are watching as 
    the police stop and interview passers by. (Their car is 
      parked pointing down the street away from them.)

                                  HANNAY
                          (referring to the car)
                    Because it belongs to those two 
                    men up there.

      VICTORIA follows his gaze.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.37.


                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    They re German spies who are 
                    chasing me with the view to 
                    ending my life.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (looking at him)
                    Not only a murderer, but a 
                    delusional maniac. Just my luck.

    She heads off across the road to the car. HANNAY has no 
      choice but to follow. He checks. ACKERMAN and ENGEL are 
      still looking in the wrong direction. 

      VICTORIA peers into the open car. She sees the cranking 
      handle and removes it. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (hissing)
                    Give me that.

      With huge annoyance HANNAY takes it from her. He goes to 
    the front of the car. He puts the handle in the cranking 
      hole.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What if the owners hear?

      HANNAY looks around. Heading towards them are a small boy 
    and a smaller girl, she has plaits. He stops them.

                                  HANNAY
                    Do you fancy earning a shilling?

    The boy and girl look at each other, then at him - they 
      nod.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Good.
                          (to the boy)
                    When I nod, pull her hair.

      HANNAY crouches down below the bonnet holding the cranking 
      handle. VICTORIA crouches down too out of the view of 
      ACKERMAN and ENGEL. HANNAY looks at the boy and nods. The 
    boy pulls the little girl s hair hard. She yells, and as 
    she does HANNAY turns the cranking handle. Nothing. The 
      engine doesn t fire.

    At the end of the road, ACKERMAN and ENGEL look back. All 
      they see is the two children and their car. VICTORIA and 
      HANNAY are hidden away. 

      Back with HANNAY - he holds the cranking handle, nods at 
    the boy again. The boy pulls the girl s hair. The girl 
      yells as HANNAY turns the handle. The engine still doesn t 
      fire.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.38.


      ACKERMAN and ENGEL look back. Nothing but two children and 
      their car. 

      HANNAY looks at the boy, nods. This time the little girl 
      yells before the boy pulls her hair. HANNAY cranks the car 
    and it FIRES. HANNAY looks at the little girl. She winks at 
      him. Then he pulls the handle out quickly. HANNAY hands the 
    boy the shilling.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Thanks.

      ACKERMAN and ENGEL turn and look towards the car. They see 
      HANNAY and VICTORIA. They start to run to the car. HANNAY  
    and VICTORIA rush to get into the car - both to the 
      driver s door.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I ll drive.

                                  HANNAY
                    No, you will not...

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m perfectly...

                                  HANNAY
                          (ordering him)
                    Just get in.

    She gets in. Climbs over into the passenger seat. HANNAY 
      looks up. ACKERMAN and ENGEL are getting closer. HANNAY 
      leaps into the car. Puts it in gear, off with the 
      handbrake.And away they go. 

    The two children watching silently as ACKERMAN and ENGEL 
    run past them chasing the car. But the car is speeding off. 
      ACKERMAN and ENGEL stop and watch with frustration as they 
    see it turn left and out of view. 



      HANNAY driving. VICTORIA in the passenger seat. They are 
      coming out of the town heading towards open road. 

                                  VICTORIA
                          (sardonic)
                    Do you have children, MrHannay?

                                  HANNAY
                    I m not married.

                    Where exactly would you like me 
                    to drop you?

      They look at each other. Then the sound of a car behind 
      them coming at speed. They both turn to look behind.

      ACKERMAN, ENGEL and 2 German accomplices are in another car 
    are behind them down the road. ACKERMAN is driving.

                                  VICTORIA

                                  HANNAY
                          (hard)
                    I don t want you touching my 
                    slippers.

    He looks behind. The car behind is definitely gaining.

                                  VICTORIA
                    You re a prehistoric boor.

                                  HANNAY
                    And you, my dear, are an unhinged 
                    hysteric. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    That s it. I ve had enough. Stop 
                    the car.

                                  HANNAY
                    No.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Let me out.

    As - she grabs the steering wheel. The car veers 
      dangerously.

                                  HANNAY
                    What are you doing, you lunatic?

      They wrestle with the steering wheel. The car weaves back 
    and forth across the road. It s heading off the road into 
    the rough. HANNAY has no choice but to slam on the brakes. 
    The car comes to a halt at the side of the road and stalls. 

      VICTORIA is thrown across HANNAY. She pushes him off her 
      indignantly.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Get your hands off me.

      HANNAY grabs the cranking handle by the driver s seat.

                                  HANNAY
                          (furious)
                        I never.....D youwant to get us

                                  HANNAY
                    The word I m looking for hasn t 
                    been invented.

      They both push open their doors and get out. VICTORIA 
      leaning forward adjusting her clothes. HANNAY rushes to the 
      front of the car. The sound of guns being cocked. They look 
    up to see ACKERMAN, ENGEL and 2 accomplices looking down at 
      them. ENGEL and the accomplices have revolvers pointed at 
      HANNAY and VICTORIA. HANNAY and VICTORIA s faces - 
      horrified. HANNAY drops the cranking handle.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (to ACKERMAN)
                    I don t understand, I thought 
                    you d come to my rescue.
                          (referring to HANNAY)
                    This criminal kidnapped me.

      VICTORIA s face. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m not a....

                                  HANNAY
                          (quickly to ACKERMAN)
                    If you and I could discuss this 
                    like gentlemen.

                                  ACKERMAN
                    You assume two things, MrHannay. 
                    One I m a gentleman, two there is 
                    anything to discuss. Give me the 
                    notebook.

                                  HANNAY
                    This is a terrible mistake. The 
                    man in my apartment....

      ACKERMAN to ENGEL.

                                  ACKERMAN
                          (possible German)*
                    Shoot the woman.

      ENGEL raises the gun to VICTORIA s head. Cocks it. 
      VICTORIA s face - petrified.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.42.


                                  HANNAY
                    No, wait, it s in my inside 
                    jacket pocket.

      ACKERMAN to his accomplices.

                          (possible German)*
                    Search him.

    One holds him as the other opens the inside of HANNAY s 
      jacket. HANNAY s face as the man slips his hand into the 
      breast pocket where the notebook was.

      HANNAY s face confused as he feels the man rummage around 
      then pull out his hand - EMPTY.

    The man looks to ACKERMAN, shakes his head. ACKERMAN hits 
      HANNAY across the face. VICTORIA cries out in shock as 
      HANNAY staggers back.

                                    ACKERMAN(cont d)
                          (to HANNAY)
                    Where is the notebook?

                                  HANNAY
                    It was there, I promise. 

                                  ACKERMAN
                          (possible German *
                            indicating VICTORIA)
                    Search her.

      VICTORIA s scared face as she looks to the gun pointing at 
      her. She raises her hands. The man pats VICTORIA down. Then 
    he looks at ACKERMAN, shakes his head.

                                    ACKERMAN(cont d)
                          (to his men)

                      surrounding ground. Then tidy up. 
                    There must be no sign of the 
                    crash remaining.

    The men bundle VICTORIA and HANNAY into the back of the 
      car, ENGEL with a gun sits with them. ACKERMAN gets into 
    the driving seat. As they drive off, HANNAY looks back at 
    to see the other 2 men at the car looking for the notebook. 
      HANNAY s puzzled, scared face. Where is it?    The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.42A.



    The car drives past a sign saying KIRKNAIRN- 2 miles. 
      Under it on the sign in the same direction, LONG KEEP - 4 
      miles. HANNAY s face as he sees it.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.43.



    The car pulls off the road into a drive, HANNAY sees a sign 
      - LONG KEEP.



    The car with HANNAY, VICTORIA, ACKERMAN and ENGEL pulls up 
      outside an imposing but small castle - Long Keep. HANNAY 
    and VICTORIA get out. HANNAY looks around. This is a remote 
      spot. No sign of human dwellings anywhere. (Maybe see the 
      plane parked in a field.)

      HANNAY and VICTORIA are pushed towards the door by ENGEL 
      with the gun, ACKERMAN follows. As they reach the door, it 
    is opened from inside by a BUTLER.

                                  BUTLER
                    If you would follow me.



      VICTORIA and HANNAY emerge from the end of a tunnel into 
      countryside a little away from the castle. From behind it s *
      obvious HANNAY s shirt is burnt and his back badly 
      scorched. They both blink in the light. HANNAY s looks 
      around. The sound of dogs barking. People shouting. 
      VICTORIA sees a path over the moorland. She starts to head 
    in that direction.

                                  HANNAY
                    No.

    He pulls her in another direction. In the distance a 
      stream, the glimpse of a waterfall.

      Behind them the castle with smoke rising from the cellar 
      area. Men running around. The sound of the dogs and 
      shouting.



      HANNAY and VICTORIA running. HANNAY pulls VICTORIA towards 
    the stream and the waterfall. He hides his jacket behind a 
      rock. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Get under the water.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What?

                                  HANNAY
                    Trust me. It ll reduce the effect 
                    of the burns.Hopefully they 
                    won t spot us here.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.54.


      VICTORIA aware HANNAY is holding her hand. She removes it 
      from his. They walk together into the stream towards the 
      waterfall. VICTORIA is freezing. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    I survived the explosion now I m 
                    going to die of exposure.

                                  HANNAY
                    Maybe if I held you.

      VICTORIA looks at him. HANNAY holds her look.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Purely for medicinal purposes.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Perhaps it would be more 
                    advantageous if we held each 
                    other.

      A moment then they tentatively hold each other. The sound 
    of the plane overhead.

                                  HANNAY
                    Getdown. 

      Theyduck down. The sound of the plane flying above then 
      getting fainter and fainter.

                                                                      TIME JUMP



    The sound of shivering. VICTORIA is shivering in HANNAY s 
      arms, her arms round him by the waterfall. HANNAY looks 
      over in the direction of Long Keep. All seems quiet.

                                  HANNAY
                    We should get out nowbefore we 
                    perish.

      They start to wade out of the streamcautiously. Both 
      supporting each other. They get to shore. Their clothes 
      dripping wet. Both are very cold. HANNAY grabs his jacket 
      from behind the rock. Puts it round her shoulders. VICTORIA 
      hesitates then -

                                  VICTORIA
                    Thank you.

                                  HANNAY
                    You should go back to your 
                    brother s. Any problem with the 
                    police, I m sure your Uncle can 
                    fix it.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.55.


    She starts wringing the bottom of her skirt out.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What do I say? I was blown up in 
                    a castle owned by an acquaintance 
                    of his who happens to be a German 
                    spy but I can t prove it. No, 
                    sorry. I don t bail out even if a 
                    cause appears hopeless.

                                  HANNAY
                    It wasn t exactly on mylist of *
                    things to do next. Caught bang in *

                    the country. A country, which it 
                    has to be said, does not feel 
                    like home.

                          (shocked)
                    That s it, you re simply going to 
                    turn your back....

                                  HANNAY
                          (confused)
                    What? No.

                                  VICTORIA
                    But you said..

                                  HANNAY
                          (firm)
                    If I may finish...?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Sorry.

      HANNAY looks into her face.

                                  HANNAY
                    Perhaps you don t realisethe 
                    true value of something until 
                    you re about to lose it. 

      They look at each other. Then HANNAY remembers what he had 
      intended to say.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    I ll do whatever it takes to stop

                    well be other situations ahead 
                    that require the use of a

                                  VICTORIA
                    ... We carry on together.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.56.


                                  HANNAY
                          (smiling)
                    It seems the most sensible plan.

      VICTORIA looks at him and smiles.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Not that I actually have a plan. 
                    Without Scudder s notebook, I 
                    can t prove anything.

                                  VICTORIA
                    We should go back to where the 
                    car was. See if we can find it.

                                  HANNAY
                    The Germans already searched 
                    there. Besides we d never find 
                    that stretch of road again.

                                  VICTORIA
                    It was north of Kirknairn, 
                      approximately half a mile after 
                    the left hand turning with the 
                    gravel heap on the side of the 
                    road and the beech tree on the 
                    right. 

      A moment as HANNAY looks at her, then he stares up at the 
    sky and the Sun then points - 

                                  HANNAY
                    North s that way.

      They move off using bushes where possible for cover.



      HANNAY and VICTORIA stand looking at the grass where the 
    car stopped. There appears to be no sign of it.  

                                  VICTORIA
                          (not as sure now)
                    Is this it?

      HANNAY squats and examines the ground like a trained 
      tracker. He looks at some broken twigs, then spots a faint 
      tyretrack on the grass. He looks to VICTORIA.

                                  HANNAY
                    Yes. Well remembered.

      VICTORIA looks around as though dredging something from her 
      memory. Then she takes two steps, stops. Crouches down AND 
      puts her hand down a rabbit hole. HANNAY watches perplexed.    The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.56A.


                                  VICTORIA

                                  HANNAY
                    What for? A rabbit?

      VICTORIA pulls out SCUDDER s notebook from the rabbit hole.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Scudder s notebook.

                                  HANNAY
                    What?

    He takes it, examines it. It is indeed the notebook.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I picked your pocket after we 
                    stopped.

                                  HANNAY
                          (appalled)
                    You picked my pocket?

                                  VICTORIA
                          (pleased with herself)
                    And hid the notebook so the Bosch
                    wouldn t find it.

      HANNAY  - new very BIG thought.

                                  HANNAY
                    Whoa, hang on, that means you 
                    believed my story about the 
                    spies. Risked our lives..

                                  VICTORIA
                    Trivial detail. Saved our lives.

                                  HANNAY
                    All right but that s not the 
                    point...

    He looks to VICTORIA. She doesn t look too good. She s 
      shivers then sways.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Sorry, I don t feel too clever.

      HANNAY goes over to her and supports her. He places the 
      notebook in the outside pocket of the dry jacket which is 
      round her shoulders. 

                                  HANNAY
                    We need to rest.

                                  VICTORIA
                    There s an inn a little way from 
                    here. Left, over a style.

                    Past the cattle trough. Beyond a 
                    sign post to Dungarven.

                                  HANNAY
                          (warm)
                    Why don t we postpone the 
                    argument until we get there?



    The lights of a small inn up ahead. 

      HANNAY and VICTORIA arms around each other, walking towards 
    it. HANNAY looks up and sees a sign post. One way indicates 
      DUNGARVEN.The other KIRKNAIRN- 1 mile, LONG KEEP - 3 
      miles. The day s adventures have obviously taken a big toll 
    on their physical well being. HANNAY stops. He takes 
      VICTORIA s right hand and removes the ring from it.

                                  HANNAY
                          (to VICTORIA)
                    Hold out your left hand.

                                  VICTORIA
                    If you think.....

                                  HANNAY
                          (exhausted)
                    I ve been chased, shot at,not *
                    eaten for two days, hardly slept, *
                    tumbled into the path of a moving 
                    motor vehicle, blown upand*
                    submerged in icy water. Even 
                    Casanova could not be thinking 
                    anything other than a bed to 
                    sleep in and something to eat.

      VICTORIA looks at him. Holds out her left hand. He slips 
    the ring onto her wedding finger. VICTORIA hands HANNAY his 
      jacket back. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    The burn marks on your back might 
                    provoke some comment.


    NO SCENE 858585*      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.59.



      Standing outside staring up at the window is the VICAR 
      dressed as he was at the meeting, the signet ring on his 
      right little finger. He sees the light extinguish behind 
    the curtains as the candle is blown out.



      Early morning. ACKERMAN and ENGEL s car pulls up outside 
    the inn. (ENGEL has burns on his face, one hand is 
      bandaged) They both get out. 2 cyclists are propping their 
      bicycles up against the inn wall. ACKERMAN and ENGEL go 
      into the pub, followed by the cyclists. 



      With ACKERMAN and ENGEL as they burst into the room. It s 
      empty. Pyjamas on the floor. The window is open. ACKERMAN 
      runs to it and looks out. HANNAY and VICTORIA are peddling 
    for their lives down the road on the bicycles.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.65.



      HANNAY and VICTORIA on the bicycles - VICTORIA leading the 
      way. They draw up outside the back door of a detached stone 
      house away from the road. They are out of breath from 
      cycling fast. HANNAY checks behind him they weren t 
      followed.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Don t tell Harry about Scudder s 
                    notebook. He s never been good at 
                    keeping secrets.



      Sunlight through the curtains. HANNAY in bed tossing and 
      turning. The sound of a door closing. HANNAY wakes, gets 
    out of bed and goes to the window. 

      Pushing back the curtain he sees VICTORIA getting into a 
    car driven by the VICAR. HANNAY looks puzzled. He s trying 
    to recall the face.

      Flashback

    The VICAR sitting in the train compartment wearing large 
      black hat and round thick pebble glasses. On his right hand 
      little finger is a signet ring. 

      HANNAY s horrified face. He thinks. Then goes to the bed. 
      Puts his hand under the pillow, nothing. He flings off the 
      pillows and searches. No notebook. HANNAY horrified face.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.74.

      Establish Stirling Castle. The sound of a screech of 
      brakes.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.76.


      HARRY pulls up at the bottom of the road up to the castle. 
      HANNAY is getting out at speed. 

                                  HARRY
                    D youwant me to ...?

                                  HANNAY
                    No, thanks. 
                          (feeling guilty)
                    You re a good man, Harry.. 

    And HANNAY is running up the hill. HARRY s puzzled face.



      HANNAY approaches the gateway into Stirling Castle at 
      speed. There is a barrier manned by armed soldiers. HANNAY 
      speaks to a SOLDIER and a SERGEANT.

                                  HANNAY
                    I need to speak to Sir George 
                    Sinclair.

                                  SOLDIER
                    Sorry sir, move along.

                                  HANNAY
                    You don t understand, it s a 
                    matter of national security.

    The SOLDIER points his gun at him. The SERGEANT stands 
      looking at him.

                                  SOLDIER
                    If you do not move sir. I ll be 
                    obliged to detain you.

                                  HANNAY
                    But...

      Suddenly the SERGEANT cocks his gun. Points it at HANNAY.

                                  SERGEANT
                    Hands above your head. Now.

                                  HANNAY
                    What?

                                  SERGEANT
                    Don t you whatme, laddie. You re 
                    that murderer, Hannay. 

    The SERGEANT signals to the SOLDIER.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.77.

    Two SOLDIERS dragging HANNAY off to the castle.



      GEORGE is in a car. He s driving out of the castle gates. 
    He has a word with the soldier at the barrier then the 
      soldier raises it and GEORGE drives out. 



      GEORGE in his car, racing through the countryside.



      VICTORIA driving at speed in a car, HANNAY in the passenger 
      seat. A moment.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Last night in the bedroom ... 
                    that had nothing to do with my 
                    job.

      They turn and look at each other.

                                  HANNAY
                    At least you re only a spy and 
                    not a suffragette.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Actually I m a spy and a 
                    suffragette.

                                  HANNAY
                          (smiling)
                    Oh lord.

    The car passes the sign - DUNGARVENin one direction and 
      KIRKNAIRNand LONG KEEP in the other. VICTORIA swerves and 
      cuts across open land.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.86.



      VICTORIA and HANNAY pull up outside the castle. 



      VICTORIA and HANNAY emergeout of a tunnel into daylight on *
    the steps. They see the PROFESSOR standing on the *
      shoreline. With him, ACKERMAN and ENGEL. In the water a *
      large rowing boat. By it the 2 accomplices. A jetty runs *
    out into the water. Facing the PROFESSOR at a distance is *
      GEORGE.*

                                  HANNAY
                          (looking down on them)*
                    What are they going to do? Row 
                    round the Hebrides to Germany?

      VICTORIA pulls out a revolver out of her other pocket. She 
    and HANNAY exchange a look.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.88.


                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    He s your uncle.

                                  VICTORIA
                    He s a traitor.

      They start running down the steps.



      GEORGE stands facing PROFESSOR at a distance. *

                                  GEORGE*
                          (accusingly to the *
                            PROFESSOR)*
                    You lied. You were going to kill *
                    Victoria.*

                                  PROFESSOR*
                    If Germany were to become great - *
                    sacrifices had to be made. We *
                    both knew that.*

                                  GEORGE*
                    Not my family.*

                                  PROFESSOR*
                    Get into the boat, please.*

      GEORGE hesitates. The sound of a gun cocking. ACKERMAN has *
      a gun pointed at him.*

                                  GEORGE*
                    I die and the naval plans go with *
                    me.*
    The PROFESSOR looks up and sees HANNAY and VICTORIAreach 
                                                                                              *

                                  PROFESSOR
                          (to GEORGE)
                    You have no choice now, George. *

      GEORGE turns and sees VICTORIA and HANNAY. The 2 *
      accomplices get into the boat. ACKERMAN and ENGEL start 
      firing toward VICTORIA and HANNAY. VICTORIA returns fire. 
      GEORGE and the PROFESSOR crouch down to escape the bullets.

      HANNAY and VICTORIA hunker down behind two mooring pillars *
      about three feet high and two feet wide. Dodging bullets as 
      they ricochet around them. VICTORIA points her gun towards 
      GEORGE.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (emotional)
                    If I have to shoot you, I will.    The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.88A.

                          (with love)
                    I would expect nothing less. 

      Then from the middle of the Loch a terrible sound. Waves 
      start to roll on to the shore. The large rowing boat begins 
    to move from side to side. And out of the water rises up - 
      a German U boat. 

                                  HANNAY
                    My god, it s one of theirs. 

                                  PROFESSOR
                          (to GEORGE)
                    Come on George, the U boat can t 
                    wait. 

      It s as if this has woken GEORGE up. He starts to run 
      towards water and the PROFESSOR.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.89.


    The men on the boat hold it steady as, ACKERMAN and ENGEL 
      fire towards HANNAY and VICTORIA. VICTORIA takes aim, down 
    her sights - GEORGE. She hesitates for a moment. HANNAY 
      sees this. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (to VICTORIA)
                    Don t shoot. I ll get him.

      HANNAY gets up and sprints at speed after GEORGE, dodging 
      bullets as he does. 

    The PROFESSOR starts wading out to the boat, GEORGE 
      following. Both ACKERMAN and ENGEL are firing towards 
      VICTORIA and HANNAY.

      ACKERMAN has VICTORIA in his sights. She fires first and 
      hits him. ACKERMAN falls back on the shoreline. 

    The PROFESSOR getting into the rowing boat. GEORGE is 
      heading towards it. Covered by ENGEL s firing. HANNAY 
      dodging in and out of the bullets, VICTORIA engaging ENGEL.

                                  PROFESSOR
                    You can make it, George. 

      Then - HANNAY with a sprint, throws himself onto GEORGE 
      knocking him on to the shallows. 

      HANNAY and GEORGE wrestling in the water. A fierce fight. 
    The rowing boat has moved out a little and is now holding 
    its position. VICTORIA is reloading her gun at speed.

      HANNAY and GEORGE struggle in the water, ENGEL has his gun 
      aimed at HANNAY. 

                                    PROFESSOR(cont d)
                          (to ENGEL)
                    Don t hit, Sir George.

      ENGEL peppering the water around HANNAY with bullets. 

      HANNAY punches GEORGE on the jaw. GEORGE falls back 
      unconscious, HANNAY drags him up. ENGEL aims at HANNAY and 
      VICTORIA fires. ENGEL falls back dead. HANNAY is dragging 
      GEORGE out of the water. VICTORIA helps him haul GEORGE up 
    on to the beach.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    Why?

                                  GEORGE
                    The glory days of the British 
                    Empire are over. The Deutsches*

                          (to the men in the boat)
                    Row. Row. 

    The 2 accomplices in the rowing boat start rowing towards 
    the U boat. HANNAY takes the gun from the dead ENGEL and he 
    and VICTORIA start firing at the rowing boat as they run to 
    the jetty. The 2 accomplices are hit. Suddenly the sound of 
    the U-boat engine. Tides of water. HANNAY and VICTORIA look 
      over to see the U-boat diving. 

                                    PROFESSOR(cont d)

    The U boat disappears from sight. The PROFESSOR turns to 
    see VICTORIA and HANNAY standing on the jetty. Their guns 
      pointing at him. A moment then the PROFESSOR raises his 
      hands.



      HANNAY sits on the jetty. VICTORIA sits next to him. The 
      guns by their sides. (In background GEORGE and the 
      PROFESSOR being taken at up the steps by KELL and the 
      VICAR.) VICTORIA tears at HANNAY s shirt sleeve. The bullet 
      graze on his arm.

                                  HANNAY
                    It s nothing.

      A moment then - 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Thank you. I m not sure I could 
                    have shot him.

      They look at each other. Then they move in and kiss. They 
      break away  - HANNAY looks at her.

                                  HANNAY
                    When we return to London I intend 
                    to woo you. Flowers, dinner, 
                    dancing, followed by a passionate 
                    lecture on the enfranchisement of 
                    women. What do you say?

      A moment then VICTORIA smiles - 

      Suddenly the sound of a shot. VICTORIA is knocked sideways 
      into the water. On the shore, ACKERMAN is raised on one 
      arm, his gun in his hand. HANNAY grabs ENGEL s gun by his 
      side, fires and ACKERMAN falls back.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.91.


      HANNAY sees VICTORIA disappearing into the Loch, a trail of 
      blood dis-colouringthe water, HANNAY dives in after her.



      HANNAY sits on his ownon the jetty, a blanket on his 
      shoulders looking out over the Loch. KELL and the VICAR 
      come and sit down either side of him.

                                  VICAR
                    It s a deep loch, she could be 
                    anywhere. 

                                  KELL
                    I m sorry, Hannay.
