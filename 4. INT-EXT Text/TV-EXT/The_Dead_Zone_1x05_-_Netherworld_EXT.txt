            Extraordinary beauty shots.  A perfect New England day. 
          Peaceful and calm in the crisp morning air.  The beep-
          beep sound continues.



          Walt's patrol car moving down the road.



          As Johnny gets out of the patrol car...

                        Will you be coming by the art
                          festival in the morning?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (preoccupied)
                        If I'm still here.

                                        WALT
                        Going out of town for the weekend?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, no, I'll probably see you
                        there.

          Walt acknowledges and waves good-bye, pulls away.


          NEW ANGLE 

          Johnny turns and looks to take in the setting... after a
          beat --

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        I have no idea what I'm doing
                        here.  Or where I'm going.

          He stops a pair of elderly passer-bys...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me, do you know me? 
                          Commissioner Johnny Smith.  Would
                        you happen to know where my offices
                        are?

          On their puzzled reaction...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        It's just a little survey; we're
                        trying to raise public awareness
                        of county government performance...



          As Ken and Johnny walk out of the County Commission office

                                        KEN
                        I think we've got them thinking
                        in the right direction, at least...

          But Johnny's mind is far away... and Ken notices... Johnny
          looks weary...

                                        KEN
                        You all right, John?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just can't seem to... wake up
                        today.

                                        KEN
                        When was the last time you had a
                        real vacation?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I took a long nap recently.

                                        KEN
                        You should get away with the
                        family.

          Johnny nods, mind elsewhere.

                                        KEN
                        I'm serious.  Connie and I found
                        a great tennis resort... they
                        have a whole program for the
                        kids...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (interrupting)
                        Listen, you mind if we put off
                        lunch for today?  I just think
                        I'll go home.

                                        KEN
                        Sure, sure, no problem.
                                (beat, seriously)
                        John, there isn't much time left. 
                        Pretty soon, this'll all be over.

          And there's a dichotomy to that line that Johnny picks up
          on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... what do you mean?

                        You know what I mean.

          Johnny lets out a deep breath, not understanding how this
          Ken person could know but obviously he does but before he
          can ask him to explain, Ken continues --

                                        KEN
                        The kids grow up before you realize
                        it.  And off they go into their
                        own lives.  We have to spend time
                        with them now... while we still
                        can.

          Johnny reacts.  It was just part of Ken's encouragement
          to take a vacation... or was it?

                                        KEN
                        I'll see you later.  Feel better.

          Ken walks away.  Johnny thinks about what he said.  Near-
          by, we hear the beep-beep sound of a truck backing up on
          the street somewhere...


          ANGLE - A BICYCLIST

          rides by... Johnny glances at him, reacts as he sees the
          rider's face is scarred with horrible burns...

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          Again, still, peaceful and beautiful.  A stark relief to
          what we've just had to endure.
