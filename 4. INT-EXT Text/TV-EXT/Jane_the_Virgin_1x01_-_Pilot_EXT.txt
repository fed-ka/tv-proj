      A hotel in the style of the  Fountainebleau.   Fabulous,  
      expensive, exclusive. And we climb up, up, up to...


      Where we find a man, his back to us, looking out at the 
      Atlantic.  Same tableaux as Rubio.  Meet RAFAEL SOLANO, 31.  
      At first glance he looks like a handsome, rich playboy type.   
      Which he definitely was...

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Raf?  Babe.  Are you all right?

      He turns to find his wife, MONICA -- the most gorgeous girl 
      you ve never seen.  She seems incredibly devoted to Rafael.                                                                              6


                                  RAFAEL
                    Yeah.  Fine.  Just thinking...

                                  MONICA
                          (knowingly)
                    Worrying about the hotel...

      No.  But he s not up for a longer conversation.  He turns to 
      her, nods.  She tries to console him... 

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    If anything goes wrong, your father 
                    will help out -- 

      She means this to be encouraging.  It s not.  She sees that.

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    Oh stop.  You know who feels bad 
                    about taking money?  People who 
                    have too much.

      He smiles a little.  She moves closer:

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    That s better.  See?  You just need 
                    to relax...

      Before he can reply, she starts to kneel down, dropping out 
      of frame.  Oh.  As Rafael begins to relax, we CUT TO:

      A ROUND MOUTH, putting on bright red lipstick.  

      WIDEN TO REVEAL:  Monica...


      Find Jane:  wearing a bathing suit, serving drinks from a 
      small canoe in one of those gigantic resort-like swimming 
      pools in the middle of a Spectacular and Decadent Party.  In 
      fact, that s the theme of the party.   Spectacular and 
      Decadent.   A shirtless hunky waiter/surfer dude -- DEREK 
      sits behind Jane, paddling.  She s miserable as she floats 
      around, trying not to spill.  After a near miss, to Derek:

                                  JANE
                    Really?  You think this is okay?  
                    That we have to do this?

                                  DEREK
                    No, yeah, I know.  
                          (then)
                    Do what?                                                                            9


      Poor Derek.  He s not the brightest.  Jane shakes her head as 
      we PULL OUT: for a WIDE, establishing the scope and breath of 
      this party...before ZOOMING elsewhere:

      Finding Rafael.  He s sitting on a settee -- round, tufted -- 
      with a high back cutting it in half so that TWO SEPARATE 
      GROUPS OF PEOPLE can sit on in.  Rafael is with his sister/ 
      best friend LUISA (32).  They re mid-conversation:

                                  LUISA
                    Raf. If you re not happy, end it--

                                  RAFAEL
                          (yeah, but...)
                    It s hard.  Monica stood by me --

                                  LUISA
                    I know.  But you don t owe her your 
                    whole life.   
                          (then, gently)
                    Look, you changed.  I mean, of 
                    course you did.  If you didn t 
                    change, I d be worried about you. 
                    And you know what?  It s a good 
                    thing because you were a douchebag 
                    before-
                          (as he protests)
                    As your sister, I can say that.  
                    You were a douchebag. But I loved 
                    you then and I love you now -- And 
                    if you get a divorce, it does not 
                    make you our father. I promise.

      He smiles a little.  Luisa leans in, hugs her brother --

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                    Alright, I gotta get home.

                                  RAFAEL
                    Say hi to Allison.

      Luisa nods, then she heads off. And now we come around on the 
      settee, to reveal: Rafael s wife, Monica.  And she s clearly 
      been eavesdropping on their conversation. Stung, she looks 
      up, towards the penthouse... And is that her mother s shadow, 
      in the window?  

      But the camera doesn t linger, we re now with Rafael, heading 
      towards the pool. He signals  a drink  and  Derek starts 
      paddling over as the D.J. starts playing some amazing summer 
      anthem... 

      We re now with Jane as Derek paddles towards Rafael.  As they 
      get closer she realizes... he looks familiar.  She knows him.  
      Jane turns towards Derek:                                                                            10


                                  JANE
                    Turn the canoe around --

      But Derek is in the zone, singing along with the music as he 
      paddles, no way she s breaking through.  Jane has to think 
      quickly, she doesn t want to see Rafael Solano -- in a 
      swimsuit, in a boat -- after all these years.  Desperate, 
      Jane dumps the drinks and throws her arm in, ruddering the 
      canoe.  It swings around, abruptly.  Nearly taking two people 
      out.  Derek stares at Jane, in shock.  She smiles, sheepish:

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Out of drinks.

      Jane sneaks a glance back at Rafael who is luckily getting 
      led away by Monica.  Oblivious to the chaos... 


      Jane enters cabana four -- it s bustling.  Champagne glasses 
      are set up. Jane goes over to the table, starts to pour.

                                  MAN S VOICE
                    I ll hand out glasses.

      She looks up, grateful.  It s Rafael.  Don t freak out! She 
      continues to pour.  But he is looking at her.  

                                  RAFAEL
                    You look so familiar...

                                  JANE
                            (overplaying a little)
                    Really?  Hm... I m not sure...

                                  RAFAEL
                    No, I really think we ve met --

                                  JANE
                          (joking a little)
                    I don t usually wear a bathing 
                    suit, if that helps--

                                  RAFAEL
                    Oh.
                          (then)
                    Scores?

                                  JANE
                    What?


                      RAFAELJANE
      Oh.  Jerk.

      But they are interrupted by tinkling on a glass.  It s 
      Monica.  She s holding up her champagne flute.

                                  MONICA
                    Please.  A toast.   To my husband.  
                    Welcome back, babe...

      As glasses are raised, Jane slips out...                                                                            12



      Jane wakes up.  Already?  She looks at her alarm.  7 a.m. She 
      closes her eyes briefly, BLACKNESS AGAIN... A beat.  And 
      then, subtly, the blackness starts moving.  WIDEN TO REVEAL:  
      A SONOGRAM IMAGE OF AN EMPTY UTERUS.  Continue to WIDEN:


      Jane is getting into a bus.  She sits down in a seat as the 
      doors close.  

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    But alas, it was too late.

      As the bus starts to move, we SLOWLY PULL BACK, revealing a 
      giant billboard on the bus's side featuring RUBIO. 

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    Jane s life was now the stuff of 
                      telenovelas.

      And off Jane, riding off, unaware...

                                      End of Act One                                                                            18


                                            Act Two


      Jane knocks on Michael s door. Wanting to talk to him, not 
      knowing exactly what to say --

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    One second, babe.

      A beat, then he opens the door, smiles, gives her a kiss.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Sorry, you re a little bit early --

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, I know, I just wanted to see 
                    you...                                                                            32



      Servers are setting up.  Luisa is standing with Rafael.  She 
      points out Jane.  Rafael recognizes her.  He reacts as--

                                  LUISA
                    Raf, I m so sorry--

      But he s walking away, leaving Luisa staring after him.   


      Eve approaches Jane and Lina --

                                  EVE
                    Jazzy Jane. The owner wants to talk 
                    to you.

      Jane and Lina look over and see Rafael sitting in a cabana.  

                                  LINA
                    Oh geez, you think he s still 
                    pissed that you called him a jerk?

      Off Jane, worried...


      Jane is smiling, a little modest.

                                  JANE
                    One-third white cheddar, one third 
                    yellow cheddar, one third grated 
                    American.

                                  RAFAEL
                    And we talked...

      She nods, as...

      FLASHBACK TO:  THE KEY BISCAYNE RESTAURANT

      The grilled cheese is now finished.  They are still talking.

                                  YOUNG JANE
                    Well, it depends if I m being 
                      practical, or brave --

                                  YOUNG RAFAEL
                    Practical then --

                                  YOUNG JANE
                    In ten years?  I m a teacher.

                                  YOUNG RAFAEL
                    Brave?

                                  YOUNG JANE
                          (beat, then)
                    A writer.
                          (then, realizing)
                    I ve never said that outloud 
                    before.                                                                            46


                                  RAFAEL
                    I bet you re a great writer.

      Jane smiles.  A beat, then he leans in...and kisses her.   
      Jane kisses him back.  A wonderful, magical beat and then 
      KNOCK KNOCK!

      They separate and look over at the window where...a PRETTY 
      TEENAGER is looking into the restaurant.  And she s irate.

                                  YOUNG RAFAEL
                    Shoot, that s my girlfriend--
                          (as he gets up)
                    I gotta go, thanks again for the 
                    grilled cheese--

      And Jane watches as he hurries out --

      And we re back in the PRESENT:  THE CABANA

      Rafael feels badly.

                                  RAFAEL
                    Yeah, I was sort of a jerk back 
                    then.
                          (tries for light)
                    Still am, according to you --

      But Jane isn t smiling.  She looks at him, needs to say it--

                                  JANE
                    Look, I don t want to be pregnant.  
                    And right now it s just cells, 
                    cells that could fit on top of a 
                    pinhead--  

      Rafael reacts, absorbing the meaning --

                                  RAFAEL
                    So...an abortion you re thinking?

                                  JANE
                    But if I terminate it, I ll become 
                    someone my grandmother wouldn t be 
                    proud of.  And that s pretty much 
                    been my whole life s goal, so...

                                  RAFAEL
                    We d take it --

                                  JANE
                    And then what? Live the rest of my 
                    life knowing that my kid is out 
                    there, I don t know if I m strong 
                    enough for that.
                          (pained, emotional)
                                  (MORE)                                                                            47

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Look, I know the reasons for 
                    wanting to end the pregnancy are 
                    so... selfish.  That I m not ready.  
                    That this wasn t the plan.  That I 
                    have worked so hard - every second - 
                    so that my life would be different 
                    from my mother's-- 
                          (off Rafael, explaining)
                    I was an accident.  And I know my 
                    mom loves me, but I also know, in 
                    some ways, I derailed her life.  

      A simple statement.  But a painful one.  It lands on Rafael.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I don t want my kid to feel like 
                    that.  Ever.  I want to be ready.  

      He sees that she s in pain over this--  

                                  RAFAEL
                    Yeah.  That makes sense.

      Off Rafael, selfless, not a jerk at all...
