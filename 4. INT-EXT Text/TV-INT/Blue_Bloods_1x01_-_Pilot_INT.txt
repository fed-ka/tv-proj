      people pressing towards the bright doorways leading outside. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You okay in all this, Pop?

                                    PATRICK
                    I m not an invalid, I had a hip 
                      replacement. 

      As they move forward, many people nod and make way, some 
      snapping a little salute, saying,  Chief  to one or the other 
      of the two Reagan men, Patrick drawing an older crowd.  
      Patrick raises his chin to one such man --

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    How you doing, Billy?  Sorry to 
                    hear about Louise.

      They push through the doors to --


      As Brian gets in and settles...

                                  BRIAN
                    Little girl, I don t like the sound 
                    of it.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Glass half empty much?  She could 
                    turn up at a friend s house.

                                  BRIAN
                    Then why d they call us?

      Demarcus pulls out into traffic and they take off.


      On the wall a bank of security monitors surveil the city: 
      Times Square, West Side Highway....  Tie loosened, Michael s 
      at his desk dialing his phone as an Aide comes in to retrieve 
      files from the out-box at Michael s nod.

                                    MICHAEL
                          (on phone)
                    So what s going on?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Place is buzzing with cops and hookers, drunks, petty crooks, 
      but the main buzz is the cackle of the police radio and 
      phones ringing off the hook on the missing girl s tip line, 
      manned by a special task force headed up by Brian and 
      Demarcus, both of them now on their phones.                                                                                    14.


                                  BRIAN
                    I won t be watching the Knicks game 
                    tonight.

      INTERCUT 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Long as you know you ve got all the 
                    resources you need.  

                                  BRIAN
                       ppreciate it, Chief.  I ll keep 
                    you posted.

      Brian and Demarcus each hang up their phones.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    What s up?

                                  BRIAN
                    I think that was a motivational 
                    call from my old man. 
                          (of Demarcus s phone call)
                    That anything?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    A white van with a little girl in 
                    Astoria, but it was just an Asian 
                    family.  And I got more bad news.  
                    The little girl s sketchy uncle has 
                    an airtight alibi.  The dude s 
                    locked up on Rikers Island for 
                    petty larceny. 

      Brian goes to a pin-board where Teresa s picture is posted 
      along with two columns, one  suspects cleared,  and one 
         possibles.   He moves a  possible  to  cleared.   

                                  BRIAN
                    And I had such high hopes for him.

      A PROFESSOR comes in, tweeds, bookbag.  

                                  PROFESSOR
                    Excuse me!  My name is Professor 
                    Robert Jordan!  I know where the 
                    missing little girl is!
                          (all eyes on him now)
                    She s been transferred to Earth s 
                    sister planet in the Andromeda 
                    Galaxy as of 22 hundred hours 
                    according to my last communique!

      Laughter as a COP comes to usher him out.                                                                                    15.


                                  COP
                    We ll launch a rocket to check that 
                    out, sir.

      More laughter, but the mood quickly sinks.

                                  BRIAN
                    I keep thinking about that little 
                    girl.  How terrified she must be.   

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Looks like it could be a long 
                    night. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Better let the wife know I ll be 
                    bedding down here...

      On Brian as he picks up his phone ...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Oppressive HEAT and GLARE.  U.S. soldiers in desert fatigues 
      guard a gate, a long line of cars shimmering into the 
      distance as soldiers check under cars examine papers.

      Suddenly, a car down the line pulls out and speeds towards 
      the checkpoint.  A few soldiers signal the car to halt.  It 
      stops for a moment.  Then starts towards them again.

      Warning shots are fired into the air.  But the car continues 
      forward.  We see now that one of the soldiers is Brian, a 
      captain.  Caught now in a horrible moment of split-second 
      decision, Brian lifts his M-15 and fires repeatedly at the 
      car which now KAROOMS into a ditch.  Dust rises and starts to 
      settle as soldiers run up.

      Inside is a family, an IRAQI MOTHER and Father crying, both 
        miraculously alive.  But the mother cradles a bloody, 
      lifeless Boy, 4, clutching a teddy bear.

                                  IRAQI MOTHER
                    My boy was sick!  We were trying to 
                    get to the hospital!

      On Brian s anguish...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    16.



      Asleep on the couch, Brian s eyes slam open.  He sits up and 
      tries to shake his recurrent nightmare.  It takes a moment 
      for him to know where he is.  Then a thought dawns.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Brian hurries in.  Clock says three, a skeleton crew here 
      now.  And Demarcus, shirtsleeves rolled up, take-out detritus 
      on his (and Brian s) desk, finishing a phone call.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    We do appreciate the call, Ma am.
                          (hanging up, to Brian)
                    Another nothing.  You sleep?

                                  BRIAN
                    We need the doll.

      Brian heads for the evidence lockers.  Demarcus catches up.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Why?  The lab didn t get anything 
                    off it.  No prints, no DNA.

                                  BRIAN
                    Well, that s just it.  If it 
                    belonged to some other little girl, 
                    why not?  Why was it so clean?

                                  DEMARCUS
                          (seeing it)
                    Because the creep used it as bait 
                    to lure the girl in.

      Brian opens the evidence locker.

                                  BRIAN
                    Must be a label or stamp on here.  
                    We see who makes it and where they 
                    sell it, maybe this talking doll 
                    can tell us something.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Brian and Demarcus at Brian s desk with the doll, Brian on 
      the phone, on hold.                                                                                    17.


                                  BRIAN
                    Had to be made in China, right?  
                    They re looking for someone who 
                    speaks English.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    What is it, tomorrow there?  Or 
                      yesterday?

                          (into phone)
                    Yeah, Detective Reagan, New York 
                    Police.  Your Dolly Change Me doll, 
                    I need you to tell me where it s 
                    sold in the Eastern United States.
                          (then, stopped cold)
                    What?  Are you sure?
                          (then)
                    Ma am, I need to know the names and 
                    addresses of anyone who had access 
                    to one of these dolls.  No, I don t 
                    have time for you to call me back.  
                    Put me on hold, I ll wait.
                          (then, to Demarcus)
                    We just hit pay-dirt.  The doll s a 
                      prototype, it s not even for sale 
                    yet.  The haystack just got 
                    smaller.

      On Brian and Demarcus, with new hope...

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      Through East Village alphabet streets.  Demarcus at the 
      wheel, Brian on his cell as they pull up to a dingy tenement.

                                  BRIAN
                    Okay, thanks --
                          (closes cell)
                    -- for nothing.  They found the 
                    U.N. delegate that had one of the

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Looks like doll number two s a real

      Brian and Demarcus enter the dank little place, bed unmade, 
      dishes piled in the sink.  As their eyes adjust and Demarcus 
      moves off to search --

                                    SPENCER FRYE
                    What doll?

                                  DEMARCUS (CONT D)
                    The doll.

                                    SPENCER FRYE
                    You can t take that!  I m not done

                    Be my guest.

      Demarcus tosses Frye the doll.                                                                                    20.

      Frye examines the doll for damage as, shaking his head, Brian 
      heads out with Demarcus.

                    We re doing everything we can.

                                  MAYOR
                    That better be good enough.  I hear 
                    your boy is lead detective.

                                    MICHAEL
                    If you mean Detective First Grade 
                    Brian Reagan, that s right.

                                  MAYOR
                    Think that s wise, Mike?  Could be 
                    exposing yourself to all kinds of 
                    scrutiny if it goes south.  You re 
                    popular with the public but I don t 
                    have to tell you you don t have a 
                    lot of friends in high places to 
                    back you up.

                                    MICHAEL
                      Truthfully, I don t spend a lot of 
                    time worrying about that.

                                  MAYOR
                    Well, maybe you should. 
                          (goes to leave, stops)
                    And another thing, that bit just 
                    now on TV about since you ve been 
                    chief and the crime stats 
                      decreasing?  There s no future in 
                    that kind of grandstanding.  Just 
                    ask your old man.

      The Mayor goes.  Michael looks coldly after.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    23.



      The room is its daytime beehive of activity.  Demarcus works 
      his computer.  Brian hangs up the phone, discouraged.  

                                  BRIAN
                    There is no van in Ronald Banse s 
                    name, so if this is our guy he 
                    either stole it or bought it from a 
                    private party and didn t bother to 
                    register it.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Well, I just hit pay-dirt.  The 
                    house in Tampa is deeded in the 
                    wife s maiden name, Roberta Abele.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah and...?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    She s a model citizen with a New 
                    York drivers license and an address 
                    in Lindenhurst, Long Island.

      They grab their jackets and fly out of there.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SGT. ANTHONY RENZULLI, 40 s, drives, Jamie Reagan, shot-gun.  
      They ride in silence, Renzulli glancing at Jamie from time to 
      time, gauging him.  Then --    

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    Y know, I was also your brother 
                    Joe s training officer when he was 
                    a new boot.

                                  JAMIE
                    No, I didn t know that.  No 
                    kidding?

      Renzulli hangs a right.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    Good guy, your brother.

                                  JAMIE
                    Yeah, he was.

      Another silence.                                                                                    24.


                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    I hear you went to Harvard.

                                  JAMIE
                    Law school.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    That right?  So what are you doing 
                    on the beat?  Seeing how the real 
                    people live?  Writing a book?

                                  JAMIE
                    It s in the blood I suppose.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    You know, Harvard, that s something 
                    we re gonna have to find out.

      Jamie looks out the window at the passing street. 

                                  SGT RENZULLI (CONT D)
                    Terrible thing about your brother.  
                    He was a great cop.

                                  JAMIE
                    It s gonna be hard to live up to.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    You got that right.   cause, you 
                    know, just  cause your old man s 
                    the chief I m not going to cut you 
                    any slack.  You re going to have to 
                    earn it just like everybody else.  

      In fact, Jamie s realizing it will be harder because he s a 
      Reagan.

                                  SGT RENZULLI (CONT D)
                    Now, your brother Brian, on the 
                    other hand...

                                  JAMIE
                    Brian s Brian.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    Harvard, I get the last word, okay? 

      A beat, then the radio cackles to life with a call 
      indecipherable to all but them.

                                  SGT RENZULLI (CONT D)
                    That s us.                                                                                    25.


      Sgt. Renzulli floors it and they take a corner really hard.  
      On Jamie, bracing himself --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Brian heads to other rooms.  Demarcus stays with Mrs. Banse.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    He s a person of interest in a case 
                    we re investigating.    

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Ronnie?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    When s the last time you spoke to 
                    him, Ma am?  Do you have any idea 
                    where we could find him?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    I sent him a box of his winter 
                    clothes a couple weeks ago.

      Brian comes back.

                                  BRIAN
                    House is clear.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Can you tell us where you sent the 
                    clothes?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    The Lincoln Inn in Yonkers, but I 
                    don t know if he s still there. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Thank you very much.

      And Brian and Demarcus are gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    27.



      Moving fast, Brian and Demarcus pass a no-man s land of gas 
      stations and light industry.  

                                  BRIAN
                    So what have we got?  A couple 
                    hours?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    If that.  Teresa s type one 
                    diabetes.  Insulin shock.  My aunt 
                    died of it.

                                  BRIAN
                    Up there on the right.


      Brian and Demarcus come in to see a room in some disarray, 
      drawers open and clothes hurriedly tossed into suitcases on 
      the bed.  Brian stays with Banse as Demarcus searches.  

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    I d like to see your warrant.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    He s packing his bags.

                                  BRIAN
                    You going someplace?  Where s the 
                    girl?

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    What girl?

                                  BRIAN
                    You made a big mistake, buddy.  
                    When you snatched the girl you left 
                    one of your samples in the gutter. 
                    A doll.

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    A doll was stolen out of my van if 
                    that s what you mean.  I was giving 
                    it to my niece for her first 
                      communion.

                                  BRIAN
                    That why you had it painted and 
                    fixed the window?

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    I don t have to talk to you.  I 
                    know my rights.

                                  BRIAN
                    You don t know jack.  

      Brian grabs Banse, roughly spins him and cuffs him.

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    What are you doing?  Are you 
                    arresting me?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    You have the right to remain 
                    silent.  Anything you say may be 
                    held against you --                                                                                    30.


                                  RONALD BANSE
                    Fine, let s go downtown, my lawyer 
                    will get me out.
                          (then, with a smirk)
                    Then maybe I will go visit my 
                    little niece.

      That does it for Brian.  To Demarcus --

                                  BRIAN
                    D, get out of here and call it in.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    C mon, let s take him downtown. 

                                  BRIAN
                    We don t have time for that. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Buddy --

                                  BRIAN
                    Just get out of here, man!  Call it 
                    in! 

      Demarcus reluctantly goes.  Banse gets desperate.

                                  BANSE
                    Let me go!

                                  BRIAN
                    You re gonna tell me where that 
                    little girl is, scumbag!  

      Brian all but lifts him off the ground by his cuffed wrists 
      as he spirits him towards the bathroom. 

                                  BANSE
                    Ow!

                                  BRIAN
                    Oh, are they on too tight? 

      Banse struggles hard now as Brian throws him into the

      BATHROOM

      Banse scrambles to get a purchase with his leather soles on 
      the tiles as Brian s on him and grabs him.  

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Where is she?                                                                                      31.


                                  BANSE
                    Go to hell.

                                  BRIAN
                    Me?

      Brian grabs him by the hair and shoves his head in the toilet 
      and holds it down as he flushes it until Banse begins to 
      sputter and choke.  Brian yanks his head back.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    You had enough?  Where is she?

                                  BANSE
                          (gasping for air)
                    I don t know!

      Banse s screams are silenced as Brian again pushes his head 
      deep into the bowl.  This time he keeps Banse under water 
      until Banse starts to twitch, drowning.  It looks like he s 
      about to die when Brian pulls his head up.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Last chance.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Siren wailing, Demarcus driving like a maniac, Brian bracing 
      himself against turns.  Banse is in back, messed up, hair 
      dripping, thrown around like a rag doll in the speeding car.  

                                  BANSE
                    Oh my God, I am heartly sorry for 
                    having offended Thee --

                                  BRIAN
                    Shut up.
                          (to Demarcus)
                    This storage locker we re going to,   
                    the name he said he rented it

      JUDGE INEZ ORELLANA, Hispanic, 45, opens her door to Ron 
      Banse s Asian Public Defender, RICK LEE, 30, and Assistant 
      D.A. Erin Reagan-Boyle.

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    C mon in, take a seat.

      They sit, she faces them at her desk and opens a folder. 

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA (CONT D)
                    So, Mr. Lee, you have emergency 
                    motions to bring on this case?  
                    Let s hear them.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your honor, we have here a most 
                      outrageous instance of violation of 
                      a citizen s civil rights -- 

                                  ERIN
                          (interrupting)
                    A citizen who abducted, bound and 
                    gagged a nine-year-old child and 
                    stuffed her into a dark storage 
                    locker and was preparing to do God 
                    knows what to her, Your Honor.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your Honor --

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                          (staying him)
                    Mr. Lee.
                          (to Erin)
                    Let s hear Mr. Lee s motions, shall 
                    we? 
                          (then)
                    But try to keep the hyperboles 
                    down, Mr. Lee.  

                                  P.D. LEE
                    I have three motions, Your Honor.  
                    A Mapp Motion for evidence obtained 
                      illegally.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    34.

                                  P.D. LEE (CONT'D)
                    To wit, the officers broke into a 
                    locked van and seized material 
                    without a warrant.

                                  ERIN
                    There were exigent circumstances to 
                    the van entry, Your Honor.  The 
                    officers had every reason to 
                    believe that the little girl was 
                    inside.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    I m talking about the packages of 
                    clothing, Your Honor.

                                  ERIN
                    The officers state the packages 
                    spilled their contents during the 
                    forced entry and search, Your 
                    Honor.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your Honor, they were secured with 
                    ribbon, so that s impossible.

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    Go on.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    The second motion is a Huntley, 
                    that any statements my client may 
                    have made or any physical evidence 
                    were obtained by use of excessive 
                    force and are therefore 
                      inadmissable. 

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    That s a serious allegation.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    I have photographs, Your Honor, 
                    taken at the time of arrest 

      He hands the Judge a sheaf of photos.  She looks through.

                                  ERIN
                    The officer contends that the 
                    accused was resisting arrest, Your 
                    Honor.

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    That how his hair got wet?                                                                                    35.


                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your Honor, since all of the 
                    State s evidence is clearly 
                      inadmissible, our final motion is 
                    that the case be dismissed and Mr. 
                    Banse be immediately released from 
                    custody. 

                                  ERIN
                    No, Your Honor!  We have a Class A 
                    felon in custody!  We can t just 
                    cut him loose!     

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    With no admissible evidence, we 
                    have no basis to hold him.

                                  ERIN
                    The State pleads for more time, 
                    Your Honor.  

                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your Honor --

      The judge holds her hand up to still them, to weigh things.  

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA 
                    We don t want this individual on 
                    the street.  But at the same time, 
                    an officer took the law into his 
                    own hands, which we cannot abide. 
                    This seems to be one of those rare 
                    instances where I actually get to 
                    be a judge.  
                          (then)
                    Well... we are looking at the 
                    weekend.  I m going to schedule a 
                    hearing on this case for Monday 
                      afternoon.  If the State can t 
                    marshal some legitimate evidence to 
                    indict by then, I ll have no choice 
                    but to let the accused go.

                                  ERIN
                    Thank you, Your Honor. 

      The Judge shuts the folder.  Erin and P.D. Lee get up and go. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Brian paces, clicking a pen.  Erin comes out of the elevator.                                                                                    36.


                                  BRIAN
                    What happened?

                                  ERIN
                    What happened?  It s a disaster, 
                    that s what.

      She keeps walking.  He keeps up.

                                  BRIAN
                    Stop with the dramatics.

      She stops and faces him.

                                  ERIN
                    What did you think you were doing?

                                  BRIAN
                    What was I doing?  Saving a little 
                    girl s life.

                                  ERIN
                    So this scumbag can go prey on some 
                    other little girl?  He s probably 
                    going to walk  cause you pissed all 
                    over evidence.

                                  BRIAN
                    We ve got the van in custody.  
                    SID s all over it for DNA and 
                    fibers. 

                                  ERIN
                    You better hope they find 
                      something.  Or you find something. 
                    And you have til Monday.

                                  BRIAN
                    Monday?

                                  ERIN
                    Because that s when they re going 
                    to let him go.  Because you crossed 
                    the line.

                                  BRIAN
                    Get off my case.

                                  ERIN
                    Just make my case, how s that?

      She storms off.  

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    37.



      Brian sits at the table, dejected.  Looks up to see Michael 
      at the door, Demarcus with him.  Michael is dressed casually 
      in sports jacket and slacks.

                                  BRIAN
                    You heard already?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I came by to see how you were 
                    doing.  Demarcus just told me.  Not 
                    the best news.

      They come in.  Demarcus pours himself a coffee.

                                  BRIAN
                    SID said the van was vacuumed and 
                    scoured with bleach.  Not a fiber, 
                    not a hair.

                                    MICHAEL
                    The guy really knew how to cover 
                    his tracks.

                                  BRIAN
                    I really screwed up, didn t I?

      Michael sits.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Internal Affairs is going to have 
                    to get into it.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Just so you know, Demarcus had 
                    nothing to do with it.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Brian --

                                  BRIAN
                    I told him to go call it in. 

      Michael puts his hand up to silence his son.

                                    MICHAEL
                    This whole thing will go down a lot 
                    easier if you nail this guy.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Every lead on this case is a dead 
                    end.                                                                                    38.


                                    MICHAEL
                    So... maybe you can get him on 
                    something else.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    The N-Dex didn t have him for so 
                    much as a parking ticket.

                                  BRIAN
                    No, he means maybe it s not his 
                    first time with this type of crime.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    The guy had a ritual.

                                  BRIAN
                    The dress.  The candles.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    So we look for unsolved cases with 
                    the same M.O.

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s worth a shot.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    We can start with his last known in 
                    Tampa.  See if he rented any 
                    storage containers.

                                  BRIAN
                    Him or the monsignor.   cause you 
                    don t wake up one day at fifty and 
                    be a pervert.

                                    MICHAEL
                    That s a welcome relief.

      Michael gets to his feet.   

                                  BRIAN
                    Thanks for the hand.  I mean it.

                                    MICHAEL
                    When was the last time you had a 
                    decent night s sleep?  You look 
                    like hell.

                                  BRIAN
                    You look good though.  Nice jacket.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Going out to dinner.  Some of the 
                    guys.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    39.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                          (from the doorway)
                    Good luck you two.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Thank you, sir.

      Michael goes.  Brian downs his coffee.

                                  BRIAN
                    Let s do it.

      He and Demarcus head to the squad room.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A hip dinner spot across from Peter Luger s under the bridge, 
      full of the latest crop of young lovelies, including Sydney 
      and Jamie with law school friends WHITNEY and JARED.  Was 
      Jamie s crowd but maybe not anymore. 

                                  JARED
                    Whitney, tell  em where you ve 
                    been.  She s been in Manitoba 
                    working on a takeover of a Canadian 
                    shale oil outfit.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Yeah, but don t buy any stock yet, 
                    we re facing an incredible 
                      environmental furor.

                                  JARED
                    Which they re pretty confident they 
                    can grease their way out of.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Oh, that s green. 

      Everyone laughs.  Jamie manages a smile.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Jamie s the one with the exciting 
                    new gig, though, right? 

                                  JARED
                    Yeah, how was life on the mean 
                    streets today, Jaimer?

                                  SYDNEY
                    Believe me, it s not dinner 
                      conversation.                                                                                    40.


                                  JAMIE
                    My first call to a stinker. 

                                    WHITNEY
                    What s that?

                                  JARED
                    Probably what it sounds like,  
                    somebody dead, right?  For a long 
                    time?

                                  SYDNEY
                    Jamie. 

                                  JAMIE
                    They asked, Sydney. -- Almost two 
                    weeks.

                                  SYDNEY
                          (a recitation)
                    He died on the toilet, okay?  
                    Morbidly obese at six hundred and 
                    fifty pounds.  Rigor mortis had set 
                    in so the coroner had to break his 
                    legs to remove him from the 
                    bathroom.

      A pall settles.  Then --

                                  SYDNEY (CONT D)
                    I need a cigarette.  I know, I m 
                      quitting...

      She takes her purse and goes out.  Then Jamie gets up.

                                  JAMIE
                    Excuse me, guys.

      He goes.  Whitney and Jared raise their eyebrows at each 
      other, sip wine.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Demarcus and Brian on their computers.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Most of these kidnaps are 
                      custodial.

                                  BRIAN
                    Well, here s something.  Cold case 
                    in Tampa, little Catholic girl 
                    around Teresa s age went missing.  
                    Body never found.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    When Banse was living there?

                                  BRIAN
                    What a coincidence.  You keep 
                    looking for unsolveds and I ll call 
                    Tampa for the police records, news 
                    coverage, gotta be something there 
                    to link him to the crime...                                                                                    43.


      He picks up his phone.  It s going to be another long night.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A lived-in mix of nice, comfortable furniture from Patrick 
      and his wife s tenure (baby grand, antimacassar on an easy 
      chair, crucifix, Jack and Bobby on the wall) before they 
      moved to the Sun Belt and Michael and his family took over 
      and added their own touches -- kids  sports trophies going 
      back decades, flat screen TV.

      Home from eleven o clock mass, Nicky lounges, texting,  
      Michael and Patrick relax with the Sunday Times, Patrick with 
      the crossword puzzle. 

                                    PATRICK
                     Kind of shell.   T-A blank blank.   

                                    MICHAEL
                    You drive yourself nuts with those 
                    things, Dad.

                                  NICKY
                    Taco shell.  T-A-C-O.

                                    PATRICK
                    It fits.
                          (then)
                    What s a taco shell?

      With a stack of plates, Erin looks in from the dining room.

                                  ERIN
                    Nick, I could use a little help in 
                    here?

                                  NICKY
                    Two minutes.

      Nicky texts some more.  Patrick looks over his glasses at 
      her.  She feels it, goes and takes the plates from Erin.

                                  ERIN
                    Thank you.                                                                                    44.


      Nicky helps set the table as FRAN McCAREY, 62, Michael s old-
      maid sister-in-law, comes out of the kitchen with a basket of 
      bread, an apron over her Sunday best.

                                  FRAN
                    Where is everybody?!  And then they 
                    complain if the roast is 
                      overcooked!

      The front door opens and Brian s boys blast in, followed by 
      Linda with a casserole.  

                                  LINDA
                    Y know guys, Staten Island is not 
                    on the other side of the world.  It 
                    wouldn t kill you to come to mass 
                    at Holy Trinity one Sunday. 

      As Linda heads to the kitchen, Sean jumps on Michael.

                                  SEAN
                    Grandpa, how much money do you 
                    have?  Can I see it?

                                    MICHAEL
                    After we eat.

                                    PATRICK
                    Jack, show me your right hand.

      Patrick holds his hand up, the nine-year-old punches it.  
      Fran comes out of kitchen with bowl of mashed potatoes.  

                                  FRAN
                    Well, I don t care, at six twenty 
                    nine a pound for roast beef, we re 
                    sitting down.   

      The front door opens and Jamie comes in with a bouquet of 
      grocery flowers.  Michael perks up as always to see him.

                                  JAMIE
                    Hey all.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Thank goodness, Fran was on the 
                      precipice.   

                                  JAMIE
                    What would Sunday dinner be without  
                    Aunt Franny s tears?

      Jamie hands Fran the flowers, puts an arm around Patrick who 
      is heading to the table.                                                                                    45.


                                  JAMIE (CONT D)
                    Hi, Grandpa.

                                    PATRICK
                    Hey, boot. 

      They all gather into the

      DINING ROOM

                                  JAMIE
                    Where s Brian?

                                  LINDA
                    He said he d try and make it. 

                                  ERIN
                    So you all know, right?  I d like 
                    to strangle him.

                                    MICHAEL
                    No strangling on Sunday, okay, 
                    Sunshine?  

      All sit, Michael at the head of the table, which Patrick 
      ceded when he and his wife moved to the Sun Belt. 

                                    PATRICK
                    Brian did what he had to do.

                                  ERIN
                    Of course you d take his side. 

                                    PATRICK
                    I say what I think.

                                  ERIN
                    And look where it got you.

      Patrick s face shuts.  Fran bustles in with the roast.

                                  FRAN
                    He tried to sell me a tired old 
                    piece in the case but I set him 
                    right.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m sure you did, Franny, now sit.  
                    -- Jamie?

      Fran puts the roast before Michael for him to carve and sits 
      as all bow their heads for grace.                                                                                    46.


                                  JAMIE
                    Bless us Oh Lord for these gifts 
                    which we are about to receive from 
                    your bountiful hands through Christ 
                    Our Lord.  Amen.

      Under which, Brian has come in and now sits, crossing himself 
      as they all cross themselves and say Amen.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Real food.

                                  SEAN
                    I don t want any beans.

                                  LINDA
                    Yes you do.

      Everyone helps themselves as bowls of food are passed and 
      Michael carves the roast.  Patrick has been stewing.

                                    PATRICK
                    I ll tell you where it got me.  I 
                    got a clean conscience and I sleep 
                    at night.

                                  BRIAN
                    Where what got you?

                                  NICKY
                    Mom s mad at him because he took 
                    your side.

                                  ERIN
                    Nicky, please, just stay out of it.

                                  BRIAN
                    So she s been riding around on her 
                    high horse, huh?

                                  ERIN
                    Don t make this about me.  I m not 
                    the one that slapped somebody 
                    around and stuck their head in a 
                    toilet.

                                  BRIAN
                    What do you know about it?

                                  JACK
                    Dad stuck somebody s head in the 
                    toilet?                                                                                    47.


                                  LINDA
                    Ssh.  Eat.

                                  ERIN
                    I know you re supposed to enforce 
                    the law, not make it up as you go 
                    along.

                                  BRIAN
                    You got no idea what goes on.  You 
                    only know what you know.

                                    PATRICK
                    Back in the day you just showed  em 
                    your nightstick.

                                  ERIN
                    The laws are there for a reason!  

                                    PATRICK
                    Yeah, to protect the criminals! 

                                  ERIN
                    No, to protect society from a 
                    police state!

                                  BRIAN
                    Blah blah.

                                  ERIN
                    What a jerk.

                                  BRIAN
                    Screw you!

                                  ERIN
                    No, screw you.

      Michael raps on the table and everyone quiets.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hey, hey.  This is Sunday dinner, 
                    not a free-for-all.  Let s keep it 
                    civil. 

                                  ERIN
                    Dad, you resort to the use of force 
                    and torture, you corrupt the moral 
                    fiber of the culture.

                                  BRIAN
                    The who?  The what?

      Michael puts a hand up to stay Brian.                                                                                    48.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Nobody s in favor of torture.  The 
                    issue is the use of enhanced 
                      interrogation, is it ever 
                      justified?  

                                  ERIN
                    I say no.  And so does John McCain. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Okay then, you ve got a ticking 
                    bomb.  That guy over there planted 
                    it.  Lives are at stake.  Is that 
                    jerk s rights worth more than those 
                    innocent victims? 

                                    PATRICK
                    Of course not.  See? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    What do you think, Jamie?  You ve 
                    got a law degree. 

                                  JAMIE
                    And a gun now too.  And that s a 
                    lot of power.  You don t govern it, 
                    Erin s right, it s a slippery slope 
                    to where we find ourselves in a 
                    fascist state.

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah?  You wait, little brother, 
                    until you chase somebody into a 
                    dark alley and maybe that shiny 
                    thing is a cell phone and maybe 
                    it s not.

                                    PATRICK
                    Every cop s nightmare.

      Brian s Blackberry buzzes, he looks at his text and gets up. 

                                  JAMIE
                    It s true.  I can say whatever I 
                    want, but really I don t know what 
                    I would have done in his position.

                                  BRIAN
                          (pocketing his phone)
                    I gotta go.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Something up?                                                                                    49.


                                  BRIAN
                    We ll find out.

                                  LINDA
                    You want a sandwich?  You barely 
                    touched your food. 

                                  BRIAN
                    I ll be fine.  Just -- Erin,
                    Lemme just ask you a question.  
                    What would you have wanted me to do 
                    if it was Nicky and you only had 24 
                    hours to save her life?

                                  NICKY
                    Me?

                                  BRIAN
                    Be honest.  Somebody snatches her 
                    off the street and I got hold of 
                    them and they wouldn t talk?  Give 
                    me a break.     

      And Brian goes.

                                    PATRICK
                    Nicky?  You wouldn t have to worry.  
                    They d throw her back in ten 
                    minutes.  

                                  NICKY
                    That s not funny.

      Hurt, Nicky bolts, runs upstairs.  Erin gets up to go after.

                                  ERIN
                    Thanks, Grandpa. 

      Silence as Michael surveys the shambles of family dinner, 
      plates half-eaten, chairs pushed back, napkins thrown down.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    More meat anyone?  I ve got a nice 
                    end piece here.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sleeves rolled up, Michael makes a brandy sauce at the stove.  
      Jamie cuts pieces of a big flat yellow cake and plates them.  
      Michael pours brandy into both a saucepan and a glass.                                                                                    50.


                                    MICHAEL
                    One for the sauce, one for me after 
                    that fracas.  Jamie?

                                  JAMIE
                    Don t mind if I do.

      Jamie pours himself a nip.  Erin comes down the back stairs.

                                  ERIN
                    That kid.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I ll tell Dad he s got to put a 
                    governor on the motor.  Teenage 
                    girls are sensitive creatures, if I 
                    remember correctly.

                                  JAMIE
                    He can be a real button-pusher 
                      sometimes.

                                  ERIN
                    It s not him she s angry with, it s 
                    me.   I was so mean to Brian.   
                    Which translated means mean to her 
                    father.  She thinks I drove him 
                    away.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m not a big fan of divorce, but 
                    not even your mother would have 
                    blamed you for kicking him to the 
                    curb, Erin. 

                                  ERIN
                    I ve got twenty-five cases on my 
                    desk, a teenage daughter I m at war 
                    with and a brother who thinks I m a 
                    schmuck.  Doesn t he know I d shoot 
                    this guy myself?  

      Michael puts an arm around Erin.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Tough week, huh?

                                  ERIN
                    Sometimes I wish I could go 
                    upstairs to my old room and crawl 
                    under the covers like I d never 
                    left.  

      Jamie pours the rest of the brandy, hands Erin the glass.                                                                                     51.


                                  JAMIE
                    Here.  It s either you or Aunt 
                    Franny and she s already half in 
                    the bag.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Ssh.  Kids.

      Aunt Fran comes in with dirty dishes.   

                                  AUNT FRAN
                    Look at you, Michael, making 
                    dessert.  How lucky was my sister. 

      Erin rolls her eyes and takes a pot of coffee into the dining 
      room.  Fran follows with cups. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    So how s the beat, buddy?

                                  JAMIE
                    I had my first stinker.  Guy had 
                    been dead fourteen days.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You want to put a dab of VapoRub 
                    under your nose before you attend a 
                    scene like that.  It blocks the 
                    smell.

      Jamie pours cream into a bowl, starts to whisk it.  Then --

                                  JAMIE
                    Dad, at graduation, that guy 
                    Malevsky, what s the deal with him 
                    and Brian? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    They were partners but they had a 
                    falling out, maybe five years ago.  
                    Brian didn t say much about it.  
                    Speaking of graduation, that was a 
                    cute girl wishing you well.

                                  JAMIE
                    Who?  Maria Romano? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Good friend?

                                  JAMIE
                    Friend.  What about you, Dad?  Any 
                     good friends  in your life?                                                                                    52.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Not a day goes by I don t think 
                    about your mother and what she s 
                    missing, seeing you kids grow up, 
                    the grandchildren.

      Jamie lets it slide...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sunday vibe.  Demarcus just hanging up the phone, every 
      surrounding surface filled with boxes of files, tapes, 
      printouts, when Brian comes in and sees the boxes.

                                  BRIAN
                    The ship is in, huh?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    And this is only Tampa.  I just got 
                    off the phone with Baltimore P.D.  
                    Banse was a security guard at a 
                    trucking company same time another 
                    parochial school girl was abducted.  
                    But this one they found.  Wrapped 
                    in purple cloth and tossed in a 
                    rest-stop dumpster.  Also unsolved.  
                    That stuff s already on the way.

                                  BRIAN
                    Purple s what they cover the cross 
                    with on Good Friday.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Dig in, bro.

                                  BRIAN
                    Let s nail this bastard.

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    53.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:




      Night shift leaving, day-shift trickling in.  It s been 
      another long seige for Brian and Demarcus, poring through 
      files and records from yet more boxes that have arrived and 
      now fill every surface, other detectives helping.  Brian s 
      going through newspaper clippings; Demarcus, police reports. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    The little girl in the dumpster in 
                    Baltimore had stigmata-like pierces 
                    on the palms of her hands.  

                                  BRIAN
                    I don t think they were miracles.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    But the crime scene was again 
                      immaculate.  Guy s a regular Mr. 
                    Clean.

      A fellow DETECTIVE comes over and drops a file into a box.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Nothing new here, gentlemen.

      Without looking up, Brian hands him another file.  Brian 
      looks at the clock.

                                  BRIAN
                    Soon as they open up, we can start 
                    making calls to the storage 
                    companies in both states.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    I m seeing double.

      Demarcus rubs his eyes.  Brian picks up a newspaper clipping.

                                  BRIAN
                    This is the kid in Florida.  Can 
                    you imagine the parents?  No body, 
                    never any closure.  Beautiful 
                    little girl.
                          (then, keying in on photo)
                    Demarcus, check this out.                                                                                    54.


                                  DEMARCUS
                    What?

                                  BRIAN
                    The crucifix.  The necklace.

      RESUME SCENE

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Whoa.

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah.

      Now both men are on their feet and grabbing their jackets.  
      They re headed out when their D3, LIEUTENANT GREENBERG, 50,  
      is just coming into work.

                                    LIEUTENANT GREENBERG
                    You coming` or going?

                                  BRIAN
                    We just caught a break on the Banse 
                    case.

                                    LIEUTENANT GREENBERG
                    Good, but you re still going to 
                    have to go downtown.  Not even 
                    Daddy s gonna be able to deflect 
                    the heat off your ass this time.

                                  BRIAN
                    You done?

                                    LIEUTENANT GREENBERG
                    For now.

      Brian and Demarcus go.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      At her desk, Erin is on the phone.  

                                  ERIN
                    Jay Castleman in the Attorney 
                    General s office, please? 

      Now we see Brian standing by, arms folded across his chest.  
      And we see now, too, that Erin has the necklace.

                                  ERIN (CONT D)
                    Hi, Jay, this is Erin Boyle in the  
                    Manhattan D.A. s office.  We want 
                    to arrange to extradite Ronald 
                    Banse to Florida for murder with 
                    special circumstances.  

      Brian smiles.                                                                                    56.


                                  ERIN (CONT D)
                    We have the necklace Katherine 
                    MacDonald was wearing when she 
                      disappeared in 2005, and Tampa 
                    police have located what in all 
                      probability are her remains in a 
                    storage container in Orlando,  
                      registered in Banse s alias.
                          (she listens, then)
                      Appreciate it.  Thank you.

      She hangs up.

                                  BRIAN
                    Beautiful it s Florida.  They re 
                    not shy about exercising capital 
                      punishment down there.

                                  ERIN
                    Yeah, it s a happy outcome.  This 
                    time.

                                  BRIAN
                    Just gimme one, will you? 

                                  ERIN
                    You don t get it, do you?

                                  BRIAN
                    Say hi to the ACLU for me. 

      Brian heads for the door.

                                  ERIN
                    You re the one who s going to need 
                    a lawyer.
                          (beat, softening)
                    Brian.  You want to talk about 
                    that?

                                  BRIAN
                    Probably.  Thanks.

      A warm moment between them and Brian goes.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sydney s naked in bed.  Jamie, up and dressed in casual 
      civilian clothes, comes and kisses her.  She stirs.                                                                                    57.


                                  SYDNEY
                    Is it tomorrow already?  Come back 
                    to bed.

                                  JAMIE
                    Can t keep the Chief waiting.

                                  SYDNEY
                    It s still dark out.  You Reagans 
                    are crazy.

      She nestles down into the pillow.  He goes.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      When Jamie s settled --

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    I m Special Agent Anderson and this 
                    is Agent Cisco.  We want to talk to 
                    you about going to work for us.                                                                                    58.


                                  JAMIE
                    I already have a job.

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    We need somebody inside to 
                      infiltrate an element in the police 
                      department. 

      Agent Cisco shifts in his seat to face Jamie.  He holds up a 
      lapel pin in the shape of a blue knight.

                                  AGENT CISCO
                    Ever seen one of these?

                                  JAMIE
                    What is that?

                                  AGENT CISCO
                    It s what they give a cop when he s 
                    initiated into a group called the 
                    Blue Knights.

                                  JAMIE
                    The Blue Knights?  I thought that 
                    was a fairy tale.  My grandfather 
                    used to tell me stories about them 
                    when I was a kid, this secret 
                    society in the New York Police 
                      Department.  

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    They were real.  They took care of 
                    their own and they cleaned up 
                    Dodge.

                                  AGENT CISCO 
                    Until about five years ago when 
                    some of them went rogue, and these 
                    guys aren t wearing the white hats.  
                    They started with planting evidence 
                    to put away the bad guys, but it 
                    rapidly escalated into extortion, 
                    stealing drug evidence and cash, 
                    murder for hire....  Real bad 
                    actors.

                                  JAMIE
                    Does my father know about this?

      They just look at him.

                                  JAMIE (CONT D)
                    You re investigating the department 
                    and you haven t told my father?                                                                                    59.


                                  AGENT CISCO
                    We don t know how wide it spreads 
                    or how high it goes.

                                  JAMIE
                    I m out of here. 

      Jamie moves to get out.  The agent stays him with a hand. 

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    Wait a minute.  Something you 
                    should hear. 

      He holds up a small digital recorder.  It stops Jamie.  The 
      agent presses a button and we HEAR a man s voice.

                                  RECORDED VOICE
                    It s me.  I think I m in.  I ll let 
                    you know when I get a location so I 
                    can wire up.

      Jamie is stunned.  The agent hits replay.  

                                  RECORDED VOICE (CONT D)
                    It s me.  I think I m in.  I ll let 
                    you know when I get a location --   

      Anderson shuts off the recorder.  Jamie is pole-axed.

                                  JAMIE
                    That s my brother Joe.

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    This was his last message to us the 
                    day before he was killed.

      It s sinking in to Jamie.

                                  JAMIE
                    He was working with you?

                                  AGENT CISCO
                    Your brother wasn t killed in a 
                    bust gone bad.  They made him and 
                    then they killed him.  We thought 
                    you might want to finish what he 
                    started. 

      On Jamie, absorbing the ton of bricks just dropped on him...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    60.
