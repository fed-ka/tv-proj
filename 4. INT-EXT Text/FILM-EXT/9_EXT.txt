SEQ. 029 - 9 Meets 2
9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted
RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war.
Pulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered
clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human
civilization surround him.
He sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front
seat of a car.
Banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on
them.
achines lie deserted on the sides of roads.
Distracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged
old flyer: REVOLT!
He looks back at the War Machines and
Dictator flags.
He sees a vandalized poster of what appears
to be a dictator/leader.
9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.
Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.
9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war
Machine.
LOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.
Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.
9 grabs a
piece of metal lying in front of him.
The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure
emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him
with all his might.
9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2
is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris
behind him. 9 quickly tries to hide.

9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He
hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his
hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid,
but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to
help 2 up.
We see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more
primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of
OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is
tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him.
His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of
eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat.
9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see
that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a
contagious eagerness and imaginativeness.
2 peers eagerly at 9.
He circles 9 and spots the number on
his back.

with eager excitement. We see that 9's hand is more
sophisticated than 2's.

And then, at the last possible moment, he HURLS his scissor
knife at the Winged Beast. It flies through the air and
