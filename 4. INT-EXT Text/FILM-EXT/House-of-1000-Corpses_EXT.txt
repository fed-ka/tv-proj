We open on a dark, lonely stretch of two lane blacktop.
Off to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Hey, welcome back to 93.5 WJRC's
Halloween monster weekend. I'm Jimmy
Ray and I'll be bringing you the
oldies, the goldies and sometimes
the moldies. The good, the bad and
the uglies straight from the WJRC
vaults.
A weathered wooden sign proclaims CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S WORLD
OF MONSTERS AND MADMEN, sits atop the building.
A smaller sign below reads FRIED CHICKEN AND GASOLINE.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Hey, kids still trying to decide on
the right costume? Well why not head
on down to Randall's Penny Save
located on Kimball Rd. just off route
1 in Mackin County. Choose from a
wide array of ghosts and ghouls,
jeepers and creepers...
(scary sound effects)
...everything you need for your
Halloween needs.
SHERIFF HUSTON, a tall southern good old boy, leans against
his dusty cruiser smoking a cigarette, pumping gas into his
tank.
From a STRANGER'S POV we watch through the window, Stucky
EXIT for the restroom.
Sheriff Huston finishes pumping his gas, gets in his cruiser
and drives off.
KARL (O.S.)
All clear. Let's go shopping.
RICH (O.S.)
Right.
From this POV we RACE across the highway towards the front
door of the MUSEUM.
SLAM! We BURST through the door.
We move around the outside of the building watching the scene
inside unfold. HEAVY BREATHING is heard.
Rich DRAGS Stucky into the main room.
From Ravelli's POV we watch through the window, as everybody
inside starts SHOUTING at each other.
Suddenly, Rich SHOOTS Stucky. Stucky FALLS BACKWARDS against
the wall, screaming in pain.
We move QUICKLY towards the entrance.
We see a BILLBOARD painted on the side of an ABANDONED TRUCK.
The sign reads GOD IS DEAD.
We turn to face the road as a car drives by.
JERRY
Alright then, out of all of Charlie's
chicks who do you think is the
hottest?
A LONE FIGURE in a cheap skull mask and white robe stands
hidden behind a billboard off to the side of the road. Bill's
car drives past.
BILL
(yawning)
Hold on, I've heard this before...
but I can't remember the end.
JERRY
So, the guy goes to Hell and the
devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy
say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great
cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest
Cuban cigars you ever had."
BILL
Shit, we really need to find some
gas.
JERRY
(not listening)
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?"
Guy says, "yeah"... devil say,
"wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks
night, best booze you ever had...
all made from the finest stuff."
BILL
Yeah.
JERRY
Then the devil says, "are you gay?"
Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says,
"Well then, I guess you're gonna
hate Thursdays."
BILL
Oh yeah, I remember now.
JERRY
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.
(looking at magazine)
Hey, you think this place called
Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is
still around? It says, "Where the
Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
BILL
I dunno... we'll ask around as we
get closer. Man, I really don't want
to run out of gas out here in the
middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
JERRY
(sitting up)
Don't panic yourself, way too much
caffeine guy... I see a sign.
(reading the sign)
Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen
and Monsters... cool. Also... fried
chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
BILL
Perfect.
JERRY
I hope this place is cool. We could
use something interesting to liven
up chapter 12.
The car drives past. We turn and hold on the billboard. We
see the happy smiling face of a young Captain Spaulding.
The car pulls up to one of the gas pumps. Bill and Jerry get
out. Inside we see Spaulding, now in army pants and a hunting
jacket, mopping the floor.
BILL
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see
if it's worth thinking about.
JERRY
(salutes)
OK, Boss.
Jerry walks inside and immediately comes back out.
JERRY
Holy crap. You gotta see this place.
It's awesome.
BILL
How awesome?
JERRY
Really fucking awesome.
BILL
Wake up the chicks and bust out the
camera awesome?
JERRY
Hell yeah.
Jerry sticks his head back inside the car.
JERRY
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
Denise leans against the glass walls of the phone booth.
Various flyers are taped to the inside: free kittens, phone
sex ads and a missing poster for a girl named KAREN MURPHY.
A light rain begins to fall.
Denise puts some change in the phone and dials a number.
The camera moves down a quaint quiet little street. We come
to rest at a modest two-story house. The house is decorated
for Halloween.
Parents and their children roam from house to house, trick
or treating.
We hear the sound of a phone ringing.
DENISE
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're
gonna be a little late. We stopped
for gas at this place called Capt.
Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville
and it turned into a whole thing, so
we're kind of behind schedule.
DENISE
Hopefully I can move things along
here and make up the lost time by
speeding all the way home... yes,
Dad I'm kidding.
An OLD FARMER and his WIFE stare directly into the camera.
OLD MAN
I don't know where that skunk ape
sleeps. Maybe in the trees and all...
all I know is he eats squirrels to
survive and he had impure relations
with my wife.
WIFE
That's true. He performed lurid acts
upon me and my person while my husband
Russell was a fix'n to our hound
Clarence.
OLD MAN
If I see that thing again... I'm a
gonna kill that skunk ape.
BILL
(off screen)
What does it look like?
WIFE
It looked just like that chubby fella
from McHale's Navy... Ernie Borgnine.
OLD MAN
Hold up the picture.
The wife holds up a pencil sketch of a Bigfoot like creature
and a newspaper photo of Ernest Borgnine.
Bill's car moves past empty farmlands. A HEAVIER RAIN is now
falling.
From a STRANGER'S POV we see the car STRUGGLING down a dirt
road.
Sitting dead center in the middle of the road is a HUMONGOUS
DOG. The dog stares straight ahead. Long strands of drool
hang from its mouth to the ground.
A gun barrel is raised and we are looking through the sight
at the car. Pop! Pop! Pop! The GUN fires THREE SHOTS at the
car's rear tire.
The stranger whistles and the dog moves to the side of the
road.
Bill and Jerry stare down at the blown tire sunk in the mud.
BILL
I hope you fixed the spare like I
asked ya.
JERRY
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't...
um, I can't remember. I think I took
it out to fit the bags and forgot to
put it back.
BILL
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
JERRY
Well, technically I did what ya said.
BILL
You're a real fucking piece of work.
Bill stares at Jerry in disbelief.
A hand painted tin sign surrounded by flashing lights which
reads MISS BUNNY'S HOLLYWOOD REVUE hangs over the entrance
to a small garage.
Movie star portraits of JEAN HARLOW, W.C. FIELDS and CLARK
GABLE adorn the walls of the garage.
An over the hill ex-glamour girl, MISS BUNNY, 55, comes into
frame. She's dressed in a sparkling red gown with feathers
in her hair.
MISS BUNNY
(bad Marilyn Monroe
imitation)
Hi, I'm Miss Bunny and welcome to my
Hollywood Revue...
(she giggles)
...where the stars shine forever.
A single flashlight beam cuts through the darkness of the
dense woods. Bill stumbles behind Baby, she is clearly in
her element.
BILL
How much further?
BABY
Almost there... are you in a hurry
or something?
BILL
Well, yeah, kind of.
An old Gothic FARMHOUSE stands atop a hill at the end of a
long sloping dirt road. SCARECROWS with pumpkin heads hang
CRUCIFIED on crosses lining the drive. Everything is severely
overgrown.
Bill and Baby enter the gates of the FARM, they walk up the
main drive.
Baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud
puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house.
The front of the house is covered with strange junk art.
Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls.
BABY
These are all my dolls. I use to
like to chop their heads off.
Broken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird HUMAN
FIGURES, ANIMAL SKINS stretched over bone armatures form a
makeshift roof.
Glowing down from the upper windows are grinning JACK-O'-
LANTERNS.
BABY
The door's locked. I'll gotta go
around... wait here.
BILL
OK.
Baby RUNS OFF around the side of the house.
Bill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate
farm grounds. The rain continues to hammer down.
From BILL'S POV we see a silhouette of a LONE FIGURE walking
in the distance. The shape of a large dog follows behind
him.
Bill JUMPS, startled by the sound of the heavy front door
opening.
BILL
Christ, you scared the shit out of
me.
BABY
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
BILL
Is your brother ready to go?
BABY
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll
wait inside, come on.
BILL
He left!
BABY
Yeah, come on.
Baby GRABS Bill by the arm and pulls him into the house.
The heavy iron door slams shut.
Bill stands on the front porch watching as the truck roughly
jerks the car to a stop.
Jerry jumps out, opens the back door and helps Denise.
JERRY
(looking at Bill)
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
DENISE
Thanks for coming to get us. Little
brother almost scared us to death.
JERRY
(quietly to Bill as
he passes)
Dude, your chick's a little high
strung.
Mary is the last one out of the car. She says nothing as she
walks to join the others on the porch.
Her look says it all as she walks by Bill and into the house.
BILL
Mary, I'm sorry but he left without
me. Mary... come on, you don't think
I'd leave you stranded out there.
Billy, Jerry, Mary and Denise stand waiting in front of an
old barn. Tiny unlocks the huge doors of the barn and swings
them open.
Standing inside waiting is Mother. She is all dressed up for
the occasion.
MOTHER
Please, come in... how many in your
party...
(she counts the heads)
...one, two, three and four... right
this way.
Mother hands each of them a folded piece of paper, which
serves as a program book. Hand drawn on each is an orange
pumpkin.
Bill, Jerry, Denise and Mary climb back into their car.
BILL
Don't look back, just get in the
car.
DENISE
Lock the fucking doors.
From a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten.
The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle.
The scarecrows continue to pound on the car.
As we fade out, the sound of a BARKING DOG can be heard.
FADE TO:
From a long shot, we see the farmhouse in the early morning
sunrise. All is still.
The sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning
silence. Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind
the house. The BEATEN REMAINS of Bill's car are towed behind
it.
Darkness, except for the face of an alarm clock. The time is
7:00 AM. TICK, TICK, TICK... BUZZZZZZ. The alarm goes off.
A hand reaches over and turns off the alarm. We hear a deep
groan. A light turns on.
A police car drives past Ravelli and comes to a stop. OFFICER
GEORGE WYDELL, 42, a big, slightly paunchy man with a big
mustache and mirrored sunglasses, steps from his car.
Following close behind, OFFICER STEVE NAISH, 29, tall
athletic.
WYDELL
(pauses, looks around,
pulls up his belt)
Well, let's go see if the nut that
runs this place can help us.
NAISH
Right.
They walk to the door.
The police cruiser maneuvers down the rough dirt road.
Bill's car is down in a ditch, run off the side of the road.
A small, crummy liquor store stands next to a sleazy motel.
A filthy looking hooker leads her customer to a waiting room,
a homeless bum stands screaming obscenities in the parking
lot.
Baby and Rufus exit. Rufus loads the boxes into the back of
the truck. Baby sits on the curb and lights a cigarette.
Bill's car is now sitting in the middle of the road. The
back is attached to a police tow truck. An additional police
cruiser arrives on the scene.
Sheriff Huston steps out from his cruiser.
HUSTON
What'd we here, Georgie?
WYDELL
A vehicle registered to a William S.
Hudley.
HUSTON
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves
a field day beating the shit outta
this thing.
WYDELL
Yeah, no mercy here.
HUSTON
Recover any bodies?
WYDELL
Not yet.
HUSTON
(inspecting the car)
Shit, I wonder what these kids did
to bring this much hell down on 'em.
WYDELL
Just in the wrong place at the wrong
time.
HUSTON
That's the understatement of the
year.
WYDELL
Yep, I suppose it is.
HUSTON
What'd ya got there?
NAISH
Keys.
HUSTON
Well Christ boy, don't stand there
like a prize dog dick with his
butthole caught up a tree.
NAISH
Huh?
HUSTON
Open up the trunk.
NAISH
Yes, sir.
WYDELL
Toss 'em over here.
Naish tosses them over the car to Wydell. Wydell fishes
through the keys, finds the trunk key and opens it.
WYDELL
(winces)
God damn.
HUSTON
You find something, Georgie?
WYDELL
(disgusted)
Yep, I found something.
We move around the car to see the nude body of Karen Murphy
laying in the trunk. Her arms and legs are hog tied. She is
dead. The word TRICK is carved into her side.
A rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road.
A filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars.
Two fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards.
A Chevy Nova sits parked next to the station. Willis leans
against the side of the car, drinking coffee from a styrofoam
cup.
A police cruiser pulls up. Wydell and Naish step from the
car.
WYDELL
Mr. Willis?
MR. WILLIS
Yes, sir.
WYDELL
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Wydell extends his hand, they shake hands.
NAISH
Hey.
MR. WILLIS
George Willis...
(to Wydell)
...any leads?
WYDELL
Well, we were on our way out to run
a check on a couple farmhouses out
on the edge of town... closest thing
we got to a lead at this point.
MR. WILLIS
That's it?
WYDELL
Well, all we know is the kids were
headed out to a spot the locals call
Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with
some local legend about this character
everybody calls Dr. Satan.
MR. WILLIS
Dr. Satan?
NAISH
Yeah it's horseshit, just some
boogieman crap that the kids like to
scare each other with.
WYDELL
Anyway, there's not much else out
that way... so, I figure maybe there's
a chance the kids broke down and
found their way over to one of the
farms.
MR. WILLIS
What about the body you found?
WYDELL
(slightly surprised)
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm,
that's a strange one.
NAISH
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing
for a couple months, figured for a
runaway.
MR. WILLIS
Fit the profile?
NAISH
No, not really. Good kid, never been
in any trouble.
WYDELL
Her part in this I can't figure...
but I will.
MR. WILLIS
(wipes his brow)
Christ, you know it's crazy...
(gets choked up)
I lived through so many other people's
nightmares, you know. Always cool
and calm, but... but I never thought
I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
NAISH
Don't worry, we'll find her.
WYDELL
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a
move on sooner we'll find her.
Willis dumps out the remaining coffee, tosses the cup into
the trash and opens the back door of the police car. He gets
inside. Wydell and Naish climb in. The car drives off.
Wydell's cruiser turns up the road to the Firefly farmhouse.
It moves past the scarecrows and comes to a halt. The doors
swing open and Wydell, Naish and Willis get out.
WYDELL
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You
and Mr. Willis take a look around
the grounds for any sign of anything.
NAISH
Right...
(to Willis)
...come on.
Naish and Willis head off around the back of the house.
Wydell walks up the front steps.
Naish and Willis move through the cluttered back yard of
garbage.
NAISH
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies
throw anything away?
MR. WILLIS
Shhhh... you hear that?
The soft sound of moaning can be heard.
NAISH
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming
from?
MR. WILLIS
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Naish and Willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse. The
thick door is chained shut.
NAISH
(knocking on door)
Anybody in there?
The moaning gets louder.
MR. WILLIS
We gotta break it open.
NAISH
I ain't got a warrant.
Willis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open
the door.
MR. WILLIS
Tell it to my daughter.
NAISH
(grabbing hold to
help)
Shit... fuck procedure.
Together they struggle to open the door.
Naish and Willis bust open the door to the smokehouse. Hanging
upside down inside is Mary. She hangs from ropes strapped to
the ceiling. Large hunks of meat hang around her in the
cramped room.
NAISH
Jesus Christ.
MR. WILLIS
Call Wydell.
Naish hears the commotion over his walkie-talkie.
NAISH
(into walkie-talkie)
Wydell! Over! Wydell! Over!
No response.
NAISH
Fuck, go to the car... call for
backup. Tell 'em officer down.
MR. WILLIS
Right.
Willis runs to the car, he gets about halfway there before
he is hit in the back by a bullet. He stumbles and falls to
his knees.
He kneels silent, stunned. We hold on his face and watch as
his life passes before him.
A quick MONTAGE, we see the following images flash by:
A. A father and daughter together in happier times.
B. A child's birthday party.
C. A baby crying.
D. Willis and his deceased wife.
Otis fires another shot.
Willis falls forward into the mud, dead.
Naish sees Willis fall. Before he can react a voice calls
out from behind him.
OTIS
Hands up, bitch!
Naish raises his hands.
OTIS
Turn around, real slow... piggy-pie.
Naish turns around.
OTIS
Interlock your fingers behind your
head...
(Naish hesitates)
...do it!
Naish obeys.
OTIS
Kneel.
Naish kneels down.
From a distance we see Otis standing over Naish, execution
style. A white puff of smoke comes from Otis's gun and a
distant popping sound is heard. Naish falls over on his side.
The scene fades to blood red.
The house stands silent in the darkness. Lightning crashes,
a heavy rain falls.
Burning JACK-O'-LANTERNS beam from every window. Smoke rises
from the chimney.
It is Halloween night.
The rain pounds down. A heavy fog hovers over the dense growth
of the field. In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a
gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night.
Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and
Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus
holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary.
Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners,
and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child.
He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam.
The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure.
OTIS
(handing Baby the
lantern)
Hold this. Point it over here.
Baby directs the light at Otis. We see that he is trying to
unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in
the base of the wooden structure.
Otis unlocks the door and swings it open. He reaches down
into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench,
attached to the hook is a chain.
Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit
to reveal a rusty metal crank. He begins to turn the crank.
Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the
end of the chain.
Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground.
He flips open the lid.
OTIS
Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here.
Rufus cuts loose Jerry, but holds him steady by the neck.
BABY
Take his gag out, it's more fun with
the screaming.
MOTHER
Yeah, I like the screaming too...
it's so much more exciting.
Rufus cuts loose the gag.
JERRY
Please don't kill us, please don't
kill us.
BABY
(imitating Jerry)
Please don't kill us, please don't
kill us.
OTIS
Bitch, shut your mouth and get your
shit in the box.
JERRY
Let us go, please... let the girls
go.
BABY
(imitating Jerry)
Let us go, please... let the girls
go.
Otis pulls out a gun and points it at Jerry.
OTIS
Get in... now!
MOTHER
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Mother grabs Jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss.
MOTHER
Bye sweety, we could of been great
together.
JERRY
Please, let us go, we won't tell
anybody.
MOTHER
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
BABY
We won't tell anybody.
Otis cocks the pistol. Jerry starts to slowly move towards
the coffin.
OTIS
Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot...
alright mamma, I ain't got all fucking
night.
JERRY
Please, please this is insane. You
can't do this.
Rufus pushes Jerry into the coffin.
OTIS
It is and I can... next.
Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus. Rufus tries
to hold her steady, when suddenly Mary breaks free and starts
to run.
OTIS
(laughs and raises
his pistol)
Where's she think she's a gonna get
to? She's gonna run all the way home.
BABY
No! Let me get her...
(turns to Mother)
...Ma, Otis is having all the fun...
can I get her?
MOTHER
That's true, Otis... not that we're
having a bad time, but...
OTIS
(rolls his eyes)
Well, go get her.
Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field
after Mary.
Mary trips and falls over a small gravestone. She gets up
and stumbles back into a wooden cross. She tears the gag
from her mouth and gasps for air.
BABY (O.S.)
There once was a woman who lived
with her daughter in a cabbage garden.
Mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden
crosses. She is in a homemade cemetery.
BABY (O.S.)
...along came a rabbit and ate up
all the cabbages. The woman said...
Mary turns 360 degrees, but finds nothing.
BABY (O.S.)
..."Go into the garden and drive out
the rabbit"...
THUD! Mary is hit from behind, she falls forward. Baby JUMPS
on top of her and sits on her back. Baby is holding a large
hunting knife.
BABY
"Shoo! Shoo!" said the maiden...
Mary screams in pain, as Baby PLUNGES the knife into her.
Baby STABS Mary again and again and again. Mary lets out a
long gurgling scream, then goes silent.
BABY
..."Come maiden," said the rabbit...
(leans down)
...sit on my tail and go with me to
my rabbit hutch.
Baby, covered in blood, licks the knife clean.
Otis shoves Denise into the coffin with Jerry and locks the
lid shut. Through a CROSS-SHAPED OPENING in the coffin we
see them crushed together.
Rufus LOWERS the coffin into the pit. Once the coffin is
inside Otis slams the door shut.
Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern
and a small tape recorder playing music.
The rain has stopped. Tiny opens the doors to the barn.
He goes inside. He exits a few moments later, dragging a
huge wooden stake. He sets the stake down carefully and closes
the barn doors. He then picks up the stake and drags it away.
Behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate
system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the
many automobiles beneath.
Rufus moves through the jungle. He stops and begins to remove
the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser. He
climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and
starts the engine. He drives off.
The police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields.
Primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece
of land, approximately twenty feet in diameter.
Laying flat in the center is the large stake, Mary's body is
draped across it. Tiny is securing her to the stake with
rope.
Baby sees the car and raises her gun. She aims it at the car
driver. She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face
of Rufus behind the wheel. She lowers the gun and begins to
laugh.
The car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat. The
car drives off.
Tiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place. He
implants it into the ground. Her body hangs like a doll.
Tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the
stake.
Otis, face painted like a SKULL and wearing a priest's robe,
walks solemnly through the tall grass.
Otis stands in front of the bound Mary, holding a pumpkin.
Otis places the pumpkin over Mary's head.
Tiny stands behind him holding a lit torch.
The police car drives wildly through the fields.
Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body
up into the night air. The cool air rushes to her lungs. She
crawls free of the hole, gasping for air.
She is safe. Suddenly... SMASH! A ghoul has broken through
the surface. He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull
her back into the hole.
Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul.
She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.
Rufus and Baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake.
Rufus and Baby stand on the hood.
Otis finishes his sermon, he raises his arm. Tiny raises the
torch. Otis drops his arm, signaling Tiny. Tiny throws the
torch onto the stake. The stake ignites into a huge FIREBALL.
Denise pulls herself to her feet and begins to run.
The flaming object burns in the distance behind her.
Denise stumbles toward the road on two badly injured legs.
Rufus, Tiny and Baby jump up and down in celebration, smashing
the police car. Otis stands transfixed by the flames before
him.
Denise makes her way out onto the road. No cars are in sight.
In the distance headlights break through the darkness. Denise
stands in the middle of the road.
The TRUCK comes into view, it is a small cube truck.
Denise stands in the headlights, waving her arms for it to
stop. The truck comes to a halt.
She runs toward the passenger's side door and climbs in.
The truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the
farmhouse. The jack-o'-lanterns still burn in the windows,
grinning their evil grin.
