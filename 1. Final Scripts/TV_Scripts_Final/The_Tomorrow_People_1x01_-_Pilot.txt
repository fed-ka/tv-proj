      ESTABLISHING:  NEW YORK CITY.  AN OFFICE TOWER.  THINK 
      NAKATOMI PLAZA (AKA THE DIE HARD BUILDING).

      INT. OFFICE TOWER -- HALLWAY - NIGHT

      FORTY STORIES UP, A SHADOW slips around a corner.  It s after-
      hours.  Whoever this is, shouldn t be here.  TRACKING with 
      him down the hall we ANGLE ON a motion detector TURNING RED.  

      INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

      CUT TO A SECURITY GUARD at his post.  Reacting to a SECURITY 
      SCHEMATIC ON A COMPUTER.  A RED LIGHT blinking.

                                  SECURITY GUARD (INTO WALKIE)
                    Code up on the top floor.  Standby.  
                    I better check it out.

      Swapping walkie for his GUN, he EXITS.

      INT. DARK ROOM - INTERCUT

      CUT TO CARA, early 20s.  Her beautiful, anxious face lit by a 
      COMPUTER with the SCHEMATIC.  She s hacked in-to the system.  

                                  CARA
                    Nice.  You just tripped an alarm.

      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

      BACK AS THE SHADOWY FIGURE steps into the light.  REVEAL 
      JOHN, late 20s, handsome, cool under pressure.  We assume 
      that he and Cara are talking VIA EARWIG.  

                                  JOHN
                    Whatever.  I m almost there.

      As John reaches a perpendicular hallway.  Right or left?

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Which way am I going?

      BACK WITH CARA. 

                                  CARA
                          (speaking to someone O.S.)
                    Pull up a floor plan of the tower --

      CUT TO JOHN.  Cara s VOICE in his ear.                                                                                      2.


                                  CARA (V.O.)
                    TIM says there s someone in the 
                    East elevator.  You gotta bail.  
                    Service elevator s to your left...

      But John spots a sign:  Medical records  pointing RIGHT.

                                  JOHN
                          (glibly ignoring Cara)
                    Right it is...

      BACK WITH CARA, pissed.  

                                  CARA
                    TIM says you re an idiot... 

      BACK WITH JOHN, reaching the DOOR at the end of the hall.  
      Marked MEDICAL RECORDS.  Only it s locked.  And not an 
      ordinary lock, a sophisticated electronic keypad.

                                  CARA (CONT D)
                    Let me guess... It s locked?

      CLOSE ON JOHN as we hear his thoughts.  For future reference, 
      all telepathic conversation will be in italics.

                                  JOHN
                    You musta read my mind...

      CLOSE ON CARA, responding telepathically... And sardonically.  

                                  CARA
                    I also read the mind of the guy in 
                    the elevator who s got a gun.

      BACK WITH JOHN looking over shoulder at the ELEVATOR, uh oh.

      INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

      CUT TO THE GUARD, READYING HIS GUN.  Almost to John s floor.

      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

      BACK WITH JOHN.  BING.  AS THE ELEVATOR OPENS BEHIND HIM.  
      He s TRAPPED.  But just as the security guard steps out... 

      JOHN VANISHES INTO THIN AIR...

      INT. MEDICAL RECORDS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      ...ONLY TO REAPPEAR ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE LOCKED DOOR.  WTF?                                                                                      3.


      INT. HALLWAY - INTERCUT

      The guard surveys the EMPTY HALLWAY.  Huh.  That s weird. He 
      holsters his gun.  Relaxing, raising his walkie...

                                  SECURITY GUARD (INTO WALKIE)
                    False alarm.

      But when the guard turns around towards the elevator, he 
      finds THREE SUITED MEN standing behind him.  Dressed like 
      government agents.  Where the hell did they come from?  

                                  SECURITY GUARD (CONT D)
                          (reaching for gun)
                    Hold it right there...  

      ONLY TO FIND HIS HOLSTER EMPTY.  

      PULL BACK from his confused expression as WE REVEAL HIS GUN 
      FLOATING IN MID-AIR.  Next to his head.  Just... Levitating.

                                  SECURITY GUARD (CONT D)
                    What the -- ?  

      CLOSE ON THE LEAD AGENT, flanked by the other two.  Staring 
      at the levitating gun... Like he s controlling it.  

                                  LEAD AGENT
                    Let me help you with that --

      Before the guard can react, lead agent plucks the gun out of 
      mid-air and CLOCKS THE GUARD in the head.  He s out cold.

      BACK WITH CARA.  Reacting to the live feed.  She goes ashen.

                                  CARA
                      Something s wrong...

      INT. MEDICAL RECORDS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Meanwhile, we CUT TO JOHN flipping through a file cabinet.  
      He finds what he s looking for, a MEDICAL RECORD.  Bingo.

                                  CARA  (V.O.)
                          ( get out of there )
                    ULTRA s in the building...

      BACK WITH JOHN.  Cara s warning comes too late.  A VOICE -- 

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    I ll take that file. 

      John slowly turns.  The agents fan out.  Surrounding him.                                                                                      4.


                                  LEAD AGENT
                    It s over, John...

      THAT S WHEN JOHN TURNS AND RUNS STRAIGHT TOWARDS A WALL.  
      About to hit it when WHOOSH, HE DISAPPEARS.  But these agents 
      know the drill.  Chasing John they reach the wall and VANISH. 

      INT. ADJACENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      REAPPEARING on John s heels.  Arms pumping, John eyes two 
      sets of FILE CABINETS.  He runs between them.  ON THE AGENTS, 
      following.  THE DRAWERS FLY OPEN.  SMASH, TWO AGENTS GO DOWN.  

      BUT LEAD AGENT DUCKS, SLIDING UNDER THE DRAWERS, LEAPING BACK 
      TO HIS FEET.  John looks over his shoulder.  Damn.  This guy 
      is good.  He spots a nearby window.  Runs towards it.

      AT THE WINDOW, John gazes on the STREET... FORTY STORIES 
      DOWN.  A moment of focus before HE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS...

      EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

      REAPPEARING ON THE STREET BELOW.  Only it s like he ran the 
      distance.  John staggers towards a SUBWAY ENTRANCE.  WHEN 
      LEAD AGENT APPEARS ON THE STREET BEHIND HIM.  Still trailing.

      INT. SUBWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER

      John SPRINTS ACROSS the empty platform as a TRAIN SCREECHES 
      INTO THE STATION.  He goes to board it when the LEAD AGENT 
      APPEARS, HAVING TELEPORTED SMACK INTO JOHN S PATH...

      WITH A KICK TO THE CHEST, lead agent SENDS JOHN SPRAWLING.  
      HE SPOTS THE FILE, fallen from John s hand, reaches for it...

      BUT JOHN SWEEPS HIS LEG.  Lead agent falls, scrambling to his 
      feet, but every time he throws a punch, John VANISHES, 
      REAPPEARING on the opposite side with a BLIND-SIDING PUNCH.

      WHIFF, WHIFF, WHIFF... The agent can t connect to John who 
      DELIVERS A FLURRY OF BLOWS, THEN DROPS HIM.  John quickly 
      grabs the file, slips on the train as the doors close.

      INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

      John looks around, making sure the train car is empty.  The 
      train enters a tunnel.  And he VANISHES...

      INT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS

      REAPPEARING inside an ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION.  John nearly 
      collapses.  CARA approaches.  We see her computer set-up in 
      the background.  We re in some sort of secret base.                                                                                      5.


                                  JOHN
                    They must have been following me.

                                  CARA
                    You sure you lost them?

      John checks out his bloody knuckles.  Then cocky... 

                                  JOHN
                    Yeah.  Pretty sure.  

                                  CARA
                    I hope this one was worth it.
                          (re: file)
                    That he is who you think he is. 

                                  JOHN
                    Only way to know for sure is to 
                    break him out... 

                                  CARA
                    So, what s his name?

      John opens the FILE.  ANGLE ON name.

                                  JOHN
                    Stephen Jameson.

      INT. BEDROOM - DAY

      CUT TO STEPHEN JAMESON, 18, a year away from being outright 
      handsome and a decade away from realizing it.  A tormented 
      soul enjoying a moment of peace.  Stephen is asleep.

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Stephen?  Stephen Jameson?  

      His eyes FLUTTER OPEN, THEN GO WIDE.  REVEAL A SEXY WOMAN 
      (30) in bed next to him.  Sleeping.  So, who s talking?

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    That s your name, isn t it?

      Stephen rolls over looking for the owner of the VOICE but 
      instead finds a BURLY GUY.  Asleep.  Arm draped over Stephen.  
      Stephen JUMPS.  That s when SEXY WOMAN awakens and SCREAMS.  

      INT. STEPHEN S APARTMENT - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      BURLY GUY holds Stephen by the neck as he POUNDS ON THE DOOR.   

                                    STEPHEN
                    Please.  Don t.  I can explain...                                                                                      6.


      The DOOR OPENS.  REVEAL Stephen s mother MARLA, 40, in a 
      robe.  Sleepiness leaves her face, replaced by concern.

                                  MARLA
                    Stephen -- ?  What s going on?

                                  BURLY GUY
                    Guess where I found your creep son 
                    this time?  On the doorstep?  No.  
                    In the breakfast nook?  No.  I 
                    found him in my bed.  With my wife.

      He PUSHES Stephen inside as Stephen s younger brother LUCA, 
      14, clean-scrubbed, ENTERS the room.

                                  MARLA
                    I m so sorry.  Like I told you 
                    before, he has a sleeping disorder. 

                                  BURLY GUY
                    Yeah?  How does a kid get through 
                    two dead-bolts, then lock the door 
                    behind him, while sleepwalking?

      Marla shoots Stephen a look.  Stephen shrugs.  No idea.

                                  BURLY GUY (CONT D)
                    I catch him anywhere near my place 
                    I m calling the super and the cops.

      He storms off, as Marla closes the door.  Luca lights up.

                                  LUCA
                    You slept with Mrs. D Amico?

                                    STEPHEN
                    It was an accident...

                                  LUCA
                          (pound it out)
                    Dude.  She is totally hot.

                                  MARLA
                    Luca.  Get ready for school.  Now.

      Luca exits.  Marla stares accusingly at Stephen.

                                    STEPHEN
                      I swear...I don t even remember 
                    getting out of bed.

      But mom just stares at him.  She s at the end of her rope.                                                                                        7.


                                    STEPHEN (CONT D)
                    I m not doing this on purpose...

                                  MARLA
                    I can t watch you all night after 
                    working at the hospital all day...

                                    STEPHEN
                    It won t happen again. 
                          (off her look)
                    I know.  I said that before, but 
                    I ll try harder this time.  Really.

                                  MARLA
                    How?  How can you promise not to do 
                    something you can t even control?

                                    STEPHEN
                    I ll talk to Dr. Bloom.  Maybe 
                    there s something we haven t tried.

                                  MARLA
                    You mean, Dr. Bloom who s no longer 
                    taking our insurance?
                          (off Stephen)
                    I m sorry.  Forget it.  I shouldn t 
                    have brought it up.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    Is that why you ve been taking all 
                    the extra shifts?

                                  MARLA
                    I can handle the shifts, Stephen... 
                          (re: Stephen s behavior)
                    It s this that s driving me crazy.

      INT. BATHROOM - LATER

      CUT TO STEPHEN, opens a BOTTLE OF PILLS.  Pops one, empties 
      the rest.  Finds a second bottle:   Miralax stool softener.   
      Stephen refills the PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE WITH LAXATIVES.  

                                  LUCA (O.S.)
                    Quit jerking it.  Gonna be late...

      EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

      CUT TO Stephen and Luca approaching the FRONT STEPS as GROUP 
      OF JOCKS spot Luca, waving him over.  This kid is popular.

                                    STEPHEN
                    See you after school...                                                                                      8.


      CONTINUE TRACKING WITH Stephen through the various high 
      school social strata.  He keeps his head down.  A loner.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Jesus, Stephen... 

      REVEAL ASTRID (18).  Classically beautiful, effortlessly 
      cool.  Friends with Stephen since the sandbox.

                                  ASTRID
                    You look awful.  Did you sleep in a 
                    ditch last night?

                                    STEPHEN
                    I wish. Neighbor s apartment, three 
                    floors up.  They almost called the 
                    cops... It s getting worse.

                                  ASTRID
                    Are you taking your meds?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Yes, Astrid, I m taking my meds 
                    like a good boy.  But, hey, maybe I 
                    need something a little stronger.  
                    A little electroshock?  Maybe an 
                    ice-pick lobotomy?

                                  ASTRID
                    Let me see your pills.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Why?

                                  ASTRID
                    I want to check to see if being a 
                    dick is a side-effect.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Cute.

                                  ASTRID
                    I m just worried about you. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    I know.  And I m just tired of 
                    everybody worrying about me.  
                    I wish I could be like them...  

      He motions to their carefree CLASSMATES, laughing, smiling.

                                    STEPHEN (CONT D)
                    You know?  Normal.                                                                                      9.


                                  ASTRID
                    I don t want you to be normal.
                          (taking Stephen s hand)
                    I just want you to get better.

        ESTABLISHING SHOT: UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.

      ANGLE ON A SIGN announcing a  visiting lecture series. 

      INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

      CUT TO a CLASS listening to DR. JEDIKIAH PRICE (40) handsome, 
        charismatic.  ON SCREEN, the famous  Evolution of Man  IMAGE.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    What this slide suggests is that 
                    over the last two-million years we 
                    evolved slowly, from primitive man 
                    into who we are today. But our 
                    evolution has been marked by sudden 
                    genetic shifts, random mutations 
                    which happened in the blink of a 
                    eye, resulting in new species...
                          (re: slide of Neanderthal)
                    40,000 years ago, this guy was 
                    king.  Until we came along.
                          (re: slide of a person)
                    We must have seemed like an 
                      evolutionary joke.  Smaller, 
                    weaker, we even had smaller brains.  
                    And yet we managed to wipe them 
                    out.  Because of just one unique 
                      competitive advantage. Love. Don t 
                    laugh. Love between individuals who 
                    unlike Neanderthals mated for life.  
                    Love for family.  We are hard-wired 
                    to care of our own...

      Just then, Jedikiah SPOTS SOMEONE -- he looks like a college 
      TA (DAMIAN, 20s) -- standing off to the side of the stage.  

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    And it s because of our collective 
                    strength we survived. Excuse me.

      Walking offstage to speak with DAMIAN, Jedikiah s easygoing 
      attitude changes during the PRIVATE BEAT.

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    What happened?

                                  DAMIAN
                    They lost him.  He was in New York.                                                                                    10.


      CLOSE ON JEDIKIAH.  A flash of rage.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    You re telling me John Young is 
                    operating in our own backyard?

                                  DAMIAN
                    We think that he came out of hiding 
                    to track a new break-out.  

      Jedikiah sets his jaw, heads for the EXIT.  

                                  DAMIAN (CONT D)
                    What about your lecture?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    You finish it.  I ve got a break-
                    out to catch. 

      INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

      CUT TO STEPHEN in class.  His TEACHER lecturing on genetics.

                                    TEACHER
                    --for a dominant gene to be 
                    expressed the F1 generation need 
                    only inherit the trait from either 
                    the mother or the father...

      CLOSE ON STEPHEN, on the verge of nodding off, when--

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Stephen?  

      Suddenly, Stephen is wide-awake.  He looks around to see 
      who s speaking... BUT THE VOICE IS IN HIS HEAD.  

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I know you re out there... I know 
                    that you can hear me...

      Stephen tries to block out the VOICE.

                                    STEPHEN
                    It s just a hallucination... You re 
                    only in my head...

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Stop shutting me out, Stephen.  I 
                    know that you re scared -- but you 
                    don t have to be -- there s nothing 
                    wrong with you, if you ll just 
                    listen to what I have to say --                                                                                    11.


      It s more than he can handle.  Stephen snaps.  Out loud.

                                    STEPHEN
                    SHUT UP!

      Shocked, his teacher turns on Stephen.  All eyes on him as 
      the whole class bursts into LAUGHTER.  Except for Astrid.  
      REVEAL her sitting in the back of the classroom.  Worried.

                                    TEACHER
                    Excuse me, Mr. Jameson?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Sorry.  I wasn t talking to you.

                                    TEACHER
                    Who were you talking to? 

      Stephen exchanges looks with his perplexed classmates.

                                    STEPHEN
                          (thinking to himself)
                    I m going crazy.

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.)
                    You are not crazy.

      Stephen LEAPS out of his desk.  Sends it toppling. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    I m not feeling well... I need to 
                    go see the nurse.

      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

        Hyperventilating, Stephen finds a CORNER.  That s when he s 
      ambushed by DYLAN, your prototypical high school bully.

                                  DYLAN
                     Sup, Stevie?  
                          (cornering Stephen)
                    Remember those pills you gave me 
                    last week?  What were they again?

                                    STEPHEN
                    The ones you stole?  Thorazine.

                                  DYLAN
                    They were pretty sweet on top of a 
                    few Adderals.                                                                                    12.


                                    STEPHEN
                          (deadpan)
                    Well, that particular medication is 
                    an anti-psychotic, Dylan... So no 
                    wonder you re fond of them.

                                  DYLAN
                    So, what d you bring me today?

      Dylan reaches into Stephen s jacket and yanks out his BOTTLE 
      OF PILLS (which Stephen substituted for laxatives).  Dylan 
      pockets them, walks off

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    Good luck with the crazy.

                                    STEPHEN
                          (to himself)
                    Good luck with the diarrhea.

      INT. STEPHEN S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      CUT TO Stephen cooking as Luca ENTERS.  Tosses down his gear.  
      He s just returned from football practice.

                                  LUCA
                    I m starved.  Where s mom?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Stuck at work.  

      Luca joins his brother by the stove.  A faint smile.

                                  LUCA
                    Beef stroganoff?  That was one of 
                    dad s specialties, right?

                                    STEPHEN
                    I m surprised you remember.

                                  LUCA
                    That s about it.

      Stephen pops open a can of cream of mushroom soup, dumps it 
      into the saucepan... PLOP.  Luca looks disgusted.

                                  LUCA (CONT D)
                    Take it dad wasn t much of a cook?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Dad really wasn t much of a dad.

                                  LUCA
                    Do you ever wonder where he is?                                                                                    13.


                                    STEPHEN
                    I try not to think about him too 
                    much.  I mean, why should he matter 
                    to us if we don t matter to him?

                                  LUCA
                    Yeah.  I guess...
                          (beat)
                    But what if what s going on with 
                    you is like genetic or something?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Luca.  I m not dad, okay?  I m not 
                    going anywhere. 

                                  LUCA
                    Not even in your sleep?

      Stephen slides the nasty-looking stroganoff into the trash. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    What do you say we order a pizza?  

      INT. STEPHEN S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      CUT TO Stephen getting ready for bed.  He grabs an old T-
      SHIRT.  Rips it into a strip.  Ties the strip around his 
      wrist before tying the other end to his bedpost.  No 
        sleepwalking tonight... 

      CUT TO STEPHEN S SLEEPING FACE.  LATER.

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Wake up, Stephen...

      STEPHEN S EYES POP OPEN.  

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I can prove you re not crazy... I 
                    can prove I m real.

                                    STEPHEN
                    How?

                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Meet me at the Flatbush subway 
                    station in ten minutes... 

      Off Stephen, untying himself from his bed.

      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

      CUT TO Stephen on the PLATFORM.  Feeling stupid.  Of course 
      no one s waiting for him.  A TRAIN ENTERS the station.                                                                                      14.


                                  CARA S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Get on the train. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    You gotta be kidding...  

      INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - MOMENTS LATER

      Stephen can t help it.  He hops on the empty train car.

                                  CARA S VOICE (V.O.)
                    You re almost there, Stephen.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Where -- ?

      Just then the train goes into a TUNNEL.  SUDDENLY a FIGURE 
      TELEPORTS ONTO THE TRAIN, GRABS STEPHEN, THEN TELEPORTS OFF.

      INT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS

      STEPHEN APPEARS OUT OF THIN AIR, JOHN STILL GRIPPING HIS ARM.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    What the -- ?  

      STEPHEN gazes around the ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION: A mix of 
      old architecture and modern accoutrements.

                                  JOHN
                    I m John, Stephen.  And I believe 
                    you and Cara have already met...

      Cara steps forward.

                                  CARA
                    Hi, Stephen.  

      CLOSE ON Stephen, realizing that not only is the voice inside 
      his head real, she s also quite beautiful...  

                                  CARA (CONT D)
                    I told you you re not crazy.

      Off Stephen, speechless.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    15.


                                        ACT TWO


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER

      RESUME: Stephen in the ABANDONED STATION with John and Cara.  
      As he takes in his surroundings.  Amazed and confused.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Where is this?  How did I -- who 
                    are you?

      He trails off, overwhelmed with questions.  Cara looks to 
      John.  You got this?  John responds point-by-point.

                                  JOHN
                    You re 100 feet beneath the streets 
                    of Manhattan. You teleported here -- 
                    actually, I teleported you.  And 
                    we re called Tomorrow People.

                                  CARA
                    We didn t choose the name.  Swear.

      Stephen shakes his head.  This can t be happening...

                                    STEPHEN
                    This is insane.  Or some sort of 
                    crazy dream.

                                  CARA
                            (telepathically)
                    It s not a dream, Stephen.

      Stephen wheels around on Cara.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    How did you do that?

                                  CARA
                    You ve heard of telepathy?  It s 
                    another one of our powers.

                                  JOHN
                    The  three T s  -- the third being 
                      telekinesis.  We all possess each, 
                    but everyone has a paranormal 
                      specialty.  Cara s is mind-reading, 
                      obviously, mine is teleportation --

      Cara has been watching Stephen closely.                                                                                    16.


                                  CARA
                    He doesn t believe us.
                          (with a shrug)
                    The teleporting usually sells it.

      Her eyes sparkle.  She s smart.  Self-aware.  A sense of 
      humor beneath her serious demeanor.  But Stephen s immune.

                                    STEPHEN
                    No offense, whoever you are, but 
                    any second I m gonna wake up and 
                    I m gonna be someplace really awful 
                    -- like my hairy neighbor s bed --

                                  CARA
                    Stephen.  You re not imagining 
                    this.  You re one of us.  You re 
                    breaking out.

                                    STEPHEN
                    I don t even know what that means --

                                  JOHN
                    You re waking up in weird places? 
                    You re not sleepwalking, you re 
                      teleporting.  You hear Cara s voice 
                    in your head?  That s telepathy.   
                    Your latent powers are starting to 
                    appear, just barely.  Soon you ll 
                    be able to do this...

      John STARES HARD at Stephen.  Stephen doesn t get it.  Huh?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Sorry.  What am I looking at?

      THAT S WHEN STEPHEN REALIZES HE S FLOATING OFF THE GROUND.

                                    STEPHEN (CONT D)
                    What the -- ?  Put me down!

      John DROPS HIM.  He pulls himself up, shaken.  Reeling. 

                                    STEPHEN (CONT D)
                    I m having a psychotic break.  My 
                    meds are off or something...

                                  CARA
                    No more pills.  They re only 
                    getting in the way. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    Of what? You have no idea what my 
                    year has been like.                                                                                     17.


                                  CARA
                    Stephen.  Look at me.  

      Stephen meets her gaze.  She speaks to him calmly.  Her eyes 
      warm, friendly.  Soothing.  Somehow he trusts her.

                                  CARA (CONT D)
                    I know exactly what it s been like.  
                    How alone you ve felt.  How scared.  
                    It feels like you re turning into a 
                    different person, like your mind 
                    isn t your own... 
                          (off Stephen)
                    I don t just sense your voice, it s 
                    your moods, emotions, fears.  When 
                    we re connected, I feel what it s 
                    like to be you.

                                    STEPHEN
                    That sounds... Awful. 

      Cara smiles.  The ice has been broken. 

                                  CARA
                    Compared to what I went through in 
                    high school?  Think you feel like a 
                    freak?  You re not... You re a 
                    dynamo, a force of nature, Stephen, 
                    you re on the precipice of turning 
                    into someone truly extraordinary.

      He gives her a sheepish look, afraid of what s inside his 
      head, of what she s seen.  John clocks their chemistry.  Is 
      pretty sure he doesn t like it.  He shifts, all business...

                                  JOHN
                    Let s give him the tour.


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

      Cara and John lead Stephen through the abandoned station.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    How many of you are there?

                                  CARA
                    Here with us?  You re number 
                    eleven.  Out there?  We don t know.  
                    Could be hundreds... Thousands.

                                  JOHN
                    It s a genetic mutation that lies 
                    dormant through adolescence.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    18.

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes it never breaks out.  
                    Someone could be a tomorrow person 
                    their whole lives and never know. 

                                  CARA
                    That s what we do.  We find new 
                      break-outs, bring them in, train 
                    them, keep them safe.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Safe?  Safe from what?

                                  CARA
                          (simple)
                    Everyone else.

      She s not elaborating.  Stephen clocks this.  Unsettled.

                                  JOHN
                    Until they break-out, tomorrow 
                    people are just regular  saps. 

                                  CARA
                    Homo sapiens.

                                    STEPHEN
                    As in human?  If I m not human.
                          (beat)
                    What the hell am I?

                                  JOHN
                    You are a homo superior... The next 
                    step in evolution.

      CLOSE ON STEPHEN.  Processing.  

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Deep breath... 

      Stephen turns to find RUSSELL, 18, a handsome bad boy.

                                    RUSSELL
                    I freaked out when I got the whole 
                     secret superhero  speech, too.  
                    But all that matters is that you re 
                    one of us.  I m Russell. 
                          (shaking Stephen s hand)
                    And you re the one my sister can t 
                    stop talking about?

      Cara glares at her kid brother as she says TELEPATHICALLY.

                                  CARA
                    Shut up, Russell.                                                                                    19.


      He grins at her.  He loves the tease.  Then, to Stephen --

                                    RUSSELL
                    You coming or what?


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

      Russell leads Stephen down a DARK CORRIDOR, through LIVING 
      QUARTERS; couches, rugs.  Small rooms with BEDS.  We see a 
      COUPLE TOMORROW PEOPLE hanging out.

                                    STEPHEN
                    You guys live here?

                                    RUSSELL
                    For now.  We re taking the whole 
                      underground thing literally...

                                    STEPHEN
                    Why?

                                    RUSSELL
                    That s chapter two, man.  We re 
                    still in the prologue.  Here --


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - RUSSELL S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      They arrive at a large room. 

                                    RUSSELL
                    Pretty sweet digs, huh? 

      STEPHEN S POV:  The room has been outfitted with everything a 
      teenage runaway might need -- computers, furniture, art -- 
      the world s coolest dormitory.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Where d you get all this -- ?

                                    RUSSELL
                    Heard of the five-finger discount?

      Russell nods to his dresser, fixing his gaze, a ROLEX FLOATS 
      up as he reaches out his arm, slides it onto his wrist.

                                    RUSSELL (CONT D)
                    We get the no-finger discount. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    You steal?                                                                                    20.


                                    RUSSELL
                    Only what we need.

      Stephen looks inside the box of watches.  Must be a dozen.   

                                    RUSSELL (CONT D)
                    Plus a few perks.  C mon, I ll show 
                    you around the training center.


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      A martial arts gym.  A PAIR OF TOMORROW PEOPLE (Stephen s 
      age) SPAR.  ONE THROWS A PUNCH, THE OTHER TELEPORTS OUT OF 
      THE WAY, COUNTER-PUNCHES.  Stephen watches them, awed.

                                    RUSSELL
                    These are two of our newest break-
                    outs.  When they arrived they were 
                    just like you, unable to control 
                    their powers.  Teleporting in your 
                    sleep is just the beginning...  
                    It s like a paranormal wet dream.

                                    STEPHEN
                    So, I ll be able to close my eyes 
                    and beam myself across the world?

                                    RUSSELL
                    Each of our paranormal powers has 
                    limits -- like physical powers -- 
                    but those limits can be stretched.  
                    Don t worry.  By the time we re 
                    done with you...

      RUSSELL TELEPORTS FROM ONE SIDE OF STEPHEN TO THE OTHER.

                                    RUSSELL (CONT D)
                    ULTRA won t be able to lay a hand 
                    on you.

                                    STEPHEN
                          (confused)
                    Sorry... Who s ULTRA?

                                  VOICE  (O.S.)
                    The ones who are hunting us.

      REVEAL CARA, standing nearby. 

                                    RUSSELL
                    Chapter three.

      Off Stephen, unsettled.                                                                                    21.


      INT. DARK CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

      CUT TO STEPHEN, trailing Cara and Russell.

                                  CARA
                    There s a war going on up there. 
                    You won t read about it, or see it 
                    on the news, but it s happening.  A 
                    shadow war between our two species.

                                    RUSSELL
                    The  saps  and the tomorrow people.  
                    They re afraid of us.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Why?

                                    RUSSELL
                          ( duh )
                    Because we re better than them. 


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      CUT TO THE LEAD AGENT (who failed to capture John in the 
      TEASER).  Marched down the hall by a PAIR OF ULTRA AGENTS. 

                                  CARA (V.O.)
                    The government has known about us 
                    for decades.  They don t want 
                    anyone else to know we exist.  And 
                    they want us neutralized.  That s 
                    why they started a containment 
                    program.  ULTRA. 


      INT. ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Lead agent is shoved into a WINDOWLESS OFFICE.  The guards 
      shut the door behind, EXITING.  

                                  CARA (V.O.)
                    Their agents aren t humans, they re 
                    tomorrow people, forced to use 
                    their powers to hunt us down.  

      CLOSE ON lead agent, terrified.  That s when we REVEAL 
      JEDIKIAH.  Seated behind a desk.  All business.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Have a seat.

      Lead agent doesn t want to sit.  He s too anxious.                                                                                    22.


                                  LEAD AGENT
                    I can explain --

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    I said sit.  
                          (then calm)
                    You had John, you lost John, end of 
                    story.  That s not why you re here.

      Jedikiah clicks a REMOTE CONTROL.  

      ANGLE ON MONITOR:  The security guard from the TEASER.  
      FOOTAGE FROM HIS POLICE INTERVIEW.  The guy is freaking out.

                                  SECURITY GUARD (ON MONITOR)
                    I know it sounds nuts, but it was 
                    like he was controlling it with his 
                    mind -- making my gun float like he 
                    had some kinda superpowers --

      Jedikiah CLICKS off the MONITOR.  

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    As you know, our program cannot 
                    tolerate any loose ends.

                                   LEAD AGENT
                          (re: security guard)
                    I ll take care of him...

                                  JEDIKIAH
                          (ominous)
                    Already taken care of. 

      Jedikiah pulls out a GUN, sets it on his desk.  

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    You have a gift.  You, and the rest 
                    of your species, you re superior to 
                    ours in almost every way.  You can 
                    talk without words, travel through 
                    space, and move objects just by 
                    thinking about them... Me?  I have 
                    to do things the old-fashioned way.
                          (picking up gun)
                    I must seem primitive to you. 

      The agent shakes his head.  Eyes fixed on the gun.

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    You re reading my mind now... So 
                    you know what I m going to do.                                                                                    23.


      Jedikiah reaches for gun.  But before he can grab it... LEAD 
      AGENT USES TELEKINESIS TO MAKE THE GUN FLY INTO HIS OWN HAND.  

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    Good.  Now pull the trigger.

      What the hell is Jedikiah doing? 

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    It s a simple matter of Darwinism. 
                    Survival of the fittest.  You re 
                    the superior species?  Prove it.  
                    I m a threat to you.  Kill me.
                          (eerily calm)
                    Do it.  Before I kill you.  You 
                    know I will.

      The agent tries to shoot.

      CLOSE ON HIS FINGER, TREMBLING.  SOMETHING IS STOPPING HIM 
      FROM PULLING THE TRIGGER.  CLOSE ON HIS FACE, SWEATING. 
      SUDDENLY, A DEAFENING ROAR INSIDE HIS HEAD.  HE SCREAMS.

      FINALLY, DROPS THE GUN, COLLAPSES IN THE CHAIR.  Jedikiah 
      stands.  Picks up the gun.  Pats him on the shoulder

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                      A remarkable adaptation -- your 
                    kind s inability to kill.  Maybe it 
                    will help in your species s 
                    survival, but for you personally... 
                    Not so much.

      Jedikiah raises the gun at his head.  AND FIRES.  BLACK-OUT.


      EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Jedikiah emerges to find Damian waiting.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Do we have a name yet?
                          (off his head shake)
                    I want a list of every psych case in 
                    the city who fits the profile.  This 
                    isn t just any break-out if John Young 
                    risked getting caught to find him...  


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

      Stephen is led back to the main room.  John is there.                                                                                    24.


                                    STEPHEN
                    What do you mean, they want us 
                      neutralized?  Like, killed?

                                  CARA
                    All we know is that every one of us 
                    we ve ever lost to them, we ve 
                    never seen again.  We can t feel 
                    them, can t track them, it s like 
                    they never existed.
                          (quick look to John, then)
                    Which is why we need your help.

                                    STEPHEN
                    For what?

      A moment of truth.

                                  JOHN
                    To find someone.  
                          (off Stephen)
                    As you can see, hiding out like 
                    this -- the more of us we find, the 
                    harder it s gonna get.  We need to 
                    find a place where we don t have to 
                    hide from ULTRA anymore.  Well, one 
                    of us went looking for it -- guess 
                    you could call him our leader.  

                                    RUSSELL
                    But he never come back.

                                    STEPHEN
                    ULTRA got him?

                                  CARA
                    We don t know.

                                  JOHN
                          (shaking head)
                    There s no way he was caught.  He 
                    was the strongest of all of us.  
                    The best.  His powers are beyond 
                    what any of us could ever dream of.
                          (beat)
                    If you inherited just a fraction -- 

                                    STEPHEN
                    Inherited -- ? 

      CLOSE ON STEPHEN WHO SUDDENLY GETS IT.  He goes ashen.  No...                                                                                    25.


                                    STEPHEN (CONT D)
                    Wait.  You re telling me my 
                    lunatic, dead-beat dad was... Like 
                    you?  One of the tomorrow people?

                                  CARA
                    He was more than that, Stephen.

      Stephen begins pacing frantically.  His mind has been blown.

                                  JOHN
                    He was a great man.  A hero to us.  
                    You re his son, you ll have the 
                    strongest telepathic link to him.  
                    If anyone can make contact with 
                    him, find him, it s gonna be you.

                                    STEPHEN
                    I don t want to find him.  He 
                    bailed.  He left my mom and two 
                    little kids and a stack of bills 
                    from some faraway psychiatric 
                    hospital.

                                  CARA
                    He bailed so that you could have a 
                    life.  So ULTRA wouldn t find you.  
                    So that you could grow up human.

      This isn t what Stephen wants to hear.  It doesn t sit right, 
      doesn t compute for him.

                                    STEPHEN
                    I don t believe you.

                                  JOHN
                    We have a message for you from him.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    A what?

                                  JOHN
                          (to someone O.S.)
                    Will you pull it up, TIM?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Who are you talking to?  Who the 
                    hell is Tim?

                                  TIM S VOICE 
                    I m a computer.                                                                                      26.


                                    RUSSELL
                    A virtual intelligence program.
                          (off Stephen)
                    He s like our HAL... Just not evil.  

      Suddenly, an IMAGE OF STEPHEN S FATHER APPEARS.  3-D.  
      Stephen stops cold.  Staring at the image of his dad.

                                  STEPHEN S FATHER (PROJECTED)
                    Hello, Stephen.  I m leaving this 
                    with the hope you never have to see 
                    it.  If you are... Then I m sorry.  
                    I don t want you to be like me --

                                    STEPHEN
                    Turn it off... I said TURN IT OFF.

      The IMAGE VANISHES.  Stephen has heard enough.  Trembling. 

                                    STEPHEN (CONT D)
                    I don t need to hear an apology 
                    from him... It s too late.  
                          (then)
                    And you re wrong.  I m not like 
                    him.  I m not one of you.  I m 
                    sorry... You got the wrong guy.  I 
                    have to get outta here.  How do I 
                    get out?

      He s spinning.  John and Cara share a look.  John nods.

                                  CARA
                    Okay.  It s okay, Stephen.  I ll 
                    take you home.

      She reaches out her hand.  And as soon Stephen touches it, 
      THEY TELEPORT OUT OF THE STATION.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    27.


                                      ACT THREE


      INT. STEPHEN S BEDROOM - DAY

      CUT TO STEPHEN WAKING UP IN HIS OWN BED.  He sits upright, 
      then relaxes.  His face says:  Maybe last night -- Cara, 
      John, the subway, the tomorrow people -- was only a dream.  


      INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Brushing his teeth, Stephen knocks his toothbrush off the 
      counter, lunges for it, WHEN IT FLOATS BACK TO HIS HAND. 

      CLOSE ON STEPHEN:   Holy shit!  Did I just do that!? 

      He sets the toothbrush down, tries it again... When Luca 
      ENTERS.  Catches Stephen trying to make his toothbrush fly.  

                                  LUCA
                    Uh... What are you doing? 

                                    STEPHEN
                    Nothing.  Brushing my teeth.


      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      CUT TO STEPHEN.  Making breakfast.  As his mom ENTERS.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Morning.  

                                  MARLA
                          (relieved)
                    I saw your empty bed and thought --

                                    STEPHEN
                    That I went on another one of my 
                    crazy sleepwalks?  Don t worry.  
                          (honest)
                    I ve finally gotten everything 
                    under control.


      INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

      Astrid closes her locker to find STEPHEN WAITING.  She jumps. 

                                  ASTRID
                    Hey, lurker.                                                                                    28.


                                    STEPHEN
                    I have to tell you something -- so 
                    promise you ll be cool. 

      Stephen grabs her elbow as they WALK down the HALLWAY. 

                                  ASTRID
                    Ooo... I love it already.  What is 
                    it?  Wait.  Stephen.  Are you...
                          (mock concerned)
                    ...Gay?  

                                    STEPHEN
                    Way bigger.

                                  ASTRID
                    Aww.  That s too bad.

      Stephen stops.  Fixing Astrid with a sober look.

                                    STEPHEN
                    I need for you to be serious.  


      EXT. SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

      CUT TO ASTRID, reacting to Stephen s news.

                                  ASTRID
                    I thought we were being serious?
                          (off Stephen)
                    You are serious.

                                    STEPHEN
                    I know it sounds crazy...

                                  ASTRID
                    That you re some kind of mutant or 
                    that you have paranormal powers?  

                                    STEPHEN
                    Just hear me out... It all makes 
                    sense.  They said it s some genetic 
                    mutation I inherited from my dad.

                                  ASTRID
                    They?  You mean, the merry band of 
                    runaways living down in the sewers?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Subway tunnels.  That s why you ve 
                    never heard of them -- because they 
                    -- me -- we re being hunted by a 
                    secret government program.                                                                                    29.


      Astrid has heard enough.  It s time for some tough love.

                                  ASTRID
                    Are you off your meds, Stephen?

                                    STEPHEN
                    It has nothing to do with that...

                                  ASTRID
                    You need to talk to your shrink...  
                    What if you re being treated for 
                    the wrong thing?  First the voices, 
                    now the paranoia.  Wasn t your dad 
                      a paranoid schizophrenic?  

      Stephen indicates a nearby football.  Raising his hand.  
      Doing the full-on  superhero using his powers  pose. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    You don t believe me?  Watch this.  
                    I can make the football fly with my 
                    mind.

      HE TRIES TO MOVE IT TELEKINETICALLY... But nothing happens.

                                  ASTRID
                          (scared for him)
                    You need help, Stephen...

                                    STEPHEN
                    Why do you think I came to you?  I 
                    thought I could tell you anything?

                                  ASTRID
                    You can...

                                    STEPHEN
                    What s the use if you don t believe 
                    me?
                          (then)
                    You think that I m insane. I m your 
                    little charity case, aren t I?
                          (off Astrid)
                    Don t pretend... We both know the 
                    only reason we still hang out is so 
                    you can feel good about yourself, 
                    like you re not the last of my 
                    friends to jump ship from my crazy.

      Astrid has heard enough.  She snaps back at Stephen.                                                                                    30.


                                  ASTRID
                    That is bullshit.  I ve stuck by 
                    you and your whole year of crazy 
                    because I care about you.  And just 
                    so you know, everyone didn t leave, 
                    you pushed them away.  Now you re 
                    trying to do it to me.  It s not my 
                    fault.  You re the one who changed.

      Astrid walks off.  Off Stephen, knowing he has changed.


      EXT. SCHOOL - FIELDHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Bummed, Stephen rounds a corner, headed back to school, WHEN 
      HANDS GRAB HIM.  It s DYLAN, the bully who rolled him for his 
      meds.  Pinning Stephen up against a wall.  

                                  DYLAN
                    What the hell did you give me?  
                    Those were Ex-Lax, weren t they?   

      Stephen can t help it.  He stifles a GIGGLE.

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    You think this is funny?

                                    STEPHEN
                    No.  I didn t mean...

                                  DYLAN
                    What s your problem? Are you crazy?

                                    STEPHEN
                    That, or superior.  Can t be sure.

      Dylan thinks Stephen is joking, but he s not.

                                  DYLAN
                    Goddamn weirdo --

      WHAM.  HE PUNCHES STEPHEN.  HE GOES DOWN.  DYLAN KICKS HIM.

                                    STEPHEN
                    HELP -- !

      DYLAN JUMPS ON STEPHEN S BACK, GRABBING HIM BY THE NECK.

                                  DYLAN
                    Shut up, you little bitch.  No one 
                    can hear you.

      DYLAN GRINDS STEPHEN S FACE INTO THE GROUND.  Just when he s 
      about to SMOTHER him... AN INVISIBLE FORCE PULLS HIM OFF.                                                                                      31.


      ANGLE ON DYLAN:  FLOATING OFF OF THE GROUND.  LEGS KICKING.

      Stephen stands, and realizes his powers are working.  
      Narrowing his eyes, STEPHEN SENDS DYLAN FLYING INTO A WALL.  

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    Put me down.  Please.  Help -- !

                                    STEPHEN
                          (parroting Dylan)
                     No one can hear you... 

      ON STEPHEN, seeing red, he charges at Dylan who remains 
      SUSPENDED IN MIDAIR.  Stephen starts to PUNCH HIM.  Pent up 
      rage spilling out.  The fight turns ugly.  Primal.  Stephen 
      grabs Dylan by the throat...

      SUDDENLY, A DEAFENING ROAR INSIDE STEPHEN S HEAD.  Stephen 
      grasps his temples, collapses.  THEN BLACKS OUT.


      INT. OFFICE - DAY

      CUT TO JEDIKIAH.  A KNOCK.  REVEAL DAMIAN.  

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    What do we have so far?

                                  DAMIAN
                    Turns out there are a lotta screwed 
                    up teenagers in New York City. 
                          (opening laptop)
                    We centered our search on the 
                    clinic where the break-out was 
                    treated, five-mile radius.  Over 
                    300 hits in the age-range, but when 
                    you focus on the patients suffering 
                    from auditory hallucinations and 
                      somnambulism -- only seven.

      Jedikiah begins searching through MEDICAL FILES.  A 
      COLLECTION of teenage faces... Including a PHOTO OF STEPHEN.  
      Jedikiah stares at it, covering his surprise. 

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    That s him.

                                  DAMIAN
                    How do you -- ?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                      I recognize the face.                                                                                    32.


                                  DAMIAN
                    You want us to bring him in? 

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    No.  I ll bring this one in myself.


      INT. SCHOOL - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - DAY

      CUT TO STEPHEN.  Outside the office.  He watches through the 
      glass as his mom finishes talking to the PRINCIPAL.  EXITS. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    What did the principal say?  Am I 
                      suspended?

      She s too mad to even look at him.  Starts walking.

                                  MARLA
                    We ll be lucky if they don t press 
                    charges.

                                    STEPHEN
                    For getting into a stupid fight?  
                    He s the one who started it...  

                                  MARLA
                    No, Stephen.  For dealing 
                      prescription drugs.  
                          (off Stephen)
                    They found a bottle of your pills 
                    in the other boy s pocket.  No 
                    wonder you ve been acting... How 
                    long have you been off your meds?  

                                    STEPHEN
                    No.  You don t understand...
                      I didn t... Ask Dylan -- he stole 
                    them from me.

                                    MARLA
                    Dylan is in the ER having his 
                    stomach pumped.
                          (off Stephen)
                    When they found him he was ranting 
                    about how you attacked him with 
                      superpowers -- thanks to the anti-
                      psychotics you gave him.

      Off Stephen, knowing he can t tell his mother the truth.                                                                                    33.


      EXT. SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

      At their CAR, Stephen s mom fumbles with her keys.  Drops 
      them.  She just stares at them on the ground.  Frozen.

                                  MARLA
                    I m sorry, Stephen.  But I just 
                    can t do this again... What I went 
                    through with your father -- his 
                    delusions and his deception -- I 
                    know how it ends.  And I just can t 
                    bear to see you go through it.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    I m sorry.  I didn t mean ---

      He tries to comfort her.  It s not working.  She tears up.

                                  MARLA
                    I thought that if I just found you 
                    the right doctors and medications I 
                    could spare you.  But we just can t 
                    go on like this, honey.  Can t you 
                    see it s breaking our family apart?

      Her PHONE BEEPS.  She checks it.  Shakes her head.

                                  MARLA (CONT D)
                    I have get back to work. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    It s fine.  I can walk home.  
                          (off her hesitation)
                    Mom, it s five blocks... I m sure I 
                    can manage to stay out of trouble.  

      As Stephen s mother gets in the car.  And drives off... RACK 
      FOCUS ON A CAR PARKED IN THE DISTANCE.  


      INT. CAR - DAY

      CUT TO JEDIKIAH, in passenger seat, Damian at the wheel.  
      LONG POV OF STEPHEN, alone and on foot.


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - TRAINING ROOM - DAY

      Cara taking out her frustrations on John -- sparring -- kicks 
      and punches combined with teleporting and telekinesis.

                                  JOHN
                    You shouldn t have let him leave.                                                                                    34.


                                  CARA
                    It was his choice.  Those are the 
                    rules.

                                  JOHN
                    He doesn t get a choice yet.  Not 
                    until he has the whole picture.

      He lays a roundhouse kick on her -- she just barely teleports 
      out of the way.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    You re getting better.

                                  CARA
                    Don t patronize me.

                                  JOHN
                    Learn how to take a compliment.

      She flings out her arm -- a nearby 5 lb weight flies at John.  
      He catches it mid-air.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Wow.  Testy.

                                  CARA
                    We shouldn t have sprung the stuff 
                    about his father on him.  Did you 
                    see his face?  His scars need time.

                                  JOHN
                    He needed to know -- and why are 
                    you so protective of him?

                                  CARA
                      Protective?  Not any more than any 
                    of the others --

                                  JOHN
                    None of the others were allowed to 
                    leave before they got the whole 
                    picture.

      WHAM.  His next kick connects with her.  She stumbles.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Stay focused.

                                  CARA
                          (fuming)
                    Stop distracting me...                                                                                    35.


      But he goes to her, helps her up.  Stays close.  There s a 
      connection there, hard to tell what.  But it s something.

                                  JOHN
                    It s good that you care.  That s 
                    what makes you so good.  But ULTRA 
                    knows we re looking for a new break-
                    out.  If they get to him first, 
                    figure out who he is...

      She sighs.  Knows he s right.

                                  CARA
                    Fine.  I ll bring him back in.


      EXT. STREET - DAY

      CUT TO Stephen walking home as A CAR PULLS UP, STOPS.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Stephen Jameson?

      ANGLE ON JEDIKIAH.  Getting out of the car.  Playing nice.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Who are you?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    You look just like him, you know... 
                    Your father.

      While Stephen is distracted with this, the henchman Damian 
      sneaks around and PULLS A BAG OVER STEPHEN S HEAD.  

      They toss him into the car.  It quickly pulls out, wiping 
      frame, REVEALING -- 

      CARA is right across the street.  She stares at the 
      retreating car in horror.

                                  CARA
                    They got him.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    36.


                                        ACT FOUR


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

      Back in the station, Cara paces frantically before John.

                                  CARA
                    TIM, what do you have?

      An IMAGE comes up on their screen.  It s city-surveillance 
      footage.  Traffic cameras, etc.  The images flash, as --

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    I had the car until Grand and 
                    Essex.  However, traffic cams were 
                    down South of Canal...

                                  CARA
                    Pull whatever SAT images you can 
                    find on the lower island.

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    Already started.   Might take a 
                    minute to composite.

                                  JOHN
                    It s too late.  Stephen s gone. 

                                  CARA
                          (ignoring John)
                    TIM.  We don t have a minute.

      Cara snaps.  John assumes a more gentle tone.

                                  JOHN
                    Look.  Cara.  We lost him.  We 
                    gotta move on.

                                  CARA
                          (shaking head)
                    No, I lost him.  And I can get him 
                    back.

      Cara turns to EXIT, but John grabs her by the arm.

                                  JOHN
                    We don t put ourselves at risk.  We 
                    don t expose ourselves to ULTRA.  
                    Not for anyone.  Those are the 
                    rules.                                                                                    37.


                                  CARA
                    Now you care about the rules?
                          (off John)
                    He s not just anyone.  You said it 
                    yourself.  He s the key to finding 
                    his father.  Meaning that he s our 
                    only chance for survival.

                                    RUSSELL (O.C.)
                    She s right.

      Russell has entered.  He locks eyes with John.

                                    RUSSELL (CONT D)
                    Look.  I know you dig this whole 
                          leader-of-the-ragtag-rebels thing 
                    you got going, but for the rest of 
                    us, living like this, always on the 
                    run?  Gets just a tad tedious. 
                          (to Cara, telepathically)
                    Plus, my sister thinks he s hot.

                                  CARA
                          (hiding her anger)
                    Russell, I swear to god...

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    I found the car.

      They all stop. 

                                  TIM S VOICE (CONT D)
                    Sorry to interrupt... Do you want 
                    to know where he is?

                          JOHNCARA/RUSSELL
      No.Yes.

      A BEAT as John stares at them.  Frustrated.

                                  JOHN
                    You want to walk straight into 
                    Jedikiah Price s office?  Be my 
                    guest.  But I ve spent nine years 
                    dodging that sadistic son of a 
                    bitch.  No one is worth getting 
                    caught by him again.
                          (pointed, to Cara)
                    No one.

      Pissed, he walks out.  A beat as Cara lets the sting settle, 
      then she looks to her brother.  Calls out to TIM.                                                                                    38.


                                  CARA
                    Tell me.


      INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

      ANGLE ON STEPHEN AS THE BAG IS PULLED OFF HIS HEAD.  POV:  
      His eyes adjust.  Jedikiah s face comes into slow focus.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Sorry... Security precaution.

      REVEAL STEPHEN sitting in something resembling a DENTIST S 
      CHAIR.  BINDINGS on the armrests.  STEPHEN IS STRAPPED IN.

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    My name is Dr. Price.

                                    STEPHEN
                    You re one of them?  ULTRA?  Is 
                    that where I am? 

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    I can only imagine what John had to 
                    say... That s why you re here... To 
                    get my side of the story.  

                                    STEPHEN
                          (pissed yet scared)
                    By tossing a bag over my head?  
                      Kidnapping me?  You pretty much 
                    proved everything I heard.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                          (nodding, pleasant)
                    That I m some bogeyman?  
                      Systematically rounding up your 
                    kind and wiping you out.  Did John 
                    tell you why I m doing it?  Or was 
                    it just to be evil?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Because you re scared of us.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    I m an evolutionary biologist.  If 
                    anything, I m fascinated by you.  
                          (off Stephen)
                    What scares me is how the rest of 
                    the world would react -- if they 
                    knew a secret, paranormal species 
                    was living in our midst.  Think of 
                    the pandemonium... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    39.

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT'D)
                    The human race would cannibalize 
                    itself -- out of fear and paranoia -
                    - we d wipe ourselves out before 
                    your kind ever had the chance to do 
                    it for us.

                                    STEPHEN
                    But they don t want to be found out 
                    -- the tomorrow people -- they just 
                    want to be left alone...

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    And you think all tomorrow people 
                    take their orders from John?  Last 
                    I checked he had what, a dozen of 
                    you?  Do you know how many more 
                    there are out there who we can t 
                    find, can t catch?  Do you think 
                    all of them will choose to stay 
                    hidden?  That all of them will use 
                    their powers for the good of man?  
                    Because I have plenty of evidence 
                    that says otherwise.
                          (then)
                    I m not the bad guy, Stephen.  Not 
                    by a long shot.

      Off Stephen, stumped.


      INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

      ANGLE ON Cara and Russell ENTERING.  Looking badass.  They 
      approach a CHECKPOINT and THREE GUARDS.  Guard #1 steps out 
      to block them.  Suspicious.

                                  GUARD
                    I m gonna need to see your -- 

      IN A FLASH, Russell lifts his hand, SENDING A TELEKINETIC 
      SHOCK-WAVE WHICH SWEEPS THE GUARD ACROSS THE ROOM, INTO A 
      WALL.  CRUNCH.  Meanwhile, guard #2 DRAWS HIS GUN. 

                                  GUARD #2
                    Freeze -- !  

      BUT CARA HAS ALREADY DISAPPEARED.  TELEPORTING.  SHE 
      REAPPEARS behind guard #2 who spots her out the corner of his 
      eye.  Too late.  Cara GRABS THE GUN, CLOCKS him with it. 

                                    RUSSELL
                    You ve been practicing.                                                                                    40.


                                  CARA
                    Shut up.

      ANGLE ON GUARD #3, doing the sensible thing... RUNS.

                                    RUSSELL
                    I got him.

      RUSSELL TELEPORTS INTO HIS PATH.  Guard #3 skids to a stop.  
      Cowering.  Starts to reach for his gun.  As Cara walks up 
      behind him.  Whispering in the guard s ear.

                                  CARA
                    Just... Don t.   

      The guard raises his hands.  Surrendering.  Smart move.

                                  CARA (CONT D)
                    Which floor are you holding him?

                                  GUARD #3
                    I don t know...

      CLOSE ON CARA, reading the guard s mind.  VOICE:  Fourteen. 

                                  CARA
                    He s on fourteen.
                          (smiling, to guard)
                    Thanks for the help...

      AS CARA PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE.  BLACK-OUT.


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

      John kicks the shit out of a punching bag in the otherwise 
      empty training room.  He stops, sweating.  Calls out --

                                  JOHN
                    Did they get in, TIM?

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    Do you care?

                                  JOHN
                    You re giving me attitude?  You re 
                      a computer.

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    It was a logical question borne 
                    from simple observation.  You said 
                    you did not care, but your heart 
                    rate indicated otherwise.                                                                                     41.


                                  JOHN
                    They re going to get themselves 
                    killed.

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    Causing me to repeat my question: 
                    Do you care?

      Off John, his survival instincts fighting his emotions...


      INT. LABORATORY - DAY

      BACK UPSTAIRS WITH STEPHEN AND JEDIKIAH.  Damian ENTERS 
      carrying a medical tray with a SYRINGE.  Stephen fixes on the 
      needle.  A look of horror.

                                    STEPHEN
                    What are you doing?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    No one s going to hurt you.  

      Jedikiah begins PREPARING A SYRINGE.  Drawing from a vial.

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    Actually, it might hurt a little.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    What is it?  

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    I could give you a boring lecture 
                    about recombinant DNA therapy... 
                    But the short answer is this:  It s 
                    phase one of a clinical trial.  My 
                    hope is, in time, it will fix you.  
                    Repair your genetic code.  Return 
                    you to the way you used to be.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Let me go... There s nothing wrong 
                    with me...

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    You re so much like your father.  
                    So much promise... So much 
                      potential... But you don t want to 
                    end up like him, do you?

                                    STEPHEN
                    What does that mean?                                                                                      42.


                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Look.  Whatever myth John tried to 
                    spin for you about who your father 
                    was... It s not true.

                                    STEPHEN
                    And I should believe you -- ?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Your father s not gonna come back 
                    to save you or the tomorrow people.
                            (matter-of-fact)
                    He s dead.

      Jedikiah goes to give Stephen, speechless, the shot... But 
      just then, Damian BURSTS IN. 

                                  DAMIAN
                    There s a breach in the lobby.

      Jedikiah puts down the needle.  Pulls up a SECURITY SCREEN ON 
      A NEARBY BANK OF COMPUTER MONITORS.  CLOSE ON MONITOR: 
      SECURITY ANGLE ON THE LOBBY, THE THREE UNCONSCIOUS GUARDS.

      Jedikiah clouds, PULLS UP A SECOND SECURITY ANGLE.  CLOSE ON 
      MONITOR: CARA AND RUSSELL riding up the elevator. 

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    They must think you re pretty 
                    special.

                                  DAMIAN
                    Want me to stop the elevator?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Let them come.  

      Jedikiah RETRIEVES HIS GUN.  Cocks it.  EXITS with Damian.   

      Off Stephen, strapped in the chair, staring at the SECURITY 
      MONITORS.  Knowing his FRIENDS ARE HEADED INTO A TRAP.


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      CARA AND RUSSELL step off the elevator as an ULTRA AGENT 
      APPEARS.  Russell raises a hand (like he did in the lobby) 
      only this time nothing happens, no telekinesis.

      The agent swings at Russell... That s when CARA GRABS HIS 
      ARM, twists it, KICKS HIM once, twice, sends the guy tumbling 
      onto the floor, down for the count.                                                                                    43.


                                    RUSSELL
                    Our powers don t work up here. 

                                  CARA
                    Then neither do theirs.

      Off Cara, undaunted, leading the charge to rescue Stephen.


      INT. LABORATORY - INTERCUT

      BACK WITH STEPHEN, strapped in chair.  Watching.  Helpless.

      ON MONITOR:  CARA AND RUSSELL RUN DOWN A HALL.

      ON SECOND MONITOR:  FOUR AGENTS, MOVING TO INTERCEPT THEM.

      BACK IN THE HALLWAY:  AS CARA AND RUSSELL RUN HEADLONG INTO 
      THE FOUR ULTRA AGENTS.  RUSSELL TAKES THE FIRST ONE OUT, 
      soon, he s swarmed by the other three.  HE TAKES A PUNCH.  

      CARA JOINS THE FIGHT, TAKES OUT AN AGENT, then another one.  
      But when she turns another AGENT BLIND-SIDES HER WITH A 
      PUNCH.  Sends her down hard.  Momentarily dazed.

      The agent who hit her, turns, coming face to face with JOHN, 
      who CLOCKS HIM with a vicious punch, knocking him out. 

      He shoots a look to Cara, who smiles through the throbbing 
      pain in her face.

                                  CARA
                    Nice shot.

                                  JOHN
                    Don t patronize me.

      But he gives her a sexy grin as he helps Russell to his feet.

                                    RUSSELL
                    I m good.  Let s go...

      BACK WITH STEPHEN.  WATCHING THE MONITORS.  His friends don t 
      know what s waiting for them... PULL BACK to show A DOZEN 
      SECURITY ANGLES: ULTRA AGENTS SWARMING FROM EVERY DIRECTION.

      Stephen closes his eyes.  Tries to reach Cara telepathically.

                                    STEPHEN
                    YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.  
                    PLEASE... CARA...

      But it s no use.  CUT TO CARA:  She can t hear Stephen.  She, 
      John, and Russell, continue straight into the trap.                                                                                      44.


      BACK WITH STEPHEN:  Pulling on his restraints.  About to rip 
      his hands off... But it would take a blowtorch to break free.

      WHEN SUDDENLY STEPHEN DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
      OF THE ROOM.  CLOSE ON STEPHEN:   I just teleported...  


      INT. HALLWAY - INTERCUT

      With John, Cara, and Russell.  A GROUP OF ULTRA AGENTS appear 
      at the FAR END OF THE HALL.  Too many to take on.

      But when our trio turn around, they spot a SECOND GROUP OF 
      AGENTS behind them.  Meanwhile, an ALARM SOUNDS.  This rescue 
      mission is going seriously sideways.

                                    RUSSELL
                      Building s in lock-down.  What now?

      For once John doesn t have an answer.  As the two SETS OF 
      ULTRA GUARDS close on them from OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

      Suddenly --

                                    STEPHEN (O.S.)
                    This way.

      Our trio turn to find Stephen.  He has appeared out of one of 
      the locked doors.  Offering them an escape route.

                                  CARA
                    How did you escape -- ?

                                    STEPHEN
                      I teleported.

                                    RUSSELL
                    Our powers don t work here...

                                    STEPHEN
                    Just follow me.


      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Stephen leads the tomorrow people to an ELEVATOR.  ULTRA 
      AGENTS on their heels.  Running.  It s gonna be tight.

                                    STEPHEN
                          (re: elevator)
                    Come on...

      On cue, BING, the elevator arrives.  They re gonna make it!                                                                                    45.


      But when the doors open, JEDIKIAH STEPS OUT OF THE ELEVATOR.  
      Flanked by more AGENTS.  Holding a gun.  Game over.  Jedikiah 
      locks on John... His white whale.  

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    After all this time, you decided to 
                    come back.  For him... 
                          (re: Stephen)
                    You thought he was going to help 
                    you find to your promised land 
                    didn t you?  Doesn t exist, John.

      Jedikiah raises the gun.  Aiming it at John.  John stares 
      back at Jedikiah.  Defiant, knowing it s over. 

                                  JEDIKIAH (CONT D)
                    And even if it did.  You re never 
                    gonna see it --

      JEDIKIAH PULLS THE TRIGGER, Stephen leaps forward to stop 
      him.  Too late.

                                    STEPHEN
                    NO -- !

      BOOM, JEDIKIAH FIRES. AS TIME STARTS TO MOVE IN SLOW-MOTION.

      THEN EVERYTHING STOPS COMPLETELY... Jedikiah, the bullet, the 
      clock.  It s like the world is paused.  Everything except --

      THE FOUR TOMORROW PEOPLE.  ANGLE ON JOHN who stares at the 
      BULLET suspended in mid-air, inches away from him.

      ANGLE ON STEPHEN, hand extended.  That s when we realize 
      STEPHEN IS CAUSING TIME TO STOP! 

                                  CARA
                    How are you doing that?

                                    RUSSELL
                    I thought you said our powers 
                    didn t work -- ?

                                    STEPHEN
                          (urgent)
                    Move.

      AS SLOWLY, TIME RAMPS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED.

      OUR GUYS DASH ONTO THE ELEVATOR.  TIME RETURNS TO FULL-SPEED.  
      The bullet continues its course.  Missing John completely.  

      Jedikiah looks around.  Bewildered.  Where did he go?                                                                                    46.


                                  JOHN
                    You missed.

      AS JOHN COLDCOCKS JEDIKIAH.  The elevator closes.  Off our 
      gang, escaping.  Thanks to Stephen... And his new powers.  


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    47.


                                        ACT FIVE


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Russell is pumped as he tags along behind Stephen. 

                                    RUSSELL
                    That was killer... And we thought 
                    there were just  Three T s.   How 
                    did you do that?  More importantly, 
                    what do we call it?

                                    STEPHEN
                    I have no idea... It was kind of an 
                    accident.  

                                    RUSSELL
                    Okay.  Your training starts today.  
                    I mean, what else can you do -- 
                    other than stopping time?  

                                    STEPHEN
                    There s something I gotta do first.


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER

      Stephen ENTERS the empty space.  Calling out.  Tentative.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Uh, whatever your name is, TIM?  

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    Hello, Stephen.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    I can t believe I m talking to --
                          (then aloud)
                    Look.  I need a favor.

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    You d like to see the rest of the 
                    message your father left you?

                                    STEPHEN
                    How did you -- ?

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    People are predictable... Even ones 
                    like you.

      And with that, TIM pulls up the IMAGE OF STEPHEN S FATHER.  A 
      virtual projection of the man Stephen only faintly remembers.                                                                                    48.


                                  STEPHEN S FATHER (PROJECTED)
                    I thought maybe you d be lucky and 
                    take after your mom... Guess I was 
                    wrong.  You must really hate me... 
                    If it s any comfort I ve hated me 
                    too, every moment I ve been gone. 
                    Funny, I imagine I m talking to you 
                    as a kid, but you must be grown by 
                    now.  I wish I was there to see 
                    you.  I m sure I d be proud... Of 
                    all you ve done to take care of 
                    your mom and your brother.

      CLOSE ON STEPHEN.  He can t help it.  He starts to tear up.

                                  STEPHEN S FATHER (PROJECTED) (CONT D)
                    But if you re listening to this, it 
                    means you re like me.  My only hope 
                    is that one day the powers you 
                    inherited outweigh the burden.  I 
                    love you, Stephen... I m sorry I 
                    can t tell you that in person. 

      Dad disappears.  Stephen wipes his eyes.  Feigning toughness.

                                    STEPHEN
                    So... Supercomputer.  What do you 
                    think?  Is he still alive?

                                  TIM S VOICE
                    There are limits, Stephen... Even 
                    to my intelligence.

      Off Stephen, that s what he thought.


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER

      A PRIVATE CORNER.  Cara and John, a private BEAT.

                                  JOHN
                    Okay, so you were right.  He s 
                    clearly -- whatever -- special.   
                    But can he find his dad?

                                  CARA
                    You saw what he did -- when none of 
                    us could use any of our powers -- 
                    what if one day Stephen can lead us 
                    there himself?

                                  JOHN
                    I get it, he s Moses.  You re 
                    giving me a complex.                                                                                    49.


                                  CARA
                    Don t be jealous.

                                  JOHN
                    I m not jealous... 
                          (beat, playful)
                    Why?  Should I be jealous?

      He gives her a sexy smile.  Self-deprecating.  She touches 
      his face, gentle.  Intimate.  Familiar.

                                  CARA
                    Thanks for coming to help us.

                                  JOHN
                    I didn t mean what I said.  I was 
                    being a dick.

                                  CARA
                    I know.

                                  JOHN
                    I d never let you get hurt --

                                  CARA
                    I know.

      He KISSES her.  It s sweet at first, then grows heated.  RACK 
      FOCUS to Stephen in the BACKGROUND.  Crushed.  He turns, 
      EXITS before they spot him.  But Cara catches him out of the 
      corner of her eye.  Pulls away from John.

                                  CARA (CONT D)
                    I ll be right back.


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER

      Cara catches up with Stephen.

                                  CARA
                    Hold up. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    I didn t mean to interrupt... 

                                  CARA
                    I should have told you.

                                    STEPHEN
                      Seriously, Cara... So you and John 
                    are -- whatever -- together.  I 
                    should have figured it out sooner.  
                    No big deal.                                                                                      50.


      She pulls him to a stop, locks eyes. Connects telepathically.

                                  CARA
                    I m sorry if I hurt you.

                                    STEPHEN
                    WILL YOU STOP THAT?  I ve got 
                    enough going on in my head without 
                    you adding to the confusion... Can 
                    we just give the whole telepathy 
                    thing a rest?

                                  CARA
                    Yeah, of course --

      He can see he s hurt her feelings, but he just wants out.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Can you ask your boyfriend to give 
                    me a lift out?  I need to get home.

                                  CARA
                    You can t, Stephen -- not with 
                    ULTRA looking for you.

                                    STEPHEN
                    I need to go home, Cara.

      His tone makes it clear there s no fighting him.  She nods.


      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Stephen and John APPEAR outside Stephen s APARTMENT.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Thanks.

                                  JOHN
                    Want me to stick around?

                                    STEPHEN
                    For when I come home six hours 
                    late?  Trust me.  You don t want 
                    any part of this...

      Stephen heads for the door.  

                                  JOHN
                    Hey.  Just for the record... I 
                    haven t forgotten about how you 
                    saved my life today, so...                                                                                    51.


                                    STEPHEN
                          ( get over it )
                    You re welcome.

                                  JOHN
                    Look, I know it s messed up.  But 
                    this is who we are.  We re 
                      different, and we re not gonna 
                    apologize for it, you know?  If we 
                    stick together, we have a shot...

                                    STEPHEN
                    I know what you want from me, John.  
                    I just need time to think about it, 
                    all right?

      John nods.  He s not gonna press any further.  For now.


      INT. STEPHEN S APARTMENT - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Stephen goes to slip his key in the door when it suddenly 
      FLIES OPEN.  REVEAL Stephen s mother Marla.  Anxious.

                                  MARLA
                    Where have you been -- ?

                                    STEPHEN
                          (bracing himself)
                    Look.  I know I said I was coming 
                    straight home after school-- 

                                  MARLA
                    Later.  We have a visitor. 


      INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Stephen ENTERS.  Finds JEDIKIAH.  

                                  MARLA
                    This is your dad s brother, 
                      Jedikiah... Your uncle.

                                    STEPHEN
                    My what?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Hi, Stephen.  Call me Jed.

      Off Jedikiah, smiling.  And Stephen, staggered.


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    52.


                                        ACT SIX


      INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      RESUME Stephen in the doorway.  Frozen.  As Jedikiah beams.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    I know.  It s weird.  We met once -- 
                    you were in diapers.  

      Stephen looks to his mom.  Is this true? 

                                  MARLA
                    Jed and your dad had a falling out 
                    before your brother was born.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Sorry to drop in like this.  I told 
                    your mom, I ve had quite a time 
                    tracking you guys down.

      Stephen snaps to attention.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Mom, could you give us a minute?

      Marla nods, EXITS.  As soon as she is gone, Stephen freaks.

                                    STEPHEN (CONT D)
                    What are you doing here?  What did 
                    you tell her?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    I told her the truth.

                                    STEPHEN
                    No.  No way it s true.

      Jedikiah pulls out an old PHOTO.  ANGLE ON PHOTO:  Two school-
      age boys, grinning, arms wrapped around each other.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Me and your dad.  Recognize him?  
                    We look like twins, don t we?  Only 
                    I was born human and he was born 
                    like you.  The reason I became a 
                    scientist was so I could understand 
                    him... Maybe one day help him.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Like you tried to help me?  Is that 
                    why you re here -- to try to stick 
                    another needle into my arm?                                                                                    53.


                                  JEDIKIAH
                          (point-blank)
                    I d like for you to come work for 
                    me, Stephen.

                                    STEPHEN
                          (long beat)
                    You re joking?   

                                  JEDIKIAH
                      I underestimated you.  Clearly.  
                    We ve only glimpsed what you re 
                    capable of... But if you let me 
                    hone your abilities, you d be quite 
                    an asset to ULTRA.

                                    STEPHEN
                    ULTRA hunts down people like me.  
                    Why would I help them?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                          (motioning to next room)
                    Simple.  For them... Your family.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    Are you threatening -- ?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    No, you re threatening them -- if 
                    you don t help contain the spread 
                    of your species.  I m offering you 
                    the chance to protect the ones you 
                    love, Stephen....

                                    STEPHEN
                    The chance to be a traitor?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    A traitor to who?  A bunch of rebel 
                    runaways you met two days ago, or 
                    to your mom?  Your brother, your 
                    friend -- Astrid, is it?
                          (off Stephen s surprise)
                    Therapy records... Very 
                      illuminating. 
                          (then)
                    Sooner or later, you re gonna have 
                    to choose a side.

      Just then, Stephen s brother ENTERS.  Feigned nonchalance...

                                  LUCA
                    So, we ve got an uncle Jedikiah...
                    How random is that?                                                                                    54.


      He holds out his hand to shake.  Jedikiah takes it.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    You must be Luca. I hear you got 
                    your dad s athletic genes...

                                  LUCA
                    Hope that s all I got.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Yeah, let s hope.

      Off Stephen, his mind whirling with anxiety.


      INT. STEPHEN S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON STEPHEN ASLEEP.  A rustling noise.  The silhouette 
      of someone in his room, outlined by his window.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Cara?

      The light flips on.  REVEAL Astrid.  As she shuts the window 
      behind her.  She s climbed through his window.

                                  ASTRID
                    Who s Cara?

                                    STEPHEN
                    No one.  

                                  ASTRID
                    One of your new friends?  Whatever 
                    you called them, the tomorrow -- 

                                    STEPHEN
                    About that... You were right.  I 
                    was off my meds.  I must have 
                    sounded like a real crazy person 
                    before... I m okay now. 

                                  ASTRID
                    You sure?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Positive.

                                  ASTRID
                    Good.  Move over.

      Astrid hops in bed with him.                                                                                    55.


                                    STEPHEN
                    What are you-- ?

                                  ASTRID
                    I m making sure you don t 
                      sleepwalk.  Why?  Is that weird?

                                    STEPHEN
                    No... No, it s cool.  Thanks.

      Astrid snuggles down beside him.  Their faces are close as 
      they stare at each other.  Comfortable.  A long history. 

                                  ASTRID
                    I m not gonna jump ship on you, 
                    Stephen.  But you re not allowed to 
                    jump ship on me either, okay?

      He smiles, nods.  Enjoying laying there with his friend. 

                                  ASTRID (CONT D)
                            (telepathically)
                    I wish you would just kiss me, 
                    already.

                                    STEPHEN
                          (startled)
                    What?

                                  ASTRID
                          (more startled)
                    What, what?  I didn t say anything.
                          (suddenly worried)
                    Why?

      Stephen realizes he read her mind.

                                    STEPHEN
                    No.  I... 
                          (playing it off)
                    Guess I m just hearing voices.

                                  ASTRID
                    Not funny.

                                    STEPHEN
                    A little funny?

      Astrid closes her eyes.  Off Stephen, wide-awake.


      INT. STEPHEN S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

      MATCH CUT to Stephen s face.  Sound asleep.                                                                                    56.


                                  VOICE (V.O.)
                    Stephen?

      He opens his eyes to Astrid but finds she s asleep.  Huh? 

      REVEAL CARA.  She has TELEPORTED TO HIS BEDROOM.  Cara 
      WHISPERS in Stephen s other ear -- to not wake up Astrid.

                                  CARA
                          (re: Astrid)
                    She s cute... 

                                    STEPHEN
                            (whispering, defensive)
                    She s... a friend.

                                  CARA
                    Mind if we talk somewhere else?

      Cara reaches out, takes Stephen s arm.  THEY DISAPPEAR. 


      EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

      REAPPEARING on top of the apartment building.  Manhattan 
      sparkles in the distance.  It s peaceful, romantic.

                                    STEPHEN
                    What are you -- ?

                                  CARA
                    You don t want to talk to me 
                      telepathically -- fine -- then we 
                    have to do it like this.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Why didn t you tell me that he -- 
                    Jedikiah -- was my uncle?

      She looks surprised that he knows, but recovers quickly.

                                  CARA
                    He s not your family.  Technically, 
                    you re related, but you re not like 
                    him.  You re one of us --

      But Stephen cuts her off.  Blurting out.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    He wants me to come work for him.

                                  CARA
                          (panicked)
                    What?  You wouldn t do that.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                                  CARA (CONT'D)
                    Can t you see, Stephen?  He only 
                    wants to use you --

                                    STEPHEN
                    Yeah?  Well, so do you.
                          (off Cara)
                    You say you re fighting some 
                     shadow war,  but what are you 
                    fighting for?  I mean, what s the 
                    worst that will happen if we all 
                    turn ourselves in and give up our 
                    powers and live like normal human 
                    beings?  What if Jedikiah s right?  
                    What if it makes the world safer?

                                  CARA
                    You want to admit that we re 
                    mistakes, freaks of nature who need 
                    to be  cured?  
                          (shaking head)
                    Nature doesn t make mistakes.  Yet 
                    Jedikiah will stop at nothing -- 
                    turning evolution on its head -- 
                    driving us extinct -- just to 
                    preserve the human race.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Which -- I m sorry, Cara -- I still 
                    consider myself a part of.

                                  CARA
                    Of course you do.  But to them... 
                    We re not. 
                          (off Stephen)
                    The tomorrow people -- the ones 
                    we ve found and the ones we re 
                    going to find, they re my family.  
                    I won t let anything happen to 
                    them.  And I won t let anything 
                    happen to you.  Come with me, 
                    Stephen.  Please.

      She reaches out her hand.  He looks at it, struggling with 
      his choice.

                                    STEPHEN
                    When you first started talking to 
                    me, the mysterious voice in my 
                    head, I trusted you.  I don t know 
                    why, I just did.  But now I need 
                    you to trust me. 
                          (meeting her gaze)
                    I m gonna find out what happened to 
                    my dad, Cara.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    58.

                                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                    I m gonna make my choice -- I m 
                    gonna pick a side.  And if you 
                    trust me in this, then I ll never 
                    let anything happen to you, either.  
                    Okay?

      A long beat, then Cara finally nods.  Okay.


      INT. STEPHEN S BEDROOM - MORNING

      Astrid opens her eyes.  Bolts awake.  Stephen is gone.  In 
      his place, a NOTE:   Had to duck out.  Don t worry.  Xo S. 


      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER

      John finds Cara awake.  Clothed.  She s been up all night.

                                  JOHN
                    What happened?  Where is he?

                                  CARA
                    Stephen made his decision.


      INT. OFFICE - HALLWAY - MORNING

      CUT TO STEPHEN stepping off an ELEVATOR.  The same elevator 
      he used to escape ULTRA.  Now he s walking right back in.


      INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Stephen ENTERS Jedikiah s office.  Finds him at his desk.

                                    STEPHEN
                    I m in.
