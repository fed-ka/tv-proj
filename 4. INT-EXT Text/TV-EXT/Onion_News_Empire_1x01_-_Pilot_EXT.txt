      The front facade of a modern, metal building. Large monitors 
      show a live feed of Onion News Network. 

      SCOTT WEST (20s, handsome but a little nerdy, eager) stands 
      stock still on the New York sidewalk, staring at the monitor.  
      He takes a deep breath, and adjusts his tie. He s nervous. 

                                  SCOTT WEST
                          (to himself:)
                    OK. OK. 

      As he walks into the building, we tilt up to see it is a 
      massive skyscraper. We fly up to the top, and end on a 
      massive ONN logo with the New York skyline behind. 



      11-year-old COURTNEY CARTER is playing in the park. An ONN 
      van with a big logo pulls up, two guys hop out, grab 
      Courtney, and throw her in the van. 

                                                                            BACK TO:                                                                                      4.



                                  WEST
                    ...three Eagle Scouts and seventeen 
                      tenderfoots tripped and fell into 
                    the open well as you can see here. 

      Computer animation: Boy scouts marching in single file. The 
      first one falls into the well, followed by the second, etc.

                                                                            BACK TO:

                                    JILLIAN
                    That was you? That story went 
                    national.                                                                                       6.


                                  WEST
                          (noticing her, attracted:)
                    Hi. I mean, yes. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Well, you re gonna have to do 
                    better than a couple dozen dead 
                    boyscouts if you wanna make it 
                    here.  Jillian, show him his desk.

                                    JILLIAN
                    I would but -- 

                                  MUSGROVE
                          (coughs pathetically)
                    Sorry, my one lung is weak today.

      Jillian relents, nods. Musgrove starts to walk away. 

                                  MUSGROVE (CONT D)
                    Thanks. Kid, be nice to Jillian.  
                    She s the glue in our weird sad 
                    collage around here. Plus, maybe 
                    you ll have a romantic connection -- 
                    just keep in mind any children you 
                    two may have will be property of 
                    the network. They ll work in the 
                    baby news division. 

                                                                      CUT AWAY TO:



      West looks around as CAMERAMAN unloads gear from an ONN van. 

                                  WEST
                    The old man is supposed to meet us 
                    here. Let s get this over with.

      A couple kids run by screaming. A fisherman sits shaking, his 
      eyes open wide. West approaches him. 

                                  WEST (CONT D)
                    Excuse me, sir? I m looking for a 
                    very old fisherman -- Kip O Rourke?

      Before he can respond, ancient O'Rourke comes sprinting down 
      the dock toward West.

                                  O'ROURKE
                          (rapidly)
                    Oh wow! That s me! I m him! I m 
                    O Rourke! I m a man, I m a happy 
                    man! I m as happy as a snail all 
                    curled up in his tiny shell! I feel 
                    like I m sweating but I m not!



      O Rourke chatters away, walking very fast down the long pier 
      to his fishing spot. West and the Camera Man chase after him, 
      filming the  interview. 

                                  O'ROURKE
                    ...the time I caught a fifty 
                    pounder in the Gulf of Mexico back 
                    in  74 is anyone else s heart 
                    racing? 

      West looks around: a frog jumps out of the water over and 
      over again, hitting himself against the peer. He frowns, 
      trying to figure out what is going on. 

      West takes a few steps away and looks out at the rest of the 
      river. The animal behavior is getting crazier: an otter is 
      hitting his head with a clam; a duck jumps onto the pier and 
      honks. West jumps in surprise.  

      West peers through binoculars, scanning the shores.  He spots 
      a factory with a huge pipe pumping yellow liquid into the 
      water. West sees a  Bulls Milk Energy Drink  logo on the 
      building.                                                                                    14.


                                  WEST
                    Bull s Milk Energy Drink. 
                          (excited:)
                    Blingo.  


      ACT 2



      Musgrove stares at monitor playing a live feed of ONN.

                                    DAYTIME ANCHOR (ON MONITOR)
                    Late in the hour, could dinosaurs 
                    still be alive on a remote island? 
                    We ll show you lots of pictures of 
                      dinosaurs, and explain why it s not 
                    likely.                                                                                     17.


                                  MUSGROVE
                    Going live to New Jersey in 10. You 
                    ready Scott?  

                                  WEST
                          (nervous:)
                    Yes sir, good to go, 10-4, I m 
                    aces. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Take a breath kid. 

      Push in on a control room monitor where we see the broadcast:

                                    DAYTIME ANCHOR (ON MONITOR)
                    But first: What would you do if you 
                    were 100 years old but still not 
                    dead? Scott West has the story...

      West stands in front of the plant, O'Rourke does push ups 
      vigorously behind him. 

                                  WEST
                    Thanks Alicia. What keeps a man of 
                    100 from settling into retirement? 
                    How about 60 million gallons of 
                    taurine being poured into his water 
                    supply? 

      Footage of the pipe dumping Bull s Milk. Animals being crazy. 

                                  WEST (CONT D)
                    A massive corporate scandal is 
                    unfolding here in New Jersey, where 
                    a Bull s Milk plant has been 
                    dumping thousands of excess gallons 
                    of energy drink into the river. You 
                    can see the disturbing effects for 
                    yourself. 

      INTERVIEW: OLD LADY is sitting next to a O Rourke doing a 
      crazy dance. 
                    OLD LADY*O ROURKE*
      My husband just started I feel good! I feel good! 
      dancing one day, and now he Gotta love it! 
      can t stop. He s lost his 
      job. 



      Scott walks up the building. The Graphics Guy we met earlier 
      walks by him and waves. 

                                  GRAPHICS GUY
                    Hey kid, your story s all over the 
                    place! 

      He points to a wall of TVs in front of him, where many 
      different channels are all covering the story. 

                                  GRAPHICS GUY (CONT D)
                    That was pretty ballsy. 

                                  WEST
                          (proud:)
                    What can I say, I have huge huge 
                    balls. 

      The graphics guy looks a little weirded out. West walks into 
      the building. 



      Three kids run by screaming. 

                                  KID 
                    I can t feel my face!!!!                                                                                    26.



      Abigail and Courtney stand outside an ONN van in a weird 
      alley. Abigail has a big contract in her hand.   

                                    ABIGAIL
                    ... you agree to tell the police 
                    that you were taken by an African-
                    American or a Latino - your choice. 
                    And that s it, you can be  found.  

                                  COURTNEY
                    I want all the royalties from any 
                    book or movie deals I make relating 
                    to this  kidnapping .

                                    ABIGAIL
                            (impressed:)
                    Fine, we can make that happen.

      Courtney nods, and signs the contract.                                                                                     27.


                                    ABIGAIL (CONT D)
                    You did good today, Courtney. I 
                    think you might have the lack of 
                    morals you need to make it in the 
                    news business. When you get a 
                    little older, you should come back 
                    and intern for us. 

                                  COURTNEY
                    Be an intern? You think I m fucking 
                    stupid? 

      Courtney runs off. Abigail smiles after her.
