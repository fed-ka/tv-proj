      We are high over the city - looking down.  And what we're 
      about to hear, is unfolding somewhere in that unknowable 
      tangle of lights below.  OVER PICTURE, a 911 dispatcher 
      fields a call from an eerily calm man.  His voice is hard to 
      make out, so the conversation is subtitled--

                                  DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                    911, what s your emergency?

                                  MAN (V.O.)
                    Woodrow s Drugstore.  They re some 
                    people shot up in there.

                                  DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                    How many people, sir?

                                  MAN (V.O.)
                    I don t know.

                                  DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                    Did you witness the shooting?
                          (long beat)
                    Sir, did you see the..?

                                  MAN
                    I didn t see BLEEEEP!

      CLICK - the man hangs up, and we-

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                      3.



    A PHOTO OF A BABY, still in the womb.  And just when we re 
      thinking this is some kind of forensic nightmare related to 
      that 911 call, we hear-- 

                                  MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    That s him!  The king.  Heir to the 
                    throne, comin at you in 3-D, baby! 


      Police out front.  Over picture, we hear a man VOMITING-  

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Longford and Majan walk across the grass toward a cluster of 
      police lights.  The grand BELLE ISLE CASINO ROTUNDA rises, 
      lit up in the B.G.  The Detroit skyline visible across the 
      river as Longford reflects soulfully for us-

                                  LONGFORD
                    You get this feeling walking up on 
                    a scene, not knowing what your 
                    gonna find.  I don t know, it s 
                    like,  la notte   appena iniziata.   
                    The night has just begun.  Gonna 
                    miss that feeling when I retire. 

      Majan ribs his melodramatic partner--

                                  MAJAN
                    You won t miss it in winter when 
                    I m freezing my nuts off and you re 
                    in your house in Tuscany sipping 
                    Chianti.  How do you say,  Cry me a 
                    river  in Italian?


      A NEWS HELICOPTER overhead.  Longford, Majan, and a bunch of 
      cops watch a TOW TRUCK pull a red Corvette out of the river.

                                  MAJAN
                    57 Vette.  Roman red.  Classic.

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      LATER - LONGFORD AND MAJAN circle the Corvette with 
        flashlights.  A water-logged body slumped in the seat.                                                                                      7.



                                  MAJAN (CONT'D)
                    Male Caucasian.

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Probably came out here to score.  
                    He gets high, veers off the road.

                                  MAJAN
                          (looking closer)
                    Got a gunshot.  Side of the head.

                                  LONGFORD
                    Driver's side window's busted.  

      Longford swishes his flashlight around the grass- 

                                  LONGFORD (CONT'D)
                    No glass, no tire tracks.  How does 
                    he get into the water?

                                  MAJAN
                    The 57 had a fiberglass body.  
                    Pretty light.  Strong current... 

                                  LONGFORD
                    Think he could have gone in 
                    somewhere up river and drifted 
                    here?

      Majan nods, and we--

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      LATER - Majan and Longford go through the man s belongings. 
      Majan matches the man s business card against the license- 

                                  MAJAN 
                    Michael Rostin.  Divorce attorney. 

                                  LONGFORD 
                    They tend to create a lot of angry 
                    people.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      WITH A LATINA DETECTIVE, (30), crossing the street toward the 
      pharmacy.  Though sexy-beautiful and plenty aware of it, she 
      also carries a discernible edge you don't want to mess with.  
      As she gets to the door, she tells us-                                                                                       8.



                                  LATINA DETECTIVE
                    I grew up three blocks away.  You 
                    just pray when you walk in to one 
                    of these that it s no one you know.

      And we FREEZE briefly on her as text appears:

       DETECTIVE ARIANA SANCHEZ, 5 years Detroit homicide.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      We re watching like voyeurs, through the back window of a 
      police cruiser, as Longford consoles the dead lawyer's shell 
      shocked wife, MRS. ROSTIN-

                                  MRS. ROSTIN
                    I told him not to drive that car.  
                    It was too flashy.
                          (crying now)
                    He was such a good person.

      She leans on Longford's shoulder, sobbing.  Longford, who 
      doesn t sense the camera watching, is clearly shaken. 

      ON MAJAN, seeing the coroners begin to remove the body from 
      the Corvette--

                                  MAJAN
                    Hey!  Seriously guys... in front of 
                    his wife?  

      They stop.  Majan gazes at his partner, making sure we know-

                                  MAJAN (CONT'D)
                    She demanded to be brought to the 
                    scene.  There s nothing worse than 
                    telling a person that someone they 
                    love is gone.  Never gets any 
                    easier.


      AT A DISTANCE, we see Fitch and Washington at the door.  A 
      Caucasian woman (60'S), answers in a robe, just awoken - 
      alarmed by this late night visit from police.                                                                                    11.



                                  FITCH
                    Ma'am, we're detectives from the 
                    Detroit Police Department...

                                  WOMAN
                    Oh my god, what happened?

                                  FITCH
                    Can we come in and talk, Ma'am?


      In the case of the dead lawyer, we're on a street along the 
      river.  Police cruisers block traffic.  Officers walking the 
      ground with flash lights.

      WITH LONGFORD AND MAJAN - on the shoulder where an aluminum 
      barrier is broken.  Red fiberglass debris scattered around.                                                                                     15.



                                  MAJAN
                    Roman Red.  Same color as the 
                    lawyer's Corvette.  Looks like he 
                    tore off a piece of panel when he 
                    went through the barrier. 

                                  LONGFORD
                    Straight over the bank and SPLASH! 

      Majan looks off at the BELLE ISLAND CASINO ROTUNDA, about 
      five hundred yards down river.

                                  MAJAN 
                    Current carries him all the way to 
                    Belle Isle.

                                  COP (O.S.)
                    Hey!  Found glass over here!

      We follow Longford and Majan out into the middle of the 
      street where a COP has a flashlight beam on SPARKLING WINDOW 
      SHARDS.  Majan looks up, seeing a traffic light.

                                  MAJAN
                    Our victim stops at the light.  
                    Shooter approaches the vehicle; 
                    BANG!  Through the window.

                                  LONGFORD
                    Victim's at a stop.  How does he 
                    get in the river?

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      LATER - AS MAJAN AND LONGFORD walk briskly toward an office 
      building across the street, Majan informs us that- 

                                  MAJAN 
                    There's a security guard in this 
                    office building, here.  We're gonna 
                    talk to him.  Maybe he saw 
                      something.

      We follow Longford and Majan as they enter the building lobby 
      where a SECURITY GUARD waits for them--

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                          (rattled)
                    Officers, I just rolled back the 
                    security footage... I got it all.  

                                  LONGFORD
                    Excuse me?                                                                                    16.



                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    We have a perimeter security 
                    camera.  It caught the whole thing 
                    on tape.

      Longford and Majan trade a look, and we CUT TO:


      Where the Corvette went into the river.  The crime scene is 
      closed down.  Longford and Majan scour the road with 
        flashlights.  Majan finds--

                                  MAJAN 
                    Here we go!  
                          (but then)
                    Strike that.  It's a 45.                                                                                    22.



      LATER - ON LONGFORD, kneeling in the gutter, finding- 

                                  LONGFORD
                    I got it.  Wait.  Wait.  Nope.  22. 

                                  MAJAN
                    This is what happens when you look 
                    for bullets in Detroit.  Let's call 
                    it a night.

                                  LONGFORD
                    Chi dorme non piglia pesci.  Those 
                    who sleep don t catch any fish...

      Majan looks over at the camera and rolls his eyes-

                                  MAJAN 
                    Have you met my partner, Inspector 
                    Berlitz?  I got nine more months of 
                    this...

      Longford stands, A CASING on the end of his pencil-

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Here we are!  Oh, baby.  Nine mil 
                    and fresh.  Can smell the powder.

      Majan walks over and takes a look-

                                  MAJAN
                    Let's hope we can pull a print.


      A car rolls up.  Sanchez gets out and opens the rear door, 
      pulling out a CAUCASIAN MAN in cuffs. 


      A SIGN reads: 'DETROIT METRO PAROLE OFFICE PARKING ONLY.'

      A crime scene in progress.  As Longford and Majan search a 
      WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK, a uniformed cop approaches -

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    The parole officer's vehicle is 
                    missing.  A blue Ford Focus.

      Longford walks to the front of the truck, which is mangled 
      and tainted with red paint.  A pool of oil under the vehicle. 

                                  LONGFORD 
                    That must have happened when he ran 
                    the Vette off the road.

      Majan opens the glove box, pulling something out-- 

                                  MAJAN
                    Uh oh.  This isn't a good sign!  


      FOLLOWING WASHINGTON - he enters Mason's office, finding 
      Fitch sitting across Mason's desk-

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    Files came over from the attorney's 
                    office.  Shannon was granted sole 
                    custody of their two children.  
                    Parole officer testified at the 
                    hearing, probably sealed the deal.  

                                  MASON
                    Roland's getting his revenge.                                                                                    41.



      Fitch's cell RINGS.  He answers--

                                  FITCH
                    Fitch...

      INTERCUT MAJAN - looking at the note-

                                  MAJAN
                    I found an old family photo in 
                    James Roland's truck.  Roland, 
                    Shannon, and the kids.  There's 
                    writing on the back.  All it says 
                    is, "Together Forever."

      BACK ON FITCH - looking grave as he turns to Mason--

                                  FITCH
                    He's trying to get his family back.  

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Why does he kill his ex-wife?

                                  FITCH
                    Murder suicide; it's the only way 
                    they can all be together.  
                          (on the move)
                    He's going after his kids!  

      And Washington rushes after him.  OFF MASON'S WORRIED FACE, 
      we see family photos on her desk of her two daughters. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Longford and Majan pull on Kevlar vests, watching as SWAT 
      cops move on the house.  Two SWAT officers sidle the front 
      door.  They pound on it.                                                                                      43.



                                  SWAT OFFICER 1
                    POLICE, open up.  POLICE!

      No answer.  The officers turn to Longford and Majan.  
      Longford nods, then - They KICK IN THE DOOR and rush inside.


      Longford, Majan, and two cruisers pull up to an intersection 
      where an accident has just occurred.  As they get out, we see 
      Fitch and Washington pulling up-

      MOMENTS LATER - The Detectives talk to a driver.

                                  DRIVER
                    He runs the light and hits me.  I 
                    get out to see if he's okay and he 
                    friggin' takes a shot at me.

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Can you give us a description?

                                  DRIVER
                    Yeah, white and crazy! 

      AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN comes forward, a pedestrian.

                                  WOMAN WITNESS
                    It was the same car my son drives.  
                    A blue Ford Focus.  And only one of 
                    those fools was white.                                                                                    44.



      The detectives trade a wary look, and as they scramble to 
      their vehicles, Majan is on his radio-

                                  MAJAN 
                    Blue Ford Focus heading east on 
                    Mack Ave.  Suspect may have a 
                    hostage in the vehicle... 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MINUTES LATER - FITCH and WASHINGTON   IN A CAR - prowling 
      the streets.  Washington let's us know-

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    What we have here is kind of an all 
                    hands on deck situation.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      WITH LONGFORD and MAJAN   BACK IN THEIR CAR   MOVING 

      Majan drives, but both eye the street as they tell us-

                                  MAJAN 
                    Every cop in Detroit is now looking 
                    for this vehicle.  Alvin Green may 
                    be a hostage...

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Not only are we worried about his 
                    personal safety...

                                  MAJAN 
                    But we suspect he s the only one 
                    who knows where June Roland and the 
                    kids are.  

                                  LONGFORD 
                    So we d like to find him in one... 
                          (seeing a)
                    PIZZA MAN!  PIZZA MAN!!

      He grips the arm rest as Majan SWERVES hard, narrowly missing 
      a car with a PIZZA DELIVER sign on the roof.  Then, calmly-

                                  MAJAN
                    I saw it.

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Yeah, you saw it after I told you. 
                    The way you drive... where do you 
                    think you are, Calcutta?  Gesu che 
                    scopa Cristo!                                                                                    45.



      INTERCUT - HELICOPTER VIEW - the searchlight scours the 
      street.  VARIOUS SHOTS of squad cars   trolling the streets.

      SANCHEZ - in her vehicle, joining the hunt.  CLOSE ON A PHOTO 
      OF A COP IN UNIFORM, clipped to her visor as she tells us-  

                                    SANCHEZ
                    My partner hated my driving, so I 
                    never had to watch the road and 
                    keep a look out at the same time.  
                    He used to call me 'Shotgun'...

      A BLUE CAR WHIPS PAST her going the opposite way.  She looks 
      over her shoulder, directly into camera and SHOUTS-- 

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    HOLD ON!

      She RIPS a U-turn.  As she races to catch his tail lights 
      ahead, Sanchez barks into her radio--

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    I gotta Blue Ford Focus heading 
                    East on Temple, approaching Cass!

      The Ford Focus swerves.  Sanchez takes the corner and is fast 
      after him.  CAMERA ZOOMS through the windshield, focussing on 
      a head, bobbing in the passenger seat of the fleeing vehicle.

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    That must be the boyfriend.

      The Ford Focus runs a red light, almost hitting cross traffic 
        Sanchez slows - then goes through after him, SIREN WAILING.

      And just when she pulls onto a straight away, catching up to 
      the suspect, something unbelievable happens - the passenger 
      door of the Ford Focus swings open, and...

      A MAN - rolls out of the car and into the road.  Sanchez has 
      to SWERVE HARD to keep from hitting the guy as he tumbles 
      like a rag doll toward their vehicle.

      A parked car comes on fast   SMASH!  Sanchez plows into it, 
      careening up onto the curb and toward a vacant shop window. 
      Sanchez's vehicle SMASHES through the window then crashes 
      into empty shelf racks.  The camera lens SPIDER CRACKS. 

      INTERCUT - FITCH as the call comes over the radio-

                                  DISPATCHER
                    Officer involved, 2423 Temple...                                                                                    46.



      We see the intensity on Fitch s face as he pins the gas, 
      racing to the scene, knowing Sanchez is in trouble.  It's 
      amplified by Washington, who's looking at Fitch, sensing it. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Fitch and Washington arrive at the scene just as other 
      cruisers are pulling up. 

      CAMERA GOES OUT WITH WASHINGTON, following him, pushing 
      through the civilians who are clustered around - ALVIN GREEN, 
      lying in the road   a bloody mess.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      CAMERA POV THROUGH A CRACKED LENS - from the back seat.  
      Though it's dark, we see Sanchez in the front seat, hand on 
      her head.  She looks over her shoulder at the CAMERA--

                                    SANCHEZ
                    You alright?

                                  CAMERA MAN (O.S.)
                    ...think so...

      The BACK DOOR OPENS, CAMERA TURNS to find FITCH.  We see the 
      Camera Man's hand reach out beyond the lens, grabbing Fitch's 
      hand.  The CAMERA MAN grunts as Fitch pulls him out.  

      Then, CAMERA turns on Fitch, now trying to open Sanchez's 
      door.  Sanchez is in the passenger seat - dazed.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    I'm stuck.

      Fitch turns to CAMERA and reaches out--

                                  FITCH 
                    Lemme borrow that.

      CAMERA POV as it swings wildly toward the passenger window. 

                                  FITCH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    There's gonna be glass!

      CAMERA POV as Sanchez turns her face away.  CAMERA POV SWINGS 
      back, then LAUNCHES toward the glass, like a battering ram--
      SMASH!  And we go to BLACK.  OVER BLACK WE HEAR--

                                  FITCH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I got you.  Here we go.                                                                                    47.



      We hear GRUNTING.  Then, a relieved sigh.

                                  FITCH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    That's gonna need a few stitches.  
                    You okay?

                                    SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    I am now.  Thanks.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Longford, Majan, and a shit load of cops are clustered around 
      a blue Ford Focus.  A helicopter is in the sky, search light 
      scanning the yards in the neighborhood.

                                  MAJAN 
                          (on his cell phone)
                    Yeah, we found the car.  He s on 
                    foot.  Who knows, maybe he stole 
                    another vehicle. 

      Longford crawls out of the car-

                                  LONGFORD 
                          (shouts)
                    What s the status on the 
                      boyfriend?!


      We're with Longford, Majan, Washington, Fitch, and a bunch of 
      cops, standing outside a door on the ground floor.  Fitch 
      knocks!

                                  FITCH
                    Police.  Open the door, please.

      He knocks again.  A moment, then   WE HEAR -- A SHOTGUN PUMP-
      Washington CHARGES FITCH, knocking him out of the way, just 
      as- BOOM!  Shotgun Pellets splinter the door-

      CAMERA JOLTS as the cops dive for cover.  Camera finds - 
      Fitch, glaring at Washington like he wants to say something, 
      but he's shell-shocked and speechless -

                                  WASHINGTON
                    I guess he's already here.

                                          ACT FIVE


      ON A WINDOW   a curtain draws back.  A child s face appears, 
      peeking out.

      ON A MASS OF POLICE ACTIVITY outside the building.  The 
      entire area cordoned off.  Helicopters hover overhead.  Swat-

      ON FITCH - looking at the little boy, who seems to be looking 
      back at him - just like he did at June Roland's house.  And 
      we GO EVEN CLOSER, seeing that INTENSITY on his face.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Going on two hours, here.  The rest 
                    of the building's been evacuated.  
                    James Roland has blockaded himself 
                    inside.  Really scary stuff. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      NEWS MEDIA VANS AND REPORTERS 

      AS WE FOLLOW SANCHEZ into their midst with a few uniforms, 
      she worries-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    The suspect could be watching us on 
                    TV, so it s very important we keep 
                    the cameras clear of the scene. 

                                  COP

      A COMMAND AREA - NIGHT

      WITH Mason, Fitch, Longford, and Majan confer with a HOSTAGE 
      NEGOTIATOR, (50'S), he looks like a car salesman.  Department 
      brass and a Swat Commander also present.

                                  MAJAN
                    He hasn't made good on his note, 
                    yet.

                                  MASON
                    Maybe he's coming to his senses.                                                                                    51.

                    I don't know, I think time is our 
                    enemy here.  We have to take 
                    control; get him out of his head.

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    Okay, so let's open up a line of 
                      communication. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      WE'RE FOLLOWING Fitch and the Negotiator through police lines-

                    Keep talking about his family.

      MOMENTS LATER - THE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR is behind a cruiser, 
      speaking through a megaphone-

                    James!  We're going to leave a

                    I know you and your family must be 
                    hungry.  I promise, no tricks here, 
                    James.  We just want to talk...

      PULL FOCUS ON - an unarmed SWAT OFFICER scrambling across the 
      parking lot to the door.  He places a box and a tray of 
      drinks on the mat, then quickly runs out of the line of fire.

      It s a tense few moments as everybody waits to see what will 
      happen.  Then   the door opens and a SCARED LITTLE BOY 
      appears.  We hear a man's unintelligible SHOUTING from inside-

      Unnerved, the little boy picks up the food.  Then drops the 
      drink tray.  Milk shakes SPLAT over the doormat.  He seems to 
      stare at it for a moment   it s heartbreaking.

      INTERCUT   OUR VARIOUS DETECTIVES, looking on helpless.                                                                                    52.

      The boy goes back inside with the box, closing the door. 


      Our detectives listen on headphones as the Negotiator talks 
      to a distressed James Roland.  His words subtitled--

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Leave us alone...

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    James, I can't do that until those 
                    beautiful kids of yours are safe. 

      We can hear a woman YELLING in the B.G. (Unintelligible) 

                                  FITCH
                    That's his mother.

                                  MASON
                    She isn't helping any.

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Just go away.  They're gonna be 
                    with me forever.  It's over.  

      All the detectives trade looks - 'The fuck does that mean?'

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    What are you saying, James?  It's 
                    not over.  Come on, don't talk like 
                    that in front of your kids.  I know 
                    you love them.

                                  JAMES ROLAND
                    I don't want to talk to you 
                    anymore.

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    I just want to help you...

                                  JAMES ROLAND
                    You're not helping me! 

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    James... Let's calm down and talk 
                    about this, okay?  Nothing needs to 
                    be decided right now...

      But then   a SHUFFLE on Roland s end of the line and                                                                                      53.



      SMASH!  The phone comes through the window, hitting the 
      pavement, smashing into pieces.  And everybody is stunned.  
      As they take off their headphones, demoralized--

                                  FITCH
                    I'm going in there to talk to him.

      A beat, then-

                                    HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR
                    Joe..?  Have we forgotten what 
                    happened the last time you knocked 
                    on that door?

                                    SANCHEZ
                    It's a bad idea.

                                  FITCH 
                    It's the only viable idea.

                                  MASON 
                    No way.  This man has already 
                    killed four people... 

                                  FITCH 
                    There are two kids in there.  KIDS!  
                    I looked 'em in the eye!  I made a 
                    promise.  They've already lost 
                    their mother.   What are we going 
                    to do, wait here til he loses it?

                                  LONGFORD
                    Fitch is right.  This guy looks out 
                    that window at us, how do you think 
                    he sees this ending?  I think Fitch 
                    can get through to him.

                                  MAJAN
                    I agree.  Fitch could sell a black 
                    lady a sun lamp.  He brings half 
                    the magic he uses in an 
                      interrogation, we got a real shot.

      Fitch trades eyes with Longford and Majan, total respect 
      between them.  A POLICE CAPTAIN looks at Mason-

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    Your call.

      OFF MASON, contemplating this difficult decision, we- 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    54.




      CAMERA FOLLOWS FITCH as he walks out from behind the wall of 
      cruisers into the open.  He raises a megaphone- 

                                  FITCH
                    James..!  James... Ja...

      But the sound is muted.  Fitch jiggles the switch then turns, 
      revealing his angry face--

      A SWAT GUY trots out, handing him a new megaphone.  It FEEDS 
      BACK.  Fitch adjusts the volume, then announces--

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    James!  My name is Detective Joseph 
                    Fitch.  I'm coming to the door.  
                    I'm unarmed.  I'm just... gonna 
                    walk to the door real slow.

      Fitch sets down the megaphone.  He walks steadily toward the 
      motel room, hands raised some.  CAMERA STOPS, showing us 
      there are some places it won t go.  And as he walks away from 
      the lens, we get a sense of just how vulnerable he is.

      Fitch gets to the door.  His mic makes him sound present-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    I m here, James.  I m at the door 
                    and I m gonna come inside now.  And 
                    it's okay, cause I know you wanna 
                    talk to somebody.  All we're gonna 
                    do is talk a little.

      INTERCUT - Our detectives, looking on.  It's tense as hell-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                          (to herself)
                    Come on... this is insane.

      And Fitch enters.  As soon as the door closes behind him, 
      SWAT moves in, sidling up to the door - on the roof - like 
      dark shadows, ready to barge in at the first signal.

      CAMERA ZOOMS THROUGH A SPACE IN THE CURTAIN - picking up 
      people moving, but we can't tell who is who, so it only adds 
      to the claustrophobia and tension.  

      *NOTE   Fitch is mic d, so WE hear everything.  And what we 
      hear is chaotic - so everyone but Fitch is subtitled. 

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    What do you want?!                                                                                    55.



                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    To talk, James..!

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Why does everyone wanna talk, 
                    there's nothing to talk about!  
                    It's too late!

      The kids are SCREAMING-

                                  KIDS (V.O.)
                    Daddy!  DADDY!  

                                  JUNE ROLAND (V.O.)
                    For god's sake, James... don t you 
                    know what you re doing to these 
                      children?!

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Let's put the gun down, James.  
                    James..?! 

      We get the sense that all hell is going to break loose.

      ON MASON - looking over at the SWAT COMMANDER--

                                  SWAT COMMANDER
                    Just say when...

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    It's not too late, James.  I know 
                    it feels that way...

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    You don't know...

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    I do...

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    DON'T LIE TO ME!

                                  JUNE ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Why are you doing this?!  Look at 
                    you!  Look at yourself! 

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                          (yelling)
                    JUNE, GIVE HIM A BREAK!!

      Suddenly, it goes quiet.  A moment, then--                                                                                    56.



                                  FITCH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I do know, James.  I know.  I know 
                    what it's like.  You loved somebody  
                    so much you don't know why they 
                    caused you so much pain.  And that 
                    pain just builds inside until you 
                    snap.  It's like you're a passenger 
                    in a car that's speeding out of 
                    control.  But then you wake up and 
                    it's you behind the wheel.  You did 
                    these things.  And you think, no 
                    matter what happens now... it can 
                    never be undone.  I've hurt people, 
                    James.  My wife, my kids...

      ON OUR DETECTIVES - listening via headphones.  Trading eyes.

                                  FITCH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                    Most days I can't even get up, 
                    thinking about the things I've 
                    done.  Some days I think it would 
                    be easier just to... end it.  But I 
                    got these pictures on my wall.  
                    Think of the pictures, James.  I 
                    brought you one.  Look at these 
                    kids.  LOOK AT THEM!  They're the 
                    same kids in this picture.  And 
                    that's you, their father.  All you 
                    wanted was to be there for them.  
                    And now you're all they have.  We 
                    can't change the past, James.  But 
                    we can choose what happens next. 

      A long silent beat, then, we hear a man crying--

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Don't come any closer...

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Give me the gun, James...

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Stop...

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    I'm not going to stop...

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    God forgive me...

      And then   silence.  A LONG BEAT.  And the apartment door 
      opens.  Swat officers train weapons on the dark doorway as-                                                                                    57.



      JAMES ROLAND appears arms raised.  Fitch behind him, nudging 
      him out.  Roland gets about two steps -- SWAT tackles him to 
      the ground.  The kids come running out- 

      Cops swoop in and shuffle them and June Roland away.  James 
      Roland cries as he struggles to pull something from his 
      pocket.  He drops it, and as the cops carry him away-- 

      Fitch looks down seeing it s an old photo of JAMES, SHANNON, 
      AND THE TWO KIDS.  And we realize it's the photo Majan found 
      in Roland James' white pick-up truck.  We know this because 
      Fitch turns it over, seeing the handwritten words:

      "TOGETHER FOREVER."

                                                                            CUT TO:


      As we establish the huge hospital complex, we hear-

                                    SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    Looks like Alvin Green is gonna 
                    make it.  Came out of surgery and 
                    asked to see the kids.
