        FLAT on a PLATE GLASS WINDOW.  The store is closed.  FRANKIE,
          trapped inside in her robe and sweat pants, BANGS REPEATEDLY*
        on the glass.  Desperate, she TAKES A BIG FAT MARKER, scrawls
          "Help" across a piece of poster board and smacks it flat
          against the window.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Yep, that's me, trapped in an office
                        supply store at four in the morning. 
                        How'd I end up here?  Well, how does
                        anyone end up where they don't want
                        to be?  Either drugs or kids. 


          Frankie sits with the three kids at the kitchen table.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Okay, guys.  I called you all together
                        because I want to show you an example
                        of someone accepting responsibility
                        and trying to do better.  I've decided
                        I don't like the way I sounded on
                        the tape.  Seems once in a while I
                        raise my voice --

                                        AXL
                        Once in a while you don't raise your
                        voice.

                                        FRANKIE
                        The point is, we've gotten into a
                        bad pattern -- I nag, you don't
                        listen, and I end up yelling.  So
                        let's make a deal.  From now on,
                        I'll calmly ask you to do something
                        once.  Then you'll show me you can
                        listen, and I'll show you I don't
                        need to yell.

                                        BRICK
                        So you're gonna stop nagging?

                                        FRANKIE
                        I'm gonna start trusting that you
                        can do things when I ask you to.

                        So what do we get if you do yell?

                        We should get something.

                                        FRANKIE
                        That's not what this is about.

                        Ooh, I like waffles.

                        That's stupid.  We should get money.

                        This is not some contest with prizes! 
                        This is about us becoming the kind
                        of family where the mother doesn't
                        have to yell!  
                              (calmly)
                        Starting now.                         


          Frankie enters to find the kids watching TV again.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Hey, there's...
                              (growing suspicious)
                        My kids.

                              (more suspicious)
                        There's... a lot on TV this week,
                        huh?  

        She puts a smile on her face and heads for the kitchen.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        The urge to yell and nag was building,
                        but that's okay.  I knew how to deal
                        with it.


        Bob is running with his arms waving, completely hysterical. 
        Mike gets out of the truck and chases him, tackling him to
        the ground.  Bob lets out a SCREAM.  Mike sits on him.

                                        BOB
                        Get off me!  Haven't I suffered
                        enough?!

                                        MIKE
                        I'll get off if you'll promise to
                        calm down.

                                        BOB
                        I promise.  Just let me sit up.

        Mike gets up.  Bob immediately lets out a SCREAM as he takes
        off again, hysterical.  Mike goes after him again and tackles
        him a second time.


        Mike and Bob are now sitting side by side.  Bob is calmer.

                                        BOB
                        You're right.  You're right.  I am
                        too needy.

                              (grabbing Mike's shirt)
                        Teach me, Mike!  Teach me how to be
                        more distant.

                                        MIKE
                        First of all, you're spitting into
                        my mouth a little bit.  So I think
                        personal space would be a good place
                        to start.  

                                        BOB

                              bit)
                        Sorry.  

                                        MIKE
                        Maybe you can try and win her back? 
                        You can go to her house right now --

                                        BOB
                        I can't do that.  I don't know where
                        she lives.  I know it's somewhere in
                        New Mexico.  I should have gotten
                        her last name back when we were in
                        love.  

                                        MIKE
                        Wait.  This is just some internet
                        woman?  

                                        BOB
                        Just?  We danced for each other on
                        iChat.  
                              (then)
                        She was the whole package.  She had
                        three kids.  A little house.  A cat. 
                        I could have walked right in had a
                        life.  I could have been like you.

          A beat.  Mike takes this in.  Heaves a big sigh. 

                                        MIKE
                        So, after the shift, why don't you
                        get some sleep, then come by tomorrow
                        night for dinner?  We'll put up some
                        burgers.  

                                        BOB
                        Really?  Okay.  I'd like that.  Thanks
                        Mike.  
                              (then)
                        Mike, can I tell you something I've
                        never told anyone in the whole world?  

                                        MIKE
                        No.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        28.


        Mike and the kids watch Frankie's tirade, but now we see that
        she is yelling but THEY CAN'T HEAR A WORD THROUGH THE GLASS.

                        I don't know.  Just... bow your heads. 
                        Look ashamed.

        They do.  Frankie keeps yelling.  

                                        MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Now nod.  Just nod like we know what
                        she's saying.

        The kids all nod their heads.  As Frankie angrily continues...        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        29.

                        That's okay.  Take your time.
