A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara
coast line frame this party of old friends. A trio plays
Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert.

CLOSE - ON A FOURSOME OF FRIENDS
2
The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink
champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND
JAKE.
JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50
is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described
by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this
woman's appearance screams "solid."
The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks,
his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his
glass of champagne.
JAKE
Happy happy happy...
JANE
(reminding him)
-- Anniversary.
Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile.
JAKE
Some things never change.
SALLY
Thank God.
JANE
I thought maybe you were drifting.
TED
He was pausing.
JAKE
Exactly....
(sighs, raising his glass)
Happy... Anniversary. You two have
led an extraordinarily blessed
life.
(MORE)
2.
JAKE(cont'd)
As long as I've known you both,
you've always managed to somehow do
everything entirely right.
JANE
-- That's so true.
JAKE
But, honestly, how can it be thirty
years!?!
When did we do that trip
to Spain?
(looks to Jane)
It was for both of our what..?
JANE
-- Fifteenth anniversaries.
JAKE
God, that was a great trip...
The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21
YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This
is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver
puts his arm around his Mom.
JANE
Ollie, how was graduation?
OLIVER
It was fantastic. I can't believe
I'm not in school anymore. When's
Luke's graduation?
JAKE
Next week.
JANE
(correcting him)
It's in three days!
JAKE
Sorry!
I mean this week.
TED
Are the girls going?
JANE
They can't wait.
Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE
SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over
a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries
a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and
uncomfortable.
3.
OLIVER
How long is Luke home before he has
to go back for work?
JANE
-- Only a week...
SALLY
Aw, that's it?
JANE
I know, I hate it. Well...
(Agness joins the group,
standing next to Jake)
Congrats again...
(puts down her champagne)
Great party...
OLIVER
You're leaving?
JANE
Yeah, I have some
(Agness hands Jake a piece
of cake. Jane works hard
at not appearing
flustered)
-- stuff I have to get done tonight
for work...
(to Jake & Agness)
I'll see you two in New York.
AGNESS
Absolutely. Lookin' forward to it.
JANE
Good.
Well....
AGNESS
-- Jane, what are you wearing to
the graduation?
JANE
Oh, a suit or dress, probably a
suit.
AGNESS
Fancy.
Okay.
Jane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally.
4.
JAKE
See you there, Janey.
Where are
you staying again?
JANE
We're at The Park Regent. You said
you were at The Four Seasons,
right?
JAKE
I don't know.
(to Agness)
Where are we?
AGNESS
We're at The Park Regent too.
JANE
(hates
this)
Oh. Good.
That'll be convenient,
actually.
Okay, so, see you soon..
(waves
awkwardly)
SALLY
-- I'll walk you out.
As they WALK AWAY, they HEAR:
AGNESS
So, Ted, do you think you can help
us get Pedro into El Montecito for
kindergarten?
ANGLE - JANE AND SALLY - WALKING INTO HOUSE
SALLY
(laughs)
I thought it was sweet how well you
and Jake were getting along. Felt
like old times.
JANE
Yeah, well, we know how to do this
by now. It has been ten years.
SALLY
That's crazy.
Jane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness
affectionately rubbing Jake's back.

and sees Jane is gone.
CUT TO:

TWENTY-THREE YEAR OLD GABBY
3
in jeans and a tank top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA
MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child.
But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered
from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as your
mother. We are:
The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in
the lush green hills of Santa Barbara. Neat rows of
vegetables dot the landscape.
Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER
SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the
trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and
has an air of maturity about her.
LAUREN
Gabby, stop...you're never going to
fit all this in... you can come
back for the rest tomorrow.
GABBY
I can't come back t---
Gabby looks up to see HARLEY, LAUREN'S FIANCE, in a T-shirt
and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down
the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest.
GABBY
Oh, God...that's all my clothes.
HARLEY
(sets the suitcase down as
he sees an SUV heading to
the house)
(MORE)
6.
HARLEY(cont'd)
Okay, your Mom is home. She'll
figure this out.
The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling
cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes.
JANE
Gabby, you're leaving now? I
thought you were going in the
morning?
GABBY
I know but my friends are all there
and they wanted me to come tonight.
JANE
But honey, it's gonna get dark
soon. You can't see out the back
window. It's Saturday night.
People will be on the road
drinking...
LAUREN
Mom, she'll be there in a couple of
hours, she'll be fine.
GABBY
Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here.
I'll be back for it in a few days.
JANE
Want me to drive it down in the
morning?
(Gabby's BLACKBERRY
BUZZES, she laughs,
thumbs flying)
I could be there by lunch. We could
go to that big Bed, Bath, and
Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby,
can you look up from that thing??
GABBY
(looking up)
I got it covered, Ma.
(to Harley)
Hey gangsta, help me carry these...
HARLEY
(exhausted)
Yep....
Gabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house.
Jane
seems worried as she watches them.
7.
LAUREN
Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the
house alone?
JANE
What are you....? No!
(Lauren looks doubtful)
-- I'm not! One of you is always
moving out...
(Gabby re-joins)
But I am wondering who I'm gonna
watch The Hills with?
GABBY
(huge hug)
Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you.
Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard.
Harley joins the group.
GABBY
Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing
this.
(walks to her car)
Mom, you don't happen to know where
Dad is, do you? I tried calling
him to say goodbye...
JANE
He was at Sally and Ted's.
HARLEY
He was? How was that? You and
them at the same --
(Jane turns to him)
-- not that it's in any way, any of
my... was just...
JANE
-- It was....
(notices both girls wait
for her answer)
-- whatever. It was fine.
GABBY
Was her lunatic child there?
JANE
(laughs)
Not this time. Gabby, call me when
you get there. Do NOT forget.
(MORE)
8.
JANE(cont'd)
(Gabby texts, deep in
convo )
Gabby!
GABBY
I will. I'll call you!
LAUREN
Knock `em dead, little one.
HARLEY
And call us when you get there,
too. And no texting and driving.
Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and
starts off.
HARLEY
(puts his arm around
Jane's shoulder)
They grow up so friggin' fast. I
hate it.
Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight.
LAUREN
Maybe you should get a dog.
JANE
Oh my God.
Goodbye you two.
Love
you.
HARLEY
(heading for their car and
getting into the
passenger seat)
Love you boss!
As Lauren and Harley drive off,
Jane turns and looks at her
suddenly very empty nest.

16
CAMERA BOOMS DOWN ON Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and
Harley, just out of a Cab. The Bellman is taking their
luggage as the Girls spot their brother, LUKE, heading toward
them.
Lauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his
hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan. Jane lights up when she
sees her son, hugs him incredibly hard, kisses his cheek,
then another tight squeeze.
JANE
Love when we're all in the same
time zone.

The NYU Band plays Pomp and Circumstance as the Graduating
Class of `09 ENTERS THE FIELD in caps and gowns. All the
families in the bleachers are on their feet, applauding.
29
ANGLE - THE ADLERS
29
Jane, in sunglasses, is sobbing, taking photos. Next to her
are Gabby, Harley and Lauren, hooting, clapping and
screaming, "There he is!!!" And next in line is Jake manning
the video camera, wiping away tears.
ON THE FIELD, Luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives
a broad bow.
The Adlers go crazy, especially Jane, who does a finger
whistle. Jake looks over at Jane with puppy dog eyes. The
girls notice, assuming their Dad is emotional over the
ceremony. Jane feels Jake's glare but won't dare look over
at him. Gabby nudges her Mom to look over at Dad. Jane
turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl.
30
35
Blue prints are spread on a garden table.
Adam is drawing as
Jane watches.
ADAM
-- So if we move this wall back a
bit, that can bring the arch
forward, which is where you really
want it, right?
JANE
Yes, I'd love that.
ADAM
(sketching)
Thought so.
JANE
I have an idea... what if we move
my bedroom like six or eight feet
so I can get more of the morning
light?
(MORE)
35.
JANE(cont'd)
(sees Adam hesitate)
Not possible?
ADAM
-- Yes, but you'll wake up in the
morning, open your bedroom door and
fall 12 feet into your kitchen.
JANE
Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up
there!
ADAM
But I get where you're headed.
Let me see what I can do... This
property is so great... Have you
lived here a long time?
JANE
About ten years. I bought this
place right after my divorce but
it's taken me until now to be able
to finally do this....
Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up
and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude.
JAKE
Good morning!
(to Jane)
Am I interrupting...?
JANE
(thrown that
he's here)
Hi. No, well, we
were just about
done. Adam, this
is my ex-husband,
Jake. Jake, this
is Adam Schaeffer,
my architect.
JAKE
Hi.
ADAM
(they shake hands)
Good to meet you.
JAKE
(re: plans)
Can I take a look?
Do you mind?
Adam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already
looking.
36.
JANE
Everything's not 100% worked out
yet...
JAKE
Wow. You're finally getting the
kitchen you always wanted...
JANE
Yeah...
JAKE
Huge bedroom.
JANE
It's not huge.
(suddenly insecure)
Why don't I show these to you when
we get a little closer.
Jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little.
Adam finishes for her. She thanks him with her eyes.
ADAM
So, I think next we should stake
out the addition... see how it all
feels - size wise...
JANE
Sounds great.
ADAM
I'll e-mail you and we'll set it
up. We did good work today. Jake,
nice meeting you.
Jake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car.
JAKE
(turns to Jane)
Got time for a cup of coffee?
Adam can't help but sneak a look back at them.
Jane waves, a
bit embarrassed.
36
37
And the plants get watered.
38
- LATE DAY
42
CAMERA MOVES IN on Adam, waiting by a ladder in the middle of
the field. Jane's addition is staked out with orange tape.
REVERSE - ON JANE
Rushing toward Adam.
JANE
Adam, I'm so sorry.
My mind is
just... Forgive me.
ADAM
If I were your shrink I'd say maybe
you don't really want to build this
house.
JANE
That's completely not true.
I'm
really sorry.
(looks at taped off
addition)
Oh! I like it already!
ADAM
Yeah, it's feeling really good. So,
this becomes your office. We come
down your new hallway, the windows
are all along here...
JANE
Great. Love it.
ADAM
And from here to there...wait, let
me get the door for you...
(opens a piece of tape)
Your kitchen.
(they ENTER)
We're in the eating area. How's
the size?
(pretends to sit)
We're at either end of the table.
48.
JANE
(laughs at Adam)
Feels perfect.
ADAM
I thought so too.
JANE
(taking it all in)
This is heaven!
ADAM
It's gonna be cool.
Want to go
upstairs?
43
JANE AND ADAM ATOP SIDE BY SIDE LADDERS
43
ADAM
So if you were lying in bed, this
would be your view.
Jane breaks into a smile.
THEIR POV - IN THE DISTANCE -- THE OCEAN
Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her
phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses,
then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance.
Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her.
ADAM
You okay?
JANE
(grabs her heart)
Yeah.
CUT TO:
WATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET

Jake, in work-out clothes, sprints across the front lawn,
careful not to be seen.
49
BACK TO SCENE
49
Jane clears their dishes.
JANE
(laughs)
You know I hope you don't feel I've
been interrogating you, but...
(MORE)
53.
JANE(cont'd)
I know what it's like to have your
ex remarried and to not have so
much going on in that department.
I mean, do you date ever or...
ADAM
Uh, constantly actually.
JANE
Constantly?
ADAM
Everyone I know or have ever known
has fixed me up. And then,
sometimes I just meet women, I
don't know how that happens, but...
JANE
-- But no girlfriend?
ADAM
Not yet.
Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam
another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a
waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass.
JANE
Just like to date...
ADAM
Actually, I find it really
stressful. You know, the last time
I was in the dating world was 1978.
It's a little more complicated
these days. I can't tell you how
nice it is to have a conversation
with a woman and have the pressure
off. Not to mention, a home cooked
meal that no one else I know could
possibly cook.
Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that.
She
smiles, wiping the counter.
ADAM
That was a compliment. So you
don't have a guy in your life at
the moment?
JANE
No....
(starts to say something.)
No.
54.
ADAM
No?
Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window.
He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a
stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and
both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to
hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet,
he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.
51
54
Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from
her bakery.
She's clearly waiting for someone.
She spots a comfortably dressed MAN IN HIS MID FORTIES
holding the leash of an Airedale and approaching the
building's entrance.
JANE
(approaching him)
Dr. Allen!
DR. ALLEN
(surprised to see her)
Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today?
JANE
No, I just need to talk...and I was
wondering if there was any chance
you could squeeze me in for an
emergency session. I'm sort of
desperate for some advice. I
brought you some of that coffee
cake you like. Not as a bribe or
anything...
DR. ALLEN
(checks his watch)
I only have twenty minutes until my
first patient.
JANE
That's fine. I'll talk fast.
55
LATE DAY - MUSIC OVER
69
Music plays from the outdoor speakers. Jane sets the table in
her courtyard. She's singing along with the music.
70
A PERFECT CAKE - MUSIC OVER
70
sits on the Kitchen Counter. Jane finishes off icing the
cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven, looks at
her perfect roast chicken.

72

Candles are lit on the table, but are now low. The table is
set with flowers from the garden. The wine has not been
opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE THE KITCHEN, still
dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then sighs very
deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by
room, the house becomes dark.
76
76
The Kids cars are in the driveway.
77
Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE DINING ROOM, sees
his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing. He
heads toward his car as...
JANE
glances out the window at Jake as he drives off. One of the
kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs...
A80

Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns
across a small patio. Lauren crosses under them, carrying a
tray of food and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks.
OMIT
81
IN THE BATHROOM
81
Jane sits at her dressing table, dressed for the party. She
puts on hoop earrings -- likes the way she looks. She opens
a drawer to take out a lipstick.
INSERT - THE DRAWER
Sitting among her cosmetics is the joint Jake left for her.
She looks at the joint, then looks at herself in the mirror.
84.
82
ADAM - WALKING UP THE PATH TO THE HOUSE - 15 MINUTES LATER 82
He looks adorable and carries a gift the size of a book.
He
knocks in a playful rhythm.
JANE ANSWERS THE DOOR
all smiles.
JANE
Hey....
REVERSE - ON ADAM
Very happy to see her.
ADAM
Hey.
You look fantastic.
JANE
I'm feelin' a little fantastic.
She OPENS THE DOOR A LITTLE WIDER and we NOW SEE she's eating
a gi-normous piece of cake.
ADAM
(trying not to react to
that, ENTERS, handing her
the gift.)
This is for you.
JANE
Really? Thank you! Come on in.
(takes a huge bite of
cake)
Can you hold this for a sec?
(hands him the cake plate)
Oh my God...
(takes another bite)
-- this could be the best cake I
ever made. You want a piece? It's
like... beyond...
ADAM
I think I'm good.
JANE
(focusing on the gift)
I can't believe you brought me a
gift?! So nice!
85.
Jane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it.
JANE
An appointment book?
ADAM
I sort of assumed you didn't have
one.
JANE
--Because I never remember our...
Awww....
ADAM
I took the liberty of filling in
our next two meetings. And marked
them with post-its and wrote them
in red and then highlighted them in
neon yellow.
JANE
Thank you!
Jane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the
kiss lands on his lips.
JANE
Sorry.
ADAM
I'm not.
(Did he really say that?
Then, he licks his lips)
Wow, that cake is good.
Jane laughs a little too hard.
83
84
From OUTSIDE, we can see lots of folks in the Living Room.
Candles dot the path up to the cottage door. Several Couples
and College Kids are walking toward the house.
85
ANGLE - BEHIND NEARBY BUSHES
85
Jane and Adam are sharing the joint.
Jane takes a tiny, lady-
like hit, passes it to Adam.
JANE
(whispers)
Don't take too much, it's really
strong.
She blows out the smoke. Adam, on the other hand, takes a
huge hit.
ADAM
(while holding in the
smoke)
I haven't had fun in almost three
years, Jane.
(takes another huge hit)
Bring. It. On.
SOME COLLEGE KIDS
walk past the bushes.
KID
Who's got the reefer?
ADAM (O.S.)
(fake falsetto)
No one. Keep walking please.
The Kids laugh.
86
89
A small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio.
Adam and Agness are dancing together. They're totally into
it. Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends
and The Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice" begins. Jake
follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby
on his way. Jake takes Jane's hand...dances with her.
Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their
parents.
LAUREN
They must be hammered.
HARLEY
Or something like that.
Adam glances over and sees Jane and Jake.
ADAM
(to Agness)
Sweetest divorced couple in the
world..!
Agness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane.
JANE
(spotting Adam)
Hey..!
(to Jake)
Jake, I'm gonna....
Jane and Adam cross toward one another. Jake dies a little
as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam. Jake doesn't notice
Agness is watching him.. Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks
from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look
back at Jake again.
Jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away.
Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it.
90
93
Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be
Nice." Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt
and boxers.
JANE
Hey sleepy! What time did you get
in?
LUKE
Have no idea. Lauren and Harley
drove me home.
LAUREN
(joining)
I'm surprised you remember that.
JANE
(turns to see Lauren)
Hi. I didn't know you slept here.
Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top,
takes out a box of cereal.
LAUREN
We were playing Scattagories with
Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell
asleep on the couch.
Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ
bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt.
LUKE
Sweet.
HARLEY
I got cold in the middle of the
night.
Lauren and Jane laugh.
JANE
Okay, who wants what?
(noticing Gabby entering)
Hi baby...
GABBY
(looks out the front
window)
What's Dad doing here?
98.
Everyone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his
Porsche.
96
96
Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's
had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane
cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are
all open.
JANE
(quietly)
Everything okay?
JAKE
I left Agness.
JANE
No, don't say that.
JAKE
She saw it my eyes, Janey.
JANE
Saw what?
JAKE
That I'm still in love with you.
I
admitted it, I told her about us
and I've left her. For you.
JANE
No, no, no.... What do you mean???
Jake, this is crazy!
(worried the kids will
hear, whispers)
Are you telling me the truth?
JAKE
(nods)
This feels so right Jane.
As Jane is about to respond, Gabby EXITS the house in her
PJ's, looking confused.
GABBY
(from the porch)
What's going on?
JANE
Nothing. Honey, set the table,
I'll be right in.
99.
GABBY
Mom, you're the only one who cares
if the table's set.
JANE
Okay, then do it for me....just go
in please.
Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch.
LUKE
What's up, Dad?
JAKE
Having some problems on the home
front, just wanted to talk to your
Mom for a sec.
Jane shakes her head.
Why did he have to say that?
Harley
joins the Kids.
LAUREN
Problems on the home front?
Is one
of you seeing someone else?
Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right
back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake.
JAKE
(off Jane's cue)
No, it's nothing like that. I just
need to find a hotel or something
for a few days `til I get my head
together.
GABBY
It's that serious?
Jake nods.
LUKE
Mom, can Dad stay here for a few
days? He can share my room.
JANE
I don't think that's the best idea,
Luke.
GABBY
Daddy, are you crying?
100.
93
ON JAKE - TEARS WELLING UP
93
He turns away from the kids.
The tears could be for dramatic
effect, could be real.
JAKE
I'm sorry.
All Three Kids immediately well up and look at Jane.
LUKE
(begging)
Mom........
97
97
Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits
silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French
Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been
lifted. His energy is in full bloom.
JAKE
Mommy's the best cook in the world!
98
98
Jane is working in the garden. A shadow falls over her.
She
looks up, Jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking
across his face.
JAKE
Thank you for saving me Janey.
JANE
Jake, you knew the kids were all
here. Shouldn't we have talked
about this? Agreed this was the
right thing to do? This is so
typical. Only thinking about works
for you.
JAKE
I'm sorry, I guess I should've
called before showing up.
JANE
-- And I'm not sure you even left
Agness. Maybe she saw something
last night and threw you out...
101.
JAKE
What's the difference? I was
drowning over there. I'm not going
to get that many more chances in my
life to figure myself out. Janey,
let's use these couple of days to
see if we can make this work.
JANE
We can't, Jake. I told you this
the other night. Please listen.
JAKE
But you were all pissy because you
thought I stood you up. Things are
different now. I'm a free man.
(then)
Can we just hug? I hate that
you're being so distant. It's
literally giving me a pain in my
stomach.
JANE
Oh, God...
Jane reluctantly hugs him.
He tries to kiss her.
JANE
See!
Too much!
JAKE
Okay!
Good note.
Jane can't help but smile.
JAKE
Can I help with what you're doing?
Hold your basket or...
JANE
I'm fine....
JAKE
Okay... I'm going to go to the
video store and get us all a dvd to
watch tonight. We'll have movie
night. Just like old times. How's
that? I'll make the popcorn.
Just then Jane's Cell RINGS.
102.
JANE
Fine.
(into phone)
Hello...
JAKE
(whispers)
I love knowing I'm coming back
here.
JANE
(nods, turning slightly)
Oh, hi... I slept great. How `bout
you?
Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back.

The Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the
house. Jane stands in the driveway, watching, never before
feeling quite like this. Jake EXITS THE HOUSE, holding his
bag. He stops, looks at Jane. She has nothing left to say.
Jake gets in his car and pulls away as Jane walks back
inside.

Jane lies on a pool chaise, wrapped in a blanket, tissues in
hand. She stares up at the night sky and as her eyes flutter
shut, we drift off of her...

CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS THE POOL TO JANE, asleep on the pool
chaise, still wrapped in a blanket. The sprinklers go off
and wake Jane. She opens her eyes, looks around, realizes
she's spent the night outside.
Jane sits up too fast, a tad disoriented, then quickly
realizes what she must do.

A FRONT DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL HARLEY

bed-headed and still in his pj's. He approvingly looks at
Jane, who stands across from him, ready to right it all.
HARLEY
Glad you're here, boss.

Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her
driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the
bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard.
Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in
this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a
sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.
JAKE
I'm sorry.
Jane doesn't answer right away.
JANE
How far back does that sorry go?
JAKE
How far back do you need it to go?
JANE
Way back.
JAKE
Consider it an all inclusive
apology. From not being the
husband you needed to showing up
nude on your bed last night.
JANE
Yeah, what were you thinking with
that move?
JAKE
That you'd find me irresistible.
Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.
JAKE
Never considered the alternative.
JANE
Gotta love that about you.
They swing some more.
115.
JAKE
Oh, man, can't believe I got up to
bat again and blew it.
JANE
You didn't blow it. We blew it.
We blew it the first time around.
This time... we just should've
known better. Too much has
happened. Too much time has passed.
JAKE
And you don't think we could make
it right?
JANE
Does that mean you didn't feel it
was totally right either?
JAKE
Being with you Jane is the best I'm
gonna be.
JANE
But do you agree that it wasn't
really...?
JAKE
It was complicated.
JANE
Begging for an answer.
JAKE
I thought it was good.
I wanted it
to be good.
JANE
Guess that's as close as I'm gonna
get.
JAKE
Do you always have to be so hard on
me?
JANE
No.
I don't.
JAKE
I don't regret giving it another
shot.
116.
JANE
Probably would've been better if
you hadn't been married.
JAKE
It may never have happened if I
wasn't married.
Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side
by side, as they sway in the breeze.
JANE
I don't regret it either.
They continue rocking, not much more to say.
As CAMERA PULLS
AWAY, we:

It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber
is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.
Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A
GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift
tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to
face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is
stunned he's there.
ADAM
Good morning.
JANE
Good morning.
ADAM
Did you know it's good luck to
start building in the rain?
JANE
Really?
ADAM
(obviously lying)
Yes. It's a well known, very good,
really lucky omen.
Thunder rattles the sky.
117.
JANE
(looking up)
Good, I could use one.
(then)
Would you all like to have your
meeting in the house...it's dry and
I've got hot coffee...
The Group thanks her and heads for the house. Adam stays
back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before
someone talks.
ADAM
Jane, I need to ask you
something...
JANE
Anything...
ADAM
You wouldn't happen to have any of
those amazing chocolate croissants,
would you?
JANE
Oh.... you like those, huh?
ADAM
I have incredibly fond memories of
them.
JANE
I don't have any here, but we could
go into town and get some... right
out of the oven.
They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear:
ADAM
You want to do that?
JANE
Yeah... love to.
And as they walk away from Camera, we:
