      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - ZACH S BEDROOM - NIGHT11

      Rewind.  We re back in the middle of ALICIA and PETER s 
      argument (from episode 118).  But we re watching it from the 
      kids  rooms now.  Too far away to hear it all... 

                                  PETER
                    Alicia-- I was trying to protect 
                    our family.  That s what you saw. 

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  You weren t.  This has never 
                    been about your family.  This has 
                    been about you-- 

    And backing out, we see we re peering through a small gap in 
      Zach s bedroom door, ZACH leaning by it, trying to hear...

                                  PETER (O.S.)
                    That s not true.

                                  ALICIA (O.S.)
                    It is.  And you know what, I m 
                    finished.  I m done.

                                  GRACE
                          (a whisper)
                    They re fighting.   

      Zach looks up, nods.  GRACE, coming through their shared 
      bathroom, homework interrupted, crosses to lean next to him, 
      listen too.  The sound of the front door opening.  

                                  ALICIA (O.S.)
                    It s over, Peter.  It s my turn to 
                    be selfish.

                                  GRACE
                            (whispering)
                    Mom s leaving? 

                                  ZACH
                    I don t know.  

      They hear a last plea from Peter...

                                  PETER (O.S.)
                    When are you coming home?

      A mumbled reply, then silence.  And the two kids slump.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #119     "Mock"     BUFF COLLATED     4/15/10        2.

      CONTINUED:11


                                  GRACE
                    They re gonna divorce?  

                                  ZACH
                    We don t know that.

                                  GRACE
                    Mom just left.  She just walked out 
                    the door.  

                                  ZACH
                    I don t know-- We ll be okay.

      Grace slumps beside him.  Two scared kids.

                                  GRACE
                    I was liking dad home too.  It was 
                    like before.  

      Zach nods when suddenly-- WHAHHHHH--a SIREN-like sound 
      blares.  Grace and Zach look at each other.  Zach pushes the 
      door open, and they start toward...

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - NIGHT22

      ...the front door, carefully.  The siren coming from there.

                                  ZACH
                    Dad?

    The two turn into the foyer, see the front door wide open.  
    The HMD unit blinking, blaring angrily.  He sprints out the 
      door, turns the corner to...

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT BUILDING - LANDING - NIGHT33

      ...the elevator, but it s closed.  Zach places his ear to it.  
    The sound of the elevator moving.  He looks back toward Grace 
    in the apartment doorway, eyes meeting: oh my god.  As...

      EXT. ALICIA S APARTMENT BUILDING - STREET - NIGHT44

      ...Alicia sees a cab approaching, waves for it.  Out of 
      service, it passes.  Alicia lowers her hand, looks at the ring 
    on her finger.  Considers it.  She hears her cellphone ring.  
      Checks the caller.   Will.   Answering:

                                  ALICIA
                    Hi.THE GOOD WIFE #119     "Mock"     BUFF COLLATED     4/15/10        3.



      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - NIGHT55

      WILL pulls a new shirt out of his office drawer:

                                  WILL
                    Hey.  I was just-- I have a 
                      reservation at North Pond.  In 
                    forty minutes.  If that s alright?

                                  ALICIA
                    It s alright.

                                  WILL
                    You re sure?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m trying to be spontaneous these days.

      Will chuckles, but hears the tension in her voice.  Not sure 
      whether to comment on that.  No.

                                  WILL
                    Okay, I ll see you then.  Okay? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  

      EXT. ALICIA S APT. BULDING - STREET - NIGHT66

      Alicia hangs up, waves down a cab.  Opens the door when she... 

      ...pauses, seeing a man approaching.  Crossing the street 
      toward her.  It takes Alicia a disbelieving second, watching 
    the man approach.  And she suddenly gasps, realizing it s...

      ...Peter.   Alicia slams the cab door, rushes toward him, 
      horrified.  A concerned gasp:

                                  ALICIA
                    Peter, no.

                                  PETER
                    I love you.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, you can t be down here!  No--

      Alicia looks around, horrified!  As Peter finds himself 
      single-minded, only eyes for her...

                                  PETER
                    Just don t leave me.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #119     "Mock"     BUFF COLLATED     4/15/10        4.

      CONTINUED:66


      Alicia takes him by the arm, drags him back...

                                  ALICIA
                    You need to be upstairs-- 

                                  PETER
                    I can t lose you.  I can t lose 
                    Zach and Grace--

    But she hits speed-dial on her cell, rushing, pulling him--

                                  ALICIA
                    Daniel, DanielGolden, please.  Tell 
                    him it s an emergency.  I don t care 
                    where he is!  Peter is going to be 
                    arrested in about twenty minutes!  

      Meanwhile--

      OMITTED77

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - VARIOUS ROOMS - NIGHT88

      --WAHHHHH-the siren still blares as Grace races through the 
      apartment, panicked-- through the kitchen-- to Peter s room:

                                  GRACE
                    Dad!  Dad!

      Empty.  Crying, she turns back toward the master bedroom, 
      yelling-- DAD!-- but Zach is already there, shaking his head.  
    But they hear--

      --ding-dong-- the doorbell.  Their eyes widening, they race 
      back to the foyer to find someone at the open front door-- 
      AMAL VERMA, (20 s) East Indian descent, born in America.  
      Studious, guileless.  Yelling: 

                                  AMAL
                    Is everything alright?!  My mom s 
                    getting complaints from the tenants.  

    But before they can answer-- ring-- the kitchen phone rings.  
    And Grace and Zach spin toward it: a more horrifying sound.

                                  GRACE
                    That s the police.
                          (Zach starts toward it)
                    No, wait-- don t!





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #119     "Mock"     BUFF COLLATED     4/15/10        5.

      CONTINUED:88


                                  ZACH
                    Grace, we have five rings or dad s 
                    going to prison.

                                  GRACE
                    But dadhas to answer!

                                  ZACH
                    We ll say we re getting him.

                                  GRACE
                    Oh my god.

                                  ZACH
                    That s four rings.  One of us has 
                    to get it.

      A millisecond stand-off.  Then Grace snatches it, surprising 
      Zach.

                                  GRACE
                    Hello.

                                  SERGEANT (V.O.)
                    This is Sergeant Thackerat HMD 
                    Center, please identify yourself.

                                  GRACE
                    This is Grace.  Grace Florrick.

      Zach grimaces at Grace: what are you going to say?

                                  SERGEANT (V.O.)
                    We ve received an alert there s been 
                    an unauthorized breach of the 
                    perimeter; please put Mr. Florrick 
                    on the line.

                                  GRACE
                    That s my dad.  I um...

                                  SERGEANT (V.O.)
                    Please, put your father on the 
                    line.  I need to speak to him now.

                                  GRACE
                    Hold on, I have to find him.

      Grace puts down the phone, Zach whispering sharply...





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #119     "Mock"     BUFF COLLATED     4/15/10        6.

      CONTINUED: (2)88


                                  ZACH
                    Say he s in the shower.  I ll go 
                    downstairs--

                                  GRACE
                    No, no, no.

    But Zach is already racing out the door past a bewildered 
      Amal toward the elevator, pushing the button, trying to get 
    the elevator back, while...

      ...Grace goes to the master bedroom door.  Opens and closes 
    it for the sound effect.  Also for effect:

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                     Dad, there s a man on the phone. 

      Grace makes momentary panicked eye contact with Amal on the 
      sideline of this little drama, then returns to the phone, 
      picks it up...

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, he s in the shower.  He 
                    said he ll be right out.

                                  SERGEANT (V.O.)
                    He s not there, is he?

                                  GRACE
                    He s here.  He s just in the 
                    shower.  He s rushing.   

                                  SERGEANT (V.O.)
                    This is my last request for you to 
                    put Mr. Florrick on the phone. 

                                  GRACE
                     Dad?!  He needs you right now.  

      And-- click-- the Sergeant hangs up.  Grace looks up, near 
      tears.  Zach sees her putting down the phone, returns.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    They re gonna take dad.  

      Zach takes a second.  A grown-up second.  Thinking about it.  
      Coming to a thought.  Then he moves-- fast.  And we re with

       What are you doing?   And--

      --WHAM!Zach slams his skateboard across the screeching HMD, 
      plunging it into silence.  A serious, almost grim, silence.  
    The unit now in pieces.  Grace looks at Zach, some shared 
      understanding of what he s doing.  In the quiet.  

      Zach takes the skateboard, backs up into the middle of the 
      foyer, stares at the spot on the bookcase where the HMD was 
      situated, expertly steps onto the skateboard-- starts with an 
      high ollie, stepping on the tail, and...

      ...flips the board up into Crooked Grind against the spot on 
    the bookshelf, and--

      --CRASH!-- he lands wiping out on the floor, as--

      ...Alicia s apartment.  She looks around.  For some reason 
    she concentrates on the foyer bookcases, touching the wood 
      when she hears the SHERIFF (from episode 114) in the kitchen 
      questioning Amal...

                                  SHERIFF
                    And when you first arrived at the 
                    apartment, did you see Mr. Florrick?  

      Amal looks past the sheriff toward Grace who pleads with him 
      with her eyes.  The sheriff doesn t notice this, but Elsbeth 
      does.  Always observant. 

                                  AMAL
                    Yes.  

                                  SHERIFF
                    You re sure?

                                  AMAL
                    Yeah, he just got out of the shower.

      Grace nods her thanks to Amal.  

                                  SHERIFF
                    And your mother is the building manager?

                                  AMAL
                    Yes, on the fourth floor.  I came 
                    up because we got some complaints 
                    about the noise.

                                  SHERIFF
                    Do you have some ID?  

      Amal reaches into his pocket as Elsbeth moves on, bored.  She 
      bores easily.  She sees in the living room Zach, Alicia 
      applying cotton swabs to his head, whispering...

                    These are beautiful bookcases.

    And she moves on.  Alicia looks after her: what the hell?  
    But we stay with Elsbeth seeing a skateboard in the foyer.  A 
      scar on the wall from the skateboard hit.  She considers it.  
      Looks toward...

      ...several wires running up to where the HMD unit was.  The 
      phone and power lines.  She studies them.  Takes out her 
      cellphone, takes a picture.  And another.

                    Excuse me.  This is my house.

                                  ELSBETH (CONT D)
                    Good evening first of all.  I m 
                    going to ask Mr. and Mrs. Florrick 
                    not to answer any more of your

                    your new lawyer, and I ask that all 
                    questions be directed through me.

      Alicia looks toward her, surprised.

                                  SHERIFF
                    I could drag Mr. Florrick in right now.

                                  ELSBETH
                    Yes, I understand that.  And where 
                    was Mr. Florrick when you arrived 
                    in the apartment?

                                  SHERIFF
                    He didn t answer his HMD call--

                                  ELSBETH
                    Due to the fact that his son was 
                    injured, bleeding from a 
                      skateboarding accident.  Again, 
                    where did you find Mr. Florrick?

                    tripped up young Mr. Florrick s 
                      skateboard, causing his injury.

      Elsbeth smiles blissfully.  The frustrated Sheriff turns away

                    What s wrong?

      Alicia looks toward the pressed button.  Number 4.  Oh.

      Ding--  the elevator stops on the 4th floor; the sheriff and 
      officer get out, go to an open apartment door.  Just a 
      glimpse of another man inside.  Alicia considers it, lets the 
      elevator doors close.  Starts down again.  

      Alicia runs through the possibilities.  What s going on?  She 
      pauses, then... raises a finger toward the 4th floor button.  
      Pushes it.  And...

                    The Sheriff ran your ID last night, Amal, 
                    and it triggered a red flag warning to-- 
                    me.  You see, there are a dozen other 
                    credit cards, driver s licenses, and 
                    passports with your name on it.  Do you 
                    know how that could ve happened?   

                                  AMAL
                    No.  I don t.   

      Alicia hears a tea kettle, turns to see a nervous SIMRAN 
      VERMA (40 s) preparing tea in the kitchen.  Amal s mother, 
      conservatively dressed, more maitre dthan building super.  
      Always polite.  Unlike her kids, a slight Indian accent.  
      Alicia goes to her.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Is everything alright, Simran?

                                  SIMRAN
                    Oh, Alicia, yes.  I just-- they 
                    have a few questions for Amal-- 
                    that s all-- about his work.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Do you want me to... do anything?

                                  SIMRAN
                    Oh, I don t know.  They said it 
                    would only take a minute.  Amal 
                    isn t in trouble.  I...

    But that s all Simran can get out: her lip quivering.  Alicia 
      nods, slips back out toward the cops.  The discussion more 
      heated. 

                                  BELKIN
                    You don t want to get in trouble,

                    Excuse me, gentlemen.  Is Mr. Amal 
                    a suspect?  

    All the cops turn to Alicia.  Silence.  Alicia very aware 
      she s the shortest person in the room.   

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Because if so, you should probably 
                    read him his rights.

                                  BELKIN
                    He s not a suspect at this time.  
                    We re asking a few questions, 
                    that s all.  Mrs. Florrick, is it?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  You just accused him of being 
                    dishonest and warned him he could 
                    get into trouble.   

      Belkin trades a look with the Sheriff...

                    We are trying to ascertain his 
                    connection to an identity theft ring.

                                  ALICIA
                    Simran, I think you should invite 
                    these gentlemen to leave.

                                  BELKIN
                    We only need a few more minutes, 
                    Mrs. Verma.

                    If you don t want them here, 
                    Simran, you can ask them to leave.

      Simran looks from Alicia to Belkin: hates being on the spot.   

                                  SIMRAN

                    Calls for speculation.  The question 
                    asks Mr. Hunter to guess the answer 
                    rather than to rely on facts. 

                                  GIADA
                    Yes, that is the definition of

                    Bigelow.  Too bad I didn t do that. 

      GIADA CABRINI (25), the cross-examining  defense attorney.   
      Smart as a whip, sexy as a model, argumentative as a political 
      panelist, Giada encourages similes.  Lots of them.

                                  GIADA
                    Now, Mr. Hunter, I just want to 
                    understand the sequence of events 
                    here.  You said you saw my clients 
                    entering the cottage?

    And Giada points toward her two clients: male and female.

                                  HUNTER
                    Yes.  I was hunting in the forest 
                    when I heard a scream.  

                                  GIADA
                    Actually you said  screams.   

                                  HUNTER
                    Yes, screams.

                                  GIADA
                    And you said you recognized these 
                    screams as belonging to the witch?  

                                  HUNTER
                    That s right.  She lives there.  

                                  GIADA
                    Now how does that work, Mr. Hunter, 
                    how do you recognize a scream?

                                  HUNTER
                    What do you mean?

                                  GIADA
                    Had you ever heard the witch s 
                    scream before?

                                  HUNTER
                    No.  But she lives in that 
                      gingerbread house.

                                  GIADA
                    And you just assumed it was the witch s 
                    scream?  Coming from inside her oven?

                                  HUNTER
                    No, I recognized her voice.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY2828

      ...Alicia sits with CARY, and four other Associates in the 
      small conference room, going through a brief.

                                  CARY
                    Anyone else bothered by the 
                    argument on page 18?  Mid-page.

                                  ALICIA
                    You mean mine?

                                  CARY
                    Well, I didn t know it was yours; I  
                    just find the citings... off-topic.  
                    Our clients are suing because their 
                    video game was stolen, that s all.

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, I m here to listen, Cary.  So 
                    tell me how my citings could be more-- 
                    on topic?

    But Alicia pauses, sees a receptionist escorting two people 
      toward her office.  Amal and his sister, FRIDA (21)-- working 
      undergrad, jeans, boots, hip blouse.   

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)

      Alicia gets up, leaves.  Cary watches her go, eyes Frida and 
      Amal, as...

                                  ALICIA
                    Nothing.  Neighbor kids who need help.

      Amal and Frida.  Mid-conversation....

                                  FRIDA
                    Sorry, but we didn t know who else 
                    to contact.

                                  ALICIA
                    It s alright.  What happened?

                                  AMAL
                    They came for her an hour after you left.

                                  FRIDA
                    They can t just take her away, can 
                    they?

                                  AMAL
                    This is about me.  They want me.

                                  ALICIA
                    I-- wait, who came?


      Kalinda leans in the office door, listens in...

                                  FRIDA
                    Mom was going out to the grocery 
                    store when... this van-- these men 
                    got out, and took her.  All we got 
                    was this phone number to call.  
                          (hands Alicia a card)
                    The line s been busy all day. 

      Kalinda peers over her shoulder at the card.

                                  KALINDA
                    Immigration.

                                  ALICIA
                    But your mom-- I thought-- isn t 
                    she a citizen?  

    An awkward silence.  Frida and Amal trade a look.  Kalinda 
      sighs.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #119     "Mock"     BUFF COLLATED     4/15/10        23.

                                  FRIDA
                    She spent eight thousand dollars on 
                    an immigration attorney who ripped 
                    her off and never filed for a Green 
                    Card.  So she just gave up.

                                  AMAL
                    She s lived here 27 years.

      Kalinda eyes Alicia, sees her warming toward them.

                                  KALINDA
                    Look, I have a few names of 
                      immigration attorneys.  I ll get 
                    them for you.

    But Amal and Frida stare at Alicia.

      Alicia and Kalinda start away...

                                  KALINDA
                    You re such a pushover.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I am not; I m responsible.
                          (off Kalinda s look: a boast?)
                    No, I mean, responsible for the 
                    Feds questioning him.  

                                  KALINDA
                          (oh)
                    Alicia.  You re not responsible for 
                    everything bad in the world.

                                  ALICIA
                    Where would they put her?  The mom?

                                  KALINDA

                    But you could find her?

                                  KALINDA
                    So you re the pushover, but I m the 
                    one who actually does the work?

    And Alicia starts toward her office, smiling, knowing Kalinda 
      will crumble.  And... 

3232EXT. BROADVIEW ICE PROCESSING CENTER   DAY 

      A squat nondescript windowless building.  Bland 1990s 
      government architecture.  Inside...

3333INT. BROADVIEW ICE PROCESSING CENTER   HEARING ROOM   DAY 

      ...the hearing room is more DMV than Federal court.  A scared 
      Simran is led into the room by two guards.  

                                  FRIDA
                    Mom!

      Frida and Amal behind a barrier with Alicia, Kalinda.  Not 
      much room for spectators.  Simran turns, waves as Alicia nods 
    to Kalinda: 

                                  ALICIA
                    Thanks.

                                  KALINDA
                    Hey.  My good deed for the year. 

      Alicia moves up to Simran, a grateful Simran...

                                  SIMRAN
                    Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

                                  COURT CLERK
                    Please stand on the lines.

      A COURT CLERK points toward two taped marks on the floor.  
      Alicia looks oddly at this, but they obey as...

                                  COURT CLERK (CONT D)
                    All rise please.  The Honorable 
                    Judge Gordon Tomlin presiding.

      And-- click-- a TV screen on the table at the front is turned 
    on.  IMMIGRATION JUDGE GORDON TOMLIN(44).  African-American.  
      A good guy, though over-busy.  His face fills the screen. And 
      Alicia realizes the reason for the marks: two video cameras 
    are turned on: one for their table, one for the 
      prosecution s.  BRAZIL by way of today s immigration courts.

                    --Bow.  Yes, your honor.  

    ICE  prosecutor  SHEILA BOW (30s) a grown-up girl scout.  

                                  SHEILA BOW (CONT D)
                    ICE is petitioning the court for

                    immediate removal and deportation 
                    to her native India.  

      Everything moves quickly, efficiently here.  A racing 
      monotone.  Alicia trying to catch up... 

                                  ALICIA
                    Your honor, I m sorry-- Simran has 
                    lived in America for 27 years--

                                  JUDGE TOMLIN (ON SCREEN)
                    Too loud for the microphone, ma am.

    Oh.  Alicia lowers her voice.

                                  ALICIA
                    Mrs. Verma has demonstrated good 
                    moral character, supports herself as 
                    a building manager, and would be 
                    subjected to undue hardship by being 
                    separated from her American-born 
                    children.  She more than qualifies 
                    for adjusted resident status.

      Simran looks back toward Frida and Amal, offers a comforting 
      smile.  

                                  SHEILA BOW

                    Simran s application for a driver s

      Alicia looks up: uh-oh.  As Kalinda also frowns, sees where 
      this is going.

                    On the application, she checked the 
                    voter registration box thus making 
                    a false claim of citizenship: a 
                    Federal offense.

                                  ALICIA
                    Your honor, these forms are confusing and 
                    often filled out by rote--

                                  SHEILA BOW
                    The application clearly states that 
                    making a false claim is a serious 
                    Federal offense.  Mrs. Verma should 
                    be permanently inadmissable as a 
                    citizen of the United States.

                                  ALICIA

                    ma am.  Summary judgement approved.  
                    Mrs. Verma s deportation is

                    Your honor, please--

    But the screen goes blank.  No one to argue with.  Kafka for 
    the 21st century.  The guards take Simran s arms.  Her eyes 
      wide, appalled:

                                  SIMRAN
                    What do I do?  Mrs. Florrick!  
                          (calling back)
                    Frida, Amal!

      They yell  Mom  back as she s taken from court.  Gone.  Oh my 
      god, Alicia turns: that was so fast.  Horrifyingly fast.  She 
      sees Kalinda, then looks past her and sees a man waiting at 
    the back of the court.  AUSA Belkin.  

                                  KALINDA
                    What?

      Alicia shakes her head, starts toward him, Kalinda following.

                                  ALICIA
                    So that s what this is about?

                    would ve been better if you d let

                                  ALICIA
                    What do you want?

                                  BELKIN
                    Identity theft is a multi-billion 
                    dollar burr in the side of America.  
                    All I ask is that Amal do his 
                    patriotic duty and help us bring 
                    down a major player. 

                                  ALICIA

    And Belkin starts out of court.  Alicia watches him go.  
      Kalinda frowns:

      A laughing DIANE.  She stares at Will s robe on a hanger.

                                  WILL
                    What, I got it cleaned?

                    So this is why you dropped all your

                    Okay.  Got it.

                    address.  Have you seen anything

      Kalinda in the doorway, indifferent.  Alicia at her desk.

                                  AMAL
                    No.  But-- I haven t wanted to see.

      Silence.  Frida looks at Amal, a hesitant Amal.

                                  FRIDA
                    It s mom.  You have to, Amal.

      Alicia and Kalinda lean against an assistant s desk, watch 
    the siblings argue in Alicia s office...

                                  ALICIA
                    You seem less than sympathetic?

      Cary approaching, nodding toward Frida and Amal arguing.

                    Big case.  Can t talk about it.

                    Can t talk about it, Cary. 

      Cary eyes the siblings as Alicia sees across the bullpen...

      ...Will coming down the stairs.  He sees her, stops, nods.  
    She nods too, starts off toward him.  As Cary keeps watching 
      Frida and Amal discussing.

                                  CARY
                    You need some help with it?  I know

    The words sound final.  Alicia isn t sure what to think.

      A niche travel agency.  Catering to the Indian community.  
      India travel posters.  Indian employees.  Several desks.  A 
      TRAVEL AGENT helping INDIAN CUSTOMERS.  

      Amal enters, nods to the other agent, crosses toward the 
      backroom, seeing, then double-taking at...

      ...one of the customers.  Kalinda.  She frowns slightly at 
      him: act casual.  Right, he does so, entering the backroom.  

      Kalinda thumbs a travel brochure, glancing toward the GLASS 
      WINDOWED BACK OFFICE where the PUJARI BROTHERS confer.  At 
      their dimensions, you d never mistake them for Bollywood 
      dancers.  Amal nods to them, drops his daypack, coat, starts 
      back toward the front when...

      ...klink--he drops his flash-drive.

                    Okay.  Just one of them is heading

      Amal shakes, as he minimizes the screen, but Kalinda sees...

      calls over his brother and shows him the contents of it.  

      Kalinda tries to pick up their conversation.  Hindi.  One of 
    the brothers looks up at Kalinda who quickly averts her eyes 
    to a model elephant on the counter.  A sharp whisper:

                    Good.  They re not looking. 

      Amal subtly slips the flash drive into his computer terminal, 
      clicks the keyboard.  The drive illuminates.

      Kalinda looks back toward the Pujari Brothers, sees one 
      suddenly checking his BLACKBERRY... Freezing.  Something s 
    up.  He shows the text message to his brother, who anxiously 
      looks out toward the street.  

      Shit.  Kalinda frowns, alarmed, watching one of the brothers 
      slip his SIM card out of his Blackberry into a water pitcher, 
      while the other hides the TIN BOX in a secret stash BENEATH 
    THE ARMREST OF HIS CHAIR. 

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Damn.  Keep going.

    The Pujari Brothers rush across the room and out the front 
      door, and--

                    There have been 38 objections, and 
                    I ve lost 34.  So what am I doing?

                    You want me to tell you why I m

                                  GIADA
                    Is this important for the lesson?

                    This is important for a life
                    lesson.  A judge asks you a 
                    question, you answer.  You don t

                                  WILL
                    Because court is a lesson in

                    with another question.

                                  GIADA
                    So you re deciding against me

                    No, I m deciding against you 
                    because you re wrong on the law, 
                    but life is not the classroom, and 
                    judges decide things all the times 
                    based on whim: on which attorney 
                    they like, they trust--    

                                  GIADA
                    So you don t like me?

                                  WILL
                    Oh my god, you re like a three year 
                    old with your questions.  I said 
                    the textbooks go out the window 
                    when you re in court.  Charm and 
                    finesse are just as important as 
                    logic.

      Giada pauses.  A student really trying to absorb this.

                                  GIADA
                    Okay.  I need to work on my charm?

                    Who s Will?

      Alicia.  She hesitates only slightly.

                                  ALICIA
                    Will Gardner.  My boss.

                                  GRACE
                    I heard you talking on the phone.  
                    A week ago.  Whispering.   At 
                    night.

      Alicia takes a second.  This honesty thing hurts.  Zach 
      shifts uncomfortably.

                                  ALICIA
                    He s my boss.  And we used to know 
                    each other in college.  And we...

                    already went to him.  They weren t

      Alicia and Peter.  They sit across from each other.  Some 
      kind of moment of truth.  Alicia s honesty tour.

                                  PETER
                    Okay.  Go ahead.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Did you threaten Kozko?

                    Yes.

      There s a relief in hearing the truth.  Alicia nods.

                    Downstairs at Lord of Christ?  

                                  PETER
                    Yes.  Do you want to know why?
                          (Alicia nods)
                    He was wearing a wire.  He made a 
                    deal with Childs for immunity.   

                                  ALICIA

                    You steered investigations away 
                    from him?

      Peter takes a moment.  Looks at her.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                      Everything, Peter.  I want to know 
                      everything.

                                  PETER
                    Everybody has friends; everybody 
                    has enemies.  I did things for 
                    Kozko-- as a friend.  

                                  ALICIA

                                  PETER
                    No.  But-- the line gets... fuzzy.

      Alicia considers that.  She reaches into her pocket, places a 
      bracelet (episode 103) on the table.  Peter stares at it.

                                  ALICIA
                    Who bought that?

                                  PETER
                    I did.

                                  ALICIA
                    Why is the receipt not in your 
                    name? 
                          (Peter looks up at her)
                    I checked the store.

      Peter studies her, surprised. 

                                  PETER
                    I wanted to buy you something nice.  
                    I didn t have the money.  Kozko lent 
                    me the money.   

                                  ALICIA
                    And that was illegal?

                                  PETER
                    That was fuzzy.

      Alicia shifts in her chair.  Peter sees her discomfort.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    I want to run again, Alicia.  I 
                    want to do it right this time.  But 
                    I only want to do it if you re with 
                    me.  If we re in this together.  

      Alicia stares at Peter.  Considers it.

                    sapphires, we ll find the buyer.   

      Simran seems shell-shocked.  Staring straight ahead.

                                  SIMRAN
                    And if you find the buyer...?

                    I m working on that.

      A guard taps her shoulder.  Simran nods, wipes her eyes.  
      Emotion sneaking up on her.

                                  SIMRAN
                    Please, Mrs. Florrick, you have the 
                    key to my apartment.  There are a 
                    few items, sentimental things...

    And Simran slides a small scribbled note across the desk. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Of course.  I ll bring them.

                                  SIMRAN
                    And tell Amal it s not his fault. 

    And that s it.  The guard pulls her away, crying, through a 
      door.  Alicia just stares at the door, moved.

      Alicia lets herself into Simran s apartment.  She looks 
      around, crosses to a small Hindu SHRINE in the corner, picks 
    up the small SILVER BELL, puts it into her bag.  Finds...  

      ...a PHOTO ALBUM beside SCHOOL PORTRAITS of AMAL and FRIDA.  
    She puts them in a bag too.  Venturing further into the 
      apartment, Alicia opens the second drawer in a night table.  
      Finds a small JEWELRY BOX.  She opens it, and stops, finding...

                    I don t know.  I recused myself.

      Diane laughs...

                    You recused yourself from the

      Diane laughs as Will looks across toward the conference room, 
      a meeting there.  Kalinda, Belkin, Frida, Amal, and... Alicia.  
      Will lingers over Alicia who is turned away: not seeing him.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    What s that?

                    That?  A personal case. Immigration.

    The Assistant nods, leaves.  Diane too.  And Will takes a 
      second, decides how to sit, looks across the hall toward 
      Alicia.  Giada arrives at his door with a cookie:

    on his desk.

                    So did you win?

      Will studies her.  Something about her.  Certainty mixed with 
      intelligence.

      Belkin studies them.

                                  BELKIN
                    I seem to be missing something.

      Alicia and Kalinda look toward Frida.  She hesitates.  Looks 
      down at her feet.  Amal eyes her.  Shoots her a whisper:

                                  AMAL
                      I sacrificed.  Now it s your turn.  

      Frida stares at her brother, nods.  She announces to Belkin a 
      rehearsed statement:

                    I was the courier between the

                    Get the visa and you ll get the 
                    rest.

      Belkin stares at her, considers it.

                                  BELKIN
                    Give me a few hours.
                          (aside to Alicia)
                    She ll get jail time, you know.

                                  ALICIA
                    She knows.

    And Belkin leaves as Alicia looks across the hall toward...

      ...Will, in the office, Giada across from her.  Writing 
      something on a piece of paper.  She hands it to him.  And 
      there s something about the exchange.  Something more than a 
      normal exchange.  And Alicia finds herself eyeing...

      ...Giada as she leaves, passing.  A smile on her young pretty 
      face.  And Alicia looks back, sees Will staring after her, 
      then turning her gaze to Alicia.  

    Two plates of glass between them.  A long moment.  Then Will 
      looks away.

                                  AMAL
                    Thank you.

      Amal in the backseat.  The car parked outside McHenry 
      Detention Center.  Cary and Kalinda in the front seat.  

                                  CARY
                    No problem.  

      Amal sees GUARDS escort his mother out.  He smiles, gets out, 
      crosses to his mother who rushes to hug him.   

                                  CARY (CONT D)

                    here.  You just drove the car.

                                  KALINDA
                    Shhh-- 

      A news report playing quietly on the radio.  Kalinda turns it 
    up, startled.  But the report s over...

                                  RADIO BROADCASTER (V.O.)
                    ...police are still investigating.

                    What is it?  Let go.

      Cary shoves her hand away.  

                                  CARY (CONT'D)
                    Hold on, I ll play it back.

      Hits a REWIND BUTTON on the radio.  It REPLAYS the news:

                                  RADIO BROADCASTER (V.O.)

                    hasn t been recovered, but divers 
                    continue to search...  

      Alicia.  She stares, standing in front of her TV, watching 
      footage of the bridge.  Photos of Kozko.  And Alicia just 
      stands there.  A voice yells off:

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    Mom, dinner.
