MARIAN PETERSON, a gray-haired woman in her late sixties,
meticulously packs a suitcase.
She picks up a small, framed
PHOTO from a chest-of-drawers and holds it up to her.
INSERT - PHOTO
It's a picture of a man about Marian's age.
He has a sweet
natured smile on his face.
Marian looks at it longingly,
then packs it carefully in her suitcase between some sweaters
and closes it up.
Marian, looking a little forlorn and out of sorts, stands out
by the taxi area with her suitcase on a tote, looking around
for a cab, unsure what to do.
CURBSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
MISCHA, a somewhat dissolute-looking Russian cabbie in his
thirties, roughhouses Marian's single piece of luggage into
the dirty, cluttered trunk of his cab.
Marian is sitting in the back of the cab as Mischa opens the
driver's side door and slams it shut, rattling Marian's
nerves.
MISCHA
(brusquely)
Where to?
MARIAN
Are you sure you got my bag in?
MISCHA
What do you think?
I left it on the
curb?
MARIAN
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.
It's my
first time in New York.
Just a minute.
Marian fumbles with a piece of paper she's rooted out of her
purse.
Mischa, annoyed, slams the shift lever into Drive and lurches
off.
Marian leans forward into the rectangular opening of the
Plexiglas partition.
MARIAN
I want to go to 526 East 5TH.
That's in
the East Village.
My daughter said it
would cost thirty dollars.
In the REAR-VIEW MIRROR we glimpse Mischa giving Marian a sly
look.
CUT TO:
Hurtling along.
Marian cranes her head through the partition
and attempts to strike up a conversation with the surly
cabbie.
MARIAN
I came to New York to visit my youngest
daughter.
MISCHA
And where is she?
MARIAN
She would have come to the airport to
meet me - she wanted to - but ... but,
she just started a new job and, well, I
guess no one drives here.
MISCHA
So, you come here all by yourself?
MARIAN
Uh, yes.
My husband passed away recently
...
MISCHA
... Oh ...
MARIAN
... And the children thought I should
take a trip.
MISCHA
Yeah.
MARIAN
I'm from South Dakota.
Where are you
from?
MISCHA
Moscow.
MARIAN
Ohhh.
Do you know the East Village?
MISCHA
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
MARIAN
(disconcerted)
You mean it's dangerous?
MISCHA
Nah, not dangerous.
Not that dangerous.
(beat)
Not during the day.
Mischa chuckles as Marian sits back in the cab.
ANGLE ON MARIAN -
looking out the window, her face clouded with consternation.
A nice, one-bedroom co-op, tastefully furnished.
Paula is
unpacking Marian's things.
Marian stands in the middle of
the apartment, feeling relaxed, if still a bit shaken, for
the first time since she arrived.
PAULA
So, what do you think?
MARIAN
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
PAULA
You don't like where I live?
Marian walks over to the window and peers out.
MARIAN
Well, when I walked up the block, I ...
well, my word!
PAULA
That's New York.
It looks rundown, but
it's safe during the day.
You'll get
used to it.
Marian returns her gaze to the view out the window.
Paula and Marian are sitting at the dining table.
They're
studying one of those plastic laminated maps of New York that
you can buy everywhere.
Paula is attempting to acquaint her
mother with Manhattan's complex public transportation system.
PAULA
You take the M-15 bus all the way to ...
79TH Street.
And then you take the
crosstown bus to 5TH Avenue, and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art is right
there.
You can't miss it.
Marian removes her glasses and fixes her gaze on her
daughter.
MARIAN
I wanted to ask you something.
Those
motorcycles across the street ...?
PAULA
Uh-huh?
MARIAN
... What are they all doing there?
PAULA
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York
headquarters.
MARIAN
(alarmed)
The motorcycle gang?
Don't they deal
drugs and rape young girls?
PAULA
I've never had any problem with them.
People say it's the safest block in the
East Village.
(lays a reassuring hand on her
mother's arm)
I just hope their motorcycles don't keep
you up at night.
CUT TO:
CRANE UP to Marian lying wide awake on a convertible sofa
next to the street window.
We (Marian!) hear VOICES,
MOTORCYCLES REVVING, POLICE SIRENS, followed by what sounds
like GUNFIRE, tires SCREECHING, a cacophony of sounds typical
of summer nights in the East Village.
We go UP and OVER Marian toward the window as imaginary
voices flood in and become intelligible.
RANDOM VOICES (O.S.)
Did that shipment of heroin come in?
That old lady see them?
We can kill her if we have to.
RAUCOUS LAUGHTER erupts.
Marian wakes with a start, consciousness giving way to a sigh
of relief.
FADE TO:
It's quiet in the co-op.
Marian is dusting the bookshelves
and humming to herself.
Behind a shelf of books she discovers a PHOTO ENVELOPE with
some snapshots in them.
Curious, she has a look-see.
SNAPSHOTS -
flipping through Marian's hands.
They chronicle Paula and a
BOYFRIEND on a recent vacation to a Caribbean island.
Marian
is amused by them ... until she comes to one showing Paula
with her bathing suit top off, arms raised giddily in the
air.
MARIAN -
gasps, then blushes and quickly replaces the pictures.
Marian is at the window, peering through the furling
curtains.
Marian cowers against the half-open door as a young MAN,
wearing faded jeans, black cowboy boots, and leather vest
over a naked torso, comes charging down the stairs pulled by
a frothing, pent-up BULLDOG on a leash.
As he passes, Marian retreats quickly back into her unit,
closes the door, and locks the locks from inside.
CUT TO:
Paula is hanging up her coat and setting down her briefcase,
an incredulous expression on her face, looking at ...
Marian, sitting in a chair by the window, leafing through a
magazine.
PAULA
(mildly rebuking)
You didn't leave the house all day?
Marian shrugs.
CUT TO:
Marian and Paula are sitting at the bar.
They each have a
glass of white wine in front of them.
Paula is looking at
some PHOTOS of the farm that Marian has brought along.
MARIAN
Would you look at those strawberries.
They made the best jam.
(passes Paula the photos)
Here are some more pictures of the farm.
Crops were unbelievable this year.
Paula continues to browse through the snaps.
MARIAN
Plenty of rain.
Your dad would have been
happy with that.
Marian removes a pill from a small vial she's rummaged out of
her purse and slips it discreetly into her mouth.
MARIAN
I just can't seem to focus on anything
these days.
PAULA
(turning to her mother)
That's why it's good you came to visit
me.
MARIAN
(washing her pill down with
some wine)
How are you doing sweetheart?
PAULA
I'm good.
MARIAN
Dating anyone?
PAULA
No, I'm working too much, I don't have
time.
MARIAN
What about the fellow in those pictures?
PAULA
What pictures?
MARIAN
You know ...
(raises both hands in the air)
... whoops!
PAULA
(blushing)
Mother!
MARIAN
Well, they were right out in plain view.
PAULA
Behind the books.
MARIAN
But I was dusting.
PAULA
(reluctantly explaining)
I was seeing Aaron and there were some
... complications.
MARIAN
He seemed quite taken with you.
PAULA
I don't want to talk about it.
MARIAN
(hurt)
You know, you never tell me anything.
PAULA
That's not true.
(lays a placating hand on her
mother's arm)
Besides, I don't want you dusting.
I
want you to see New York.
CUT TO:
Marian lying awake in bed, the ENGINES of the Disciples'
Harleys deafening ...
DISSOLVE TO:
We follow Marian down a dark corridor leading into the bowels
of the clubhouse.
DISSOLVE TO:
At the end of another corridor, a MAN stands, silhouetted
against an explosion of blue light.
As we near the ghostly
figure, we REALIZE it's Marian's deceased husband.
There's a GUN SHOT.
SLAM CUT TO:
Marian wakes with a start, clutching a hand to her breast.
Marian shakes a Valium out of a vial, puts it into her mouth,
swallows it with a drink of orange juice.
FADE TO:
Marian, not wanting to be a disappointment to her daughter,
damn her fears, gathers her purse up and starts out the door.
Marian is again prevented from an easy exit when a young, hip
looking COUPLE come bounding down the stairs.
As she stands
at her open door to let them pass, they completely ignore her
as if she didn't exist.
Paula comes running up the stairs.
She stops when she SEES:
MARIAN -
sitting on the floor, propped against the door to their unit.
Paula shakes her head reprovingly at her mother who just
shrugs, chagrined.
Paula is in the bathroom.
She has her mother's vial of
Valium in her hand.
PAULA
Maybe you should lay low tomorrow.
I'm
going to see if I can get off early and
maybe we can take the ferry cruise.
Okay?
LIVING ROOM -
Marian is standing at the window looking down on the street.
Looking through the security eyepiece, a FISH-EYE LENS SHOT
of an attractive, but distraught woman in her twenties,
puffing a cigarette, eyes red and swollen from crying.
MARIAN
Who is it?
MARIKA
It's Marika.
Is Paula there?
MARIAN
She's at work.
I'm her mother.
MARIKA
Oh.
I thought today was Saturday.
Marian, seemingly reassured, opens the door for her.
She
sees Marika, realizes she's upset about something, and feels
immediately compassionate toward her.
MARIKA
I'm sorry.
I had a wretched night.
MARIAN
Oh.
You need a cappuccino.
And she lets Marika in.
They're sitting at the dining table, having coffee.
Marian
is listening sympathetically to Marika's tale of woe.
MARIKA
And there was this number on my phone
bill that I didn't recognize.
Calls made
at three and four in the morning.
So, I
called the number ... and a woman
answered.
And I ... I hung up.
(leans forward)
So, then I followed him.
Just like in
the movies.
And I found out that he has
a wife and a little girl living in
Brooklyn.
We had been going together for
almost a year.
MARIAN
(shaking her head in disgust)
Men ... they're all the same.
(beat)
Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with
his wife's sister.
MARIKA
(brightening)
Really?
MARIAN
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
MARIKA
What happened?
MARIAN
Poor man had to leave town.
(Marika laughs)
And I hear that other women came forward.
This makes Marika laugh even harder.
Marian's story seems to
have assuaged her own grief in some parallel way.
MARIAN
You know, you ought to come out to South
Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve.
He's single.
MARIKA
What does he do?
MARIAN
He's an organic farmer.
MARIKA
(chuckling)
Oh.
Well, that would be a ... change.
(smiles warmly)
Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.
You have a
very reassuring voice.
The Disciple's MOTORCYCLES GROWL OFF SCREEN, interrupting
their tte--tte.
Marian and Marika both rise simultaneously from the table and
amble over to the window together.
MARIKA
I wish they wouldn't come and go in
packs, then they wouldn't be so loud.
They reach the window.
At the window, Marian and Marika standing side by side.
MARIAN
I wonder what they do in there?
Don't
they frighten you?
They all look so ...
MARIKA
... Manly?
Marian does a double-take and throws a backward glance at
Marika.
MARIKA
You know, probably none of them had a
mother like you.
Marian and Marika smile at each other.
CUT TO:
The hallway leading into the clubhouse is dark and gloomy.
ROCK MUSIC assails them as they make their passage into the
main room.
CLUBHOUSE MAIN ROOM -
They reach the main room where about ten or so DISCIPLES are
lounging about.
One has his nose in a book, The Road Less
Traveled.
Another reads the Wall Street Journal.
Two others
are seated at a card table, playing a game of poker.
Still
another is sprawled on a couch, smoking a cigarette.
The
walls are festooned with biker posters.
The place is a bit
of a mess, but innocuous.
The Head Disciple stands in the center of the room and
addresses his clan.
HEAD DISCIPLE
Hey, guys.
This here is, uh ...
He turns to Marian, realizing he doesn't know her name.
MARIAN
(meekly)
Marian.
HEAD DISCIPLE
(booming voice)
Marian!
A CHORUS OF VOICES
Hi, Marian.
Hey, Marian.
Yo, Marian.
Marian blushes at their warm response to her unexpected
appearance.
HEAD DISCIPLE
(explaining her visit)
Marian's daughter lives across the street
and she was a little worried about her.
DISCIPLE #1
Swear to God, lady, she's not here.
Laughter erupts.
Marian smiles.
DISCIPLE #2
Hey, is she cute?
DISCIPLE #3
Does she like motorcycles?
DISCIPLE #4
Can she cook?
Amiable laughter fills the room.
Marian laughs with them.
She glances all around her, fascinated by this dungeon she
had dreamed and fantasized about since she first arrived in
New York.
MARIAN
You know, this isn't so bad.
It looks
like our kids' rooms when they were
growing up.
INSERT SHOTS -
of overflowing ashtrays, crushed beer cans, fast food
wrappers balled up and strewn on tables.
BACK -
to Marian, her brow knitted thoughtfully in a schoolmarmish
expression.
MARIAN
Could use some cleaning.
INSERT SHOTS -
of several of the Disciples' FACES, turning to her in SLOW
MOTION with mock baleful looks of disapprobation.
THERE'S A BEAT, then ...
CUT TO:
A MONTAGE, with abbreviated SCENES DISSOLVING one into
another of Marian supervising a thorough, top-to-bottom
cleaning of the clubhouse:
One Disciple sprays Easy-Off in a blackened oven.
Another empties ashtrays.
Yet Another vacuums.
Still others pick up wrappers from under the couch, while
Marian wags a reproving finger at them.
One Disciple tosses the contents of an ashtray under the
couch while Marian isn't looking.
DISSOLVE TO:
Marian in the kitchen, wearing the cut-off blue jeans
insignia jacket of the Satan's Disciples, their colors
emblazoned on the back.
She pops the top on a can of beer
and pours some of it into a huge pot of chili she's stirring
over a stove, while the Disciples sit patiently in the
background at a bar awaiting the food.
Marian tries a sip of the beer and some of the Disciples
smile approvingly.
A FEW MOMENTS LATER -
Marian ladles chili into all of their bowls in a series of
JUMP CUTS.
DISSOLVE TO:
All the Disciples are huddled around Marian in the middle of
the clubhouse, as if she were the mother hen, arms folded
across their chests, smiles creasing their faces, sated.
MARIAN
Well, I'd better be going.
It was nice
meeting all of you.
DISCIPLE #1
Thanks, Marian.
CHORUS OF OTHER DISCIPLES
Thanks, Marian.
DISCIPLE #2
The food was outstanding.
Marian starts off.
HEAD DISCIPLE
You know, if we can do anything for you,
Marian, you just let us know.
MARIAN
(turns, considers for a moment)
Well, there is one thing.
(beat, mildly scolding)
At night, your motorcycles are so darn
loud, I'm not getting much sleep.
Now,
I'm going home in a few days, so ...
could I ask you to keep them quiet?
Some of the Disciples exchange petulant looks, rolling their
eyes at the request.
HEAD DISCIPLE
(mollifying)
Well, we'll, uh, see what we can do,
Marian.
All the Disciples break into laughter.
MARIAN
Thank you.
CUT TO:
Paula, with her mother in tow, knocks on an open office door.
PAULA
Hello.
NEW ANGLE -
DON PALMER, an avuncular-looking man in his mid-forties rises
from his desk.
MR. PALMER
Come in.
Paula and Marian enter the office and halt mid-room across
from his desk.
PAULA
Don, this is my mother.
(turns to Marian)
Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
MARIAN
(enthusiastically)
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
MR. PALMER
We're very glad to have your daughter
working for us.
MARIAN
(blurting out)
I met the Satan's Disciples today.
MR. PALMER
(chuckling nervously)
Really?
PAULA
Mother, I ...
MARIAN
(waving her daughter off)
My daughter lives right across the street
from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse,
and I was so worried about her ...
so, I went over and introduced myself.
And they were the nicest people.
Paula and Mr. Palmer exchange disquieting glances.
MR. PALMER
(playing along)
Well, that's a very unusual New York
experience.
MARIAN
I had a wonderful time.
Paula is in a mild state of shock hearing her mother's
fantastical anecdote.
CUT TO:
Paula is sitting at the dining table with a plate piled with
roast chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in front of her.
She
has a worried look etched on her face.
Marian is in the kitchen in the background, feeling light and
happy, a singsong quality to her voice.
She brings a plate
of food for herself to the table.
MARIAN
And they were so friendly those young
men.
Though I do think they should shave
their beards and ... and get some nicer
clothes.
Marian sits down at the table and takes a sip of her wine,
picks up her utensils and gets ready to dig in.
She turns to
Paula who isn't touching her food, her head in her hands.
Marian, seemingly oblivious of her daughter's feelings,
prattles on.
MARIAN
What do you say ... we take a subway
uptown and see a play tonight?
Marian finally notices that Paula isn't listening.
MARIAN
What's wrong?
PAULA
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine
such a thing, but ... how many of those
pills have you been taking?
MARIAN
(stung, taken aback)
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
PAULA
No, no, it's my fault.
I've been pushing
you too hard to do things on your own.
Marian retreats into herself, sips her wine - as if she,
herself, now wonders if she's lost her mind - and her buoyant
mood deflates almost at once.
PAULA
The, um, other night, I got up to get a
glass of water and you were standing by
the window talking to daddy.
I called
out to you, but you didn't answer.
You
remember?
Marian doesn't remember, and her daughter's words pierce her.
She's afraid to object.
PAULA
New York is a ... it's a strange place in
the summertime.
The noise, the warm air,
it's ... easy to imagine things.
Paula lays a reassuring hand on Marian's arm, talks to her
condescendingly, as if she were a child.
PAULA
Now, you know you didn't go into the
clubhouse, did you?
Marian doesn't bother to argue, fearing anything she might
say would compromise her.
PAULA (CONT'D)
It's okay.
Dad's dying put a lot of
stress on you.
But you're going to be
all right.
We're all going to be all
right.
Where did you get this vivid
imagination, huh?
Paula grips Marian's arm a little tighter and shakes it
gently as if snapping her back to reality.
Marian returns
her a tight-lipped smile.
FADE OUT.
Marian, lying supine on the convertible sofa bed by the open
window, snoring peacefully.
The room is cast in soft ambient light from the street.
Paula comes into the living room and lies down next to her
mother on the sofa bed and rouses her awake.
Marian swims
leadenly back to consciousness.
PAULA
Mom, I need to talk to you.
MARIAN
(still drowsy)
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't
want to talk about it.
PAULA
No, I had a dream about daddy.
Do you
think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
MARIAN
Oh, I hope so, dear.
PAULA
You know that guy in the pictures you
saw?
MARIAN
Aaron?
PAULA
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
MARIAN
I'm sorry.
Marian pats her daughter on the arm.
Paula pricks up her
ears for a minute.
PAULA
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
MARIAN
Mm hmm.
FADE TO:
Marian is finishing up her packing.
Paula comes from the
kitchen, bearing a gift for her mother to take home with her.
PAULA
Here you go.
(Marian accepts the gift)
I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when
you get back about how much Valium he's
prescribing.
Okay?
MARIAN
At my age, I'm going to take any pill
that makes me feel better.
PAULA
Mother!
MARIAN
I can make my own decisions.
Paula extends her arms and embraces her mother.
PAULA
I love you, Mom.
(turns to leave)
I have to run.
You remembered to call
the limousine service, right?
MARIAN
Mm hmm.
PAULA
(pulling on her backpack)
Well, bye.
And have a safe trip ... and
... Paris in the spring!
MARIAN
(pensive)
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Paula blows her mother a kiss and Marian throws her daughter
a little wave.
