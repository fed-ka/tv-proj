Aw, c mon, man. Look at that face. 
Can t she be my plus-one?

The Security Guard just sighs. Not worth it. To April:

dozen blood donation stations are set up. She takes a seat 
  HITZ reading banner a under PEOPLE OF GROUP small a near*
101.2 FM!  They burst into applause as...

A FEW OF THE RED SOX enter. RICHIE MIRANDA leads the way, 
pushing a LITTLE BOY in a wheelchair and stopping at a MIC. 
Nearby, an intense WOMAN (30s) - his PUBLICIST - motions for 
him to put his arm around the boy. Richie complies and the 
TEAM PHOTOGRAPHER snaps photos.

RICHIE
Without blood donations, kids like 
Shane here wouldn t be with us 
today. That s why this team is 
honored to show Boston how it s 
done.

And I know my blood s clean cause 
it gets tested every week now.

wanna get your arm poked with 
needles just to hang out with a 
couple ball players?

to the tubes. Richie pats the chair next to him.

RICHIE
Now who wants the best seat in the 
house? 

APRIL

Richie squints into the crowd, but April is deliberately 
HIDING behind a tall man, so he doesn t see her.

eyes. Richie notices and rolls his eyes.

RICHIE
