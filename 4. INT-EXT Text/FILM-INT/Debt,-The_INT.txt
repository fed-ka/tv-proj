A strange ROARING sound...
CLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN
...in darkness. Light begins to spill on her from the right
- revealing her face, lost in thought. This is RACHEL
SINGER - pretty, painfully young looking. A surgical
dressing covers half her face.
As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit
either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick-
set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired
and pale-faced.
The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight
ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting.
The roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES,
gradually runs down into silence.
The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen
begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing
the inside of a CARGO PLANE.
Stephan turns to look at the growing light. Then he turns
to Rachel.
STEPHAN
Breathe.
He stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing
too, his face a mask.
Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the
other two, walking towards the light.
As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of
the bay door, we hear a woman's voice:
SARAH (V.O)
We should never forget how young
they were.

CLOSE ON OLDER RACHEL
...now 56. Handsome, impeccably groomed. A long crooked
SCAR runs down one side of her face.
SARAH (O.S)
...a man whose sadistic
experiments left thousands
disfigured or dead, who became
known by a name which defiles the
annals of medicine: The Surgeon
of Birkenau.
She's wearing tinted glasses, staring at us, listening to
Sarah speak.

Rachel's daughter - SARAH - stands at a podium, reading the
Dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the
launch of her first book.
She's 31, and clearly her mother's daughter.
The cover image from the book is projected on a screen
behind Sarah - a black and white photograph of a young
Rachel, David and Stephan. Above their faces, the title -
In Our Hands.
SARAH
Their mission had been to return
him to Israel to stand trial.
Instead it ended with his death
on the streets of East Berlin...

SARAH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
This book is dedicated to my
inspiration. My mother, Rachel
Singer.
People around Rachel begin to applaud, the sound almost
startling her. Automatically she gives the same bob of the
head, acknowledging the applause.
Sarah, cheeks burning with a mixture of embarrassment and
emotion, hasn't finished yet. She locks eyes with her
mother.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Mother, I'm so very proud to be
your daughter.
More applause. Rachel manages to smile.

The room is now alive with the excited chatter of the
guests.
Rachel moves against the tide of the audience with a fixed
social smile, murmuring thanks to well-wishers, trying to
get out, trying not to look like she's trying to get out...

A MAN sits in the back of the car, silhouetted against the
brightness outside. This is OLDER Stephan, now 63.
He watches as David straightens up, hands on hips,
squinting up at the sun.

Young Rachel stands in the small kitchen. Rain lashes on
the window. She stares out at some FIREWORKS exploding
nearby, then turns away and begins to gather three METAL
SAUCEPANS from the shelves.
We TRACK with her as she walks into the...
14
LIVING ROOM
14
And begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the
rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
ceiling.
As she positions the last pot we REVOLVE around her to get
our first view of the far wall. And there, tied to a
radiator, is DIETER VOGEL, now 50. He's bound, his mouth
taped, apparently asleep.
Rachel doesn't, of course, react to this sight. Instead
she begins to clear away some pieces of BROKEN GLASS BOWL
from the floor. We TRACK with her as she walks back down
the short hallway into the kitchen, drops the pieces of
bowl into the bin. From the living room comes the three
distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
11.
She stops suddenly, puzzled. It's a moment before she works
out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound
of the rainwater next door.
There are only two drips instead of three.
She walks back towards the living room...
RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
with a SHARD OF GLASS.
Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
throat with the glass.
Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.
Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
pain of the blow.
Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
blood from her wound washing into her eyes.
As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
face. She falls.
Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
the front door.
Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
free and kicks her hard in the head.
Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
rest, losing consciousness.
RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of
darkness - Vogel's feet as he stands beside us, breathing
hard. Then he turns and hurries to the front door...and
out.

Rachel lies motionless. Then a cough. And another. And
finally she rolls over, holding her gaping cheek with one
hand, and drags herself towards the CHEST OF DRAWERS.

With difficulty, Rachel pulls out a GUN fitted with a
silencer... and pulls herself towards the door.

Stephan and Rachel sit in the back of the car. Behind a
screen the young Mossad Agent we saw earlier sits in the
front next to the Driver. Tel Aviv races by in neon smears.
The air is charged with tension.
RACHEL
(Of the driver)
He's driving too fast.
Stephan ignores her. She turns to the window, watches as
they streak past another car.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
This is ridiculous. What's so
important? Tell me where we're
going?
STEPHAN
We're going to David's apartment.
Rachel turns to him, startled.
RACHEL
David...?
STEPHAN
I keep track of people Rachel.
It's my job. (Beat) I know he
came to see you yesterday.
RACHEL

What's this? The jealous ex-
husband or the intelligence

STEPHAN
A little of both. What did he
want?
RACHEL
Fuck you.
STEPHAN
What did he tell you?
Something about his intensity unnerves her.
RACHEL
He didn't tell me anything. (Off
his look) He didn't! He told me
where he'd been travelling, that
he'd been teaching... We spoke
for a few minutes and then I had
to go.
Stephan is still staring at her, reading her.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
(Bristling)
If you don't believe me ask him
yourself.
And then he can't keep it from his face - and she knows.
Something terrible has happened.

Stephan sits in the middle of the squalid living room, lost

Rachel walks slowly though the room, taking it all in - the
little islands of occupation, the places where David sat,
read, slept. Piles of newspapers. Used cups. A mound of
laundry...
ON Rachel as she looks about her, looking for something,
some sign from the man she knew. But there's nothing
personal here. These are the rooms of a man who had no real
home.

Stephan looks at her, considering.
He takes out a sheet of PRINTED PAPER, hands it to her. She
reads some of the first page, then looks up at him.
And now we see it on her face too. Fear.
32
33
Rachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely,
silently - all the time a terrible tension in her
movements.
She tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps
trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free
and hurls it across the room.
She stands breathing hard.

We TRACK with her as she emerges from the shadow of the
hotel back into the bright sunshine of the street and
starts to walk along the sidewalk.
After a moment a CAR purrs alongside. She ignores it for a
moment, keeps on walking, the car cruising beside her.
Finally, almost angrily, she stops and gets in. The YOUNG
AGENT sits in the back seat next to her. The car pulls
smoothly away.
38
39
Rachel looks down at her passport. We see her PHOTOGRAPH
and name - RACHEL SINGER. She hardly reacts as the agent
ushers her to the front of the queue.
An Officer takes her passport, and as he checks it, we
see...
40

white image of YOUNG RACHEL. The name beneath it is ELSA
ROGET.

Rachel takes her passport back from the BORDER GUARD and
walks forward, past the barrier into EAST GERMANY.
RACHEL'S P.O.V
A CROWD of people are waiting beyond the check-point for
their loved ones. They're all looking eagerly at us. Only
one YOUNG MAN has his back to us, turning away to light a
cigarette.
Then he turns - Young David - a fine, sensitive face,
darkly shadowed eyes. This is the SHOT we saw earlier. A
moment when we see how anxious he is to play his part
right. Then he smiles his beautiful smile...

Supered TITLES read "East Berlin, 1965."
Rachel walks up to him and after a fractional hesitation
they embrace.
DAVID

How was your trip?
RACHEL
(German)
Fine. Everyone sends their love.
DAVID
You've cut your hair.

David takes her suitcase, and they begin to walk away, hand

Rachel nods, embarrassed.

A brief glimpse of the couple climbing the winding stairs -
a view we have seen before.

The place looks like a squat.
YOUNG Stephan sits playing idly at a battered old upright
piano, a cigarette in his mouth. He looks up as David and
Rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway, looking
every inch the young married couple. Stephan looks at them
for a beat, then starts to play the first few bars of
Mendelssohn's wedding march.
The other two blush furiously, not amused. Rachel takes her
case from David.
RACHEL
Where do I sleep?
STEPHAN
You're in my room.
He waits just long enough to enjoy her reaction.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
I'm moving in with him. (Beat)
You're at the end there.
She nods and walks off.

Stephan is smoking. David sits at the table. He is using a
file to create a notch at the bottom of a thin strip of
sprung steel.
Both men can hear the BATH RUNNING in the bathroom, both
very aware of this new female presence in the house they've
been sharing together for the last month.
STEPHAN
What do you think of your new
wife?
David frowns at the steel strip, seeming preoccupied.
DAVID
Too young.
Stephan watches him, amused.

STEPHAN
Pretty.
David shrugs.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
You didn't notice.
He begins to sort his possessions out.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
You know what I've noticed? You
don't notice women. I've noticed
that. How long have I known you?
DAVID
(examining the steel)
I don't know.
STEPHAN
Two years. All the places we've
been to. You don't look at women.
Before I get into that bed, is
there anything you have to tell
me?
David sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for
Stephan to examine.
We hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse
of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door
heading for her room. The two men watch her pass. Stephan
turns and catches David's expression.
STEPHAN
Well, well...I think he just
noticed.

Rachel sits on her bed drying her hair. She stops,

to hear more but the voices fall silent.

David, holding a kitchen knife, MOVES TO STAB Stephan.
Stephan uses a krav magah move to disarm him. The knife
clatters to the floor as he twists David's arm behind his
back.

There's an element of showing off and Stephan uses a
little more force than is necessary. David winces but
doesn't say anything.
Stephan turns to Rachel who has been watching.
STEPHAN
Yes?
Rachel nods and they change places. David picks up the
knife and repeats the "attack" move on her. She disarms him
easily.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
Now an attack from behind.
David takes his position, grabbing Rachel from behind, but
he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little
tentative.
Stephan talks as Rachel practises breaking free from the
hold.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
Where have you come from?
RACHEL
Argentina.
STEPHAN
Really? Whereabouts?
RACHEL
Cordoba.
STEPHAN
What were you doing there?
RACHEL
My husband is an Industrial
Chemist.
Stephan glances at David, amused.
STEPHAN
He does look like a chemist.
David grabs Rachel again, once more holding back a little.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
She's not going to fucking break,
David. Move.
He takes David's place.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
What were you doing before this?

RACHEL (CONT'D)
Oh...Liaison.
STEPHAN
And what did you do in Liaison?
RACHEL
(Beat)
Translator.
Stephan looks even more amused.
STEPHAN
So, first time in the field.
Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs
her from behind and Rachel executes a perfect break,
twisting Stephen's arm. Stephan winces, surprised.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
Good. That's...good.
David gives the slightest of smiles.

Rachel lies in bed, restlessly playing with a locket around

Giving up on trying to sleep, Rachel rises from the bed,
throws on a robe and pads out of the room...

...and into the living room. She sits down at the table,
stares at a FILE before her. She hesitates then opens it,
forces herself to look at the terrible PHOTOGRAPHS inside -
a pile of severed legs, bodies covered in mustard gas
wounds, phosphorus burns, a naked woman, barely a skeleton,
held up by two Nazi nurses, a row of DEAD BABIES, rulers
laid beside them to indicate dimensions...

himself and slips back into the darkness.

A large NOTICE BOARD covered with photographs of grateful
smiling MOTHERS holding their NEWBORN BABIES - row upon row
of new life.
Rachel sits staring at the board. She turns her attention
to the frosted glass door to the doctor's surgery.
Indistinct shadows move on the other side.
She turns to look at the other two women sitting looking
through magazines, then back to the door. A shadow darkens
as it approaches the glass, then the door opens and a NURSE
leans out.

Rachel stands behind a SCREEN, trying to control her
nerves. All we can hear is the sound of RUNNING WATER and
Rachel's tense breathing. Finally she takes off her skirt
and unbuttons her blouse with trembling fingers. She puts
on the gown, and slips out of her underpants, stumbling as
she steps out of them.
We TRACK with her as she walks out from behind the screen
into the large brightly lit room. She walks towards the
GYNAECOLOGICAL CHAIR at the centre of the room. On the far
wall, behind a screen, someone stands washing their hands
at a basin.
As she walks, Rachel passes a tray of MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS,
her glance lingering on it.
She reaches the chair and climbs onto it. A pause and then,
tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging
the gown to cover herself as best she can.
She tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the
ceiling. A bright LIGHT shines down on her.
We hear footsteps approach.
Rachel closes her eyes.
VOGEL
Good morning, Frau Roget. I'm
Doctor Bernhardt.
Rachel opens her eyes. Vogel is sitting on a small stool,
taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to
us.
RACHEL
Good morning, doctor.
He turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful, warm
smile, the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle.
VOGEL
Alright now, just relax. We're
going to do a little examination.
If you feel at all uncomfortable,
you just say. Alright?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09

She manages to nod.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Alright, this is my hand... and
this is the speculum. It's going
to feel cold.
Rachel reacts as Vogel pushes the speculum into place,
opens it and begins the examination. She stares up into the
light.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Can I ask how old you are?
RACHEL
Twenty five.
VOGEL
And how long have you and your
husband been trying for a baby?
RACHEL
Nearly two years.
VOGEL
Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look
fine. Alright, let's see... your
cervix is slightly retroverted.
Tilted backwards?
Rachel raises her hand to her LOCKET NECKLACE and begins to
fiddle with it.
RACHEL
Really?
The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the
image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us
clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE.
VOGEL
Mmm. But that generally shouldn't
affect fertility.
RACHEL
Oh, good.
VOGEL
You have a slight accent, Frau
Roget. Where are you from?
RACHEL
Argentina. We just moved here...
A few months ago.

VOGEL
Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos
Aires?
He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand
away from the locket. She finds herself nodding.
Vogel looks away again. Rachel bites down on a wave of
panic.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Oh, Buenos Aires. Beautiful. I
went once, when I was young. We
went to the Opera house I
remember. What's it called again?
Rachel stares at the light. Beat.

He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile.
VOGEL
That's right. Beautiful. This

Rachel winces.

I'm sorry. Now, there's a couple

that alright?

and join him. There is an awkward silence for a moment.
Stephan sips his coffee.

So. Everything...?

Next appointment is on Wednesday.
She looks at David but he is staring at the table. Like
Stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what Rachel

She takes his hand. He looks up, surprised, searches her
face...
But then Rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets.

How did you find me?
RACHEL
(beat)
What?
VOGEL
Who told you about me?
RACHEL
Who... told us?
VOGEL
Were you referred by a doctor,
or...?
RACHEL
(trying to conceal her
relief)
Oh, Doctor Eisenberg.
VOGEL
Ah-ha. How is the old Jew?
RACHEL
Very good.
Vogel busies himself for a moment.
VOGEL
Any history of infertility in
your family Frau Roget?
RACHEL
No.
VOGEL
Are your periods irregular?
Rachel stares up at the light.
RACHEL
Yes.
VOGEL
Yes. I think we've found the
problem.
Rachel stares at him - she didn't know there was a problem.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
It's very common. Your ovarian
follicles...well, inside you're
still immature.

VOGEL (CONT'D)
We need to help you with this.
There's something we can use, a
little injection. Do you want to
proceed?
Rachel nods, dumbly. Vogel nods, turns back to his tray of
instruments, begins preparing an injection.
Vogel turns back to her with the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE.
Instinctively Rachel stiffens. He injects her.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
(As he works)
How many brothers and sisters do
you have?
RACHEL
(Stiff)
None.
VOGEL
An only child?
Rachel nods. Vogel smiles, not unkindly.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
And yet you say there's no family
history of fertility problems?
RACHEL
(Beat)
I lost my mother in the war.
Vogel stares at her. Then, to her dismay, he TAKES HER
HAND, and pats it with such a sad, sympathetic look, that
she feels her eyes prick with tears. Then he lets go and
turns back to the examination.

Rachel and David walk into the room and find Stephan
waiting for them.
STEPHAN
Identity is confirmed. We have a

Rachel and David stare at him.

Rachel comes out of the bathroom in her nightclothes, with
her hair wet around her. She looks into the kitchen. David
is sitting smoking. Rachel pauses in the doorway and then
walks in. A small two bar electric fire provides the only
light in the room. Rachel kneels down in front of it to dry
her hair.
David looks at her as Rachel spreads her hair around her
shoulders. She looks very beautiful. She starts to comb her
hair. On impulse, Rachel HOLDS OUT the comb to David.
David takes it. He starts to comb, pulling it slowly
through her hair. Then stops. The atmosphere is suddenly
charged.
DAVID
It's a brave thing you're doing.
RACHEL
I'm not brave. I'm terrified.
DAVID
But you're doing it anyway.
Because you know how important it
is.

Another stroke and then he stops again, stares at the comb
in his hand.
DAVID
You're very brave.
RACHEL
(Beat)
David...
Rachel turns round and stares at him, overcome with
longing. She leans in to KISS HIM. For a moment David
hesitates, but then it's as if something inside him closes
and he pulls back from Rachel, his face cold.
Without a word he gets up and walks out. Rachel sits,
crushed...
80
80
Rachel, sits at the piano in her robe, picking out notes.
She's been crying. Stephan stands watching her from the
doorway, holding a drink - something slightly predatory
about him.
He crosses to her, sits down beside her and starts to match
her notes. They work out a nonsense tune between them.

Rachel picks up Stephen's drink and takes a sip.
STEPHAN

Defiantly Rachel drains the glass, grimaces a little.
Stephan watches her. He continues to play, moving the
melody up in octaves until his hand is beside hers, then
covering hers. Rachel brushes him away. He puts his hand
back and starts to caress her wrist.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
You're so beautiful...
He begins to kiss her neck. Rachel stares ahead, pretending
it isn't happening. Then she gives in, turning to him.

Rachel stands at the mirror, dressing in a DARK SKIRT and
WHITE BLOUSE, trying to control all the emotions she is
feeling.
Behind her Stephan lies in the bed watching her. Neither
speaks.

86
Rachel is in the chair for what she knows will - whatever
happens - be the last time.
VOGEL
Alright, this is my hand. And
this is the speculum.
RACHEL
Okay.
Vogel begins the exam. From beneath her GOWN Rachel slips a
HYPODERMIC NEEDLE.
VOGEL
You had intercourse last night?
RACHEL
(Tight)
Yes.
VOGEL
Good. You're at the most fertile
stage of your cycle. This is very
good timing.
He turns to his tray of implements.

VOGEL (CONT'D)
All you have to do is have faith.
Ask any of my patients.
RACHEL
What about your patients in
Birkenau...?
Vogel looks up in shock.
Rachel grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls his head to
one side. With her other hand she jams the needle into the
side of his neck, and begins to depress the syringe.
Vogel gives a grunt of surprise, opens his mouth to speak
but no sound comes. He grabs vaguely for Rachel's throat
with one hand, struggles with the needle with his other,
eyes dull with fury, fighting the drug racing through him.
Rachel fights to hold him, bucking on the chair, pinned
beneath his weight, struggling for breath...
Weakening, VOGEL manages to pull the needle free and it
drops to the floor...
INSERT OF SYRINGE
...which we see still contains some FLUID.
A rope of spittle drools from Vogel's contorted mouth onto
her face. Then his eyelids flutter and close and he
collapses onto her.
Rachel pulls his hand from her throat, gasps for air.
Finally she pushes him to the ground. She leaps up and
deliberately knocks the tray of medical instruments to the
floor.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
Help!
The Nurse runs in, reacts at the sight of the prone VOGEL.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
He collapsed!
NURSE
My God! What happened?!
RACHEL

I don't know! I don't know! He

Rachel leads them in. Stephan crouches down beside Vogel
and takes his pulse.
STEPHAN
We need to take him to the
hospital.
He and David open up the stretcher and transfer Vogel to it
with some efficiency.
NURSE
Oh God!
STEPHAN
He's going to be alright.
Rachel and the nurse follow David and Stephan as they carry
the stretcher out through the waiting room.

We hear the siren of the real ambulance starting up not-so-
very-far-away down the street as David and Stephan push the
stretcher towards the doors.
The nurse follows, but David stops her.
DAVID
I'm sorry, Madam, but you'll need
to meet us at the hospital.
NURSE
But... I want to travel with him.
DAVID
Not possible I'm afraid. New

We begin to register that the siren is growing louder with
every second.

As Stephan and David carry the stretcher down the stairs,
Rachel takes the nurse's hand to detain her.
RACHEL
Don't worry, he's in good hands
now. He's going to be fine.
NURSE
Thank you...thank you.
RACHEL
You should get your things, go to
the hospital to meet him.
The Nurse nods tearfully, starts to back towards her
office, watching as they disappear.

The winter evening is gathering outside. David and Rachel
are in the back of the van. David has taken off the white
coat. David checks his watch.
STEPHAN

He accelerates.
Rachel grabs hold of the back of the seat to avoid falling.
She looks down at the stretcher - Vogel lies unconscious.

The Guard from the bridge has run down the stairs and is

sending him flying.

Rachel sits on the floor looking towards the living room,
staring at something.
RACHEL'S P.O.V
...three POTS have been placed under drips from the ceiling
inside the room. We hear the three distinct notes of the
water drops.
Rachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling
exhausted and numb.
A key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and
David walk in, hair soaked from the rain.
RACHEL
(Standing up)
What did he say?
Stephan stalks past, ignoring her.
RACHEL
You made contact?
David nods. David looks after Stephan who's walked on into
the living room in grim silence.
RACHEL
What did he say?

DAVID
It's going to take time. They
need to open up a new route, they
need to find political help.
Maybe the Americans. Two weeks...
maybe three.
Rachel reacts with dismay. Rachel moves after David towards
the living room. The camera continues after her.
DAVID
We work four shifts guarding him.
We feed him at the end of each
shift. We never leave him alone.
STEPHAN
(turns to Rachel, hard)
And you're compromised. You don't
leave the fucking house.
DAVID
We can do this. We just need to
stay focussed.
The three turn to stare at something off-screen.
The camera continues into the room to find Vogel's body
slumped on the floor, bound to the radiator, mouth taped,
slumped, unconscious.
We continue towards him...closing on his
face...CLOSER...Then his eyes open and he looks at us...

Rachel's EYES OPEN and she lies in bed listening to the
muffled sound of Vogel CURSING and YELLING in German next
door - a breakfast ritual that has been going on for days.
IN THE LIVING ROOM
VOGEL
(In German)
.....Fucking assholes! Fucking

David and Stephan are wrestling with an enraged Vogel,
trying to feed him.
A BOWL clatters to the floor. Vogel's shouts are muffled as
his mouth is taped again.

Rachel walks in and finds a flushed David wiping oatmeal
off his trousers, the empty bowl on the bench beside him.

At this rate he's going to starve
himself to death before we can
get him back.
134
LIVING ROOM - LATER
134
Rachel sits in the armchair near the end of her shift,
watching Vogel who is slumped asleep. He looks dishevelled,
the oatmeal he refused to eat smeared down his chin. She
can't delay the moment anymore.
She takes a bowl of prepared oatmeal from the table beside
her and walks towards Vogel, stirring the bowl with an
unsteady hand.
She kneels down in front of him.
In the silence, we hear rain falling heavily outside.
Vogel wakes, stays slumped, staring at her with dull eyes.
She takes the napkin that was covering the bowl and wipes
the food from his chin. Finally she removes the tape from
his mouth. Vogel watches her without moving. She offers him
a spoon of oatmeal, waiting for the sudden yelling and
abuse. He says nothing, just opens his mouth obediently.
Rachel feeds him a spoonful of oatmeal. He speaks to Rachel
in German, subtitled.
VOGEL
My wife.
Rachel ignores him, feeds him another spoonful.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Is she hurt?
Another spoonful, and another.

VOGEL (CONT'D)
Is she alright?
An ALARM CLOCK on the table, rings - the end of her shift.
She wipes his mouth, tears some tape from the roll. Vogel
closes his eyes, a look of such genuine suffering it stops
Rachel.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Please? Tell me she's alright.
Rachel puts the tape over his mouth and stands. David walks
in and takes his place in the ARMCHAIR facing Vogel.
Rachel begins to leave. She looks back at Vogel who is
staring after her, eyes pleading. She hesitates then gives
a small nod and turns to walk out of the room, passing
Stephan who has been standing in the doorway, watching her.

He rubs her back. Rachel stiffens a little.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)

him. He isn't there. He isn't a
human being. He...
He stops himself.

Rachel looks at him, relieved.

An exhausted David, finishing his shift, walks out of the
living room as Stephan walks out of his bedroom to take his

Rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom, for
a moment the three criss-crossing each other's paths.
Rachel's bedroom door closes. Both men avoid looking at
each other as they pass it.

Stephan and David are carrying a struggling, cursing Vogel
towards the bathroom.
Before they can get there Vogel pisses himself, the urine

Stephan drops Vogel in disgust jumping back out of the way.
Vogel lies in the pool, staring up at him, eyes triumphant.

Rachel watches him from the doorway.

Rachel is washing Vogel's face with a towel. He pays no
attention, continuing to stare out of the window.
Rachel picks up a bowl of shaving cream, strips the tape
off VOGEL's mouth, and begins to brush the cream over his
face. She produces a RAZOR and carefully begins to shave
his cheeks.
She stops suddenly, a TEAR is running down Vogel's cheek,
cutting a line through the soap. He turns his eyes to her.
VOGEL
Why don't you just kill me now?
Rachel pauses for a moment.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
How can you keep me waiting to
die like this!
Rachel keeps on shaving.
VOGEL
I know what you want. You want to
hand me over to the others, let
there be some fucking sham of a
trial. Then, when they kill me,
you can tell yourself that there
was no blood on your hands.
Rachel switches to the other cheek. Vogel's getting more
animated, tears in his eyes, a kind of bizarre
indignation...
VOGEL (CONT'D)
But that isn't true. There will
be blood on your hands.

Rachel tilts his chin up a little and puts the razor to his
throat. He falls silent, tenses, waiting. Then...
VOGEL (CONT'D)
(Softly)
Yes. Do it. You want to do it...
Rachel finishes with a trembling hand.
Vogel slumps back against the wall, the tension in his body
easing away. He gives her a long, calculating look.
And as we watch some CHANGE seems to come over him, some
new fire beginning to kindle in him - a sense of cold
contempt for Rachel and with it, perhaps, a fresh
determination to survive this.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
That's right. I'd forgotten. You
Jews never knew how to kill. Only
how to die.
Rachel wipes the razor clean on the towel, SLAPS fresh tape
onto Vogel's mouth and gets up.

Rachel is cleaning the kitchen again, clearing some of the

Rachel crouches at the toilet, vomiting.
She finishes, rinses her mouth, looks at her pale

She opens the door and steps out...
Vogel stands DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER.
Rachel stands frozen - a split second of total panic.
Then Stephan steps into sight behind Vogel, gun in hand -

Stephan is staring at Vogel. He begins to play the anthem
more discordantly, hitting the keys more violently, as if
the music is possessing him.
Then suddenly he stops, stands up and walks away from the

Vogel is very aware of the sudden change in atmosphere, a
sense of impending violence.
Stephan doesn't move. The moment hangs.

Stephan sits eating with Rachel. David walks in and throws
the SACK on the table. Stephan glances at it, continues

Did you know about this?
RACHEL

His mouth's taped. You want him

I was sick of seeing his face. Go

Don't do that again.
Stephan gets up and walks calmly towards David as if
shooing him back out the room.
STEPHAN
You don't give orders David. It's
your shift now so you can go back
in there...
He has his hands on David's chest, gently pushing him back.
David takes his hold of the hands, pulling them free and
suddenly there's a flurry of violent movement as Stephan

other.

David kneels next to VOGEL with a bowl of oatmeal and

David doesn't react.
Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching
David, his mood strange.

David and Stephan and Rachel...
He gives a soft laugh, finding something amusing in the
sound of the names.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
If I had a choice I'd prefer
Rachel to feed me. So gentle...in

How is she today?

You should let her get more rest.
It's a dangerous time, the first

David stares at him, unable to hide his shock.

You didn't know?
Vogel absorbs this thoughtfully.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
You're not the father then?
(Beat)I thought it would be you.
I thought...I don't know. The way
you look at her. The way she
looks at you...
David stirs the oatmeal, trying to think about what he's
just discovered. Vogel doesn't take his eyes off him...
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Women can be like that, they like
to make you dance first, I
remember. (As though to himself)
So, she chose the other one...?
He shakes his head, shrugs.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
That must be hard, watching them
together, right in front of you.
And you not saying a word. Like
the Poet says - "Great souls
suffer in silence." I wouldn't
have taken Stephan as a family
man. Too ambitious, too...?
Whereas you? David, I see you
with children...
DAVID
(Quietly)
Shut up.
Vogel stares at him. This is the first time someone has
spoken to him in weeks. He's quick to hide his sense of
triumph.

I am expressing my sympathy. For
your suffering.

about suffering?

This isn't medicine. This is
disease. This is sickness.
Vogel seems to consider this.

So we were all insane? Is that
the answer?
DAVID

There's no answer. I'm not
looking for an answer. I'm not
looking for...
He forces himself to be silent, tries to regain control of
himself. He offers Vogel another spoonful, but his hand
trembles a little with the violence of his emotions.
VOGEL
You're trembling.
David pushes the spoon into Vogel's mouth, starts to load
another spoonful.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
It's strange. Here I am - the
victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to
be murdered, but I think you are
the one that is afraid, David.
(Beat) Afraid of the monster.
He leans closer to David.
VOGEL (CONT'D)

Boo.
They stare at each other, eye to eye. Vogel senses a new
brittleness in David. His tone becomes more assured.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09

VOGEL (CONT'D)
Yes. Do you know why it was easy
to exterminate you people?
Your weakness. I saw it. Every
day I saw it. Every one of them,
thinking only of how to avoid
being flogged, or kicked, or
killed. Only thinking of
themselves.
David looks up at him with a strange, crooked smile, eyes
glittering.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Why do you think it only took
four soldiers to lead a thousand
people to the gas chambers?
Entire families? Because not one,
out of thousands, had the courage
to resist, the courage to be the
first to fall. Not one would
sacrifice himself. Even when we
took their children from them. I
knew then that you people had no
right to live, no right to...
He may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from
David but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather
than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his
eyes as David suddenly swings the bowl violently at his
head, SHATTERING IT on the pipe to which he is tied.
He grabs Vogel by the collar and begins to punch him, hard,
again and again.
Vogel slides sideways, limp. And still David punches him in
a murderous rage, possessed, wanting to break his skull
open, to kill him.
Rachel and Stephan run in, with Rachel reaching him first.
She throws her arms around him, trying to stop him, but -
instinctively - he throws a punch behind him. It connects,
splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground.
Stephan runs at him, knocking him to the floor, and remains
lying on him, the two of them breathing hard, the assault
finally over.
VOGEL slumps forward, held up only by the rope at his
wrists binding him to the pipe on the wall.
Stephan is still struggling with David, who's panting,
adrenalised, staring wildly at Vogel's slumped body.
STEPHAN
Out. We're going out.

He begins to drag him out. Stephan nods in the direction of
VOGEL.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
(to Rachel)
Are you going to be alright?
Rachel nods.
As she hears the door close, she turns to stare at Vogel.
He's barely conscious, his face smeared with blood.

Rachel drenches a cloth under the tap.
162

Rachel cleans the blood from VOGEL's face. He has his eyes
closed.
VOGEL
(Mumbling, in German)
Thank you...
She tears off a new strip of tape and places it over
VOGEL's mouth, gently.
She notices the rain leaking in through the ceiling and
walks off towards the kitchen. We hold on Vogel, apparently
sleeping. Then his tied hand reaches out, straining and
manages to reach one of the SHARDS of broken bowl.
163
KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Rachel gathers three METAL SAUCEPANS.
She stops for a moment looking at FIREWORKS flashing in the
sky. She remembers - it's New Years Eve.
We TRACK with her as she walks into the living room and
begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the
rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
ceiling.
CLOSE ON VOGEL'S HANDS
As he uses the shard to saw through his ropes.

ON RACHEL
...as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of
shattered bowl scattered around Vogel. She kneels down in
front of him and collects up the pieces. She glances up at
Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed.
We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From
the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater
dripping in the pots.
She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops,
puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's
noticed - something has changed in the sound of the
rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three.
She walks back towards the living room...
RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
with a SHARD OF GLASS.
Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
throat with the glass.
Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.
Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
pain of the blow.
Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
blood from her wound washing into her eyes.
As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
face. She falls.
Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
the front door.
Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
free and kicks her hard in the head.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
77.
Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
rest, losing consciousness.
RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of
darkness - Vogel's feet as he stands beside us, breathing
hard. Then he turns and hurries to the front door...and
out.
164
165
Rachel lies motionless. We wait for her to cough as we saw
her do before. But she doesn't. She just continues to lie
still.
166
167
No movement from Rachel.
168
169
Rachel holds a blood-soaked tea towel to her cheek, trying
to staunch the flow. David sits, staring ahead, in shock.
Stephan bursts in, out of breath.
STEPHAN
Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at
all.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
78.
He hurries to the drawers and takes out the gun, puts it
into his waistband.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
He might go to the house, might
try and get a message to the
wife...
DAVID
(Without looking up)
He's not going back to the house.
He's gone. Fifteen years, it took
them to find him. And he's gone.
And no-one's going to find him
again.
STEPHAN
So we what? We...are you going to
make the phone call? Are you
going to tell them how he got a
fucking piece of broken bowl?
Wonderful. But don't try and take
me down with you. I've done
nothing wrong. Remember that!
Stephan kicks at the chair, at the drawers.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
(muttering tensely)
This can't happen! This is never
going to go away.
RACHEL
I take responsibility. It was my
shift.
DAVID
(Quietly)
This happened because of me. I
let him go. And no-one's ever
going to find him again.
He closes his eyes, struggling with the enormity of his
guilt.
Stephan drops the gun onto the table, sits down. Outside we
hear more fireworks. Suddenly...
STEPHAN
No-one's ever going to find him
again.
Something in his voice causes Rachel to look up at him.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
(Beat)
What if he didn't escape?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
79.
RACHEL
What are you talking about?
STEPHAN
Only four people know what
happened in this room. Us, and
him. And he's not talking. No one
will ever hear from him again.
RACHEL
(Realizing what he
means)
No.
STEPHAN
Nobody needs to know what
happened here.
RACHEL
He escaped.
STEPHAN
That's the truth. But that
doesn't have to be the truth we
take home. The truth can be
anything we want it to be. The
truth is Vogel tried to escape,
you struggled with him and got
hurt. The truth is, seconds
before he got away, Rachel got
the gun and shot him. The truth
is we got rid of him.... got rid
of the body... got rid of every
trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau.
RACHEL
We can't lie about this!
STEPHAN
No, you know what? We have to. We
have to! This is...this isn't
about us. This is about Israel.
This is a national humiliation!
We can't be seen to fail. And in
the end, Vogel rots away his life
in some jungle, looking over his
shoulder, waiting for the
bullet...? Who's to say...?
He looks at them both, trying to convince them, trying to
convince himself.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
Maybe that's a worse fate. Maybe
that's...The important thing is
justice... justice is seen to be
done!

Rachel turns to David, waiting, expecting him to say
something. But David looks like he's been barely listening,
lost in his own thoughts. He notices Rachel staring at him.
DAVID
He's gone. What does it
matter?(Beat) He's gone.
Stephan seizes on this, sensing he's close to convincing
them.
STEPHAN
(Seizing )
He's right. It makes no
difference. No difference. All we
have to agree is that we never
talk about this. No matter what
happens, we never tell anyone.
The truth stays in this room.
Between us. Agreed?
Rachel looks at David again, wanting some kind of sign.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
(To Rachel)
Agreed? Say it. (Silence) I need
to hear you say it!
She's still staring at David. He's still avoiding her gaze.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
(To Rachel)
Say it. Say...
DAVID
Agreed.
Silence. Rachel closes her eyes. Instead of relief she
feels a kind of immense disappointment.
RACHEL
David...?
STEPHAN
Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say
it.
We CLOSE on Rachel. The moment that will change her life
forever.
From outside comes the sound of some REVELLERS on the
street cheering, more fireworks. We hear some people
chanting a countdown to the New Year...
REVELLERS (O.S.)

Rachel is holding the PRINTED SHEET - the point at which we
left this scene earlier.
RACHEL
(crying out)
How could this happen? You said
he would never speak! You said
he'd never...
STEPHAN
We don't know it's him.
RACHEL
Oh God! Oh God!
STEPHAN
If you read it...
RACHEL
He's alive! He's in the Ukraine!
What else is there to read?
STEPHAN
This is a little internet story.
(Grabbing the paper,
reading)..."a psychiatric patient
claiming to be the Surgeon of
Birkenau..." Some crazy old man.
No-one is paying this any
attention. Yet.
RACHEL
(as if her mind was
elsewhere)
How did you find it?
STEPHAN
David comes back after all this
time, I want to know why. I had
his apartment searched. This was
on his computer...
Rachel stares at him.

STEPHAN (CONT'D)
He didn't say anything to you
last night..?
Rachel doesn't answer.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
Rachel..?
RACHEL
No!
Beat.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
82.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
(quietly)
Why would he do this..?
STEPHAN
Because he couldn't handle it. I
told him we had to deal with it
and he couldn't handle it. He
thought it was all going to come
out and he panicked...
He trails off, thinking about what happened down on the
road. Rachel stares at him. His previous words have just
sunk in.
RACHEL
(Suddenly)
Deal with it? (Beat) What does
that mean? Deal with it?
Stephan stares at her.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
What did you tell him to do?
STEPHAN
(Simply)
I told him to find Vogel. I told
him to finish it.
Rachel stares at him. She stands up, starts to walk away,
comes back, slaps him hard across the face.
RACHEL
(quiet rage)
Did you know he'd been ill? Did
you...? You knew, didn't you? You
killed him. YOU killed him! You
knew he wasn't strong enough...
STEPHAN
(overlapping)
FUCK DAVID! I don't want to hear
about David! David took the
coward's way out!
RACHEL
You could have left it alone!
It's an old man in a hospital!
You said - nobody will believe
it! No-one will notice!
STEPHAN
There's a journalist.
This stops her.

STEPHAN (CONT'D)
A Ukrainian. He's heard about it
and he's going to interview
Vogel. (Beat) Then it all comes
apart. (Beat) We don't have the
name of the hospital. You have to
find out where he is.
Rachel stares at him.
RACHEL
What are you talking about?
STEPHAN
David's taken himself out of the
equation. (Indicating his chair)
I can't do it. You're the only
one left.
RACHEL
Are you insane?
STEPHAN
We can't...
RACHEL
I'm not...Look at me! I'm not
capable of...This is insane. I
can't do this.
STEPHAN
(Beat. Simply)
You have to, Rachel. Because for
thirty years you've been taking
the credit for it. (Beat,
carefully) And there's Sarah.
It's as if he's struck her. Beat.
RACHEL
I won't do this.
She walks out.

The scene we saw earlier.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
84.
Rachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely,
silently - but all the time there's a terrible tension
about her movements.
She tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps
trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free
and hurls it across the room.
She stands breathing hard.
Then something we didn't see - her gaze settles on a
photograph beside her table - SARAH holding her son,
smiling at us.
Rachel stares at the photograph, her breathing slowing.

Rachel is at the reception desk...

Rachel crosses to a TABAC KIOSK, glancing back to some
glass doors behind her.
A sign indicates the offices of the UKRAINIAN EVENING NEWS.
We can see a RECEPTIONIST at her desk. A young man walks
through the entrance, and she throws a knowing glance up at
him as he passes.
Rachel takes in the ALARM PAD beside the receptionist.

She stares out at the stream of people passing in and out
of the building...

Late sixties. Young Rachel, Stephan and David are giving a
talk to a group of young Israeli soldiers. This is a well-
rehearsed routine, something they have probably done many
times.
RACHEL
At that moment, I don't think I
was thinking about myself at all.
I was thinking about my mother. I
was thinking about how she had
suffered in Europe.
The FACES of the soldiers, moved by this. One raises a
hand.
SOLDIER
The same question to Mr. Peretz.
The others look at David, waiting for him to make his usual
response.
But David doesn't move.
Stephan looks along the row. David sits staring straight
ahead. The silence GROWS.
And we realize he's NOT GOING TO ANSWER.

The house is cold, white, aggressively modern. Rachel sits
in her underwear, drunk, a bottle and glass of wine on her
dressing table. Stephan is dressing behind her.
STEPHAN
(Calmly)
Fuck him.
He examines his reflection in the mirror.
STEPHAN
Fuck him.
A DOORBELL rings downstairs. He walks out to answer it,
taking the wine bottle from her as he goes.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
Hurry up.
Rachel finishes her glass, starts to apply some eye makeup.
She senses something and turns to find YOUNG SARAH (four)
watching her from the doorway. She stares back at her
dully.
RACHEL
Go to bed, Sarah.

A cocktail party in progress - Stephan is mingling with the
guests - Mossad high-fliers, Military, politicians. She

watches him handle them - just the right mix of deference
and charm.
Rachel stands against a wall, drunk, watching him as he
laughs sycophantically at something one of the politicians
has said.
He crosses over to an attractive BLONDE WOMAN and greets
her. As Rachel watches he runs a hand down the woman's back
- an unmistakably INTIMATE gesture.
Rachel watches - depressed by how little this makes her
feel. She begins to mix herself another drink, sees someone
across the room, and her face changes...

He's standing alone drinking, nervous. Rachel appears

beside him.

Stephan working the room.

Stephen's girlfriends.
She turns to see what David's reaction to this is, but he
continues to watch Stephan.

And what kind of a friend are

you? I call you last night and...

David suddenly takes her hand and pulls her round the

corner.

He turns to her, his face alive with an energy that we

haven't seen before - fear or excitement?

DAVID

DAVID

You call me, at night, when

you're drunk. Why do you call me?

Do you want us to fuck around

Rachel sits, still smoking, though it's dark outside now.
There is a sound of chatter from above her and she looks up
to see JOURNALISTS spilling out from the offices above,
coming down the stairs towards her.
Rachel eases a PHOTOCOPIED SHEET from her bag and examines
it...
INSERT SHEET
A photocopy of a JOURNALIST'S BY-LINE - a long, rather
mournful face, the name YURI TITOV.
She checks the face, slips the sheet back in the bag, looks
up, studying the men descending towards her. Moments later
she has found him - chatting to a colleague.
He reaches the ground floor and walking past her, goes to
the bar for a coffee.
Rachel finds herself staring at him -
the man WHO COULD
DESTROY HER LIFE.
Yuri seems to sense someone watching him and looks to where
Rachel was sitting.
But there's no-one there.

The PRETTY RECEPTIONIST stands chatting to her BOYFRIEND, a
young journalist. He is holding her coat for.

She starts to put it on and the Boyfriend gives a brief
bark and play-bites at her neck. She laughs, pushing him
away. Rachel hurries in.
RACHEL
(Russian)
Am I late? I'm sorry.... Can I
place an advertisement?
RECEPTIONIST
(gathering her things)
100 grivna for twenty words. 5
grivna a word after that.
Rachel proffers an envelope.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
Here...
The girl takes it.
RECEPTIONIST
Thanks.
Rachel fishes in her bag and hands over a 100 GRIVNA NOTE.
RACHEL
This should cover it.
The girl drops the envelope onto her desk, and slips the
money into a small DESKTOP DRAWER UNIT, as Rachel leaves.

Rachel pauses outside the doors, zipping her bag, watching
the receptionist tap a code into the alarm key-pad before
letting herself and the Boyfriend out. She locks the door
after them and the two walk past Rachel who smiles a
goodbye.
She watches them go.

We're looking through the glass doors to the shadowy
mezzanine level beyond. A DARK FIGURE stands silhouetted at
the door. We hear the scrape of tools working on the lock.
There is a click, the doors open and Rachel slips inside.
The alarm begins to BEEP. Rachel takes out a TORCH. A quick
twist and the beam becomes ULTRAVIOLET.
As Rachel moves swiftly towards the alarm box, the beam
from the torch sweeps across the girl's desk, and we see
Rachel's envelope glowing a deep PURPLE. We may also notice
that the desktop drawer unit where the girl placed the
money is smudged with purple FINGERPRINTS.
Rachel opens the alarm box and shines her beam onto the
keypad. We see four PURPLE FINGERPRINTS, one deeply
pigmented, the other three progressively less so.
Rachel takes a deep breath and punches the four marked keys
in what she hopes is the correct order. The alarm falls
silent.
She moves quickly out of the lobby, down the corridor...
190
190
...and into the main press room.
Using her torch on its regular setting, Rachel scours the
desks for information.
On one desk is a photograph of the journalist we just met -
YURI - HOLDING A LARGE FISH in triumph. Rachel dives into
the desk's FILING UNIT and begins to rifle through the
files.
Presently, she finds an OLD PICTURE OF VOGEL. He wears SS
uniform, the same shot we have seen before.
Behind it, a stack of SCRIBBLED NOTES. She begins to scan
them.

The Receptionist and her drunk BOYFRIEND stand at the doors
to the newspaper office, trying to open them. It takes them
a moment, as - unaware that it was unlocked - the girl has
accidentally locked it. Her boyfriend tussles with her
playfully, keen for her to let him try instead, but she
swats him away, turns the key again and finally they're in.

Rachel, unaware, is still reading through the notes. She

needs.

The receptionist stands by the alarm box, drunk and
confused, as the Boyfriend, impatient and equally drunk,
comes up close behind her and reaches round to clumsily
unbutton her coat.
RECEPTIONIST

That's weird.
The coat undone, the Boyfriend reaches round and snakes his
hands up inside her sweater. She ignores him.
RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
I set the alarm.
BOYFRIEND
What?

The alarm's not on.
BOYFRIEND
Who gives a shit?
He moves his hands from her breasts to grab her around the
waist and pull her away from the alarm box.

Rachel is still at the desk reading. Suddenly the main
LIGHTS are switched on and the Receptionist and the
Boyfriend stagger into sight.
Rachel stands frozen, COMPLETELY VISIBLE.
The girl and boyfriend stand kissing, too engrossed in each
other to see the woman standing only ten feet from them.
The Receptionist pulls free, laughing, makes it back to the
entrance and switches the lights off, plunging the room
into darkness.
Rachel moves behind a column.

Laughing softly, the Boyfriend leads the girl over to a

produces a PETTY CASH TIN.
BOYFRIEND
The loot!
He starts to take some cash from the box.
RECEPTIONIST

You can't!
BOYFRIEND
I'll put in an i-o-u...
He scribbles on a piece of paper.
BOYFRIEND (CONT'D)

He drops the note in the tin.

You're going to get fired.
He kisses her.

They kiss again, slowly backing up against the desk Rachel
was searching. The two struggle with their clothes.

Rachel has no way of reaching the door.
She closes her eyes as the young couple begin to have sex
on the desk.
Then she opens her eyes and notices something...
RACHEL'S P.O.V - CLOSE on her TORCH which is still on the
desk.
The Boyfriend seems to be staring RIGHT AT IT.

Rachel watches, holding her breath.
ON BOYFRIEND
...as we realise he is staring STRAIGHT THROUGH the torch,
lost in the moment.
Next moment the couple change positions and some books and
the torch are swept from the desk and clatter to the floor.
The TORCH ROLLS across the carpet to the shadowy entrance
of the cubicle.
BEHIND THE COLUMN
Rachel stares at the torch, wondering if she can reach it
before they can see her. But at the moment the desktop
tryst reaches its noisy conclusion.
AT THE DESK
The Boyfriend does up his trousers and pulls on his coat.
The Receptionist adjusts her dress. She notices the fallen
items and begins to pick them up, following the trail to
the torch.
BEHIND THE COLUMN
Rachel stands frozen as the Receptionist stoops down
directly IN FRONT OF HER and picks up the torch.
The Boyfriend notices.
BOYFRIEND
What are you doing?
RECEPTIONIST
I'm tidying up.
BOYFRIEND
Are you working? Are you at work
now?
RECEPTIONIST
(Laughing)
No, I'm not working.
BOYFRIEND
So leave them.
She drops the objects and follows her Boyfriend out.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09

Shaking, Rachel picks up her torch and replaces the items
she is still holding from Yuri's file into the filing
cabinet.
From OS, we hear the BEEP BEEP BEEP of the alarm being
reset.
Rachel's heart sinks.
OS, we hear office doors close, and the KEY TURNING in the
lock.
Rachel's eyes alight on A MOTION SENSOR, blinking in the
corner of the room.
She waits. And eventually - no choice - she runs for the
door.
The motion sensor lights up and the alarm strikes up loudly
with a warning BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.
196

Frantic, Rachel dashes to the alarm box, the insistent beep-
beep-beep even louder here. Rachel runs for the door, yanks
it open and bolts out.
Moments later, the alarm CLANGS into action.

Rachel has pulled over and is on her cell-phone to Stephan.

He's at the BABENKO Hospital.

STEPHAN (CONT'D)
It's outside Vinnycja. About a
hundred and fifty miles south-
west of you. What name is he
going under?
Rachel checks her notes.
RACHEL (O.S.)
Ivan Schevchuk. He's the right
age.
STEPHAN
When is he supposed to interview
him?

Tomorrow.
There's silence from the other end. Both know what this

This will be over soon. And when
it is...
Rachel hangs up.

A forest of fir trees pass as she drives. Rachel's mind is

The car drifts to the wrong side, then swerves as she
corrects.

RACHEL is being interviewed by a FEMALE FACULTY MEMBER.
Projected on a screen behind is an image of the young
Rachel, Stephan and David.
The audience consists of mainly female students, hands
raised.
STUDENT
Did you think you were going to
die?
Rachel seems to consider this carefully, although we know
by now that this is a question she's been asked thousands
of times and has a carefully rehearsed answer to.
RACHEL
I'll tell you something. At that
moment, when I was on the floor,
I wasn't thinking about myself at
all. I was thinking about my
mother. And what she had suffered
in Europe. I think that was what
gave me the strength to get up
again.
The audience listen, moved. Rachel looks out and then
FREEZES - Older David sits near the back of the room.
LECTURER
Well, I'm sure you'll all join me
in thanking Ms Singer...
As the audience applaud enthusiastically Rachel smiles,
trying to regain her composure but her eyes are drawn back
to David, standing in the shadows, watching her intently.

The place is empty now, only David and Rachel sitting in

David looks like a man who's been up on speed for too long,

Neither of them seems to be able to bridge the divide

Rachel ignores this.
She's waiting for an explanation.

DAVID
I expect so. (Beat) I read about

him. How is he?
*
RACHEL
(shrugs)
*
The same. Different. Resigned to

life at a desk. He likes to play
*
the tragic hero...
*
She stops herself, ashamed.
*
RACHEL (CONT'D)
Things became...very bad between
*
us. We try to stay civil for
*
Sarah.
*
DAVID
*
Have you met anyone else?
*
Rachel stares at him.
How can he even ask this?
*
RACHEL
No. Thank you for asking. There
*
was someone...but he left. And I
*
never heard from him again.
*
(beat, hard)
*
What are you doing here, David?
*
DAVID
*
I wrote you letters.

RACHEL
Pity you didn't send any of them

I wanted to see you...

RACHEL

I travelled a lot. The States.

Looking for him

RACHEL
Who..?

He doesn't answer and she looks up, suddenly realising who

he means. She feels a sudden, instinctive rush of fear.

RACHEL (CONT'D)
*
Why?
*
(beat)
*
What would you have done if you
*
had found him..?
*
He's watching her intently
*
DAVID
*
I would have told the truth. I
*
would have gone to the newspaper,
*
and said "this is the Surgeon of

Birkenau." I could have finally
*
seen him face trial.

Rachel listens to this, mesmerised.
*
RACHEL
*
And what would have happened to
*
us?
*

DAVID
*
We'd be free. Whatever happened

to us, it seemed to me we'd be
*
free.
*
Rachel stares at him without answering
*
DAVID
*
Don't you agree? Aren't you tired
*
of lying? Isn't that what you
*
would have done - if you'd found
*
him?
*
RACHEL
*
But it isn't just us. (Beat) It's
*
Sarah...
*
Beat. Something changes in David's face, something fading
*
away. He sits slowly back
*
RACHEL (CONT'D)
*
She hasn't done anything wrong.
*
DAVID
*
(Quietly)
*
No.
*
RACHEL
*
If the truth had come out she

would be destroyed. (Beat)
*
So...no, I wouldn't have told the

truth.
*
(A long beat)
*
But you never found him

She looks at him, waiting for him to contradict this.

DAVID
*
No I never did.

The LECTURER appears at the doors to the auditorium.

She stands up again, the spell is broken.

CLOSE ON RACHEL
...driving, lost in thought. She drives into some
grounds...
RACHEL'S P.O.V THROUGH WINDSCREEN
The BABENKO HOSPITAL - a huge, imposing building stands in
wintry grounds. A long drive leads up to the car park and
the entrance.

Rachel stares up at the building as she drives towards it.
208
208
The large lobby area, vast pillars. A few stairs lead up
from this to a waiting area, separated from the corridors
beyond by BARS AND LOCKED GATES.
Rachel approaches a young male REGISTRAR at RECEPTION.
RACHEL
(Russian)
Good morning. I'm here to visit
Mr. Schevchuk?
The man squints at her, checks his register an squints at
her again.
REGISTRAR
You're from the newspaper?
Because I have a man's name
here...
RACHEL
Oh, no, no. I'm Mr Schevchuk's
niece. Anna Barova. I've been
before, do you remember?
A moment's scrutiny, then a shrug.
REGISTRAR
Well, our visiting hours haven't
changed, I'm afraid. Eleven till
one.
He points to a PLAQUE that reads:
VISITING HOURS: 11:00am - 1:00am, 5:00pm - 8:00pm
Sarah glances at her watch. It's 10.25.
REGISTRAR (CONT'D)
Take a seat?
He points to a waiting area.
Rachel walks up the few stairs past a large PILLAR and
takes a seat, trying to think of her next step.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
104.
She glances to her left, through the bars, and sees an OLD
WOMAN in a patient's gown staring blankly at her from the
far end of the corridor. A DOCTOR appears and leads the Old
Woman away, still staring.
Rachel looks away, unnerved.
Someone has just walked in and is talking to the
Receptionist. Rachel's view is obscured by the pillar and
she leans slightly to see who it is.
RACHEL'S P.O.V - YURI stands showing his press card to the
Registrar.
AT RECEPTION
The Registrar passes the press card back.
REGISTRAR
Mr. Schevchuk is in room 414.
Visiting time starts at eleven
o'clock. You can take a seat over
there.
Yuri walks across the lobby, towards where Rachel is
waiting, but as he clears the pillar we see her seat is
EMPTY.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PILLAR
...Rachel waits for Yuri to pass and then slips back out of
the lobby.
209
210
Rachel's car is speeding down a narrow road that runs
behind the hospital. Two stone arches frame the road, where
the building meets the hillside.
RACHEL'S P.O.V - high fences - the forbidding facade of the
hospital - rows of barred windows.
Rachel is scanning the building, looking for some way in.
211
211
Suddenly we pass a central arched entrance. A man is
opening large double METAL DOORS for A LAUNDRY VAN to leave
the hospital.

It takes Rachel a few moments to register it. Then she
BRAKES.

Rachel runs up the staircase from the service area of the
hospital.
214

Long and bleak with rows of BARRED DOORS. Rachel runs on.
215

Yuri is writing in a notebook. The clock says: 10:50.
216

Rachel reaches a junction - the vast, white corridors
stretching away from her in different directions, like a
nightmarish maze.
She stares about her, picks a corridor and begins to run
again.
217
217
Rachel reaches a MAP on the wall and scans it, frantically
trying to locate the room she needs.
She hurries on to an ancient looking ELEVATOR and gets in,
jabs at the fourth floor button.
With a groan of its motor the elevator begins to rise.

RACHEL'S P.O.V - TRACKING past rows of NUMBERED DOORS.

Finally we reach it - ROOM 414.
Rachel stares at the door.
219
219
Rachel sits in a CUBICLE. She takes the BLACK CASE from her
handbag and opens it. Inside is a pen. She lifts this and
the false bottom of the case away to reveal a HYPODERMIC
NEEDLE and an AMPULE of a clear liquid. With trembling
hands she begins to prepare the injection.
She can't quite believe what she is about to do.
220
220
Rachel enters the room. The curtains are drawn and Rachel
hesitates for a moment, her eyes adjusting to the gloom.
A MAN sits in a chair, angled towards the window, his back
to us. An IV drip hangs on a stand, its tube running into a
cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the
chair.
The only sound is the faint, rasping breath of the man.
Rachel moves a little closer. On the bottom of the bed
hangs a medical chart. The name reads Ivan Schevchuk.
Rachel moves closer, carefully taking the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE
from her pocket.
221
221
A NURSE is unlocking the gate at the waiting area for Yuri.
He walks through them and over to the ELEVATOR.
222
222
Rachel stands by the IV drip and tube. She can inject
directly into the tube - and it will be over. She holds the
tube, rests the tip of the needle against it. She struggles
with herself. Just one tiny push...
She can't do it.
She stands frozen for a moment then slowly lowers the
needle.
Beside her, the steady breathing alters. The Man stirs and
a cadaverous face half turns towards us.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
107.
Rachel and Schevchuk stare at each other. The face is
ancient, lined...but IT ISN'T THE FACE OF VOGEL.
IVAN SCHEVCHUK
(Weakly)
Are you the journalist? (Beat)
Do you know who I am?
RACHEL
(Beat, meaning it)
No. No, I don't.
IVAN SCHEVCHUK
My name is Dieter Vogel. I am the
Surgeon of Birkenau. (Beat) Have
you heard of me?
RACHEL
Yes. I've heard of you.
Schevchuk looks at his withered hands.
IVAN SCHEVCHUK
(Simply)
I have killed thousands. You can
take my photograph. The last
photograph of the Surgeon of
Birkenau?
He struggles to raise his arm in the Nazi salute, a
pathetic sick man.
Rachel sits down at Schevchuk's desk, feeling suddenly
exhausted.
223
223
Yuri stands in the elevator waiting for the doors to close.
NURSE
Hold the doors please.
Yuri holds the doors, as the Nurse approaches, escorting an
ELDERLY WOMAN with a walker - the two moving at a snails
pace.
Yuri watches, amused.
224

We CLOSE on Rachel, lost in thought. Beside her Schevchuk
rambles on.

IVAN SCHEVCHUK (O.S.)

bred with apes. But we Aryans are

He dissolves into a fit of weak coughing.
Rachel stares at a NOTEPAD AND PEN on the desk beside her.

Yuri walks towards Schevchuk's room. He pays no attention

her cell phone. She listens to the other end ring.

Stephan nods, a fixed smile on his face, covers the

The two OFFICIALS leave the office, closing the door behind
them. Stephan takes a a beat to calm his breathing.

PULLING RACHEL
As she moves down another corridor.
She reaches an opening on her left, which reveals a
STAIRCASE winding around a central lift shaft, caged in
frosted glass panels.
She glances through it as she passes.
And just for a second we see an ELDERLY MAN walking down
the stairs.
Rachel has walked on a few steps before it registers, and
she stops -
VOGEL.
She walks back to the opening.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
112.
The figure seems to have retraced their steps, because they
are now walking FURTHER UP the staircase, on the other side
of the lift shaft - a shadowy figure through the frosted
glass which quickly disappears from sight.
Rachel stares after him, frozen. What did she just see?
239
239
She begins to climb the stairs.
240
240
Rachel comes through double doors and finds herself in a
long REC ROOM - PATIENTS and some STAFF grouped around the
room.
Rachel begins to walk through the room - elderly men all
around her, playing cards, reading, some sitting staring
vacantly.
She walks through them, staring at faces. Is he here? Is he
amongst this ordinary world?
She feels her pace quicken as she's drawn on through the
room. It's as if she's back at that terrible night. Vogel's
ahead of her somewhere, escaping all over again.
She FLASHES through DOUBLE DOORS into a junction area - a
long, empty corridor leading away from her on the right,
ahead another set of double doors...
She bursts through these doors and finds herself in...
241
241
A long, white tiled corridor of a room. A row of windows
down the right, under which sit WASHBASINS. There's a row
of LOCKERS and DOORS along the left.
Rachel walks on, feeling increasingly as if she's in a
dream.
She's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead-
end - there's no exit ahead of her.
VOGEL
(a dull rasp)
Why did you come...?
She turns and freezes.
Vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left. Now
he's between her and the doors on the far side of the room.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
113.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Why did you have to come? You
didn't have to follow me.
He begins to advance slowly towards her.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Was it Schevchuk? Did he talk?
Rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer. He reaches out a
hand as if to reassure her, a ghastly attempt at
reasonableness.
VOGEL
I can stop him. I won't tell him
anymore. (Almost pleading) Nobody
needs to know.
As if the spell has broken Rachel makes a sudden dart for
the doors. But before she can pass him, Vogel has moved
with surprising speed and, almost before Rachel has seen
the SCISSORS in his other hand, he has stabbed them into
her shoulder.
She reels over against the opposite wall, dislodging a
GLASS SHELF which shatters into a WASHBASIN behind her.
Vogel goes after her, pinning her against the basin, one
hand on her throat, the other hand trying to stab her
again. Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two
struggle frantically.
The scissors inch closer to her FACE, to her EYE.
Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a
piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across
Vogel's face.
He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at
his cheek.
Rachel collapses gasping to the floor.
Moaning, Vogel stumbles to a basin, blood dripping down
onto the white porcelain from his slashed face.
He suddenly notices Rachel has made it to her knees and is
trying to crawl towards the door,
He walks after her, pulls back her head, gets ready to stab
the scissors into her throat.
VOGEL
You Jews never knew how to kill.
Only how to die.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
114.
Then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body
doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the
PIECE OF GLASS Rachel has stabbed into his thigh.
He falls, almost on top of Rachel, and she finds herself
pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits
in agony.
His hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors.
Rachel grapples with him, almost embracing him, apparently
trying to prevent him for reaching it.
His searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open
in triumph, staring straight into Rachel's. He raises the
scissors above his head.
Then he stabs Rachel in the stomach.
Rachel jack-knifes, as if she's been punched.
Then...nothing. Both lie still. The only sound is Vogel's
rasping breathing.
Slowly Vogel gathers himself, drops the scissors, gets onto
his knees - the victor.
He climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door.
242
242
PULLING VOGEL
...as he walks down the corridor, breathing hard, trying to
make it back to his room, back to safety.
Suddenly he staggers against the wall.
Something's wrong, something in his back. He twists around
trying to locate the source of the strange sensation. And
there it is - the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE Rachel has stuck
between his shoulders.
He touches it with his fingertips, eyes wide with horror,
feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood. He
twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs
are already giving way and he collapses to the floor.
Moments later he's dead.
CUT TO:

Rachel manages to turn over, starts to drag herself up...
MUSIC begins.
244
244
As the music continues we see Yuri putting his coat on.
He's evidently finished his fruitless interview with
Schevchuk, who is sitting slumped by the window. Yuri
turns, about to leave, when he suddenly notices a NOTE upon
the desk, ADDRESSED TO HIM.
Surprised, he picks up the note and begins to read it.
INSERT
We see the first line - "My name is Rachel Singer."
