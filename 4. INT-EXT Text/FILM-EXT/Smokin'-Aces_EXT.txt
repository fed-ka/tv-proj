Neon-framed doors fly open as a slicked-back chump with a
store-bought tan strides out onto the strip, swinging underage
bar-bait on each arm. He's all strut and punk swagger,
grinning like a geek who just struck gold.
DUPREE (V.O.)
Buddy Israel, nicknamed "Aces" Born
a bastard, mom Laverne chased the
pipe dream from a Dairy Queen in
Kansas City to the Vegas stage. Two
months after stepping off a Greyhound,
she gets knocked up by some hood.
CUT TO SCENE:
A '51 Ford Fairlane, flush with an embankment, bullet
perforated, dead-body draped. A top-coated gunman (presumably
Primo Sparazza) stalks the vehicle's sole survivor, FREEMAN
HELLER; faux mafioso, full-time federal agent.
LOCKE (V.O.)
There wasn't enough evidence to bring
formal charges, so the case never
went to trial.
Heller collapses, the gunman looms over, levels a .45, FIRES.
LOCKE (CONT'D)
Sparazza is a bit of a specter.
Over the years, the serious crimes
with which he was thought to be
involved, including Heller's murder,
could never be traced back to him.
The gunman slinks back to his car as we--
CUT BACK TO:
The blind Tremor, walking wounded, piggybacking his brother
with the bum back, dragging the other by the scruff of his
neck, unconscious across the concrete. Police sirens squeal.
McGarey, the union guy, hairpiece hanging by a thread,
crawling toward his car. The piggyback Tremor brother reaches
into his blind brother's coat, grabs a revolver and unloads.
Long live the teamsters...Not tonight.
CUT BACK TO:
Crammed pedestrian crossing, noon hour a trio of SUITS
converse, shrouded by bodyguards.
WYMAN (V.O.)
Nobody really certain where he come
from...
The party proceeds through the crosswalk, approaching them
is a dark-suited man, expressionless, hands in his pockets.
Others move past; a woman with shopping bags, a skateboard
punk, a geriatric dog-walker and a man, full paralysis, mouth-
op wheelchair, "My Left Foot" palsy.
WYMAN (CONT'D)
...and when he moves on somebody,
they the last ones t'see it comin'--
The bodyguards perk up, sensing something. Dark-Suit,
removing his hands from his pockets-- cellphone...Wrong guy.
The crippled cat, throwing a quilt off his lap, contorted
face vanishing, two Uzi machine-pistols up, safeties off,
triggers pulled-- BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP!
The bodyguards get caught napping-- bullets blaze point blank.
The three suits collapse. The phony invalid empties both
guns, hops up from the wheelchair, hooks a passing truck and
flees the scene...that, was LAZLO SOOT.
DUPREE (V.O.)
So what do you think?
Dupree and Deeks in an empty parking lot, bundled up in
windbreakers, battling the frozen spindrift swirling in off
the lake.
DUPREE
Same place that rents the guard's
uniforms. There's a shift change at
9am. Graveyard goes home and we can
blend in with the day shift coming
on.
DEEKS
What about access cards? Pass keys?
DUPREE
We'll have to get our hands on them.
There's two separate units; Casino
Floor/Count Room Security and General
Hotel Security--
(annoyed, nods to car)
Does he want to hear this or what?
Deeks bangs on the hood of the car.
DEEKS
Hollis!
Elmore steps out, moving slowly to the rear of the car.
DUPREE
Nobody put a gun to your head.
Elmore leans against the bumper, bored.
ELMORE
Yeah, we've been through that.
38.
DUPREE
Then quit acting like somebody shit
in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave
us fifty grand.
ELMORE
--Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing
here, aren't I?
(beat, to both men)
Shouldn't that be enough? That I
made the trip?
DUPREE
Your attitude sucks.
ELMORE
I been accused of worse.
(glancing at uniforms)
What do we got...?
Dupree, dubious, does he continue...?
Fine. Fuck it.
DUPREE
Two security levels, the one we're
going in under the guise of, hotel
security, has restricted access.
They're mostly there to monitor the
lobby, handle disturbances on the
different floors and toss out drunks.
(beat)
There's a thirty-five member employee
rotation going from graveyard to day
shift. If we split up, we can blend
in and enter unnoticed. Once we're
inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
ELMORE
Then what--
--A Plymouth Barracuda passes by, brakes hard, reverses.
The trio stop talking, look over...and then their lives end.
Bad intentions blaze from the driver's side, machine-gun
bursts-- Dupree is hit flush, dead on his feet, his dying
thought, cut comically short; "I had that car in high scho--
Deeks, shredded where he stands, his body absorbing a
fusillade of rounds traveling at twice the speed of sound.
One creases Elmore's skull, another blows out Deeks' back,
fragmenting, claiming three fingers from Elmore's left hand.
The three of them fall in weird, waterlogged flops, no dying
breaths, no death rattles, just lights out...just like that.
Several seconds pass. Then the car door opens and The Tremor
Brothers, like circus clowns, clamber out in a cloud of gun
and reefer smoke. LESTER TREMOR, the dandruff-caked,
pockmarked middle brother is the first out. He shakes off
the cold, yawning, stretching, revealing all manner of tattoo.
39.
The Tremors' youngest brother, the Baby-Huey sized JEEVES
TREMOR bumbles out, pulling at his crotch. He unzips & rips,
baptizing the Cuda's tire with a truly prodigious piss.
DARWIN TREMOR climbs from the car, the eldest brother, straw
boss, brains of the outfit. He looks down at the dead men,
seems saddened by their state. Some remorse maybe? Maybe so.
JEEVES TREMOR
(still pissing)
Luvin' that, rat-tat-tat-tat, clean
as a nun's snatch on Kristal Nacht!
LESTER TREMOR
(stops singing)
Shut up fuckass, them spirits ain't
vacated yet, s'keep quiet.
JEEVES TREMOR
Them spirts can kiss my Chinese ass.
LESTER TREMOR
...YOU AIN'T NO CHINESE!
This exchange prompts Jeeves to turn and urinate on Lester.
Lester squeals war cry, launching a wild windmill barrage on
his behemoth little brother. Jeeves ignores the hydrant-
like urine stream soaking them both and starts swinging back.
Darwin kneels down over the dead Jack Dupree, taking Jack's
face in his hand and squeezing back and forth, adding his
own words in what amounts to a freakish ventriloquist act.
DUPREE (DEAD)
...I forgive you Darwin.
DARWIN TREMOR
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
DUPREE
If I needed your I.D. and your car
and me and my brothers were wanted
by the law, I woulda killed you to
get 'em too.
DARWIN TREMOR
You woulda?
DUPREE
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong
place at the wrong time. So don't
feel so bad dude.
DARWIN TREMOR
Damn...alright then.
DUPREE
I don't mind now anyway.
(MORE)
40.
DUPREE (CONT'D)
You know, up here in Heaven, it's
beautiful. Way better than fuckin'
Hawaii or any place like that.
Darwin's eyes begin to well, the tears coming slowly. In the
background, Lester and Jeeves beat e ach other ruthlessly.
DARWIN TREMOR
Really?
DUPREE
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm
gonna get laid by some fine ass angels
and then go hang out with Jesus and
them.
Darwin wipes his eyes.
DARWIN TREMOR
Man, that's great.
DUPREE
I got it made in the shade Amigo.
Hey, I'll see you up here some day,
don't worry.
DARWIN TREMOR
You think so?
Darwin uses his thumb and forefinger to make it appear as
though Dupree we're smiling up at him.
DUPREE
I know so.
Darwin smiles back down
at the corpse, wiping his nose on
his sleeve. He reaches
down and pulls out Dupree's wallet.
He spots the bondsman's
license, eyeballs the bail papers:
He sees the name ROBERT
ISRAEL in bold type. Puts it together.
DARWIN TREMOR
Damn Jack...you was after the same
sacka shit as us...Small world.
Darwin continues the pat down, pauses, pulls the envelope
with fifty grand inside, fingers fresh bills. With his free
hand he manipulates Dupree's dead mouth one last time.
DUPREE
Don't tell your asshole brothers you
know about it, that money is for you
old boy.
Darwin, a nod of acknowledgement for the dead Dupree.
41.
DARWIN TREMOR
I appreciate that pard...I wish I
coulda been a better friend.
Darwin stands, His eyes move to the guard's uniforms, still
laid out across the trunk...he looks over at his two brothers,
Jeeves now with a Lenny-like hammerlock on Lester's head.
DARWIN TREMOR (CONTD) (CONT'D)
Alright enough grabassin' goddamit!
We need t'get over t'that hotel.
WATTERS (V.O.)
We're already here baby.
CUT TO:
The Feds, heading toward their car, Carruthers snaps his
cellphone shut.
47.
MESSNER
He's giving them up?
CARRUTHERS
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I
think we should move.
MESSNER
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
CARRUTHERS
That's happening in about ten minutes.
Israel's at optimum risk of flight
right now, so we can't wait.
They reach their car.
MESSNER
What about the sheriff's task force?
CARRUTHERS
Have them mobilized. I'll phone
security and have the elevators locked
down and stairwells secured. We
need to keep Israel sequestered in
that penthouse.
SECURITY SUPERVISOR (V.O.)
No, I'm sorry, the penthouse is
currently under construction.
Elmore sits up in the sub-zero shallows of Lake Tahoe with a
start, stripped naked, shaking uncontrollably, his skin a
deep bruised blue. Dull pain quickly defines-- pinpoints,
bores in, bone deep...Death can't hurt this much.
He gets his breathing under control, the onset of hypothermia
turning his fingertips black-- his left hand, lighter three
digits-- he looks, comprehension sparks but can't catch-- he
stares impassively at the ragged space, for the moment, he
doesn't seem to mind their absence. He gropes the side of
his head, bullet-graze, blood congealed by the cold, the
concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind.
He crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up. He
reaches the sand, unable to pull himself up any further. He
turns back, sees the bodies of Deeks and Dupree, face down,
the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them...
MESSNER (V.O.)
Double homicide, gunshot vics, both
of 'em dumped in the lake. That's
where the Sheriff's task force is.
CUT TO:
A learjet touches down. THE CAMERA TRACKS, FINDING: Dr.
Gill, at a payphone, the cacophonous racket of taxiing
aircraft forcing him to repeat every other sentence.
DR. GILL
I'm here, where's the car?
61.
ISRAEL (O.C. OVER PHONE)
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
Gill looks around.
DR. GILL
Well I don't see him.
P.O.V. -- CAMERA PANS AROUND WITH HIM...
GILL
Should I take a taxi or what?
ISRAEL (O.C. OVER PHONE)
No, wait there. He'll be there.
...AS WE FIND:
A learjet unloading passengers-- The Swede steps down off
the plane, dressed as we last saw him, carrying the same
black leather valise. He's accompanied by two Sparazza thugs
who quickly escort him to an awaiting car.
The Swede looks over, sees Gill at the payphone...The two
seem to acknowledge one another as the Swede quickly climbs
into the car and closes the door--
CUT TO:
Hollis Elmore, hypothermia-ravaged, racked by seismic-like
seizures, body temperature terminally low. The delivery
door is flung open and A KID of about twelve stands there;
cross-eyed, coke-bottle eyeglasses, shirtless, wearing a
rising-sun head-wrap and karate Gee. He says nothing.
ELMORE
(sputtering)
Hel-- I-- ambula-- pleeeeee--
--Elmore collapses-- consciousness strains, snaps-- he blacks
out as his jaw collides with the concrete--
CUT TO:
--As Dupree's bagged corpse is hefted onto a coroner's gurney
and wheeled into an awaiting ambulance. Deeks' body follows.
The parking lot teems with local news trucks. Passerby's
crowd the police line. Messner is on his cellphone, incensed,
confused. A Sheriff's DEPUTY flanks him.
66.
MESSNER
No, no clarify. What is "an emergency
requisition of surrounding personnel?"
(beat, listens)
Within one-hundred mile radius,
understood-- Sacramento, Reno, Carson
City. So in less than an hour, we're
going to have anywhere from forty to
fifty odd field agents arriving,
without the slightest inkling as to
why they're here. Is that correct?
Am I misinterpreting that or--
(listens)
No, I'm not blaming any one person,
this is Bureau directive. But Agent
Carruthers is the SAC and he's out
of cell range at the moment, so I
can't contact him to--
(listens, frustrated)
Very well. I need to get Deputy
Director Locke on the phone as soon
as possible.
One of the Crime Scene Recovery TEAM MEMBERS approaches,
hands Messner a printout. A faxed, blown up rendering of a
Nevada Driver's license...We recognize the face.
MESSNER (CONT'D)
Who's this?
CS TEAM MEMBER
Hollis Elmore, resident of Las Vegas,
formerly with the P.D. there. He's a
known associate of Dupree's.
The CS Team Member holds an evidence bag aloft.
CS TEAM MEMBER (CONT'D)
We found these washed up on shore.
Messner takes the bag, gawks, can't quite make out the
contents.
MESSNER
What are these?
CS TEAM MEMBER
Elmore's fingers. Whorls are in bad
shape from the frostbite, but we got
a good pull for latents, positive
ID.
(beat, nod to bag)
Those were shot off.
MESSNER
Then we've got a third man missing.
67.
--Commotion close, Sheriff's task force members, hustling
past, hopping into cruisers, firing their sirens. A fifty-
something TASK FORCE CHIEF approaches Messner.
TASK FORCE CHIEF
We've recovered their car.
MESSNER
What car?
TASK FORCE CHIEF
Dupree's rental. A Dodge Stratus--
Picked up yesterday at a commuter
airport in Reno, Nevada.
MESSNER
(suddenly panicked)
--Where's it at now?
TASK FORCE CHIEF
In the parking structure of the Nomad.
CUT TO:
They amass around the elevator, taking care to double handcuff
Ivy now. Mustache pushes the call button. It fails to light.
CUT TO:
A gunshot in the distance followed by shrieks-- Darwin Tremor
snaps his head around at the sound, moving past platoons of
Cops and Feds now rushing that way. His I.D. is out,
affording him easy egress. He hops the stairs up, top level,
Barracuda parked at the rear of the lot. As he approaches...
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey...
Darwin glances over at...Hollis Elmore, standing there, skin
horribly discolored, disease afflicted. He wears a hooded
tourist sweatsuit; "Ta-Hoe, Ta-Hoe It's Off To Fun We Go!"
stitched in cursive across the front. He's holding the Colt
Python against his hip.
ELMORE
(nodding to Cuda)
That your car?
Darwin, a beat, what-to-do...hillbilly-acumen in overdrive.
DARWIN TREMOR
No, I'm confiscating it.
(holding up badge)
F.B.I.
Now Elmore raises the Colt with his good hand, advancing on
Darwin, moving gingerly, his legs not quite there...
ELMORE
You're F.B.I.?
Darwin tries to stay tight, composed.
DARWIN TREMOR
That's right...and I'd advise y'ta
lower your weapon sir.
Elmore keeps coming.
110.
ELMORE
You investigating those murders out
at the lake?
DARWIN TREMOR
(blanching a bit)
Ww...uh...
ELMORE
Three men were ambushed and shot,
two died and had their bodies tossed
into the lake, the other has severe
hypothermia, possible dementia and
will probably be a multiple amputee
by week's end...if he even lives
that long.
Darwin, uh-oh...
DARWIN TREMOR
No, I ain't even heard abou--
--Oops.
ELMORE
(even more menace)
You "ain't"--
(beat, teeth clenched)
You have any idea how close to death
I've been? You understand that I'm
dying now? That I've survived bullets
and frostbite and raging fever--
(holding up hand)
missing fingers and every fucking
imaginable horror in between?
Darwin...speechless...he's done.
ELMORE (CONT'D)
And I'm asking you now, "Is that
your car" and you can't even come
clean and do me the decency of a
straight answer, with the fucking
state that I'm in!?
Elmore, that Colt looking like a cannon this close to Darwin.
DARWIN TREMOR
Yeah, shit-- hell, you're right. I'm
sorry.
ELMORE
You shot me and murdered my friends.
DARWIN TREMOR
I did. We-- yeah, I know.
111.
ELMORE
And threw us into the lake.
DARWIN TREMOR
Pretty much, yep.
Elmore, still nodding.
ELMORE
And this is your car, isn't it?
DARWIN TREMOR
Mmm-hmm.
ELMORE
But there were more of you?
DARWIN TREMOR
Yeah, m'brothers...They didn't make
it.
ELMORE
Two of 'em?
DARWIN TREMOR
(nods, tears flow)
Thass' right.
(beat, wiping eyes)
I got other brother's though, so it
ain't so bad.
ELMORE
You were here huntin' a man named
Israel, weren't you? Your name is
Tremor.
Darwin gazes up at Elmore, some fraternal bond forms.
DARWIN TREMOR
I was. It is...That who you was here
for? Israel?
A pause. Elmore nods.
DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
Well...we both got beat out then,
didn't we?
Darwin, slowly lowering the Colt.
ELMORE
Yes we did...
(long pause, then)
Now, give me your car keys. And get
the fuck out of here.
Darwin, sifting through his pockets, tossing Elmore the keys.
112.
DARWIN TREMOR
S'fair...lemme just grab somethin'.
Elmore brings the Colt back up.
Darwin, hands up, hold on--
DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
No, no, no, I'm done with all that.
He reaches in, pulls a joint off the dashboard, forages,
finds matches, lights up, starts off.
DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
(to 'Cuda)
Probably needs to be tuned. Air
filter's old. Plugs might be bad.
Heater and AC ain't worked in forever.
(seeing Elmore waver)
There's some good drugs in the glove
box there, homespun, keep you smiling,
semi-lucid at leas'...
(beat, puffing away)
Well, God's speed t'ya then. Sorry
'bout all that. S'way a'the world
though, winners and losers y'know.
S'way it's always goin' be...
Darwin, walking away, taking huge hits off that joint,
traipsing down the steps, getting stoned out of his mind.
Elmore, considering, re-considering, looking at that Colt.
ELMORE
...Oh, fuck that...
--As he back shoots Darwin with all six rounds from the
Python, blowing holes through him. Darwin goes lop-sided,
legs failing, lit-joint still smoking in his mouth as dies
standing, only to fall like cut timber seconds later.
Elmore acts quickly, sliding into the 'Cuda and starting it,
that big block Hemi roaring to life under the hood.
CUT TO:
Pedestrians and passerbys drawn to the commotion at the Nomad,
the bottleneck bogs traffic down, making it impossible to
move. Elmore crouches low as police and emergency personnel
cross in front of the car... Slowly, the crosswalk begins to
thin and then finally clear...save a single man:
Messner...standing right in front of the Barracuda, staring
at the tires, staring at Elmore. The two lock eyes as he
moves around to the driver's side, reaching into his pocket--
--Elmore lifts the Colt up off his lap, putting his heavily
bandaged hand on the wheel. Then he sees Messner's FBI creds,
clipped to his belt-- can't tell if this one's legit.
113.
He sets the Colt down on the floorboard as Messner walks up,
pulling a plastic bag from his pocket: The one containing
three severed fingers. He glances down at Elmore's mummified
left hand, holding out the bag for him to take.
Elmore, unsure, accepting the bag, seeing what's inside,
embarrassed by it-- he sets it down on the seat next to him.
MESSNER
Your friends were taken to Carson
City Memorial, they're going to be
autopsied and shipped back for burial.
ELMORE
I'll take care of it.
Messner, nodding. A beat.
MESSNER
Who owned this car?
Beat.
ELMORE
The ones that killed 'em.
Beat.
Messner nods.
MESSNER
Where are they now?
Elmore looks up at him-- what does it matter...
ELMORE
I just want to go home man...I just
want to go home and forget this
fucking place even exists.
MESSNER
Where's that? Home.
ELMORE
Las Vegas.
Messner, a thought, then:
MESSNER
You're injured...Let me drive.
CUT TO BLACK
FADE UP ON:
