  0A0AOVER BLACK

          Begin with a familiar beep-beep sound a truck makes when
          it backs up...

          FADE IN:

  11EXT. MAINE LANDSCAPE - MORNING (STOCK)

            Extraordinary beauty shots.  A perfect New England day. 
          Peaceful and calm in the crisp morning air.  The beep-
          beep sound continues.


  22INT. JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          Close on Johnny in bed... shades drawn but light sneaking
          in the window... the beep-beep continues but it's coming
          now from an alarm clock by the bedstand... Johnny's eyes
          open and he reaches over and hits the button that turns
          the alarm beeping off.

          We hear someone moving around in the kitchen downstairs,
            refrigerator opening and closing, a pan clanking on the
          stove... Johnny reacts curiously to the sounds, comes up
          on one elbow...

                                        SARAH'S VOICE
                                  (downstairs)
                          Breakfast's ready!

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reacts, to himself)
                        Sarah?

          What kind of surprise is this?


          ANGLE

          He sits up - wearing a T-shirt and pajama bottoms and
          reaches out toward the nightstand where he would normally
          find his cane... it isn't there...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (murmering to himself)
                        Where's my cane?


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: NETHERWORLD - TEASER - 03/28/02 - GREEN  1A.


    2CONTINUED:2

          He discovers and picks up a photo of himself and Sarah in
          a heart shaped frame on the nightstand... reacts curiously
          and then looks around --


          P.O.V. - THE BEDROOM

          which has a definite female touch to the decor... with
          frilly, ribbony accessories and artwork that no single
          guy would ever be caught dead with in his room... and if
          that's not enough, there's a clear suggestion in the bed







































                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: NETHERWORLD - TEASER - 03/28/02 - GREEN  2.


  2CONTINUED: (2)2

          that someone slept next to him last night... and a negligee
          is hanging from the hook on the bathroom door... 


          RESUME JOHNNY

          as he reacts to the room...  he pushes himself to his
          feet and takes a tentative step as he looks around the
          room for the cane... then realizing --

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself, how can
                                this be?)
                        No pain... 

          He takes hesitant but pain-free steps across the room,
          toward a bathrobe hanging on a hook...  


          ANGLE - THE DOOR

          where little Johnny walks into view, rubbing his sleepy
          eyes... he pauses a moment at the door and looks in...

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                                (yawning)
                          Morning, Dad.

          And moves past to go downstairs.  On Johnny's stunned
          reaction...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  33INT. SMITH HOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - MORNING

          Johnny is wearing the bathrobe as he comes down the
            stairs... his eyes confused... moves toward the kitchen...
          hearing Sarah and little Johnny in mid-conversation...

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Mom, I just woke up...

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                        This is when your brain is fresh.
                        'Compare'.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY (O.S.)
                                (sighs)
                        Don't remember.

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                          C-o-m-p-a-r-e.  I thought you
                        studied these with your father.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        I did.   

          Johnny enters...


          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          to see the most typical domestic scene imaginable... Sarah
          at the stove cooking pancakes... she has a school list of
          spelling words by the stove...

                                        SARAH
                          'Repair"...

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                          I forget.

                                        SARAH
                                (seeing Johnny enter)
                        Your son is not cooperating.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't understand...

                                        SARAH
                          R-e-p-a-i-r... repeat it...

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                                (mumbling, rushed,
                                    disinterested)
                          R-e-p-a-i-r...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... what are you doing here...?

                                        SARAH
                                (gives him a look)
                          Studying for the spelling test. 
                        Which was supposed to be done
                        last night?

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        Why do we need to learn to spell
                        when we have Spellcheck?  

          He moves to her at the stove... 

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sarah... what is going on? 
                                (off her confused
                                look, sotto)
                        When did you tell him?

                                        SARAH
                        Tell who?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Johnny.

                                        SARAH
                        Tell him what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He knows.  About me.

                                        SARAH
                        What about you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That I'm his... you... he called
                        me 'dad'.

          A beat.  Sarah smiles quizzically at him, not understanding
          what he's getting at.

                                        SARAH
                        What do you want him to call you?

          She moves away from him to bring two plates of pancakes
          to the table... Johnny stands there like a boxer taking
          an eight count.

                        I'm hungry.

          He turns to see a darling three year old girl with tired
          eyes entering, carrying a Teddy bear...

                                        SARAH
                        There's a sleepy-head...

          And Johnny doesn't know how to react to this latest
            revelation... another child.  She moves to him and reaches
          up to be picked up like it's the most natural thing in
          the world.  But of course it's not at all natural to Johnny
          who hesitates a beat then after a quick glance toward
          Sarah, bends over and picks up the little girl.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello.

          She smiles at him.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Hi Daddy.

                                        SARAH
                              (a joke)
                        Daddy doesn't want to be called
                        'daddy' this morning.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Why not?

                                        SARAH
                        He was just about to tell us.

          All eyes to Johnny for the punchline of his strange joke...
          a beat as Johnny looks into the smiling eyes of the three-
          year-old in his arms...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Daddy...
                                (beat)
                        ...is just fooling around.

          And it's said with internal confusion raging and puzzled
          eyes but at the same time that line represents his turn
          away from trying to get answers.  Things are unreal. 
          It's absurd, he knows.  And he can't explain it.  So he's
          going along until he can.  As that process takes place in
          his mind for a beat or two, Johnny is just standing there
          holding a child and doesn't quite know what to do with
          her...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh... right.

          He moves to the table... and there's a little dance as
          she holds on to his neck as he tries to lower her into
          the chair but she won't let go...

                                        MIRANDA
                        In your lap, silly, like always.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Lap.  Right.

          Johnny sits in the chair and Miranda transitions into his
          lap, begins to eat.  Sarah brings the spelling list over.

                                        SARAH
                          Spelling words.  Test him.  Drink
                        your milk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right.

          He reaches for the glass of milk.

                                        SARAH
                        Not you.  Her.  Since when do you
                        drink milk anyway?  It makes you
                          constipated.

          Johnny reacts to the casual wifely intimacy of that...
          Sarah wants the spelling test to continue, picks out the
          next word to get them going...

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                          'Share'.   

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        Don't know.

          Sarah gives Johnny a look, get involved... Johnny reacts,
          tries his best...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Answer your mother.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        S-h-a-r-e.

          Sarah nods her approval to Johnny...

          There's a knock at the kitchen door... Walt sticks his

                        Naw, I stopped by the bakery for

          He looks at the little girl...

                                (evenly, self-aware
                                of the absurd humor
                                in this situation)
                        A pleasure to make your
                          acquaintance.

          She smiles at him.  He exits.


  44INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Dazed, Johnny enters... and all this is quite fast: the
          first thing he does is slap his face several times with
          both hands; nothing changes in the room...

          He gets back into bed, rolls over and closes his eyes and
          then reopens them... and gets out of bed... still nothing's
          changed.

          He shakes his head... unable to believe any of this... he
          quickly moves to a phone and dials a number.  After a
          couple of rings, a sleepy voice answers...

                                        BRUCE'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        Hello?

                        Johnny who?

                        Hello?

          Johnny reacts to the dead phone and...


  55INT. BATHROOM - MORNING - CLOSE ON A SHOWER HANDLE

          that says "cold".  Johnny's hand turns it on... the water
          comes on and we hear his shriek as the frigid water hits
          skin...


          ANGLE - JOHNNY

          jumps out of the shower... shivering naked in the middle
          of the room... whereupon Sarah walks into the bathroom as
          wives will do, finds a hairbrush... Johnny reacts to this
          casual traffic around his nudity... she gives Johnny a
          curious look...

                                        SARAH
                        What are you doing?
                                (she touches him)
                        You're ice cold.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nothing like a cold shower to
                        start the day.

          Sarah goes up on tip-toes to give him a quick affectionate
          kiss...

                        warming you up later on, won't
                        we?

          Off her inviting smile, as she exits with the hairbrush:

                        little kid who's running around
                        here?

          Again, it's said in deliberate humor, with self-awareness
          of his own situation as we...

                        far?

  88INT. OLD TOWN MALL - DAY

          As they enter.  We push in on Johnny... he studies the
          mall and his expression grows concerned: there's something
          about this mall that bothers him and he doesn't understand
          why... in the background, we hear the beep-beep of a truck
          backing up...


          WIDE ANGLE - JOHNNY

          dwarfed by the looming structure... giving it an ominous

                        the display booths... every school
                        has been assigned a number...
                        which will line up with numbers
                        we've put on the floor... see?

                        All over here.  They're responsible
                        for setting up their own booths...
                        but we'll have people here to
                        assist if necessary.  The only
                        access to the courtyard will be
                        from the east and west entrances...
                        There's some minor construction
                        over here on the south wing... 

          Johnny's head is throbbing now...


          ANGLE

                        We're working with the contractor
                        to keep the noise at a minimum
                        and they'll be putting in a plywood

          He pauses, glances back at the troubling mall... and as

  1212INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

          An attractive doctor in her thirties, SHARON WEIZAK, shines
          a penlight in Johnny's eyes...

                                        WEIZAK
                          Anything like this ever happened
                        before?  Any history of migraines?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not exactly.
                                (beat)
                        I... had a head injury once.

                                        WEIZAK
                        When was that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Almost seven years ago.  It should
                        be in my file...

                                        WEIZAK
                        You were treated here?

          She opens the file...

                                (reading)
                        Hockey injury, hockey injury,
                        hockey injury... no wonder you
                        get headaches...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nothing about a car accident?

                                        WEIZAK
                                (nothing there)
                        Are you sure it was this hospital?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure of anything this
                          morning.

          ELAINE, Johnny's nurse in the pilot enters, bringing some
          X-rays of his head which she hands to the doctor who puts
          them up on a backlight display to study them... she doesn't

          seem to recognize Johnny which is remarkable since he
          saved her daughter's life.  Johnny reacts.  Finally, to
          get Elaine's attention --

                                        JOHNNY
                        How are you, Elaine...

                                        ELAINE
                        Fine, thank-you.

          Cordial, but Elaine has no idea who he is.  She exits.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Elaine, she... has a daughter,
                        doesn't she...?

                                        WEIZAK
                                (still looking at the
                                  x-rays)
                        Her little girl died in a fire. 
                          Terrible tragedy.

          Johnny reacts, realizing the consequences of this new
          life.

                                        WEIZAK
                        The x-rays look perfectly normal.

          Off Johnny's reaction...


  1313INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

          Walt is waiting as Weizak comes out with Johnny.

                                        WEIZAK
                        If it comes back, take two
                        ibuprofen.  Call me if you need
                          something stronger.

          She smiles and moves away.

                                        WALT
                        Doesn't sound too serious.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, she says my brain is actually
                        better than it was yesterday.

                                        WALT
                        You should have eaten something
                        this morning.  That's probably
                        all it is.

    13CONTINUED:13

          Johnny acknowledges.  His eyes narrow as he sees --


          P.O.V. - A CANE

          A cane exactly like the one he's been using - leaning
          against an empty waiting chair outside the room - as though
          he put it there before going in.


          RESUME JOHNNY

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... is this doing here?

            Whereupon a near-by hospital attendant (who had left the
          cane there while picking up some supplies at a nurse's
          station) picks it up and moves off with it.

                                        WALT
                                (off Johnny's question)
                        It's a hospital, John.  They have
                        canes.

          Johnny nods but the image dwells in his mind.  As they
          begin to move toward the exit, they approach --


          A MAN BEING PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR

          by an attendant.  As they get closer, Johnny sees his
          faced is scarred with terrible burns.  As they pass, he
          looks straight into Johnny's eyes.  Johnny feels a chill
          run up his back.


          NEW ANGLE

          As they exit, Johnny almost bumps into Bruce as he's
          entering... their eyes meet...

                                        BRUCE
                        Sorry.  Go ahead.

          Bruce smiles and lets Johnny by and then moves off without
          a hint of recognition... Johnny pauses, turns back and
          watches him go down the hallway.  On Johnny's troubled
            expression...

                        No, no, I'll probably see you
                        there.

          Walt acknowledges and waves good-bye, pulls away.


          NEW ANGLE 

          Johnny turns and looks to take in the setting... after a
          beat --

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        I have no idea what I'm doing
                        here.  Or where I'm going.

          He stops a pair of elderly passer-bys...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me, do you know me? 
                          Commissioner Johnny Smith.  Would
                        you happen to know where my offices
                        are?

          On their puzzled reaction...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        It's just a little survey; we're
                        trying to raise public awareness
                        of county government performance...


  1515INT. COUNTY COMMISSION OFFICES - DAY

          Johnny enters uncertainly into a small bullpen of
          activity... at a desk, a young man in his twenties (MARCO)
          looks over and sees him arrive...

                                        MARCO
                          Finally.

          Marco is gay but it's no source of humor here.

    15CONTINUED:15

          He's a young man overwhelmed and in a rush...

                                        MARCO
                        Where have you been...

          Johnny looks curiously at this fellow he's never seen
            before...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had to stop by the hospital.

                        Well, it's already been a crazy
                        morning...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dry)
                        I might have guessed...

                        She's in your office.

                                (reacts, huh?)
                        She was moving pretty well when I
                        checked in on her...   

          Johnny turns to the nearest office door and starts to go
          in...

                                        MARCO
                        No.  In your office.

          Johnny turns around and considers other office doors...
          walks deliberately down the center of the room until he
          sees --

                        You've done something with your
                        hair, haven't you?

                        What are you talking about?  I've
                        had the same hair style for 
                          years...

          Glowing in the wonder of seeing her again --

                                        JOHNNY
                        It looks good.  You look good,
                        ma.

          She reacts to his unusual attention but has a suffering
          mother agenda that she wants to get to...

                        I don't know why.  I didn't sleep
                        all night.  I want you to call it
                        off.

                        And we're going to whether you
                        like it or not.  

          He kisses her on the cheek.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because we love you.

  1717INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Johnny enters uncertainly... seven people, the
            commissioners, waiting for him... he's never seen any of
          them before... the SUPERVISOR is mid-forties, heavy-set,
          strong face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry I'm late.

                                        SUPERVISOR
                        We all have mothers, John. 

          Johnny moves to an open chair in front of a series of
          windows to the square outside... sits...

                                        SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)
                        I do have another meeting behind
                        this one so we should jump right
                        into business...  I think it's
                        fair to say we were all very
                          impressed with the memo you
                          generated yesterday, John... would
                        you care to elaborate...

          All eyes turn to him... a long beat as Johnny considers
          an answer... finally --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think the memo speaks for itself.

          The bluff didn't quite work... people still wait for him
          to continue.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But... I'd... like to hear other
                          thoughts on the subject.  



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: NETHERWORLD - ACT TWO - 03/28/02 - GREEN  22.

          Turning to the closest person in the room... a man in his
          30s we'll call KEN...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        What do you think,...
                                (coughs to cover the
                                name he doesn't know)

          Outside, the sound of fire engines... sirens...

                                        KEN
                        Well, the federal guidelines are
                        clearly designed to raise test
                        scores.  The first question is
                        whether the district's schools
                        are prepared to meet these new
                          challenges...  

          As Ken's speech continues, Johnny's attention is drawn to
          the windows where louder and louder sirens can be heard...


          P.O.V. - OUT THE WINDOW

          Fire trucks, police cars, ambulances...  no one else in
          the room seems to be paying the least attention... the
          speeches fade behind the dominating sirens...

                                        KEN (O.S., CONT'D)
                        But Johnny's right -- if we focus
                          strictly on test scores, our kids
                        won't be getting a well-rounded
                        education; Johnny's point on page
                        two, paragraph 'b' about protecting
                        music and art and electives is
                          critical in my opinion...


          CLOSE ON JOHNNY

          troubled by the fire engines... the sirens grow even
            louder...

                                        SUPERVISOR (O.S.)
                        I tend to agree with you, Ken,
                        but the guidelines clearly
                          prioritize... 

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

          But Johnny's mind is far away... and Ken notices... Johnny

                        I just can't seem to... wake up
                        today.

                        I took a long nap recently.

                                        KEN
                        You should get away with the
                        family.

          Johnny nods, mind elsewhere.

                                        KEN
                        I'm serious.  Connie and I found
                        a great tennis resort... they
                        have a whole program for the
                        kids...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (interrupting)
                        Listen, you mind if we put off
                        lunch for today?  I just think
                        I'll go home.

                                        KEN
                        Sure, sure, no problem.
                                (beat, seriously)
                        John, there isn't much time left. 
                        Pretty soon, this'll all be over.

          And there's a dichotomy to that line that Johnny picks up
          on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... what do you mean?

                        You know what I mean.

          Johnny lets out a deep breath, not understanding how this
          Ken person could know but obviously he does but before he
          can ask him to explain, Ken continues --

                                        KEN
                        The kids grow up before you realize
                        it.  And off they go into their
                        own lives.  We have to spend time
                        with them now... while we still
                        can.

          Johnny reacts.  It was just part of Ken's encouragement
          to take a vacation... or was it?

                                        KEN
                        I'll see you later.  Feel better.

          Ken walks away.  Johnny thinks about what he said.  Near-
          by, we hear the beep-beep sound of a truck backing up on
          the street somewhere...

                        Oh!  You scared me.  You're home

          more important to be with Johnny and Sarah than to see

                        That was just after the pony bit
                        you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ah.

          He flips.

                        His first Halloween. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were the hottest vampire on
                        the block.  

          It's too painful and too ludicrous for Johnny to
          continue... and she notices...

                                        SARAH
                        What's wrong? 

          Off her look, Johnny searches for the words... finally --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm afraid, Sarah.

                        Afraid?

                        That this won't last.

                        What's that supposed to mean...?

                        I know how this sounds but...
                        I... I have another life, Sarah. 

          Her smile fades.

                                        SARAH
                        You're having an affair.

                        No, no... the only one I'm having
                        an affair with... is...you.

          Sarah smiles but happy with the news, cuddles up closer..

                        In that case, you got nothing to

                        I think... I'm imagining all this,
                        Sarah.  You, the kids, every damned

                        to tell you...  This...  isn't...
                        real.

          She studies him, takes his hand... and places it gently
          on her shirt over her heart...

          A party in full swing...


          LITTLE JOHNNY

          by a buffet table... Johnny moves over...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Leave a few chips for the rest of
                        us.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        I like a good chip.

          Johnny munches one.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So, how was the spelling test?

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        Easy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How easy?

                                        JOHNNY
                          A hundred percent.  Wow.  I get
                        it - you're one of those sneaky
                        smart guys.
                                (leaning, sotto)
                        You don't want to let on how smart
                        you really are.  Just like...
                        just like your father used to be
                        when he was your age.

          Little Johnny glows in his father's praise...  


          WALT AND SARAH

          Walt holding a drink, regarding a woman across the room...

                                        SARAH
                        So, just go talk to her.

                                        WALT
                        I don't do small talk very well.

                                        SARAH
                        This is small talk.

                                        WALT
                        This is different.  I know you.

                                        SARAH
                        How are you going to find your
                        soul mate if you won't talk to
                        any one, Walt?

                                        WALT
                        'Soul mate' - what the heck's
                        that?

                                        SARAH
                        The person you're meant to spend
                        your life with.

                                        WALT
                        You believe in that stuff?

          Her eyes catch Johnny's across the room, their eyes
          exchange an intimate, even post-coital smile.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.  I really do.

                                        WALT
                        I'd just settle for a good woman...

          She smiles encouragingly to Walt, pats his arm...

                                        SARAH
                        You'll find her.

          And moves away toward Johnny.  Alone, he watches her go,
          he finishes his thought to himself.

                                        WALT
                          Unfortunately all the ones I know
                        are taken.


          WITH JOHNNY

          as Sarah arrives...

                                        SARAH
                        Can't we find some girl for Walt?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is he coming on to you?

                                        SARAH
                                (he's harmless)

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because I can take him... he has
                        the upper body but I'm quicker...

                                        SARAH
                        Behave yourself.

          She kisses him...

                        Great party.

          She moves on... but after she's gone, Johnny looks across
          the room and feels sorry for Walt as he sees --


          HIS POV - WALT

            ill-at-ease, getting shot down by the woman across the
          room, standing alone now trying his best to appear at
          ease as he drinks his coke and looking horribly ill-at-
          ease... and then... COMING INTO FOCUS just behind Walt -
          Elaine, the nurse from the hospital, the one who lost a
          child.  It's curious that she's at the party since she
          didn't seem to know him that morning.


          JOHNNY 

          reacts to her...

                                        PURDY
                                (warm, friendly)
                        I think we really surprised your
                        mom this year.

          As Johnny turns to see REVEREND PURDY standing there,
          he's not in the mood to deal with him but there is no
            escape...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lying)
                        Yeah, yeah, we sure did.

    22CONTINUED: (3)22

          HIS POV - ELAINE

          glances over his way, smiles casually as though she does
          know him, walks out of view...


          RESUME JOHNNY

          as his face shows concern and confusion.  Purdy notices. 

                                        PURDY
                        You seem... troubled tonight,
                        Johnny.  

          Johnny looks at him, laughs uncomfortably, embarrassed at
          being caught with his feelings showing.

                                        PURDY
                          Anything I can do to help?  

          Johnny would normally dismiss the offer but tonight it
          seems appropriate.  He's deeply conflicted...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You believe in miracles, don't
                        you, Reverend?

                                        PURDY
                        I'd better or I need to find
                        another line of work. 
                                (beat)
                        Do you?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (mostly to himself)
                        The question of the hour.

          The forlorn Walt joins them... just so he won't be standing
          by himself any longer.  Johnny looks straight at him as
          he continues to Purdy...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Imagine if a man could choose his
                        own destiny, re-invent himself at
                        will.  Make himself happy.  And
                        damn the consequences to anyone
                        who happens to be hurt as a result.

                                        WEIZAK
                        Of course, you're not in a coma.  
                        You're right here talking to me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I never saw you before today...
                        and it wasn't even in this life...

                                        WEIZAK
                                (to Bruce)
                        Is he on any medications?  

          Bruce shakes his head, no.  To a nurse who has rushed
          over --

          Johnny reaches the door to his old room... it's closed...

                        I just need to see...

          He pulls free of them... and pushes the door open to the

          JOHNNY IN BED

          just as we saw him in the pilot... still in the coma... 
          his fears have apparently been justified - none of this
          is real...


          THE CONSCIOUS JOHNNY

          moves to his own bedside... breathing hard, heart
          pounding... looks down at himself....

          lying on his back... quick move down to his face... as he

          And now, for the reader's benefit, this really is
          reality... although Johnny doesn't know that yet.

          Johnny sits up and finds himself in the courtyard of the
          mall again...  He looks around at the mall which now is
          crowded with high school students setting up their display
            booths... a sign says "Penobscot Youth Art Fair"... a
          handful of people are looking at him, concerned... Bruce
          is beside him...

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (looks at Bruce)
                        What happened?

                                        BRUCE
                        We were checking out the art
                          festival when you got a terrible
                          headache... and then you fainted...

          sure why yet.  His head still pounds...

                        the art festival...

                        for almost thirty seconds...  


          HIS POV

          There are people there he recognizes - people from the
          other life... the man with the burned face in the wheel
          chair, the bike rider, the waiter, other burned faces
          from the party (none of them are burned here), plus members
          of the county commission, the supervisor... this time the
          cane is beside him...


          JOHNNY

          As he feels the pain in his leg, reaches for his cane to
          get up, one man we recognize as Marco moves over to help
          Bruce get him up...

                        Johnny, you had a bad dream... it
                        wasn't real...

                        Sarah, it was so real, so
                          overwhelming that my mind couldn't
                        begin to handle it.  That's why
                        my mind is a jumble.  Right at
                        this very minute, I'm... I'm lying
                          unconscious on the concrete floor

                        You need to talk to somebody. 
                        Ken told me about a therapist...

                        Ken isn't real.  I don't know Ken.

                                        SARAH
                        Ken and Connie are our best
                          friends.  They were here for dinner
                          Saturday night.  I made a pot
                          roast... you made your famous
                          Chocolate Surprise for desert...

                        Afterwards we played scrabble and
                        watched that horrible Adam Sandler
                        movie you and Ken rented...*

  39A39AGOING DOWNSTAIRS

          He rushes down, Sarah right behind him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call Walt.  Tell him to send every
                        man he's got to the mall.

          At the bottom of the stairs, the kids, still in pajamas
          move out of the living room where we can hear the sound
          of Sponge Bob (or something comparable) on the TV...
          Miranda holds her teddy bear...

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        Where you going, Dad?

                                        MIRANDA
                        Can I come?

          And they stop Johnny in his tracks... and Miranda reaches
          up for him to pick her up... it's heartbreaking for Johnny
          because he knows they may never exist for him like this
          again.  He picks up Miranda...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, baby.  Daddy can't take you
                        with him.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I wish I could.

          He hugs the little girl and rocks her in his arms.

                        Johnny?  Are you positive?

          Johnny puts Miranda down and studies his son sadly, smiles
          at him... he wants so much to believe... but...

                        I have to go.

                        No... no... no... we need search

          He rushes ahead... feels his headache coming on again...
          Walt follows...

                        John, I went through all the
                          preparations with you yesterday...
                        it's going to be fine...

          ROSCOE, the deputy who's doing security and helping people
          set up their booths comes over to find out what's going
          on...

                        Humor me, Walt.  Help me.  For
                        reasons I can't explain, I have
                          information that there's going to
                        be a terrible disaster here.  Are
                        you really willing to take the
                        chance that I'm wrong?

          Roscoe reacts and looks to Walt...

                        Look, dammit, if I'm a county
                          commissioner... I can give an
                        order to... to protect public

                        we look around.

          Roscoe moves away.  Walt moves with Johnny, tight jaw,
            unconvinced...

                        We need help, Walt.  

          Walt sighs and gets on his walkie-talkie...

                                        WALT
                                (to the walkie)
                        This is the Sheriff.  I want to
                        conduct another security sweep of
                        the area... report anything
                          suspicious.

                        People, we need to evacuate this
                        area for a few minutes... sorry
                        for the inconvenience... could I
                        have everyone take the north
                          escalator down to the street
                          please...

          The art students and teachers react curiously but follow
            orders... Johnny and Walt begin to move around the
            courtyard looking for some clue to the disaster Johnny
          knows is going to happen...


          NEW ANGLE

          as a sound draws Johnny's attention... the beep-beep sound
          that has haunted him from the beginning of this
            nightmare... the sound of a truck backing up.  He reacts
          to the sound... and it draws him toward --

  4444THE CONSTRUCTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

          workers in hard hats are busy... a welder is at work... a
          forklift truck is on site as well... the sound of beep-
            beep-beep is coming from it as it backs up... 


          JOHNNY'S EYES

          are drawn to the...


          FIERY WELDER'S TORCH

          sparks flying from the metal it's welding... the sparks
          sprinkling away to the floor as...


          THE FORKLIFT

          backs up and accidentally hits one of a bank of large
          propane tanks strapped to a steel post, rupturing the...

          the welded seam splitting open, hear and see the gas belch
          out...

          But...


          THE GAS

          ignites from the spark... and explodes like the shooting
          wall of flame Johnny saw before... it wipes his view and
          the screen...

          WIDER

          as he gets up and he's back at the Old Town mall courtyard
          which is undamaged... his head is pounding... but he
          staggers past people who get out of his way toward --


          THE CONSTRUCTION SITE

          where the same scene we saw before is taking place... the
          forklift is beeping, backing up... it's too late and too
          noisy to reach the driver but he can get to --


          THE WELDER

          at work with his torch...


          JOHNNY

          battles the pain in his head to move forward to the
            welder... who looks up at the civilian stumbling toward
          him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Turn it off.  Turn it off!  Now! 

          The welder turns off the torch safely and looks over with
            curiosity at Johnny.  A moment later --


          THE FORKLIFT

          hits the propane tank, rupturing the seal... workers
          quickly react to...


          THE PROPANE TANK

          and move in to seal it.


          THE WELDER

          takes off the mask and we see his face for the first time --
          it's Ken.  His face shows the shock at the discovery...

                                        KEN
                        Mister, that could have been
                          serious.  Don't know how you saw
                        it coming.  But thanks.

          JOHNNY

          nods, takes a deep breath of relief... his headache finally
          gone.  Bruce moves quickly over... and of course, he has
          no idea what almost just happened but he knows enough
          about Johnny to realize that he just prevented a
          disaster...

                                        BRUCE
                        How bad was it gonna be?

                        You gonna be okay or you want to
                        me to run you by the hospital?

          Johnny gives him an even, exhausted look...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Think I'll skip the hospital this
                        time around.

          As he moves away, on Bruce's curious reaction...

          As Johnny enters... alone as always... using his cane as
          he must... he takes a few beats to look around the quiet,
          oh, so empty house... takes a deep breath...  The phone
          rings... he moves to answer it...

          Johnny takes a long beat.

                        it so... surprising.

          Sarah smiles.  That Johnny, he has such a funny sense of
          humor.
