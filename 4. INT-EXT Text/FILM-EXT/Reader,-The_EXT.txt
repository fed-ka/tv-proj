1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the
street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway
leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to
get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a
wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS
walks past.
3.
MICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand
over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the
pavement and seizes him by the arm.
HANNA
Hey. Hey!
HANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties.
She disappears. He's sick again. She reappears with a bucket
of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down
with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket.
HANNA
Hey, kid. Hey.
MICHAEL
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Effortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his
head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly
he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head.
HANNA
Where do you live?
HANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted
with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his
satchel, she is pulling him by the arm.
They come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops
outside his block, as if nervous she might come in.
MICHAEL
It's here. I'll be fine now. Thank
you.
HANNA
Look after yourself.
MICHAEL smiles `Thank you' and goes in. HANNA is left alone.
She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping
uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came.
MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision.
1959. A sunny day in March. MICHAEL's bed has been moved
beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is
sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving
round behind him, tidying the room.
CARLA
How are you feeling?
MICHAEL
Better. By the way, I meant to tell
you, the day I got ill... a woman
helped me. A woman in the street.
CARLA
She helped you?
MICHAEL
Yes. She brought me home.
CARLA
Do you have her address?
MICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is
looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The
woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building.
The WORKMEN look up, curious, as MICHAEL flies by, slamming
the outer door.
The tram making its way along the quiet street.
MICHAEL is standing on the other side
of the street from
HANNA'S courtyard. He is in two minds
about whether to go in.
The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He
waits for them to
finish before he slips in through the
archway, making his way
to the stairs.
A massive brownstone building. The whole SCHOOL is coming
out, but MICHAEL is first, in a desperate hurry, waving
goodbye to his friends and running quickly away.
MICHAEL comes out the back door of the school, unobserved,
climbs over the railings and starts to run down the street.
An empty tram moving through the eerie early morning streets.
MICHAEL appears walking alongside it and gets on.
The tram is heading out of town.
The tram comes to a halt and PASSENGERS get on.
MICHAEL watches the tram disappears up the hill. He looks
around, lost, in the middle of nowhere. A tractor goes by,
WORKERS heading to the fields. MICHAEL sets off to walk back
to town.
Seen from outside, a shop full of stamps. MICHAEL and a STAMP
DEALER with white hair and a moustache. MICHAEL is offering
his pyramid stamp, his gestures becoming desperate as the
STAMP DEALER shakes his head, clearly not giving him as much
as he hopes.
22.
Then MICHAEL concedes, the DEALER concedes, and a bunch of
notes are handed across. MICHAEL runs exhilarated out into
the street.
MICHAEL'S VOICE
"Danger will only increase my love,
it will sharpen it, it will give it
spice. I'll be the only angel you
need. On this arm, Luise, you will
go dancing through life. You will
leave life even more beautiful than
you entered it. Heaven will take
you back and look at you and say
`Only one thing can make a soul
complete, and that thing is love.'
HANNA and MICHAEL are whizzing down a hill together on
bicycles. He has a rucksack. It's a rural paradise - hills on
all sides, a gleaming river below, the sun shining brightly.
She is wearing a blue dress.
They come to a cafe and sit down outside. They pick up the
menus on the table. A WAITRESS arrives.
WAITRESS
So what would you like to have?
MICHAEL
What are you having?
HANNA
You order. I'll have what you have.
MICHAEL starts giving the order. Next to them are a group of
BOY SCOUTS, who are laughing among themselves.
BOYS
There's sausages, sausages or
sausages. Give it to me, come on,
give it here. Let me have a look.
You always have the same thing.
They all laugh. HANNA watches them nervously.
The meal finished, MICHAEL is alone, paying the bill.
WAITRESS
I hope your mother was happy.
23.
MICHAEL
Thank you. She enjoyed her meal
very much.
The WAITRESS goes. HANNA returns from inside. MICHAEL holds
out his arm to her, which she takes. They walk away towards
their bikes. He is smiling. MICHAEL looks round, then dares
to reach across and kiss her on the lips. The WAITRESS
watches.
They get off their bikes at a small church. MICHAEL stops and
gets out a map and a guide book.
MICHAEL
Here, let me show you where we're
going.
HANNA
It's OK, kid. I don't want to know.
The sound of a choir from inside.
HANNA is in a river, the water up to her calves, her skirt
tied round her thighs. She is completely absorbed. Then she
looks up, aware of being watched. MICHAEL is sitting with a
notebook.
HANNA
What are you doing?
MICHAEL
I'm writing a poem. About you.
HANNA
Can I hear it?
MICHAEL
It's not ready. I'll read it to you
one day.
24.
MICHAEL swings his car into place. He gets out and heads
across the road, prosperous, purposeful.
MICHAEL is riveted as SOPHIE swims fast and lithe through the
water. Around him, YOUNG PEOPLE are lounging round on towels.
It's the social centre. HOLGER and RUDOLF are rubbing their
hair with towels as SOPHIE approaches.
HOLGER
Michael the water's fantastic.
MICHAEL
It's wonderful, isn't it?
HOLGER
Wonderful. It's going to be a great
summer.
MICHAEL looks across to where a group of AMERICANS are
shouting and playing a very loud game of volleyball.
HOLGER
Now the Americans have allowed us
back in our own lake.
SOPHIE
Why are they so loud?
HOLGER
You should see their stores. They
have everything.
MICHAEL
Oh sure. Everything mankind could
ever dream of.
SOPHIE
You don't like Americans?
MICHAEL
Just it's more fun without them.
He looks SOPHIE straight in the eye. There is a sudden
silence, MICHAEL looking straight at SOPHIE. SOPHIE looks
down. Then MICHAEL moves slightly to pack up his stuff.
27.
SOPHIE
Why do you leave early?
HOLGER
He always leaves early.
MICHAEL is cycling back towards town, a smile on his face.
MICHAEL is watching SOPHIE swimming, a look of anxiety in his
eye, when HOLGER touches his shoulder.
28.
HOLGER
Get a move on, we're leaving early
today.
MICHAEL
Why? What for?
HOLGER
We're going back to Sophie's. It's
your birthday. We're giving you a
party.
HOLGER and RUDOLF disappear to get dressed. SOPHIE appears in
her swimming costume.
SOPHIE
Come on, it's a surprise. We
thought you'd like it. We've been
planning it for weeks.
MICHAEL
I'm sorry. Really. I promised
someone I'd do something else.
The others are furious with him. They all go off.
MICHAEL is cycling towards HANNA'S apartment, his hair wet
from the lake, looking equally unhappy.
MICHAEL is sitting on the pier watching as HOLGER, RUDOLF and
SOPHIE swim competitively out to a pontoon, then turn back,
full of energy and high spirits. MICHAEL watches for a while,
then suddenly he gets up and starts to run away from them
all.
SOPHIE
Michael. You all right?
But MICHAEL is running away across the lakeside beach.
MICHAEL is alone in the deserted pool. He is on the jetty. He
takes off his clothes and slips into the water. Just his
head, like a seal's, at one end, just out of the water, quite
still.
1958. The sun slants, and for a few seconds the water
dazzles. He slips his head under.
They drive through the gleaming streets. It's been raining -
Berlin is glistening. Their voices :
MICHAEL
I admit it now, I was nervous.
JULIA
I was nervous too. It's silly isn't
it?
MICHAEL
It is silly.
JULIA
Thank you for dinner.
MICHAEL
I'll see you very soon.
MICHAEL lets JULIA out, and is watching her safely to her
door from the car.
JULIA
Good night, Dad.
MICHAEL suddenly gets out himself.
MICHAEL
Julia, wait. I want to ask you a
favour.
JULIA
What favour?
34.
MICHAEL
I want to take you on a trip. I
want to show you something.
JULIA
When?
MICHAEL
Tomorrow, maybe. Can I pick you up
in the car?
JULIA doesn't need to say anything.
MICHAEL
At ten, say.
JULIA smiles.
MICHAEL
Then good.
MICHAEL hugs her, his heart aching with love. JULIA goes in
to her place. MICHAEL is left standing still in the plaza
outside, not moving. Underneath the sound of what follows,
thirty years previously.
The STUDENTS are having a cigarette in front of the huge
building. Two black vans with barred windows come by,
carrying prisoners. The first one veers close to MICHAEL on
the pavement, then disappears into the inner courtyard. ROHL
smiles at MICHAEL.
MICHAEL
Why all the police?
ROHL
They're worried about
demonstrators.
MICHAEL
For or against?
ROHL
Both.
The train hurtles through the German countryside.
MICHAEL, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out
into the night. His eye lands on a student room in which a
couple are making love.
MICHAEL walks along an empty wooded road, miles from
anywhere. The sun is shining through the trees behind him.
52.
The wire fence of a concentration camp, deserted. MICHAEL,
with a back-pack, goes alone through the metal gate. MICHAEL
walks among the deserted empty huts.
MICHAEL thinks back, to HANNA in her bedroom saying `No you
read', to her looking puzzled at the menu on the bicycle
trip, and to her throwing a book away in the apartment. At
this moment, MICHAEL realises she is illiterate.
MICHAEL is standing smoking a cigarette in the waiting area.
A whole number of visitors, old people, children, families
are waiting. Some kids are playing with a football. Then a
GUARD arrives and calls out names. MICHAEL's name is called.
MICHAEL is led in the GROUP towards the visiting room. It has
come on to snow. As he walks towards the room, he loses
heart. He changes his mind. The rest of the GROUP go on, as
he falls behind, watching them go. He begins to turn back.
MICHAEL turns away and heads back the way he came.
A lot of people heading into the courtroom. As the seminar
group goes in, MICHAEL hangs back. ROHL looks at him as he
goes through the doors. MICHAEL is left outside, then goes to
watch as the vans arrive.
60.
MICHAEL walks away through the cameras and news crews.
61.
MICHAEL walks with JULIA towards their old house. He looks
round, the memory of coming with HANNA as a sick boy 18 years
earlier clear in his mind. The same landmarks.
On the other side of a busy Berlin street full of traffic,
MICHAEL holds JULIA'S hand, a loving father, to guide her
across the street.
A montage of MICHAEL reading and HANNA listening. MICHAEL is
reading different books. He is animated now, excited. There
are extracts from The Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway) ;
Anatol (Schnitzler) ; The World of Yesterday (Zweig) and
Doctor Zhivago (Pasternak). MICHAEL catching fire with
excitement with what he is doing. HANNA collecting the tapes
from the mail room and organizing on her shelves - her
library growing.
HANNA is walking round with other PRISONERS, in sequence.
Suddenly she stops dead, an idea hitting her.
1981. MICHAEL is coming down a busy Kreuzberg street. He is
37. He goes into his block. He opens the door : the place is
much more lived-in. He picks up his mail. Thumbing through
it, he sees a letter in childish handwriting. MICHAEL frowns,
opening it and taking out a piece of paper.
MICHAEL stands looking out over Berlin from his balcony.
71.
MICHAEL walks along the road by the prison wall, then goes to
the guichet to sign in.
MICHAEL is waiting in a small barred waiting area as MS
BRENNER walks across the yard to open the gate and let
MICHAEL in.
MS BRENNER
You're Michael Berg?
MICHAEL
Yes.
MS BRENNER
Louisa Brenner. We were expecting
you earlier.
MS BRENNER is walking MICHAEL up the steps towards the prison
canteen. They pass GUARDS and INMATES.
MS BRENNER
I should warn you: for a long time
Hanna held herself together. She
was very purposeful. In the last
few years she's different. She's
let herself go.
MICHAEL comes out of the main entrance. He stands a moment,
looking round at the evening. MICHAEL walks to his car.
MICHAEL gets out of the car. He is carrying a bunch of
flowers. He walks towards the prison. He leans in to the
GUARD who is in a modern office.
MICHAEL rides in a taxi into Manhattan. A view of the
familiar skyline.
MICHAEL'S taxi comes up Fifth Avenue. It draws up outside an
expensive apartment block. MICHAEL gets out and goes in, the
Manhattan skyline opening up behind him.
1995. MICHAEL is driving JULIA in the big Mercedes through
the German countryside. He is tense, silent. JULIA takes a
sideways look at him, but he does not respond.
81.
JULIA
Where are we going?
MICHAEL
I thought you liked surprises.
JULIA
I do. I do like surprises.
They draw up at a church. It is the same one he and HANNA
passed on their bicycles years before. MICHAEL and JULIA get
out and walk towards the graveyard at the side.
MICHAEL & JULIA stand at a deserted grave-side. The whole
cemetery is seen. MICHAEL stoops down and uncovers a simple
stone : HANNA SCHMITZ 1923-1988. JULIA watching, says her
name.
JULIA
Hanna Schmitz.
JULIA waits a moment.
JULIA
Who was she?
MICHAEL
That's what I wanted to tell you.
That's why we're here.
JULIA looks, waiting. MICHAEL looks for a moment as if he
will not go on.
JULIA
So tell me.
There is a moment, then they turn to stroll, MICHAEL talking,
starting to tell the story.
MICHAEL
I was 15, I was coming home from
school, I was ill...
They walk away among the trees.
