Walt and Billie sit at a table. A Cadillac can be seen
through the window (ATLANTA LANDMARK), parked beside the
restaurant.
BILLIE
Here they are.
Walt looks out the window and sees Chris drive up in his
old yellow Datsun with Carine in the passenger seat
beside him, and pulls up to the space beside the
Cadillac.

Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the
LAST LINE OF THE POEM...
CHRIS
I say...Do what you are going to do,
and I will tell about it.
CARINE
Who wrote that?
CHRIS
Well, it could've been either one of us,
couldn't it?
He hands a book of Sharon Olds' poetry to her.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
There's a lot of great poems in there.

Congratulations, son.

CHRIS
My grades are gonna be good enough, I
think, to get into Harvard Law.
WALT
That's a big deal. What do you have left
in your college fund?
CHRIS
It's an inheritance, dad. I've only been
spending it as a college fund...Exactly
twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars
and sixty-eight cents.
BILLIE
That's very specific.
CHRIS
I had to go to the bank this morning.

WALT
Well, we'll certainly contribute the
balance for Harvard.
CHRIS
Yeah. I've got to figure out what I'm
going to do. I got a lot of things to
pack and organize here first.
BILLIE
I'm so glad you're getting out of that
place you're living. It was so much
nicer when you lived on campus.
WALT
You'll come to Annandale before you
disappear on us, won't you?
CHRIS
(reluctantly)
Sure, I will.
Carine's not so sure.
BILLIE
You promise?
CHRIS
(whining)
Mom.
BILLIE
Well, your father and I want to make a
present to you.
WALT
We want to get you out of that junker.
CHRIS
What's a junker?
Walt points outside to the Datsun.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
The Datsun?
WALT
Yes.
We want to get you a new car.
CHRIS

A new car? Why the hell would I want a
new car? The Datsun runs great.

CHRIS (CONT'D)
(Mocking the Cadillac)
Do you think I want some fancy boat? Or
are you worried about what the neighbors
might think?
BILLIE
We weren't going to get you a Cadillac,
Chris. Just a nice new car that's safe
to drive. You don't know when that
thing's just going to suddenly blow up.
CHRIS
Blow up? Blow up?! Are you guys crazy?
It's a great car. I don't need a new
car. I don't want a new car. I don't
want anything. Thing, thing, thing.
Under the table, Carine jabs Chris' leg.
Chris returning
to polite -
CHRIS (CONT'D)
But, thanks anyway.
WALT
Everything's gotta be difficult.
CHRIS
I said thank you. I just don't want
anything.
The group returns to some superficial calm.
CARINE
I wouldn't say no to a new car.

OVER Chris' shoulder, he frisbees his graduation cap from
the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on
the street.

As they wave goodbye, Carine catches the cap from the
backseat window. And with a parting smile to her
brother, she poses with it on her own head. Chris smiles
and waves goodbye.
As the Cadillac drifts away, his smile disappears into
something other than sadness.

In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster
on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from "The
Good, The Bad, And The Ugly."
We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor -
Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak.
Beside them, a camper's backpack.
Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight.
The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But
on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank
envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes
a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the
same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all
my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris
McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a
pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston)
envelope.
He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the
cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each,
he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one. Finally
coming to his social security card, he holds it to the
candles flame. As the flame burns bright we -

Chris McCandless, in the same clothes he had been in back
in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the
Datsun. His head supported by his backpack. We begin to
HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It
rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to
a deafening level. Chris awakens.
11.
As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through
the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the
leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of
water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun,
momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is
SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright,
disoriented.
POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight,
water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.
However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe
him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water,
while violent seems to have topped off just above the
wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the
car settles into its new position below the cliff. He
returns to sleep.

Chris McCandless speaking to camera holds a microphone in
a shadowy room, doing his Geraldo Rivera. It's tongue-in-
cheek at best.
CHRIS
This is Emory University freshman Chris
McCandless reporting from the vault at
Thompson Hall.
He indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a
brightly lit corridor below.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
We have just dynamited the hatchway and
are the first human beings to step foot
into this vault in over a hundred years.
Somewhere in here lies the secret of the
great beast within us all. A beast built
on lies, corruption, and greed.
We HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
And there it is! The legendary beast
Mocra.
CAMERA quickly PANS to a blanket-wrapped, crawling FELLOW
STUDENT in a grotesque Halloween mask.
We MOVE INTO CU on the monster growling.
QUICK PAN back to Chris.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
(in mock fright)
We've got to get out of here quick and re-
secure the hatch while we make a plan of
how to kill the beast.
CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying to
stay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down the
hatchway into the University dorm corridor.
CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT: Chris nailing the last nail in
the hatchway from below. He climbs down the steps where
he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off-
camera source.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Well, it looks like we've succeeded -
We HEAR the monster's GROWL from above.
13.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
- at least for the moment, in sealing the
beast back into the vault. Your humble
reporter, Chris McCandless will now
struggle with the journalistic question
of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's
objectiveness or save the future of human
truth by slaying this awful beast?
He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will
he do?
CONTINUE VIDEO:
We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a
cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room
as the office of Ted Turner.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Once again, your humble reporter Chris
McCandless.
We HEAR OS students commenting on Chris and his video
crew:
OS STUDENT
What is this? Filmmaking 101?

A FELLOW STUDENT PLAYING TED TURNER with obvious fake
mustache is locked into an episode of Matlock on his
television set as our bold reporter, Chris, barges in.
CHRIS
Ted! We've got a monster in the vault.
It represents all the corruption, the
deceit, and greed within us all. I must
slay it.
14.
TED TURNER/STUDENT
(worst acting we've ever
seen)
McCandless, how many times have I had to
tell you? I've had to tell you that you
are a journalist and you can't get
personally involved in your cases...or
your stories.
CHRIS
Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the
only one who knows. You can't keep
sending me on stories and expecting me to
do nothing! I look like some kind of an
idiot.
TED TURNER/STUDENT
Do you know who you're talking to?
I'm
Ted Turner.
Behind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, a
PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door.
PANICKED STUDENT
McCandless! You've got to hurry! The
monster is scratching at the hatchway.
He'll be out in no time.
TED TURNER/STUDENT
(threatening)
It'll mean your job, Chris McCandless.
CHRIS
(to Ted)
That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but
this beast must be slayed.
Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNS
WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of
steps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monster
appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having
pulled off the board Chris had nailed.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
(into camera)
This is the only thing that can kill the
monster. It's gonna be risky but without
great risk, there is no freedom. So we
will now hear from the famous singer -
Chris McCandless.
15.
A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris. A YOUNG BLACK
STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to
play. Chris begins to serenade the monster,
intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera
as well. He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is
The Night.
CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway,
slowly dying from the song being sung.
As the song continues to be sung and the monster
continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO
TO SLO MO.
CARINE (V.O.)
When we were little, Chris was very to
himself. He wasn't anti-social, he
always had friends, and everybody liked
him - but he could go off and entertain
himself for hours, he didn't seem to need
toys or friends. He could be alone
without being lonely. The secrets our
parents kept, though unknown to Chris and
I, led to bouts of rage and even violence
between them that we had been forced to
witness since we were very young. It
seemed like they never fought without us.
I remember the first family meeting to
let Chris and me in on their plans for
getting a divorce. They wanted us to
choose which of them we'd live with. I
cried my eyes out. But the divorce never
happened, though the threats and meetings
never stopped. It wasn't long before
Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom
and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
Chris and I just wanted to get away from
their fights and mom kept promising to
get out and take us with her as soon as
their company made enough money. Dad had
been the young genius [that] NASA
enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the
American satellite radar systems that
would be our answer to the Russian
Sputnik. And mom and he later started up
a consulting firm combining her get-up-
and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of
knowledge. By the time the company
actually made its first million, the
careerism and money seemed to erase her
memory of the promise she'd made us.

CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I think this is when Chris began to see
"careers" as a diseased invention of the
twentieth century and to resent money and
the useless priority people made of it in
their lives. He'd begun planning to
"slay the beast"...to make himself free.

Delirious in the heat, we WIDEN OUT to see that he's

As he wipes the corners of his mouth with a tissue and
throws it into the bin below the sink, he notices a
discarded tube of lipstick. He picks it up. It's down

had done. That he had spent the previous
four years fulfilling an absurd and
onerous duty in graduating from college.
We return to the image of Carine sitting on her bed as
she plops on Chris' old graduation cap. We slowly ZOOM IN
on her throughout the remaining V.O.
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And now, at last he was unincumbered.
Emancipated from the stifling world of
parents and peers. Abstraction,

things that cut Chris off from the raw

Chris is awakened by the SOUND of TWIGS SNAPPING in a
nearby thicket. He quickly grabs a knife from his
backpack, unzips six inches of the tent door open. We
see his eyes peering out. The CRACKLING moves closer.
His grip on the knife tightens.
Suddenly a hot white light hits his face.
And a VOICE
comes from behind the light.
FOREST RANGER
U.S. Forestry. Could you step out of the
tent please?
Now we see the FOREST RANGER appear from the thicket.
Chris exits the tent, catching himself holding the knife.
CHRIS
(as he drops the knife to the
ground)
Sorry. I thought you were a bear.
FOREST RANGER
(approaching)
I don't blame you. You're less than a
hundred yards from the nearest den.
That's why I came over here to talk to
you. Do you have some identification?
22.
CHRIS
No. I'm sorry. My name's Alex. I've
been travelling a lot and I got robbed
and my identification was taken.
FOREST RANGER
You mind if I take a look in your tent?
CHRIS
Go ahead.
The Forest Ranger bends over. Pops his flashlight
through the tent door and peers around a bit before re-
addressing Chris.
FOREST RANGER
You're not the character who knocked down
our sign, are ya?
CHRIS
(giggles)
No.
FOREST RANGER
Because there was a sign indicating that
camping was allowed by permit only.
CHRIS
Well, I don't have a permit.
FOREST RANGER
No, I'm sure you don't. Listen, it looks
like you've got your food secured pretty
good, so I'm not gonna make you move on
tonight. But, these bears out here are
nursing young and you know how that goes.
Next time, stop at the Rangers station
and get yourself a permit.
CHRIS
Alright. I appreciate it. I'm gonna be
headed towards the coast tomorrow.

Be careful.
They shake hands and the Forest Ranger disappears into

Walt, Billie, and Carine sit around the kitchen table in
August. A copy of Chris' ticket has been sent to the
Annandale address and sits before them. Billie and
Carine sit silently. Walt's on the phone.
CARINE (V.O.)
If Chris were trying to disappear, it
would have been a pretty uncharacteristic
lapse for him to give the police his real
place of residence. Though my parents
had already contacted the Annandale
police with their initial concerns, this
ticket arriving from California made them
frantic.

CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
My father called one of his old
government friends who put him in touch
with a private investigator, someone
who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA.
Using the Willow Creek ticket as a
starting point, the investigator began
chasing down leads. Most of them led far
afield -- to Europe and South Africa.
Ultimately turning up nothing. What my
dad couldn't believe was that he'd given
up his car. He seemed to love that
Datsun so much. It sounded just like
Chris to me, though. He was very much of
the school that you should own nothing
except what you could carry on your back
at a dead run.

Chris pulls out a bag of berries and edible plants he's

are edible. You can find things wherever
you go.

As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the
campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris

CHRIS

emotional)
Dad, you and I have had our differences
over the years...but on your birthday I
want to tell you how grateful I am for
all the things you've given me. And that
you did it starting from nothing to
working your way through college and
busting your ass to support us kids. So,
in return, I've been busting my ass a
bit...at Domino's Pizza -
Chris moves to the gift.
CHRIS (CONT'D)

damned expensive token, as a token of
that appreciation.
Chris holds the large gift toward Walt. Walt moves
through his friends to Chris and strips the paper,
exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope.
WALT

Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.
And the
party responds with applause.
Chris walks through the cheering family friends to take
his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps.
CARINE

CHRIS
Too much and not enough. I used to
believe all that stuff. That whole
story. I thought maybe if I said it

The day after the party, Chris left on
his trip and ended up staying away most
of the summer. It was nearly three months
before he walked back into our house in
Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his
hair was long and tangled, and he was
rail thin. As soon as I heard he was
home, I ran into his room to talk to him.
In California, he'd looked up some old
family friends who still lived there.
He'd found out that long after he had
been born, our dad had continued a
relationship with his first wife Marcia
in secret.

And that one lie had led to another.

children.

CARINE (CONT'D)
Chris was quiet when he told me this. He

dying everyday." If something bothered
Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself.
And he made me promise to do the same.

CARINE (CONT'D)
He never did tell mom and dad that he
knew. But Chris measured himself and
those around him by an impossibly
rigorous moral code. He loathed what he
considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and
resented what they considered guidance.
Chris submitted to dad's authority
through college but I knew he raged
inwardly the whole time. It was
inevitable that Chris would rebel. And
when he did, he did it with
characteristic immoderation.
Walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken
and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless
light of dusk.
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
My father is a brilliant man. But he had
made some terrible mistakes. And to some
extent, it seemed Chris was making him

WAYNE
So where is it you're headed?

Well, I do a lot of things. Computer
programming. Video game repair. I'm a
licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in
Carthage and another one a few miles out
of town. But in the summertime I run a
combine crew, follow the harvest from
Texas way the hell north to the Canadian
border. We just got done cutting barley
for Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I
got this little black box deal on the
side (You know what I mean?)
CHRIS
You mean those free satellite TV deals?
WAYNE

You said it, not me.
Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.
Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated
food. As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind
rocks the trailer.

OOOOOOH.
Chris doesn't respond, digs into the food. Points to the
unconscious tribe splayed out. SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING
UNCONSCIOUS BODIES.
CHRIS
Who are these guys?
Wayne gets a little giggle.

Okay.
Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding
the trailer shell. A couple hits of lightning follow.
WAYNE
Listen, you don't want to go out there on
the road tonight. Why don't you just
roll your sleeping bag out and play like
a Hudderite until morning.
Chris looks about. There's not much room but it beats

I'm gonna break out some whiskey. Alex,
you want anything other than that beer?
CHRIS
I'd take a White Russian if you've got
it.
The group of men laugh at the youngster's order of a
fancy drink.

MAN #1
What are you Alex, a Commie?
CHRIS
No, I just like White Russians.
WAYNE
I haven't got anything like that here.
But I tell ya what. And I know I speak
for everybody. You wanna come work with
us in Carthage, we'll hook you up on the
grain elevator and get you a White
Russian down at the Cabaret.
CHRIS
Really?
WAYNE
Dawn tomorrow, engines roaring.

Wayne plops Chris' pack beside a single bed in the tiny

new quarters.
WAYNE
Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you
can beat the rest of the boys to it. But
you do want to grab a shower cause we're
all heading over to the Cabaret in
exactly thirty-six minutes. So, get your
dancing shoes on. There's foo-foo in the
medicine cabinet. I think it's Brut.
(slaps his own face as if
he's putting on cologne)
Then you want to put your charm in
overdrive cause we like to PAH-TAY!
Wayne gives Chris a wink and exits, shutting the door
behind him.
Chris takes in his new surroundings. He's on a work crew
and he likes it. Chris makes the move for the shower but
by the time he opens his door to the hall, all the other
crew members are barreling up the stairs in front of
them, clamoring for dibs (Chris' POV)

heron, delicate features and long blond hair. Wayne and
Chris sit at the end of the bar.
WAYNE
Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to
go to for that White Russian you've been
wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can
be hazardous.
GAIL
Shut up, Wayne.

You want a White Russian, sweetie?

CHRIS
I'm thinking about going to Alaska.
WAYNE
Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?
The
city Alaska does have markets.
CHRIS
(with a drunken, excited
energy)
No, Alaska, Alaska. I want to be all the
way out there. On my own. No map. No
watch. No axe. Just out there. Big
mountains, rivers, sky. Game. Just be
out there in it. In the wild.
WAYNE
In the wild.
CHRIS
Yeah. Maybe write a book about my
travels. About getting out of this sick
society.
WAYNE
(coughing)
Society, right.
CHRIS
Because you know what I don't understand?
I don't understand why, why people are so
bad to each other, so often. It just
doesn't make any sense to me. Judgement.
Control. All that.

CHRIS
You know, parents and hypocrites.
Politicians and pricks.

Chris is clearly troubled by his own words.
Wayne leans

WAYNE
(tapping a long finger

This is a mistake. It's a mistake to get
too deep into that kind of stuff. Alex,
you're a helluva young guy, but I promise
you this: You're a young guy. Blood and
fire! You're juggling blood and fire!
GAIL
(chimes in)
Who are you to be giving advice to
anybody?
WAYNE
Blood and fire...What? Mr. Happy.
That's who I am. Gimme a kiss.
Gail

Alex, it's October for Christ's sake.
You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring.
This time of year you wanna head south.
Personally, I like Las Vegas. One-armed
bandit. That's what I like.
CHRIS
Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to
Alaska, at least so I can get settled up
there in decent weather.
GAIL
South. You want to go south. You want
me to take you out to the highway?
CHRIS
(putting on his cowboy)
Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out.
He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his
backpack, and gives Gail a hug.
GAIL
You take care of yourself now, Alex. You

GREEN SUIT
"To launch out of?" What's your
experience level?
CHRIS
Not much.
GREEN SUIT
Any?
Do you have a permit?
CHRIS
A permit for what?
GREEN SUIT
You can't paddle down the river without a
permit. If you like, you can apply for
one here, get yourself some experience,
and I'll put you on the wait-list.
CHRIS
Wait-list?
To paddle down a river?
GREEN SUIT
That's right.
CHRIS
(giggling)
Well, how long do you have to wait?
GREEN SUIT
I've got an opening May 2003.

GREEN SUIT
Well, you could always join a commercial

I can't disagree with you on that. Okay,
Alexander SuperTramp. I think we're
gonna let you out of here shortly but
you've got two working weeks to get an ID

smashed in the head with a baton. A BULL jumps into the
car with him.
BULL #2
Lay down on your stomach, spread eagle!

railroad. And we will do whatever we
have to, to keep you freeloaders from
violating our liability.

As they both laugh we DISSOLVE BACK to Chris (PRESENT)
reading beside his candle lantern.
CARINE (V.O.)
In the nine months since Chris'
disappearance, my parents went through
enormous changes. Guilt was giving way
to pain. And pain seemed to bring them
closer. My father had humbled
dramatically. And what had always been a
sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man
who actually thought he could cancel
Christmas, had given way to the
vulnerability of a father's heart. Even
their faces had changed. It made me sad
that I couldn't share with Chris the new
closeness I felt toward our parents.
The image of Chris reading begins a SLOW DISSOLVE INTO...

I close my eyes at night sometimes and

Suspicious, ghostly faces briefly appear in the strobing

We see Chris observing them.
Warmly he speaks but we DO

A year and a half into Chris'
disappearance, each day that goes by now
feels like two. Dad calls it "suspended

Hey boy. You are a handsome fellow.
(over shoulder to the girl)
Beautiful dog.
THE GIRL
Thank you.
As the girl continues on, the dog wants to stay with
Chris.
CHRIS
Go on, boy.
Go on.
And the dog obeys him.
As he sorts through the various rice selections, brown,
white, wild, we notice a MAN peering over the opposite
shelf at Chris. This is RON FRANZ, between 70 and 80
years old, six-feet, thick arms, barrel chest, and large
ears. He wears old jeans, an immaculate white T-shirt, a
decorative tooled leather belt, white socks, and scuffed
black loafers. His deeply pitted nose demonstrates a
purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely
wrought tattoo. And on either side of it, the wary blue
eyes of a soldier. He is the archetypical American man.

It is.
No question about that.
Ron continues to let Chris vent.

The government's the same as my parents.
They don't respect anybody. Regulation.
Regulation. Regulation. WE can't do
this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the
hypocrisy of the whole...culture.
Makes
me crazy. My father was having children

with two women at the same time, and then

has the gall to think that he can be of
some guidance to me? Make judgments on
me? My mother, of course, goes along
with all of it. Keeps the secret, which
of course, makes my whole life a fiction.
Everything I thought was, wasn't.
They're such fools! Fucking idiots!

your judges. And your tyrants. But I'd

CHRIS
(realizing his slip)
Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of
language either. I just get so angry
thinking about it.
Ron reaches across the table.
Puts his sturdy hand on
Chris' shoulder.
RON
You got a lot of passion, young man.
Chris smiles at Ron.

Ron broils a couple of steaks. Chris enters and moves
past Ron carrying his laundry into another room.

Chris pours detergent over his long-in-need clothes.
Starts the cycle.

As Chris enters, Ron is pulling the steaks from the
broiler.

Above the kitchen sink, Chris sees a row of approximately
ten photographs, each in vertical 4x6 frames, some black
and white, some color: all of Japanese boys and girls in
formal American and Japanese attire.
RON
Did you find everything you need?
CHRIS
(breaking his gaze from the
photographs)
Yeah. I hope I don't wreck your machine.
There's a lot of grime in that stuff.
RON
Well, that's what it's for.
How do these
steaks look?
Ron pops the steaks on the kitchen table.
CHRIS
Great.
RON
Well, sit down.
Ron grabs some silverware from a drawer, plops it down on
the kitchen table with some paper napkins.
RON (CONT'D)
What do you drink?
CHRIS
You got a White Russian?
RON
Nope.
CHRIS
Beer?
RON
Nope. Don't have any alcohol. I had to
quit all that. How about a guava juice?
CHRIS
I'll take a guava juice, that sounds
good.
As Ron gets the drinks -
RON
Yeah, I had a little spell with the
bottle, you could say.
110.
Ron pops the drinks down on the table, then sits with
Chris. They lift their glasses toward one another, then -
RON/CHRIS
Cheers.
RON
I spent most of my life in the army. On
New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over
in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in
the States, just driving down the road
when a fellow who'd had too much to drink
plowed right into them. Killed them
both. Anyway, you might think that the
last thing in the world I'd do, is go to
the whiskey, but at the time, it felt
like the only thing I could do. And I
did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured
I wasn't doing my wife and son any good,
mourning them with a bottle. So, I
pulled myself together and quit drinking,
cold turkey. And then...
Ron, spinning his body around, points to the photographs
over the sink.
RON (CONT'D)
(brightening)
You see all these kids over here?
CHRIS
Yeah, I was gonna ask you.
RON
Yeah, that's...
(pointing at each with his
finger)
Fuki, Kenjiro, Yoshiko, Keiko, Masaro,
Junichi, Kimpei, Nayoko...
For the last picture frame, Ron stands and takes it off
the shelf -
RON (CONT'D)
(pridefully shows Chris the
picture)
And this is Akira. Just finished medical
school.
Chris takes the picture and studies Akira's face.
Ron
sits back down.
111.
RON (CONT'D)
Yeah, I unofficially adopted all of them.
It did my heart some good but I guess
really it was just writing a few letters
and sending some money. Anyway, it was
important to me. I get a letter from
each of them from time to time. You
know. So, since all that, this is pretty
much me.
(indicating his small
reclusive abode)
CHRIS
Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?
RON
No. I can't seem to get too far from my
leather. I'll show you after you finish
eating. I do a lot of leather engraving.
I got a little workshop in the garage.
Between that and my pension, I do pretty
well. But every time I think I might
take a trip somewhere, I get too far
behind on orders and such to consider it.
CHRIS
(having wolfed down the
steak)
Well, I'm finished eating. I'd love to
see your workshop.
RON
Would ya?
Chris nods.
RON (CONT'D)
(standing)
Alright then.
Ron picks up the picture of Akira and replaces it on the
shelf above the sink.

Chris pulls his laundry out of the dryer. He's got his
pack sitting in the doorway to the kitchen. He folds his
things and tucks them into his pack.
117.
Ron appears in the doorway dressed for travel.
CHRIS
What are you doing up?
It's three-thirty
in the morning.
RON
Heard you get up off the couch half an
hour ago, and had a funny feeling you
might not be here for our breakfast.
Chris says nothing.
RON (CONT'D)
I'm going to drive you a hundred miles to
somewhere where you can pick up a train,
a plane, or hitch a ride without getting
stuck on this desert. I'd take you all
the way to Alaska if I didn't have to get
to an eight o'clock mass.
CHRIS
Ron, you don't have to do that.
RON
I want to do it.
Get you started on this
thing of yours.
CHRIS
On my Great -
RON
(interrupting)
I know. On your "Great Alaskan
Adventure."
From just out of Chris' eye-line, Ron leans out of frame,
picking up a zippered duffel bag. He opens it,
displaying the contents to Chris.
RON (CONT'D)
There's a machete, an arctic parka,
collapsible fishing pole, and a few odds
and ends I threw in there for you.
CHRIS
Ron...
RON
Oh, just take it.
Chris does, nodding his thanks.

RON (CONT'D)
I'll wait for you in the truck.
CUT TO:

209
As Ron begins to pull over.
RON
Well my friend.
CHRIS
Yep.
Both of them are uncomfortable. Chris goes for the door
handle. Ron's gnarled hand reaches out to take Chris'
elbow.
After a long beat, Ron speaks without looking at Chris.
RON
I had an idea. You know my mother was an
only child. So was my father. And I was
their only child. Now, with my own boy
gone, I'm the end of the line. When I'm
gone, my family will be finished. What
do you say, you let me adopt you. I
could be, say, your grandfather.
This takes Chris by surprise.
He knew it would be hard
but not this hard.
CHRIS
How about we talk about this when I get
back from Alaska, Ron. Would that be
alright?
119.
Silence.
Ron nods.
Releases Chris' elbow.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Alright, Ron. We'll talk about it then.
RON
(trying to mask. The
blinking, moist eyes again)
Yep.
We can do that, yep.
CHRIS
Thanks, Ron.
Ron nods. Chris gets out of the truck. Ron watches as
Chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that Ron
gave him.
Chris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a
ride north on the far side of the road.
We ZOOM SLOWLY through the windshield into Ron's face as
he watches Chris hitching away.
We HEAR the first bars of Neil Young's My My, Hey Hey.
This will carry throughout the following MONTAGE.

CARINE (V.O.)
About a month short of the second
anniversary of Chris' disappearance, I
had gotten engaged to my boyfriend Jerry
Ray and was moving in with him...
Carine, packing her belongings into boxes, stumbles upon
the Sharon Olds book Chris had given her on his
graduation day.
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...when I stumbled upon the book Chris
had given me on his graduation day. For
some reason, it was the last line of the
poem he read that really stuck out.
FLASH BACK: (From page 2-3)

212
Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the
LAST LINE OF THE POEM...
CHRIS
...and I will tell about it.
CARINE (V.O.)
I asked Chris who had written the poem.
What we SEE of Carine plays with the VOICE OVER TRACK and
SILENT with the production track; in essence lip synching
herself.
Chris' dialogue comes directly from the flashback image.
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Who wrote that?
CHRIS
Well, it could've been either one of us.
Couldn't it?
We see pictures of Chris on the night-stand of Walt and
Billie's bedroom
CARINE (V.O.)
What would he tell about now?
What did
his voice sound like now?

CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I realized that the words to my thoughts
were of less and less meaning. Chris was
writing his story and it had to be Chris
who would tell it.

He re-enters the bus and pulls his pen from his pocket,

ANGLE: The book
CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
Here she stopped and, closing her eyes,
took a deep breath of the flower-scented
air of the broad expanse around her. It
was dearer to her than her kin, better
than a lover, wiser than a book.

He puts down the book and brings one of the ripe berries
in front of his face (as close as shot of when he picked
it.)

book he had gotten from the library in Fairbanks. And it
takes him out of the bus like a divining rod. His nose

The open bag of seeds beside Chris' sleeping body. We
drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin
parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to
sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to
his feet.
Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the
hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps.
From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus
and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his
mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He
drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest.
138.
We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside
his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him.
He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping
the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph
identifying the wild potato root and the word "edible"
beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as
almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there
might be more.
The word -
POISON
jumps off the page at him.
The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato
root and warns that those with:
lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of
wild sweet peas are poisonous.

The diary/log: DAY 100 - MADE IT. BUT IN WEAKEST
CONDITION OF LIFE. TOO WEAK TO WALK OUT. HAVE LITERALLY
BECOME TRAPPED IN THE WILD - NO GAME IN SIGHT.
A SUBTLE DRUM (HEART)BEAT BEGINS OVER:
Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. He
shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then
considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. But taking
his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an
option for him. "No, no, no, don't do this to me." The
frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream
out.
141.
He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakes
it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for
distraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses his
eyes on the page -
ANGLE: The page: what he reads:
CHRIS (V.0)(O.C.)
And that an unshared happiness is not
happiness...
Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the
book, scribbling across the page:
CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
(CONT'D)
HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED.
He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had
written the quote:
CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
(CONT'D)
CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME.
He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the
pencil across its blank side, writing these words
quickly, as if in panic:
I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD.
GOODBYE AND
MAY GOD BLESS ALL!
And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris
repeating:
CHRIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)
(with a weak voice)
Call everything by its right name.
The drumbeat increases as he signs the note:
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.
We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he
has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his
weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays
them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes
dance wildly.
The drumming intensifies.
Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is
covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud.
142.
His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at
the blue sleeping bag made by his mother.
With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces
his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the
sleeping bag.
SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun.
Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face.
(Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine
both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side
up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and
dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.)

His backpack on

Billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris
approach, alive and healthy.
We SEE but do not hear her call to Walt.
A smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home.
Walt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run
out the front door to their returning son.
PUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the
ground and runs toward his parents' embrace.
CHRIS (V.O.)
What if you saw me running into your
arms...
Chris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and
loving embrace!
CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Would you see then...
The DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an
embrace is possible...
CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...what I see now?
A SUDDEN CUT TO:
270
270
TOTAL SILENCE
Chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his
left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud
clears the sun.
144.
Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH.
His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in
his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true,
deep serenity.
The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease
into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom.
That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly
into our camera.
And he died alive.
He made it.
He lived.
He loved.
Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER:
As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window
and up into the sky -
We drift further and further away, above the stunted
trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny
white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and
smaller.
REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in
scene #1.
Then it's him:
The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene
from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and
it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the
edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen,
we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these
words appear superimposed over it:
Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless
February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992
As those words dissolve, these words appear:
On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her
brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard.
She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.
