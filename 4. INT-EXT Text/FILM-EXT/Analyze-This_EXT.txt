CREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we
see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the
top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps
through the peaceful landscape.
MANETTA (V.O.)
It was the first time the whole
commission was ever gonna meet
face to face. Bosses and wiseguys
were comin' in from all over the
country, and all the New York
families, too -- maybe sixty
bosses, the whole wiseguy world --
all headin' toward this little
town upstate to figure out what's
what.

A sign reads, "Entering Apalachin - pop. 342." The black
Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy,
then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc.

MANETTA (V.O.CONT'D)
He was running the family at the

anybody was thinking, but some
asshole thought it would be a good
idea to have this meeting at Joe
Babara's farm in the country where
nobody would notice.

A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle
when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks
up and scratches his head at the unusual sight.
MANETTA (V.O.)
Turns out the local cops were
watching Joe Babara like a hawk.
So now you got about fifty Caddies
and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin
and some deputy sheriff with cow
shit on his shoes notices all the
traffic and calls the Feds.

The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling
country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and
greeting each other on the big front porch.
One WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car.
WISEGUY
You wanna be a ribeye?
Get away
from the fuckin' car.

Federal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed,

Your papa and me hid in a field
with hay or corn, some kinda
foliage, I don't know.

Two wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass.
Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on
them.
MANETTA (V.O.)
Then along comes this farmer who
almost runs us over in a tractor,
so your father hauls out his piece,
this .44 cannon he used to carry,
and hijacks the goddamn tractor.
Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw.

The farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two
wiseguys drive off on it.
The farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a

Jelly and Jimmy jump out of the Lincoln and slam the top

inspect the damage.
JIMMY

Are

BEN
I'm sorry.
It's totally my fault.
Ben looks at the damage. The Lincoln has gotten the

Jimmy is reattaching the rear bumper and securing the

No, it was like that before.

Why?
Fuck the police.

this is my last report for

Hi!

That certainly makes a statement.
It's a little big for the yard,
don't you think?
BEN
What can I tell you, Mom? It
looked much smaller in the store.
ISAAC
Think it'll affect your water
pressure?
BEN
I think it'll affect the tides.
What are you doing here?
DOROTHY
Your father and I are just very
concerned about what happened
in Florida.
ISAAC
How was your flight home? Anyone
hang themselves in first class.
DOROTHY
We got in last night, we couldn't
sleep a wink. Is Laura inside?
BEN
Yeah, but she and Michael are
spending some time alone, you
know, getting to know each other.
That's important. I don't want
to disturb that dynamic.

ISAAC
All right. What's with you and
Paul Vitti?
BEN
Well, Dad, I'm not at liberty to
discuss that.
ISAAC
He's your patient? Are you
joking? Have you thought about
what this could do to your
reputation?
BEN
You, know, I always wanted to be
great, but then I realized that I
might have to settle for just being
good enough. Now I've got this guy
who's hurting and I'm thinking that
if I can help this guy, maybe I can
be a little bit great.
ISAAC
Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's
going to be hurting. I want you
to stop seeing him.
BEN
Didn't you read your own book?
Instead of trying to run my
life, why don't you just close
your eyes, take a deep breath, tell
me what you feel, tell me what
you want.

Is that really it?
ISAAC
That's it.
They embrace awkwardly.
BEN
You know why I became a shrink?
Because I grew up with a great

I thought you became a shrink

Yes, and because of you.

For some

BEN
I'm going to buy some fruit.
You want anything?
VITTI
No, go ahead.
Ben crosses to a sidewalk fruit stand and starts picking
out oranges. Vitti leans up against a car waiting for
him to finish. SHOTS are FIRED. He runs toward the car.
More SHOTS are FIRED. Ben is hit. Vitti pulls out his
gun but he fumbles and drops it. The gunmen run off.
Ben sinks to the pavement, mortally wounded. Vitti kneels
next to him and sobs loudly. He puts his hand to his
head, knocking off his hat.
VITTI
Papa!
Papa!
64B
It's Vitti. He goes down on one knee and genuflects in
front of a big crucifix. Ben wiggles his finger in the
holy water, just kind of curtsies and waves at Jesus on
the cross.

You look lousy. You all right.

BEN
Don't buy me a Rolex.
VITTI
Who said anything about buying it?
They cross to the main aisle of the church.

Listen, I really need to talk
to you.
Ben stops cold. A casket sits in front of the altar.
A funeral service is in progress.
VITTI
Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
Worked for a crew out of Jersey
City.
BEN
How did he die?
VITTI
He was on his way to talk to a
federal prosecutor. Got hit by
a truck -- twice.
BEN
Do I need to know that? I'm
having nightmares as it is.
The funeral procession comes down the aisle.

Last night I dreamed we were
walking down the street, I stopped
to buy some fruit, and they shot
me -- like Brando in The Godfather.

A mourner walks up to Vitti, bows his head in respect and
kisses Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti
gives him a consoling pat on the shoulder, then the man
kisses Ben and walks off.
BEN
You dropped your gun, then you ran
over to me and started yelling,
'Papa, Papa!'
VITTI
I was Fredo.
I don't think so.
An older woman kisses Vitti's hand, then both his cheeks.
Vitti whispers a few words to her, then she kisses Ben's
hand and moves on. More old ladies kiss their hands as
they walk by.
VITTI
You're losing it, Doc.
You may
need therapy yourself.
A man comes up to Vitti, kisses him on both cheeks,
embraces him with excessive energy, then repeats the

Freud believed you're everyone

VITTI
Yeah, well, that guy I don't need
to hear about. I can't even call
my mother on the phone after that
thing you told me.
BEN
Let's say you are the baby. What
kind of milk did you get from
your father?
VITTI
Could we stop talking about my
father?
BEN

That's the whole point! We have

One more?
TONY BENNETT and his trio are set up on the back porch.
TONY BENNETT
Whatever you want, Dr. Sobol. My
friend told me to stay as long as
you wanted me. What do you want
to hear, Mrs. Sobol?
LAURA
Your choice, Tony.
TONY BENNETT
I was hoping you'd say that.
(quietly, to trio)
'World on a String,' fellas.
Tony sings "I've Got the World on a String" as Ben and
Laura continue to dance. The CAMERA PANS UP and we see
Michael smiling and shooting video from his bedroom
window, then the CAMERA PANS UP TO a starry sky, and we...
FADE OUT.
