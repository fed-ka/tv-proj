  11EXT. GAS STOP - COUNTRY ROAD - MAINE - DAY

            A classic rural, middle-of-nowhere Maine gas station -- a
          couple of pumps in front of a tiny store.

          Bruce's Cruiser pulls up, Johnny and Bruce climb out. 
          Binoculars dangle from both their necks.  Johnny is wearing
          appropriate hiking attire -- Bruce looks like he's dressed
          for the gym, in bright workout gear.

          Bruce has a "Field Guide to Birds of New England" in one
          hand and is reading from it, energized.

                                        BRUCE
                          Wingspan up to eight feet!  Eight
                        feet!

                                        JOHNNY
                        You are not going to see a Bald
                        Eagle.

          Bruce tosses the bird book to Johnny and pops open the
          hood to check the oil.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because there are about three
                        Bald Eagles left in this entire
                        county.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll settle for a Dodo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Too late.  They're extinct.

          Bruce slams the hood.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's the point of bird-watching
                        if all the birds I want to watch
                        are missing in action?




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - TEASER - 6/25/02 - PINK        2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's the point of dragging me
                        all the way out here for physical
                          therapy?

                                        BRUCE
                        Because it's time you got back to
                        basics.  We cannot duplicate in a
                        gym the kind of landscape our
                        human legs evolved upon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nobody evolved in Maine.

                                        BRUCE
                        Until we pay a visit to Mother
                        Africa, it'll have to do.

          Bruce pops open the gas cap and starts to fill the tank.

                                        BRUCE
                                (re: binoculars)
                        In the meantime, if I'm gonna lug
                        this sucker around you'd best
                        deliver me something with an eight
                        foot wingspan.

          Johnny heads over toward the tiny store and the OLD MAN
          who is sitting out front next to a narrow table with an
          ancient cash register and a small stand displaying tourist
          post cards.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi.  How are you?

          The guy just stares at him.  Several feet away is the
          man's young grandson.  The boy has a toy drum he is
            awkwardly beating on with his open hand.

          A postcard catches Johnny's eye--


          CLOSE ON: THE POSTCARD

          Which reads "Hello from Picture Rock" and shows a local
          tourist site -- a rockface with a Palaeolithic drawing on
          it, the simple but elegant figure of a leaping deer.

                                        OLD MAN (O.S.)
                        Not bad.  Yourself?          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - TEASER - 6/25/02 - YELLOW      3.


  22RESUME

          Johnny turns back, caught a little off-balance by the
          man's delayed response.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not bad at all.

          He reaches for his wallet, takes out a bill.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Twenty on Supreme.

          The Old Man makes no effort to accept the cash.  Johnny
          has no choice but to play along with his odd rhythm.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lightly)
                        Seen any bald eagles around here?

          The man stares at the "Birds of Maine" book tucked under
          Johnny's arm.

                                        OLD MAN
                        Just yesterday.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (excited)
                        You're kidding.

                                        OLD MAN
                        Yes I am.

          Johnny is disappointed.

                                        OLD MAN
                        But I do expect a couple tomorrow.

          The man reaches up and takes the twenty from Johnny.  And
          as their hands make contact -- we go into SLOW MOTION and
          Johnny hears the SOUND of the toy drum become a much deeper
          and more rhythmic drum beating, which is then overwhelmed
          by a tremendous burning ROAR.

          The Old Man is frozen in place.  A brilliant LIGHT suddenly
          illuminates the scene.  Johnny turns to look up at the
          source of the light and the roaring sound, and finds
          himself:


  2A2AEXT. LOW MOUNTAIN - DAY - VISION

          Johnny stands at the foot of a low mountain, surrounded
          by wilderness, watching as:           THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - TEASER - 7/16/02 - PINK-2     3A.


  33JOHNNY'S POV - A METEOR - VISION

          streaks through the blue sky like a fiery arrow, burning
          the air as it goes, until it strikes the side of the
          mountain with a tremendous explosion.

  44RESUME JOHNNY - EXT. GAS STOP - VISION

          Johnny watches as the frozen image of the Old Man suddenly
          wavers like a flickering candle flame -- and then
            vanishes.

          The vision ends.


  55RESUME SCENE

          Johnny reacts to what he has just seen.  The boy suddenly
          stops pounding on his toy drum.  The silence is itself
          disturbing.

                                        OLD MAN
                        I'll give 'em your regards.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Huh...?  Oh, right.

          He turns and unsteadily makes it back to Bruce at the
          vehicle.  Bruce sees the haunted look on his face -- he's
          seen it before.

                                        BRUCE
                        Now what?

          But Johnny doesn't answer -- he's still thinking about
          the impending disaster.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  66EXT. A STARFIELD

          Across which moves a single point of light -- like a star
          with its own agenda.

          WIDEN TO REVEAL:


  77INT. OBSERVATORY LAB - DAY

          The starfield is an animated image on a computer screen. 
          A woman in her late twenties -- the ASTRONOMER -- clicks
          a mouse and a graphic circle appears over the moving star --
            highlighting it.

                                        ASTRONOMER
                          Asteroid nineteen-fifty "D" "A." 
                          Diameter: approximately one
                        kilometer.


          INCLUDE JOHNNY

          staring with great concern at the screen.

                                        ASTRONOMER
                        Big enough to wipe out a major
                          metropolitan area -- or a good
                        chunk of the countryside. 
                          Depending where it hits.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (barely)

                          March... of the year 2880.

          Johnny just looks at her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you sure?

                                        ASTRONOMER
                        NASA's sure.  JPL's sure.  So I'm
                        pretty sure.

          She clicks the mouse and the starfield disappears, replaced
          by the SCREENSAVER of a housecat in a funny pose.

                        you don't know about.  There's a
                          near-miss every couple of weeks
                        and you never see them coming.

                        But you can... in a 'vision'...

          Johnny picks his words carefully, but his voice is intense.

                                        JOHNNY
                        People are going to die unless
                        you can identify this meteor and
                        tell us exactly where it's going
                        to hit.

          The Astronomer is trying to be patient.

                                (dry)
                        Where should I aim the telescope?
                        It's a very big sky up there.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All I can tell you is that it
                        will hit at the foot of a mountain. 
                        A mountain that looks like a
                          crouching animal of some kind. 
                        Like a dog or a wolf.

          The woman stands... she's had enough...

                                        ASTRONOMER
                        Mister Smith, I agreed to our

          The woman bristles slightly.

                        I'll be finished with my doctorate

          Johnny knows he can't get any further.  He stands.  The
          Astronomer extends her hand.  Johnny takes her hand -- she
          freezes as he HEARS THE ROAR OF THE METEOR FLASHING BY...          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/3/02 - GREEN       7.


88THE ASTRONOMER - VISION

          She suddenly wavers like a flickering candle flame, and
          then vanishes -- exactly like the old man at the gas
          station.


  99RESUME

          Johnny lets go of her hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I can find this mountain, give
                        you an exact location and the
                          meteor's angle of impact...

                                (anything to get this
                                guy out of here)
                        You bring me the declination and
                        right ascension and we'll point 
                        the telescope together...

          She ushers him out.


  1010EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - MAINE - DAY

            A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN pulls his flashing motorcycle to a
          stop on the lonely stretch of road.  He takes off his
          sunglasses -- his local Native American heritage is evident
          from his features.

          We FOLLOW him as he walks up to the car he has just pulled
          over.  It's Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good morning, Officer.

                                        HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        License and registration please.

          As Johnny reaches for it, the cop notices the binoculars
          around his neck and the maps open on the seat next to
          him.

                                        HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        You were driving too slow for the
                        road.  Is there a problem?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, sir.  Just looking for a
                          mountain.

                        Well, we've got plenty to choose
                        from around here.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes sir.

          He hands over his license and registration, and the moment
          the man makes contact with them -- he freezes as Johnny
          HEARS THE ROAR of the meteor flashing by.


  1111HIGHWAY PATROLMAN - VISION

          The man suddenly wavers like a flickering candle flame,
          and then vanishes -- just like the old man and the
          Astronomer.


  1212RESUME

          Johnny tries to maintain his composure after this vision
          as the officer glances at the license and registration.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It looks sort of like a dog... or
                        a wolf.  When you're looking up
                        at it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

          The cop hands him back the license and registration.

                                        HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        There's a scenic turn-off a few
                        miles up the road.  You might
                        have better luck.

          Johnny nods.


  1313EXT. SCENIC TURNOFF - DAY

          Johnny is parked at a scenic vista point off the rural
          highway.  He is looking through his binoculars at the
          distant landscape.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/16/02 - PINK-2    8A.


    13CONTINUED:13

          JOHNNY'S POV - BINOCULARS

          He scans the area, finally spotting a low mountain that
          has some vague resemblance to the meteor impact site in
          his vision -- but it is obscured by a couple of hills in
          the foreground.


          RESUME

          Johnny takes down the binoculars and consults a map he
          has already opened onto the hood of his car.


          CLOSE ON: A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP

          Johnny's finger traces a winding country road that looks
          like it might take him in the direction of the mountain.          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/9/02 - GOLD        9.


  1414EXT. END OF THE ROAD - DAY

          Johnny's car runs out of road in front of a stand of trees. 
          He slows to a stop and gets out.

          Johnny considers the boundary of vegetation that lies
          before him -- this is where the unknown begins.  He takes
            a daypack and his cane out of the car, and slams the door. 
          He heads with resolve into the trees.


  1515EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY - SERIES OF DISSOLVES:

          -- Johnny walking through a stand of trees.

          -- Crossing a small stream.

          -- Standing on hillside, scanning with binoculars.

          -- Walking through another stretch of trees and brush,
          more dense, more genuine wilderness.  A little tired,
          Johnny sits down on a rock in a small clearing to catch
          his breath.

          The SOUND of quiet drumming.  Johnny is puzzled.  He looks
          around.


    1616JOHNNY'S POV - A FALLEN TREE TRUNK

          Nearby is being softly "beaten" over and over again by a
          breeze blown plant.  The sound is strangely suggestive of
          a drum.


          RESUME

          The breeze suddenly turns into a cold wind, and Johnny is
            instantly chilled.  He pulls his jacket closer around him --
          it is far too thin for this environment.  The distant
          SOUND of a HOWL.  Johnny shakes his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Great.

          He stands, grabs his cane, and moves off.          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/9/02 - GOLD       10.


  1717EXT. NARROW ANIMAL PATH - DAY

          Johnny is walking along a narrow, brush-lined path along
          the top of a steep incline.  The wilderness is absolutely
          silent.  The path he is on seems ancient.  As if countless
            creatures have cut this arrow across the landscape.  His
            footsteps fall rhythmically on the earth, syncopated
          because of the cane, strangely like a drum... suddenly he
          hears a distant, rushing ROAR... Johnny reacts...


  1818NEW ANGLE - JOHNNY IN A VISION

          A blinding light from above almost whites out the scene...
          the ROAR flashes by.


  1919RESUME

          As the vision ends but Johnny finds himself disoriented
          and off-balance -- he tries to turn around and his cane
          catches on a rock that slips out from under him.

          Johnny suddenly pitches sideways, off the path and down
          the steep incline!


  2020EXT. STEEP INCLINE - DAY

          Johnny tumbles and rolls and slides along the rough ground,
          trying desperately to stop himself, finally smashing up
          against a clump of vegetation, which breaks the fall.

          Several tense moments pass as Johnny catches his breath.





















                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/10/02 - WHT-2     11.


    20CONTINUED:20

          He tries to move his leg and groans with the effort.  His
          trousers are torn and his leg is bleeding.  He stares up
          at the incline to mark the fall -- it's a long climb to
          the top.  He takes out the cell phone, opens it.


          CLOSE ON: CELL PHONE

          Which reads "No Service Area."


          RESUME

          Trying not to panic, he scans the slope for his daypack --
          which is a few feet further down the incline.

          Johnny locates his cane, several feet away.  Struggling,
          he crawls toward it.  Agonizing seconds later, he grabs
          the cane--


  2121EXT. ROCKY INCLINE - VISION - DAY

          ROSCOE is holding the cane aloft.

                                        ROSCOE
                          Sheriff!  

          Walt looks over from several yards away.  A search party
          of half-a-dozen people are carefully climbing among the
          rocks.  Walt starts moving toward Roscoe, then:

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        Walt.  Over here.


          INCLUDE BRUCE - VISION

          further down the incline.  He is crouching down next to a
          body -- Johnny's.  Walt joins him, takes a look.

                                        WALT
                                (grim)
                        Guess it got a little too cold
                        last night.

          Bruce just looks at him, devastated.  Vision ends.


  2222RESUME JOHNNY

          As he considers this.  His gaze travels up the way he
          fell -- no way.  Then back down -- just as steep.  He'd
          likely fall again.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/16/02 - PINK-2    12.


    22CONTINUED:22

          He scans horizontally along the incline.


          JOHNNY'S POV - A CLEFT IN THE ROCKS

          Not so far away.  And on the same level as his current
            position.  He uses the cane to reach down for his daypack,
          pulling it up to him.  Then he struggles toward the cleft.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


  2323INT. ROCKY CLEFT - DAY

          Johnny appears at the opening, shoving himself with the
          cane into the cleft.  Larger than he anticipated, not
          quite a cave, but definitely better than the open elements.

          He drags himself over toward the wall, reaches down to
          check his leg -- the torn pants above his knee are soaked
          in blood.  Johnny takes off his belt (or uses a piece of
          his ripped trousers), loops it inside the torn fabric,
          along his upper thigh, and pulls it into a rough tourniquet
          to stop the bleeding. 

          Johnny leans back against the wall to catch his breath,
          his hand reaches out to the rock face for support, and on
            contact--


    2424MULTIPLE HANDS - VISION

          Move across the rock, dissolving to replace one another. 
            Scrawling with marker, pen, knife, bright clay, burnt
          stick.  Leaving graffiti, initials, dates, symbols,
            Palaeolithic drawings.


  2525RESUME

          As Johnny feels a sudden chill he kicks something in the
          dark.  He casually picks it up - and it's an old crushed
          beer can... as he touches the can, he hears the SOUND of
          the roaring meteor in the distance, and the rock face in
          front of him is lit with sudden brightness.  He turns to
          find, not a meteor but --


2626A CAMPFIRE - VISION

          The roar becomes only the popping of the green wood, the
          brightness merely from the flames.*

    26CONTINUED:26

          And just beyond the flames are the ghostly images of four
          1980s vintage college kids drinking beer.

    26CONTINUED: (2)26

          One of the college kids lights a cigar, then tosses the
          lighter.

          Johnny watches as it falls behind a rock -- the vision
          ends.


  2727RESUME JOHNNY

          Who immediately hauls himself over to the rock -- sure
          enough, the lighter is still there.  He tries it, and
          even if the fuel is long gone, the flint still sparks.

          Johnny puts the lighter in his pocket, starts to gather
          pieces of loose wood strewn around, piling them together.

          Then he picks up what looks to be an old piece of broken
          antler, but flat and smooth.  Just as he is about to toss
          it over with the other kindling, his eye is caught by
            something on its surface--


          CLOSE ON: THE ANTLER FRAGMENT

          upon which two faint lines can be seen, as Johnny traces
          them with his fingertip -- a double-curve, intersecting.

          The SOUND of a low drum beating, somewhere nearby.


          RESUME JOHNNY

          who slowly turns toward the source --


  2828INCLUDE THE SHAMAN

          Native American, about Johnny's age, dressed completely
          in deerskin clothing, sitting by his own small fire,
          beating on a flat drum hoop with a drumstick, eyes closed,
          in concentration or even semi-trance.

          The man is wearing feathers and dried plants woven into
          his long black hair.  Two narrow green vertical lines
          rise above his nosebridge onto his forehead.

          This is a vision from a time long before Europeans landed
          on this continent. 

          Johnny sees an knife carved from antler held in a sheath
          against the Shaman's chest -- Johnny then glances down at
          the antler shard in his own hand.  Clearly it is the same
          object -- now worn smooth by the centuries.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 6/25/02 - PINK      14.


    28CONTINUED:28

          And this is what's causing the vision.

          Johnny watches as the man starts to speak a single word,
          eyes still closed.

                                        SHAMAN
                                  (welcoming)
                        Kwai... Kwai... Kwai...

          Johnny stares, fascinated -- when a sudden sharp pain in
          his leg makes him cry out.  He turns away, and as he does
          so --


          NEW ANGLE - THE SHAMAN

          Opens his eyes and turns toward the SOUND of Johnny's
          voice -- and sees Johnny!

          The Shaman reacts with amazement -- he is both frightened
          and excited.  As if he both expected and feared the arrival
          of this apparition.  He stops beating the drum and stays
          completely still.  Is Johnny a Demon?  A Spirit Guide? 
          How to tell the difference? 

          He stares at the antler shard in Johnny's hand, then
          glances down at the antler knife in his sheath.  Just as
          Johnny did, he concludes that they are somehow connected.

          As he watches, Johnny -- still facing away from him --
          drops the antler fragment.  And instantly disappears from
          the Shaman's vision.

                                        SHAMAN
                                (puzzled)
                        Toni odosaan?

          And anytime we're alone with the Shaman we're in the
          ANCIENT CAVE (i.e., no graffiti but with a small pool of
          water that doesn't exist in Johnny's era.)

          The Shaman thinks for a moment.  He puts down the drum
          and drumstick.  He stands, takes out the antler knife and
          waves it in the air.  He shakes it once or twice, then
          points it at the place where Johnny was standing before
          he disappeared.

                                        SHAMAN
                              (a command)
                        Pion n'wigomnok!

          Nothing happens.  Clearly, he is trying to make Johnny
            reappear, but doesn't know exactly how.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 6/25/02 - PINK      15.


    28CONTINUED: (2)28

          He walks over to exactly where Johnny was standing and
          tosses the knife down just as Johnny dropped the shard,
          and cries out in mock pain, imitating the same cry Johnny
          gave.  He looks around expectantly -- but no Johnny. 

          The Shaman thinks hard about this problem.  And seems to
          have an idea.  He picks the antler knife up off the ground,
          goes and sits back down next to his fire, taking the drum
          in hand.

          Then he starts to slowly beat on the drum with the antler
          knife, using it as drumstick.  As he closes his eyes in
            concentration--


  2929CLOSE ON: THE DRUM

          FADE IN:

  3030INT. ROCKY CLEFT - DAY

          Johnny is lying on his side, straining to light the small
          pile of wood he has collected with the old lighter he
          found.  The lighter sends out a spark with each try --
          but nothing catches. 

            Suddenly, he grits his teeth at a shooting pain in his
          leg.  He rolls over onto his back and pulls himself
            backwards and up against the rock wall to look at the
          leg.  Blood is dried and caked onto the torn up trousers,
          it's a real mess.

          The near subliminal SOUND of drumming.  So faint it might
          be the wind against the rocks outside.  Johnny glances
          down and spots the shard of antler nearby.  He considers
          for a moment -- it has a good sharp edge along one side --
          then picks it up.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


  3131THE SHAMAN (INT. ANCIENT CAVE - DAY)

          Striking his drum quietly but insistently with his antler
          knife.


          INCLUDE JOHNNY

          who suddenly APPEARS out of thin air.  The Shaman reacts --
          it worked!  But Johnny is facing slightly away from him,
          using the antler shard he has just picked up to cut the
          torn trousers from his injured leg.  Johnny does not yet
          know anyone else is there.

          The Shaman stops beating the drum, sets it aside, but
          keeps hold of his knife.

          Johnny suddenly feels as though he's being watched.  He
          slowly turns -- the Shaman looks quickly away the moment
          Johnny's gaze finds him.

          Johnny stares at the man for a moment, then at the antler
          objects in both their hands.

          The Shaman pretends to busy himself by tossing another
          piece of wood onto his fire, but Johnny isn't buying it.

          Johnny grabs his cane, struggles to his feet and takes a
          few halting steps closer, getting a better look at him.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 6/25/02 - PINK      17.


    31CONTINUED:31

          He leans way over, stares right into the Shaman's face --
          it's a comic moment as the Shaman avoids his eyes, still
          feigning ignorance of Johnny's presence.  Then Johnny
          leans up and turns away.

          The Shaman glances up at him as Johnny whips back around
          and their eyes lock.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (amazed)
                        You can see me.

            Intimidated, the Shaman instantly throws down the antler
          knife in his hand -- and disappears!

          Johnny considers this strange development for a several
          seconds, trying to process what he has just experienced. 
          He looks closely at the antler shard in his hand.  Then: 


          THE SHAMAN

          suddenly appears again, moving toward Johnny with antler
          knife in one hand, a gourd in the other.  His voice is
            challenging.

                                        SHAMAN
                        Awani gia?!

          Johnny reacts to this next development -- trying not to
          freak out at the sight of the knife raised toward him.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (cautious)
                        Hey.  How you doin?

          Johnny shifts his own shard of the same knife into a ready
            defensive position, held up near his chest.  The two stand
            face-to-face staring at each other.

          The Shaman suddenly points with the knife and shakes the
          gourd -- it is filled with tiny pebbles that make it rattle
          loudly.  He shouts.

                                        SHAMAN
                        Kadgwi achiwaldaman?!

          He circles Johnny only inches away from him.  And Johnny
          turns his head to follow, eyes wide, keeping his shard
          ready.  The Shaman circles him entirely, facing him the
          entire time, shaking the gourd.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry if I'm trespassing--


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 6/25/02 - PINK      18.


    31CONTINUED: (2)31

          The Shaman suddenly HOWLS in his face -- as if to scare
          him away.  Johnny pulls back slightly but doesn't flee.

          The Shaman stops, intimidated again.  He takes a step
          back.  He seems almost ready to bolt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I don't know what's happening
                        here any more than you do.  But
                        I'm guessing from the deerskin
                        pants that you lived a long time
                        ago. 

          The Shaman obviously doesn't understand a word.  But Johnny
          is saying it aloud for his own benefit, trying to puzzle
          things out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So maybe I'm having a vision of
                        the past and you're having a vision
                        of the future and this knife of
                          yours...

          He waves the antler shard in his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...is the link between us.

          The Shaman just stares at him for a moment, then suddenly
          howls again, and shakes the gourd right in his face--

            Instinctively, Johnny reaches out and grabs hold of it. 
          And on contact-- 

          The sudden SOUND of a distant rushing ROAR outside, and
          the light in the cleft brightens.  Johnny turns toward
          it, reacts.

          In a panic at the roaring sound that he too can hear, the
          Shaman yanks the gourd out of Johnny's hand, steps back
          and throws down his knife -- vanishing as he does so.

          But Johnny has been galvanized into action, he drops the
          antler shard and bolts toward the entrance, covers a short
          distance then falls, losing the cane!  He cries out,
            clutching his leg.  Despite severe pain and the immobile
          leg, he drags himself forward, as the rushing ROAR grows
          and the light gets brighter.

          He makes it to the outer edge of the cleft, and stares
          into the sky--          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 7/9/02 - GOLD       19.


    3232JOHNNY'S POV - THE METEOR - VISION

          Plummets down through the blue sky, a rocky fireball that
          arcs past with a deafening roar and smashes into the side
          of the small distinctive mountain Johnny saw in his vision,
            exploding in fire and debris.


  3333RESUME

          The vision ends and everything is still and quiet once
          more.  Johnny looks out and sees the exact same mountain
          that was just hit, now sitting placidly across the small
          valley in front of the cleft.  Then he glances up toward
          the clear blue sky in the direction he saw the meteor
          first appear.  Johnny is completely energized, despite
          the pain -- this is exactly what he wanted to see.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (voice shaking)
                          Origin... southwest... forty-degree
                        angle from the horizon... maybe
                          forty-five...

          He drags himself back inside the cleft to where the cane
          came to a rest and grabs it, using it to help shove him
          along until he can reach his daypack.

          Johnny pulls out his topographical map and opens it up--


          CLOSE ON: THE TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP

          As Johnny's finger traces his path into the wilderness
          and to the cleft, and from there to the mountain, which
          he stabs at with his finger. 

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)

          RESUME

          Johnny excitedly keeps tracing on the map.

          --He is suddenly hit with a wave of agony from his leg. 
          Johnny fights the dizziness, fights to stay conscious but
          can't, he shudders in the cold night and as he starts to
          pass out, he reaches for the antler shard nearby, grasping
          it in his hand -- the one lifeline he has to another human
          being.  And he's out.          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 7/9/02 - GOLD       20.

          concern on his face.

          He hangs up the phone, moves to a road map on the wall
          and Bruce moves with him.

  3535INT. ROCKY CLEFT - SUNSET

          Johnny's eyes flicker open... he's in bad shape, terribly
          cold... whatever internal injuries he has in his leg are
          taking a serious toll... he sees his hand still resting
          on the antler shard, then reacts with a start as he finds --


          ANGLE - THE SHAMAN

          Looking down at him... the Shaman takes a cautious step

    35CONTINUED:35

          back when he sees Johnny move... he seems to realize the
          serious distress that Johnny's in... Johnny is weak but
          company is a good thing right now... it keeps him focused
          and awake... he's raises himself up a bit.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess you probably think I'm
                        some kind of spirit or demon. 
                                (re: his leg)
                        Can a spirit bleed? 

          The Shaman doesn't understand the words, but the calm,
          reassuring tone of Johnny's voice calms and reassures.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds crazy, but I need your
                        help.  I'm hurt, I'm stuck out
                        here.
                                (re: Shaman's fire)
                        And I need a fire or I'm gonna
                        freeze tonight -- I was a lousy
                        eagle scout... can you help me?

                                        SHAMAN
                                (cautious)
                        Kagwi k'didam?   

          The Shaman considers this, his mind working, processing
          this bizarre experience.  Johnny suddenly starts to shiver. 
          He holds up a stick of the cold wood.  His voice falters.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need a fire.  I know you
                          understand.

          A long beat.  The Shaman suddenly grabs a burning branch
          from his own fire, moves over to Johnny's pile of wood
          and touches it with his own flame.  Nothing happens.  The
          flame passes through it in a ghostly fashion.  Johnny is
            disappointed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was afraid of that.  Technically,
                        this fire of yours went out
                          centuries ago.

          The Shaman tosses the branch back into his own fire, then
          reaches high up the wall of his side of the cleft, and
          locates a piece of dried vine.  He yanks it off, then
          offers it to Johnny.  But Johnny is now impatient --
          they've just seen the process fail, after all.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not getting it--


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT TWO - 6/25/02 - YELLOW    22.


    35CONTINUED: (2)35

                                        SHAMAN
                        Wzomi tka!

          There is impatience in his voice as he shoves it toward
          his own fire -- it ignites instantly.

          Johnny stares at it, understanding completely.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have the wrong kindling.

          Energized, Johnny shoves the antler shard into his pocket,
          freeing his hands as he then moves toward the rock wall
          nearby, starts searching high along its surface for the
          same vine, finally locating a small patch hidden in the
          shadows.  He breaks off a few handfuls, puts them onto
          his pile of wood, then pulls out the old lighter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bet you've never seen one of
                        these.

          The Shaman watches wide-eyed as Johnny flicks the mechanism
          and the sparks catch against the vine, which flames up! 
          Johnny carefully works the burning vine among the other
            branches, and in a matter of seconds has a roaring fire.

          Johnny laughs with the success.  The Shaman can't resist
          a small smile as well.  Johnny warms his hands against
          the flames.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          Johnny indicates the rock nearby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Pull up a chair.

          But the Shaman suddenly turns and reaches for a huge
          Medicine Bag -- the size of a large pillowcase -- then
          turns it over, upending the contents onto the ground.


  3636SLOW MOTION: THE MEDICINE OBJECTS

          Spill out onto the ground, bouncing, catching the firelight --
          they sparkle and shine, almost seem to breathe and move
          of their own accord.  Then the illusion is shattered:

          And Johnny sees that this is very much a mixed bag --odds

          and ends of stones and bones and dried plants and pieces
          of wood, including but not limited to a clump of hair and
          a dead fish.

          Johnny nods, trying to look appreciative.

          The Shaman quickly locates a small bundle of animal fur
          and picks it up, untying the leather strap that holds it
            together.  He opens it gently as he moves toward Johnny,
          then places the contents onto Johnny's open hand--


          A TINY BLUE EGG

          The brightest blue there is.  Like a jewel.  The egg in
          Johnny's hand takes him to--   


3838A TINY BLUE EGG - VISION

          The egg is now sitting in a bird's nest in the crook of a
          slender branch.  A small hand is reaching for it.  WIDEN
          TO REVEAL:


  3939EXT. FOREST TREE - DAY - VISION

          The hand belongs to the Shaman, now a small boy, six years
          of age, on a branch high in a tree -- the two narrow
          vertical green lines on his forehead identify him.

          Johnny is also up in the tree, sitting on a nearby branch,
          watching this.  Johnny is amazed and even delighted to
          find himself in this vision.  There is no injury here, no
          pain (and a reminder: Johnny does not use the cane in his
          own visions.)

          The boy is unaware of his presence.  Johnny watches as
          the small hand stretches further and further, but the egg
          is just out of reach.  He is suddenly concerned.

          One more stretch, a little more, too much --


          ON JOHNNY

          who winces with the SOUND of crashing branches as the
          child falls O.S.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          THE BOY

            semiconscious at the base of the tree from which he has
          fallen, head bleeding, is struggling to sit up.  Find
          Johnny now standing on the forest floor, watching as the
          boy rouses slightly, and stares down at the blue egg,
          which miraculously, is intact in his hand.  Then he hears
          a SOUND -- of footsteps.  Not soft, off the forest floor,
          but harsh, echoing off a street -- and with the added,
          syncopated tap of a cane.

          Both Johnny and the boy look up in the direction of the
          sound.

  4141THE SPECTRE 

          Begins to take shape as it approaches like a distorted
          image on hot road... until to our astonishment we see the
          spectre is wearing the black peacoat and his third leg is
          a cane, and in fact, it is JOHNNY SMITH.

                                        JOHNNY SMITH SPECTRE
                        There's still time.

          But the spectre of Johnny disappears into thin air...
          close on the boy... find Johnny watching this... completely
          astonished as the vision ends and we're back...

          SARAH'S silhouette, sitting in silence at her vanity table. 
          She's completely still, like a patient shadow.

          The SOUND of the phone RINGING and she instantly answers
          it, her voice filled with anticipation and concern.

          Walt is standing by his Sheriff's dept. vehicle, talking
          on the radio set to Sarah.  The headlights illuminate
          Johnny's abandoned car parked where the road ends -- Roscoe
          is checking it out.

                                        WALT
                        We found Johnny's car.

                        hiked in.

          Another deputy with a flashlight passes by, heading for
          his own vehicle.

                        Mom?

          Sarah reaches over and clicks on the small lamp at her
          table, revealing JOHNNY JR. in his pajamas.

                                        SARAH
                        What's the matter, Sweetie?

                                        JOHNNY JR.
                        I can't sleep.

          Sarah reacts to this -- is the boy having some unconscious
          foreboding about his father?  But she puts on as good a
          front as possible.

                                        SARAH
                        Join the club.

          The boy just stands there.  Sarah indicates her lap.

                        The club is over here.

          He moves toward her and she helps him climb into her lap,
          where she holds him as he buries his head against her. 

          But they both keep their eyes open.


  4646INT. ROCKY CLEFT - NIGHT

          Johnny stares at the contents of the medicine bag strewn
          across the rock floor, trying to put his most recent vision
          into perspective.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Which you would've gotten from
                        any European trader.  Which means
                        you lived before they got here. 
                        Maybe four, five hundred years
                        ago?  At least.

          He turns away from the objects.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So five hundred years ago, you
                        fall on your head and have a vision
                        of Johnny Smith.  Why?

          The Shaman can read the puzzled tone in Johnny's voice.

                                        SHAMAN
                        Awani gia?

          He too, is puzzled.  He's been puzzled his entire life. 
          And finally, he wants an answer.  The Shaman moves to the
          objects and finds a broken arrow...

          The Shaman turns and extends it toward Johnny.  Johnny
          stares at it for a moment.  Then puts out his hand and
          makes contact, ramp to his face --


  4747EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY - VISION - THE SHAMAN

          Now an adolescent of 14 years, the same two vertical green
          stripes rising up his forehead, is raising a bow and arrow
          as he hunts a deer standing at a pool of water, drinking.  

          As the boy takes aim at the deer--

          Suddenly stands between him and the deer!  The spectre
          stares right into his eyes.

          And the Shaman holds out a small fetish object... a wooden
          stick to which has been tied a few bright feathers and
          tiny seashells.  Johnny takes it in hand --

          ENCAMPMENT IS IN THE BACKGROUND AS A MATTE SHOT) -
          MATCHING SHOT OF THE FEATHER FETISH

          Johnny Spectre standing in the background and we rack
          focus to see him clearly... the Shaman, now eighteen,
          same lines on his forehead, is holding the feather fetish
          defensively in front of him, as if hoping its magic will
          chase away this demon.  But it's not working.  He yells
          at the spectre...

                                        EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SHAMAN
                        Awani gia!?  Awani Gia!?

          Moving to find he's in a simple encampment of bark and
          animal skin-covered lean-tos.  And all the people of this
          small rugged community -- A couple of adult women scraping
          birch bark with sharp-edged stones, an old man sits by
          himself fashioning a fishhook from wood, three younger
          women are carrying water in skins to a birch pot above an
          open fire and one particularly pretty girl near-by that
          perhaps he was courting before the spectre made his
          appearance -- none of them can see the spectre - they
          only see the crazy young man... a couple of children laugh
          at him, the others barely notice anymore.


          ON HIS HURT AND CONFUSED FACE...

          the vision ends and we are back in...


  5252INT. ROCKY CLEFT - NIGHT - AS BEFORE

          Johnny reacts to this vision, letting go of the fetish.

                        "Who are you?"  "What do you want?" 
                        "Why don't you just leave me the
                        hell alone?"

          The Shaman studies him, not comprehending.  A beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've been waiting for me to

                        That's why you can see me... that

                        both operating out of our dead
                          zones... huh?  

          Johnny considers this for a moment... picks up his cane
          and holds it out for the Shaman... in essence returning
          the favor of the medicine bag offerings...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I don't know if it will work
                        for you like it worked for me. 
                        But you want to know who am I? 
                        Take it.  Maybe it'll help us
                        figure out why our powers have
                        brought us together.

          The Shaman tentatively reaches out for the cane and as he
          touches it, ramp to his face as we usually ramp to Johnny's
          and he finds himself in...


  5353INT. JOHNNY'S CAR - NIGHT - PARTIAL CLIP FROM PILOT

          --and into the passenger seat of Johnny's old convertible! 
          Johnny at the wheel.  The Shaman may have experienced
          strange visions, but he's never been in a car before --
          his hands are fiercely gripping the seat and door, his
          eyes are wide.  Then suddenly a huge truck looms up in
          front of them.  The Shaman puts his hands out to stop it --
          shouting loudly.          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT THREE - 6/25/02 - PINK    31.

          The Shaman throws down the cane in panic.

                          Kwe-yoh!

                        I guess it worked, huh.

          The Shaman stands, heart pounding, scared but driven to
          know the answers he seeks... he walks away a few steps
          but then gathers his courage and returns and sits again...
          stares at the cane...

                                        JOHNNY

          The Shaman watches as the Nurse is suddenly grabbed by

          jumps back.

          The fire is still smoking in the background.  The little
          girl is safe in the arms of a firefighter.

          The Shaman is standing nearby, watching this with great
          interest... perhaps beginning to understand that the
          words...

                        Yes, I'd want to know what it
                        means too if I were you...   

          His voice has taken on just a hint of a drift.  His eyes
          get distant.  His head lolls, the Shaman's voice is
          suddenly sharp as he indicates Johnny's injured leg.

                                        SHAMAN
                          Kwe-yoh!

          Johnny glances down -- a pool of blood is forming beneath
          his leg.  He is stunned back to full consciousness.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whoa.

          He grabs down at his leg, turns aside the fabric of his
          trouser leg -- the wound is open and bleeding freely.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: cleft entrance)
                        My little stroll must've made it
                          worse...

          Johnny tries to adjust the strip of fabric he tied above
          the wound, and thinks aloud.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can't go any tighter on the
                          tourniquet, that would cut the

          The Shaman suddenly turns to him holding a lit firebrand
          from his own fire, offering it.  Johnny is confused.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Didn't we already go through this?

          But then the Shaman waves the flame with intent toward
          Johnny's open wound.  Johnny suddenly understands -- and
          shudders at the prospect.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stone age medicine?  No thanks. 
                        I'll shake that rattle and say a
                        prayer to the Great Spirit.  But
                        I'll be damned if...

          He stares at the pool of blood.  He struggles to keep his
          wits and keep from panicking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Lose any more blood and I lose
                          consciousness.  That happens it's
                        all over.

          Almost without thinking about what he is doing -- as if
          to think about it is to change his mind -- Johnny pulls
          himself a couple of feet over to grab a burning brand
          from his own fire.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have to stay alive till the sun
                        comes up.  Keep the fire going. 
                        They'll see the smoke.  Just stop
                        the bleeding.  A little heat to
                          cauterize the veins.  That's all.

          He pulls himself back into position, leg wound exposed,
          fiery brand in position.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No problem--

          --He suddenly stabs the flaming branch into his open wound --
          and cries out in agony as the SOUND of flesh searing and
          blood vessels cauterizing sizzles off the walls.  Then he
          drops the branch and faints from the pain.

          The Shaman takes a step closer and inspects the wound
          with a "Stone Age" expertise that pronounces the procedure
          a success.

  6161INT. OBSERVATORY LAB - NIGHT

          The Astronomer Johnny met with earlier is directing Bruce
          to a computer monitor.  She's drinking from a can of
          Mountain Dew.

                                        BRUCE
                        Sorry to drag you out of bed.

                                        ASTRONOMER
                        Are you kidding?  I'm an
                          astronomer.  Vampire schedule.   

          The Astronomer goes to the computer, moves the mouse and
          gives a click.  The housecat screensaver is replaced by a
            satellite view of southern Maine.

                                        ASTRONOMER (CONT'D)
                        You said he took the Picture Rock
                          turn-off, right?

                                        BRUCE
                        That's where they found the car. 

          The Astronomer clicks on a smaller section of the image
          and it suddenly fills the screen -- it's the same region
          covered by Johnny's topographical map.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's still got some ambulatory
                        issues from a previous accident. 
                        I'd say the furthest he could
                        handle in a day is about fifteen
                        miles.

                                        ASTRONOMER
                                (mental calculation)
                        That's about a hundred and eighty
                        square miles of ground to search.

                                        BRUCE
                        Which is why we want to narrow it
                        down.  Did he give any indication
                        of where he was headed?

                        impact site.  Of the asteroid. 
                        The one he saw...

          Her voice trails off into skepticism.

                        In his vision.

                                        ASTRONOMER
                        Right.

          She suddenly reacts to some of the data on the screen.

                                        ASTRONOMER
                        That's odd.

                        This data includes geological
                        surveys... look at that Iridium
                          spike...

          She makes another click, which replaces the map with a
          readout of pure numbers.  Her eyes are very curious
            indeed...

          Johnny stands on a high vantage overlooking the Indian
            encampment... and again it's wonderful to be here...
          without pain, without injury... the breeze of a thousand
          years years ago drifting through his hair...

          to one of terrible realization...

          A beat.  The Shaman reacts.  It's a great struggle for
          Johnny to speak.  He raises himself up as far as he can.

          Johnny extends his hand toward the Shaman.  The Shaman
          stares at it.  Everything that went before -- the visions
          that altered his life, this encounter in the cleft, the
          mistrust and misunderstanding -- have all led to this
          moment.  He grasps Johnny's hand--


  6666EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY - VISION

          Johnny and the Shaman are among the people of this tiny
            community... a rushing ROAR and the people stare into the
          sky like deer caught in the headlights, and watch with
            incomprehension as a meteor flashes across the heavens
          like an arrow, striking the mountain with a tremendous
          explosion.. as time stops in its tracks... people frozen...
          flames already halfway down the slope, heading toward
          them.  The Shaman looks with horror from his doomed people
          to Johnny.

          Johnny nods...

          Their hands unclasp, ending the terrible vision.  The
          Shaman has been shaken to the core; Johnny has been
            energized with hope.  He drags himself toward the
            topographical map and the Shaman rushes to help him along.

                        they're descendants... of your
                          people...

          He grabs the map, pulls it into position.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (almost raving)
                        Must be hundreds of them... maybe

          Johnny stabs his hand out at the map.

                        It's all going to burn.  You've
                        got to get them out.  You have to
                        make them believe you.  They won't
                        want to believe you.

          The visions and context have been enough -- the Shaman
          understands the implications completely.  He points to
          the spot on the map below the mountain where the encampment
          is -- then traces a line down the valley and across a
          river.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes.  Get them across the river.

          Johnny tosses the branch into the fire.  He falls back
          onto the ground as the Shaman stands over him, unsure of
          whether he should go now or stay and help Johnny.  Johnny's
          voice is strained, closer to delirium.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I did what I had to do... now
                        it's your turn... that's the
                          trick... with our little gift...
                        you do what you have to do... and
                        you never know why... until the
                        end...

          His mind clears for just a moment and he points at the
            entrance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go.

          The Shaman takes off, moving quickly toward the opening. 
          Then he pauses and looks back -- Johnny has passed out
          completely.  He stares at him for a moment.  Then he takes
          the antler knife from the sheath, lets it fall from his
          hand -- and disappears from this world.

          OFF Johnny, still as death.

  6868EXT. OBSERVATORY - DAY

          Bruce is standing by the cruiser in the parking lot, a
            topographical map on his hood, talking on his cell phone,
            animated.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny didn't have a vision of a
                        meteor that was gonna hit, he saw
                        one that already hit.  Not in the
                        future.  In the past.  The
                        geological surveys prove it.

          Walt is in the same clearing where we saw Johnny rest
          during his hike into the area, talking to Bruce on a
          handset with transmitter.  A couple of deputies are with
          him, other searchers are moving through the trees.

                        Go ahead.

          Bruce stares at the map -- the exact same mountain that
          Johnny indicated on his own map has been circled.

                                        BRUCE

  7070INT. ROCKY CLEFT - DAY

          Johnny is unconscious, possibly dead.  


          THE SHAMAN

          is standing at the entry to the cleft, having just arrived,
          his antler knife is back in its sheath.  His face is more
          calm and collected than we have ever seen.  He moves toward
          Johnny and crouches next to him, studying his face.

          Johnny is out completely.  His breathing is barely
            perceptible.

          The Shaman glances at the fire, sees that it's burning
          very low, almost out -- generating no smoke at all.

          He puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder.  We are in a
          vision.


  7171EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY - VISION

          Johnny is walking along a small path, wearing his black
          peacoat and leaning on his cane.  There's something
            dreamlike about him.  He might be dreaming; he might be
          in somebody else's dream.

          Several of the Shaman's people are going in front of him,
          carrying their belongings.  This is clearly the migration
          of these people to safety.  Johnny turns to find the Shaman
          walking at his side.  Their words throughout this sequence
          are matter-of-fact and dreamlike.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gagwi yo?  Are we escaping to the
                        river?

          The Shaman puts a hand out and stops him.  The others
          keep moving on ahead.

                                        SHAMAN
                                (re: others)
                        They are.  We have somewhere else
                        to go.

          His voice has no trace of an accent.           THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT FOUR - 7/3/02 - GREEN    40A.


  7272INT. ROCKY CLEFT - DAY - VISION

          Johnny and the Shaman climb into view.  They move into
          the space, and Johnny pauses at the small pool of water. 
          He crouches down, takes a handful of water and drinks it.

                          Goodbye.

          He opens his eyes.  The SOUND of the helicopter is louder. 
          It's approaching and will pass by.  Johnny looks at the
          low fire, and knows he has one chance.  He pulls himself
          together long enough to grab a handful of dried vines
          piled nearby, and shove them onto the fire.  It flares up
          instantly, and smoke quickly ascends toward the sky.

          Johnny falls back down, and as his eyes start to close,
          he pulls the antler fragment from his pocket, clutches it
          in his hand.  The SOUND of a growing ROAR from outside. 
          Johnny's gaze moves toward the source --

          His animal skin garment billows momentarily like a peacoat,
          he is holding a wooden branch like a cane -- his silhouette
            mimicking the image that haunted him his entire life. 
          It's as if he has become a final homage to the demon who
          turned out to be a spirit guide -- and his own destiny.

          The ROAR of burning atmosphere grows, the light outside
          gets brighter and brighter, fiery red, yellow, then finally
          a dazzling white that washes out the screen.  And the
          ROAR becomes the chopping whirl of helicopter blades. 
          And the SOUND of a radio.

          The helicopter is on the ground.  Johnny is being slowly
          moved along on a gurney toward a paramedics van that is
          set up as a emergency unit.

          Bruce is moving alongside the gurney.  IVs are in Johnny's
          veins, he is conscious but dazed.  He suddenly grabs hold
          of Bruce's arm.

          stand of postcards for sale.

          drawing has changed -- to the simple but elegant image of
          a man with a cane.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
