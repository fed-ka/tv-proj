      FADE IN:

      MUSIC:  JINGLE BELLS

      We open on a LARGE CHRISTMAS-Y STORYBOOK.  A HAND opens the 
      book and we see...

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (DAY ONE)

      QUICK CUTS:  ADAM, BLAKE and ANDERS are merrily decorating.  

      ANDERS places a FRAMED CHRISTMAS PHOTO of him and the guys on 
      the mantle.

                                  BLAKE
                          (re: photo)
                    Hung by the chimney with care, fine 
                    sir.

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Ders and ADAM are putting the final touches on a CHRISTMAS 
      TREE with BEER-CAN ORNAMENTS as BLAKE teeters on a chair 
      placing a BEER BONG FUNNEL on top like an angel.

                                  ANDERS
                          (singing)
                    Do you see what I see?  

                                  ADAM
                          (singing wrong)
                    I sure do.  A star dancing in the 
                    night. 

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      The guys, drinking EGGNOG from a GIANT KEG, squeeze FROSTING 
      onto CHRISTMAS COOKIES (one is a Santa on fire).

                                  ADAM
                    Okay, guys, time to bundle up.  
                    We ve got some cheer to spread.

                                                                            CUT TO:                      Workaholics 106 - Network Draft - 4/2/10             2.


      EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD HOME - DOORSTEP - MOMENTS LATER

      We come in on BLAKE S FINGER ringing a DOORBELL.  We widen to 
      see the guys in Christmas sweaters, scarves, earmuffs, etc.  
      A MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in shorts and a tee shirt opens the 
      door.

                                    ADAM/BLAKE/ANDERS
                          (singing)
                    Deck the halls with boughs of 
                    holly, Fa la la la la--

                                  MAN AT DOOR
                    Are you drunk?  Why are you singing 
                    Christmas carols in the middle of 
                    July?

                                  ADAM
                    Ummmm, we re trying to deliver some 
                    god damn holiday cheer in the name 
                    of Half Christmas.  And yes, we re 
                    super drunk.  
                          (to the guys)
                    Now, where were we?  Okay... 
                          (conducting )
                    Three and two and one and--

                                    ADAM/BLAKE/ANDERS
                          (singing)
                    Deck the halls with--

                                  ADAM
                          (interrupting them)
                    Cut, cut.  Blake, no.  I need... 
                          (singing)
                    You up here... 
                          (singing a lower note)
                    Because I m down on F-sharp.

      As the Man at the Door SLAMS the DOOR SHUT we...

                                                                          SLAM TO:

      MAIN TITLES.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      We see a HAND turn a page in our LARGE CHRISTMAS-Y STORYBOOK. 
      (NOTE:  We see this PAGE TURN effect on all subsequent Act 
      changes.) 

      INT. OFFICE - ALICE S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING (DAY TWO)

      ALICE is at her desk on the PHONE.  The guys, still bundled 
      up in Christmas garb, give a slight knock on the open door 
      and come in.

                                  ALICE
                          (into phone)
                    I ve gotta go, someone just took 
                    three shits in my office.
                          (hangs up, to guys)
                    What... are you wearing?

                                  ANDERS
                    Alice, since we are your top 
                    earners and we ve been here over a 
                    year with no time off or any 
                      vacation...

                                  ADAM
                    Which we don t even mind because we 
                    love working for such a multi-
                    talented professional...
                          (flirting)
                    ... confident lady of the world 
                    such as yourself.

                                  BLAKE
                    But we were wondering if we could 
                    get a couple of days off to 
                    celebrate Half Christmas.  A 
                    tradition in the Holmson-DeMamp-
                    Henderson household.

                                  ADAM
                    It started in July four years ago 
                    when Blake here went out to buy a 
                    keg, but returned with a keg full 
                    of eggnog.  It s become a super 
                    deeply religious tradition.

                                  BLAKE
                    The eggnog was on sale.  Probably 
                    because it d been there since 
                      Christmas.

                                  BLAKE (CONT'D)
                    We drank that sweet nectar of gods, 
                    we sang, and Adam ended up naked in 
                    the neighbor s truck.

                                  ADAM 
                    And so it was that Half Christmas 
                    was born.

                                  ANDERS
                    What do you say?  It s just two 
                    days. 

                                  ALICE
                    Get the fuck out of my office.

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

      The guys are gathered at their cubicle licking their wounds 
      after Alice s steam roll job.

                                  ADAM
                    She pretty much just  talk to the 
                    hand -ed us.

                                  ANDERS
                    You realize you rarely make any 
                    sense. 

                                  ADAM
                    Your hair doesn t make sense. 

                                  BLAKE
                    Guys!  We can t let her negativity 
                    tear us apart.  It doesn t matter 
                    where we are... the spirit of Half 
                    Christmas lives in all of us.

                                  ADAM
                    Blake s right.  We should totally--  
                    wait, was there a plan in what you 
                    just said?  Or were you just like 
                    saying something super profound?

                                  ANDERS
                    I think he s saying if we can t 
                    stay home for Half Christmas, we 
                    should celebrate it here.

                                  BLAKE
                          (covering)
                    Exactly.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                      Workaholics 106 - Network Draft - 4/2/10             5.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ADAM
                    Just like Fake Easter.

                                  ANDERS
                    Right.  Except if I fall asleep, 
                    and somebody dyes my balls purple, 
                    you will see the Norwegian side of 
                    me.

      Adam and Blake look terrified.

                                  BLAKE
                    Ders, trillax your mind.  Let s 
                    just go get decorations so we can 
                    turn this boring cubicle into a 
                    magical Half Christmas winter 
                      wonderland.

                                  ADAM
                    Time to stomp this yard.

      EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - A BIT LATER

      The guys WALK across the parking lot.  Anders carries a LIST.

                                  BLAKE
                    Wrapping paper?

                                  ANDERS
                          (marking things on list)
                    Got it.

                                  ADAM
                    Popcorn and thread?  Pumpkin pie?  
                    Case of Activia?

                                  ANDERS
                    Yes.  Yes.  And banana-strawberry.

                                  BLAKE
                    Wrapping paper?

                                  ANDERS
                    I said it s on the list.

                                  BLAKE
                    Just checking it twice, homie.
                          (R&B singing)
                    I plan on being gnaw-T.

      The guys stop when they see GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEES on strike 
      outside the front door. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                      Workaholics 106 - Network Draft - 4/2/10             6.

                                    GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEES 
                    Hell no, we won t go.  Pay us right 
                    or close the sto(re).  

      It s a bunch of MIDDLE-AGED FOLKS and YOUNG BAG BOYS/GIRLS, 
      holding SIGNS, CHANTING, and listening to a shitty RADIO.  
      Adam, impressed, pulls aside one of the Bag Boys holding a 
      MEGAPHONE.    

                                  ADAM
                    What s going on out here?

                                  BAG BOY STRIKER
                    We re on strike for more pay, 
                    better hours, insurance--

                                  ADAM
                    Let me get this straight, you get 
                    to hang out in a parking lot all 
                    day, shouting at people and not 
                    working?  

                                  BAG BOY STRIKER
                    Well, yeah, sort of.

                                  BLAKE
                    And do I smell barbecue?
                     Cause I am not mad at that.

                                  BAG BOY STRIKER
                    We deserve paid days off for the 
                    amount of work we do.

                                  ADAM
                    I heard that.

                                  ANDERS
                    Great, can we go?  
                          (pointedly, so Bag Boy can 
                            hear)
                    Unlike these freeloaders, we have a 
                    job we actually show up for.

      The Bag Boy shoots him a dirty look.

                                  BLAKE
                    What s with you, sen r grumpy?

                                  ANDERS
                    My dad had a plastics factory and 
                    when his employees went on strike; 
                    the business went under.  Our

                    We had to leave the country club in 
                     95.  Ever wonder why my cross 
                    court serve practically returns 
                    itself?  I went from clay court to 
                    ghetto court... 
                          (snaps fingers)

                    I thought you guys worked here.

      Clueless, Adam and Blake don t get it.  Off the strikers  and 
      Bag Boys  annoyed looks we CUT TO:

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE - A LITTLE LATER

      The guys put the finishing touches on their Half Christmas 
      cubicle decorations.  Their CHAIRS are WRAPPED in wrapping 
      paper, some of it looks a bit Christmas-y, some of it says 
       Happy Retirement.   POPCORN STRINGS and BLINKING LIGHTS run 
      along the cubicle walls.  They are trimming what looks to be 
      the sawed off BOTTOM HALF of a CHRISTMAS TREE.  Alice enters, 
      visibly annoyed.

                                  ALICE
                    Down.  Now.  All of it.  It s 
                      distracting the entire office.

                                  ADAM
                    How so?

      A TOY TRAIN WHISTLES past on a track running atop the cubicle 
      walls.  It circles the entire office.  JILLIAN pops over the 
      cubicle wall wearing a TRAIN CONDUCTOR S HAT.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Next stop--
                          (notices Alice)
                    Work Town.

      Jillian takes off the hat and exits awkwardly.

                                  ALICE
                    And put that tree back.  It was 
                    obviously pulled from the shrubs 
                    outside the building.

                                  BLAKE
                    It most certainly was not.  In 
                    fact, it s not even real.  We

      A BIRD flies out of the tree and through the office.

                    P.S.  There s no such thing as Half

                    do you like yours, delicious or 
                    super delicious?

      Adam and Karl grab burgers and start digging in.

                    Super, please.  If I were at work

                    Holmson.

      It takes Ders a second to snap to attention.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    I need you on a special assignment 
                    and I need you mobile.  Take this.

      She hands him a WIRELESS EXECUTIVE HEADSET.  SPARKLE!  He 
      puts it on, loving it.

                    Glad I can count on you to stick

                    sports shit.

      Ders looks back to the Half Christmas photo on his desk.  
      He s torn for a moment, then catches HIS OWN REFLECTION in 
      the photo and sees how cool he looks in the headset.  He puts 
      the frame on his desk, face down.

      Ders is interrupted by some noise down the hall...

      INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Adam and Blake are standing on a table in the middle of the 
      office   la Norma Rae, rallying a crowd of co-workers.

                                  ADAM

                    SUCK OUR DICKS!  SUCK OUR DICKS!  

      The crowd starts joining in.  Ders and Alice make their way 
      through to the front of the crowd.

      Adam ends up over Anders  shoulders, in a fireman s carry.  
      He starts carrying him outside.

      INT. OFFICE - JILLIAN S DESK - AFTERNOON

      Ders is overworked.  He s trying to send a fax for Alice, but 
      her phone is RINGING.  He picks up.

                                  ANDERS
                    Hello, Alice Murphy.  Please hold.

      INT. OFFICE - ALICE S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Alice is on the phone with corporate, INTERCUT with reactions 
      from Ders (at Jillian s desk) listening.

                                  ALICE

                    They tasted like ass.

      INT. OFFICE - JILLIAN S DESK - CONTINUOUS

      Alice approaches Ders, leaning over, confidential-style.

                    I guess so.  I mean, it really 
                    makes it harder for sales if we re 
                    calling people that already said 
                    don t call.  Not to mention it s

                                  ALICE
                    Yeeeah.  Listen, you want to run 
                    with the big dogs?  Sometimes 
                    you ve got to wear a muzzle.

      She pantomimes putting a muzzle on Ders  face and tying it 
      behind his head.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING (DAY THREE)

      Blake and Adam are eating cereal at the breakfast table.  
      Ders enters.

                                  ADAM
                    Morning, scab.

      Ders tries to pour himself a bowl of TRIX, but Adam snags the 
      carton out of his hand.

                                  BLAKE
                    Sorry, Ders.  Trix are for kids... 
                    and union workers.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah.  Maybe you should stop and 
                    get some food at  Traitor Joe s. 

      Anders stares daggers.  Blake and Adam hi-five.

      INT. GUYS  CAR - LATER, ON THE WAY TO WORK

      Adam and Blake sit in the back seat while Ders drives.

                                  ADAM
                    Hey scab driver and low down dirty 
                    dogg, can you drop us off right 
                    here, please?

      Ders stops the car and lets the guys out, into:                     Workaholics 106 - Network Draft - 4/2/10             24.


      EXT. OFFICE - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

      Adam and Blake get out, and immediately stand right in front 
      of Ders  car.  Other strikers from the office join behind 
      them.  SOME are wearing Christmas clothing.

                                      ADAM/BLAKE/EVERYONE
                    Scab!  Scab!  Scab!

                                  BLAKE
                    Turn your vehicle around, sir!

                                  ADAM
                    Don t let this commie bastard cross 
                    this picket line!

      The crowd descends on Ders  car, chanting at him.  He s 
      forced to get out and make it on foot.

      BLAM!  He gets nailed in the back with white liquid.  REVEAL 
      Adam pumping kegnog frantically to be thrown at Ders.

      Ders runs for the door, but soon everyone is throwing kegnog 
      at him.  He shouts back to Blake and Adam.

                                  ANDERS
                    You proud of yourselves?  Filthy 
                    animals!

                                  BLAKE
                    I wish we didn t have to do this 
                    Ders!  It breaks my heart.  On Half 
                    Christmas Eve, of all days. 
                          (then)
                    FIRE IN THE HOLE!

      Blake whips another cup of kegnog at Ders, who just barely 
      ducks inside.

      INT. OFFICE - JILLIAN S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

      Alice comes out to talk to Anders before he can even sit 
      down.  He s trying to wipe the kegnog off of his outfit.

                                  ALICE
                    Here, I want you to give your

                    Show them what team you re playing 
                    for.  Oh, and tell them thanks for 
                    giving it thirty percent every day.

      Anders swallows and sucks it up.

                    You re being groomed, And-ers.

      Ders is frozen -- no she didn t! -- stung by the betrayal of 
      her mispronouncing his name.  Ders exits.

      EXT. OFFICE - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

      Ders hands Adam and Blake some envelopes.

                                  BLAKE
                    So this is how you re going to play

                    What did you expect would happen?

      Adam opens the envelope. 

                                  ADAM
                    Guess we know what kind of friend 
                    you are. 

                                  ANDERS
                    Guess so.

      As Ders walks away.

                                  BLAKE
                    Thanks a lot!

      INT. OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      On one side of the table: Alice and Ders.  On the other, Adam 
      and Blake, with a semicircle of their co-strikers behind 
      them. 

                                  ALICE
                    Okay.  Tell me what the hell this 
                    is all about.  You have a  list of 
                    demands? 

      Adam reads from a list.

                                  ADAM

                    One milkshake water fountain,

                    Christmas party, to be paid for by 
                    the company. 

                                  BLAKE
                    The party is pretty much the reason 
                    for the season.

                          (calmly)
                    That s a good list.  Some good 
                    ideas in there.  What I think you 
                    guys should do at this point, is 
                    chop your dicks off, and then park 
                    them up your own buttholes.

                          (to Blake, whispering)
                    Okay.  We use that as a starting 
                    point, and negotiate from there.

                                  ALICE
                    And-ers, get these jag-holes off 
                    our company property.

      Anders doesn t react. 

                                  BLAKE
                    Oh, I m pretty sure that s not 
                    going to happen.

      He pulls out PAPERS from the ENVELOPE that Ders gave him, and 
      slides them across the table to her.

                    Wouldn t want that information to

                    Where did you get this?

                                  BLAKE
                    We got it from the tightest 
                    butthole on the block.  ON-ders!

                                  ADAM
                    He s got a hard ON.

      Anders nobly walks over to the other side of the table.

                    Sometimes you have to make your own 
                    Half Christmas miracle.

                                  ALICE
                    That s... nonsense.  That doesn t 
                    mean anything.

                                  BLAKE
                    You want to try to explain why all 
                    of your employees were calling 
                    numbers on the  do not call  list? 

                                  ALICE
                    Look, I was just following orders 
                    to protect my job.  Recycling the 
                    leads was all corporate.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh really.  Well who s going to 
                    protect our jobs?

      Adam and Anders discretely exchange low-fives.  That was 
      dope!

                                  ALICE
                    Okay, okay.  I ll give you all your 
                    jobs back.  And I ll give you two 
                    paid personal days per year.

                                  CO-WORKER 2
                    Well that s not good enough!

                                  ALICE
                    Fine.  I can t give you milkshake 
                    water fountains, because that s not 
                    a real thing.  But you can have the 
                    rest of the day for your stupid 
                    Half Christmas Party.

                    health insurance?  My daughter has

      Adam runs up to Alice to shake her hand.

                    eggnog, I m gonna go start up the

                    a white Half Christmas!

      Outside the window, it looks like snow is falling!  Our guys 
      huddle up by the window to see what s going on.

                                  ANDERS
                    Let s go outside and make snow angels!

      EXT. OFFICE - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

      REVEAL Karl on the roof, dumping ashes from the grill onto 
      the cars below.  Then he hoists up the still frozen TURKEY.

                                  KARL
                    FUCKING SCABS!!!

      Karl chucks it and it lands on a car.  The alarm SOUNDS.

      ... and THE LARGE CHRISTMAS-Y BOOK closes shut.
