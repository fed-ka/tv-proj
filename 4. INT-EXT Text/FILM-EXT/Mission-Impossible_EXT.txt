SARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter.
Another legend:
PRAGUE
ETHAN's POV of Embassy.
The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River.
Party
at the Embassy tonight.
JACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.
But as he pulls the
final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes
and SPARKS.
ETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the
waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous
couple.
ETHAN
In position.
Jack open the door, let the
package roll.
JACK (O.S.)
Roger that.
Opening doors now.
ETHAN
Stairway, youre wrapped, go to
transport.
ETHANS voice comes over HANNAHS earpiece.
HANNAH
En route.
HANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs.
Through the monitor, ETHAN sees JACKS P.O.V. of the roof of
the building approaching.
Fast.
ETHAN
Cut the power.
Cut the power Jack.
Do
you hear me.
ETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was
JACKS signal.
ETHAN
Jack.
Jack.
He closes his eyes, knowing what that means.
PHELPS hurries towards the bridge.
PHELPS
En route.
PHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the
river, toward the Embassy.
He throws a look back, over his
shoulder.
Paranoias setting in.
Outside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the
service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in
the midst of a lovers quarrel, in Russian.
Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is
still racing to meet ETHAN.
But he stops suddenly, as if
hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening
gloom.
ETHAN and SARAH hear PHELPS voice over the monitor.
SARAH
The package is in the open.
ETHAN
Jim.
Jim.
Hes in the open.
PHELPS (O.S.)
Ive got a shadow.
ETHAN
Can you lose him?
PHELPS (O.S.)
No.
Abort.
Over ETHANs shoulder, SARAH sees GOLITSYN getting away.
Fog
starts to roll over the river towards the bridge.
SARAH
Ethan.
Hes out of pocket.
ETHAN
(to Phelps)
Jim we cant.
PHELPS (O.S.)
Abort.
Thats an order.
ETHAN
Negative, Golitsyns on the move.
Outside the Embassy, SARAH and ETHAN argue.
ETHAN
Sarah eye on the package.
Jim, Im
coming to you.
SARAH
Jim gave an abort, we should walk
away.
ETHAN
No, were going to recover the disk,
understand?!
Now move!
ETHAN takes off for the bridge, leaving SARAH to shadow
GOLITSYN.
HANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle.
ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs.
PHELPS (O.S.)
Where are you?
ETHAN
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
PHELPS (O.S.)
Theyre covering this frequency, Ethan.
Cut all radio communications.
Repeat.
Cut all radio communications.
ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.
Past
CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.
He looks on his monitor
and again sees PHELPS POV.
Only ominous silence.
Phelps is
looking back over his shoulder.
The bridge is deserted.
SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where
a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.
He disappears
into the fog at the edge of the river.
ETHAN checks his monitor again.
THE MONITOR
PHELPS point of view changes radically as his head swivels
on the darkened bridge.
He whirls again, looking over his
shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible,
pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a
GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.
The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down
to a bloody hole in his own chest.
His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge
and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.
ETHANs face goes white with shock.
ETHAN
JIM!
He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but theres
no sign of PHELPS.
ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but
sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming
obscured in the gathering fog.
He turns and looks to the embankment.
He can faintly see
GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade.
ETHAN gives chase.
ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point
on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIRES outline,
visible in the drivers seat.
But as he descends the stairs
--
--the car explodes and bursts into flames.
The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.
ETHAN
CLAIRE!
He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a
stunned CROWD starts to gather.
Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the
embankment.
SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees
GOLITSYN again, slowing down.
A MAN comes out of the fog an
seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.
SARAH draws closer.
Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to
be hanging with her for some reason.
ETHAN continues towards the embankment.
SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN.
Suddenly, the MAN in front of
GOLITSYN pulls him towards him.
Sensing something wrong,
SARAH quickens her pace.
The MAN is now hunched over
GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYNs
pockets.
The figure finds what its looking for -- the disk -- and
takes it.
SARAH comes closer --
-- and the figure whirls.
It brings a knife up sharply,
plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.
ANGLE
ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment.
He bursts
out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees,
over GOLITSYNs body.
ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and
GASPS.
He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.
He
looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated
edge.
BEHIND ETHAN
The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more.
In fact, theyre
watching ETHAN.
Through the fog and night, they see him
leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.
AT THE BODIES
SARAH goes still.
ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body
over and sees that it is GOLITSYN.
He quickly begins
rummaging through his pockets.
ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...
ANGLE
A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in
front of the Embassy.
The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop
suddenly.
As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the
explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley
and out of sight.
ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.
Hes
holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a
modernist cockroach.
He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts
of the phones wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.
He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phones tongue
down for a second, releases it and listens.
He has a dial
tone.
Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by
heart.
After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.
FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
Satcom seven.
ETHAN
Central Europe.
Unsecured.
FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
Designator?
ETHAN
Bravo Echo one one.
FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
Switching.
There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the
line.
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
This is Kittridge.
ETHAN
Go secure.
Pause.
A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line.
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
Go ahead.
ETHAN
Theyre dead.
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
Whos dead?
ETHAN
My team.
Claire, Jack, even Jim -
- Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
Are you damaged?
ETHAN
They knew we were coming.
Golitsyns
dead too.
The disk is gone.
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
Are you intact?
ETHAN
Do you read me?
The list is in the open!
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
Let's just bring you in safely, and then
we'll worry about that, okay?
Were you
followed?
ETHAN closes his eyes.
KITTRIDGES voice is strong and
reassuring and he needs that right now.
ETHAN
I dont think so.
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
Dont think, be sure.
Are you clean?
ETHAN
Yes.
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
Location green.
One hour.
Ill be there
myself.
ETHAN
Youre in Prague?
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.
Dont
disappoint me.
ETHAN
No sir.
KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
One hour.
He hangs up.
ETHAN does the same.
He stares at the phone
for a moment, thinking.
He checks his watch.
ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the
street.
Every face seems to be starring at him now, every
sound is menacing.
He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his
hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.
ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering,
gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by
residential buildings.
ETHANS POV
Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built
on the portico of an old palace.
Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively
shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.
ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the
deserted square.
Silence.
ETHAN enters the darkened entry.
ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A
MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to
ETHAN.
ETHAN
Excuse me, could I trouble you for a
match?
Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As
ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm
and escort him into a car which has just pulled up.
The OTHER MAN comes out on the balcony.
Nothing out here but
a beautiful day.
He walks to the railing and looks down at
the street.
Down below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street
sign.
WOOF.
WOOF.
WOOF.
Abruptly, it stops.
A pollution control van and a taxi arrive amidst other street
activity. KITTRIDGE and the FEMALE CZECH AGENT exit the taxi
as BARNES and TWO OTHER UNDERCOVER MALE IMF agents leave the
van.
MAX, ETHAN, MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN move quickly across
the bridge that connects Max's apartment to the tower.
KITTRIDGE kicks open the door to the balcony, comes outside,
and looks around.
Nobody in sight.
KITTRIDGE
GOD D-
Seen from the air, CIA headquarters is a sprawling complex,
two huge buildings surrounded by acres of parking lots hacked
out of a thick forest.
LANGLEY
SIRENS BLARING, three fire trucks race past an inconspicuous
gray van parked on the shoulder of a two lane highway.
One fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the
parking area of the headquarters building.
Second truck
roars past.
LUTHER watches it go.
It may be a HUMAN SCREAM or it may be a SIREN'S WAIL but it
echoes over the forest as a lone fire truck ROARS away from
the headquarters building, making its escape.
Night. This street is a row of nondescript hotels, one after
the other, with anonymous names like "Hotel Pomeroy," "Hotel
Vincent," and "Hotel Berridge."
LONDON
ETHAN comes out from a side street by Liverpool Street
Underground Station and crosses the road to the main station.
CLAIRE watches him from the window.
ETHAN
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was
an especially nice touch.
Close Digital clock.
It reads 23.59.
Angle widens to show
ETHAN looking at it with grim satisfaction.
He opens the
door of the phone booth and almost SMACKS right into --
--the pale, weary, ghostlike figure of a man standing just
inches in front of him.
Startled, ETHAN looks up, but what
he sees shakes him to the core.
The man is JIM PHELPS.
ETHAN SHOUTS and almost falls back into the phone booth.
PHELPS leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly.
PHELPS
You're a hard man to catch up with.
PHELPS falls towards ETHAN.
ETHAN tries to speak, but can't
even form words.
INT - RAILWAY STATION CAFE (DAY)
ETHAN and PHELPS opposite one another in a booth, PHELPS
looking clammy and listing to one side.
But the banter
seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close
colleagues able to follow one another's reasoning easily,
finishing each other's sentences:
PHELPS
..the next day I managed to drag myself
to the safe house, must've just missed
you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
ETHAN
- and picked us up in the States -
PHELPS
- but you left before I could get there
and I could check just so many places..
ETHAN
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize
customs records -
PHELPS
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed
up in England..it was easy.
ETHAN
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool
Street.
PHELPS
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
ETHAN
I remember..
PHELPS smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an
upright position.
He opens a medicine bottle and takes the
pain killers.
ETHAN
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?
A
doctor's gotta look at that.
You can't
sit up straight.
PHELPS
I can sit up straight.
I just can't..sit
up straight very well.
It's not
important!
I saw who shot me.
Ethan, I
saw the mole.
It was Kittridge.
(a fist into the table)
Kittridge!
PHELPS grips the sides of the table.
ETHAN
Kitteridge.
Oh my god!
Kittridge is the
mole?
PHELPS
Yeah.
ETHAN
How did Kittridge do it?..
A reprise of PHELPS'S narrative only now ETHAN'S telling it
and camera is showing the events as ETHAN sees they actually
happened.
ETHAN VO
- first he took care of Jack in the
elevator -
At the Embassy PHELPS sends the elevator to the top of the
building, watching it go and crush Kiefer.
ETHAN VO
- he shot you on the bridge -
On the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the
gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them
into the Vltava River.
ETHAN VO
- he must have had back up take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence..
There on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is KRIEGER
who takes out GOLITSYN and SARAH thru the fence..
ETHAN VO
How did he do Hannah?
Here it is CLAIRE with back to camera who presses the
detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion
brilliant behind her...
ETHAN VO
No.
No.
He could've taken out Hannah
himself.
PHELPS presses the remote detonator and the car blows..
Suddenly its bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our
eyes.
KITTRIDGE and BARNES step off a military helicopter, blinking
at the sunlight and hurry down the steps.
TWO AGENTS immediately flank KITTRIDGE at the bottom and fall
into step alongside, ready to brief him.
One of them holds
out a small package with "for Job" written on it.
KITTRIDGE looks at him.
He rips it open.
A note inside
simply says:
TGV.
LONDON TERMINUS
Noon.
KITTRIDGE looks at his watch.
Its ten to twelve.
As he reads the note, something else falls out of the
envelope and CLUNKS to the ground.
He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it.
Cradled in his
hand, we cant see what it is.
But to him, its very
interesting.
He steps up his pace, headed for the car.
KITTRIDGE
(to the Agent)
How long to the London Terminus?
AGENT
Twenty, twenty-five minutes.
KITTRIDGE
Youve got ten.
Move!
KITTRIDGE and BARNES looking - stop in doorway.
BARNES
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
KITTRIDGE
This is bullshit - we dont even know
what Max looks like.
BARNES
Maybe we dont have to know what he looks
like.
If hes got that list, hes going
to want to check it.
We should be
looking for laptops.
KITTRIDGE
Good idea.
-- halfway out onto the roof of the train.
He reaches into
his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle
on the end of it.
He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof
and pulls himself the rest of the way out.
He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the
smooth surface of the train.
Now for the tough part.
Using the suction cups, PHELPS
slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and
replanting the cups as he goes.
He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the
back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply,
a window for the ENGINEER.
Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his
belt.
He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.
From out
of the fog, a helicopter approaches.
PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is
going.
In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching
the tunnel under the English Channel.
His eyes widen.
PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position.
Looking up, he
sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns.
ETHAN is climbing out the trap door.
A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost
touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it.
ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position.
Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to
grab small holes on the roof.
He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other
way.
Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof.
PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto
his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the
roof.
ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto
the roof.
PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously
closer to the chunnel entrance.
They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance.
PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the
train.
PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the
strap manages to pull himself back on.
-- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel --
-- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT!
For a moment, we see no one.
No ETHAN.
No PHELPS.
Moving
around to the other end of the car, we see where they've
gone.
They're dangling from either side of it.
PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself
back onto the roof of the train.
ETHAN reaches for the other
cup.
The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track
and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER
pushing it up to full speed again.
But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the
train.
PHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the
windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of
KRIEGER'S copter.
He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the
other direction.
Another train.
At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the
oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the
roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as
it blows by.
The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS
misses the skid.
KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate
ETHAN with the rotor.
PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the
copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the
tunnel.
SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.
KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly.
ETHAN uses the moment to
leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid.
PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another.
Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls
out --
-- a red and green piece of bubble gum.
PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles
frantically for his gun.
ETHAN
Red light, green light.
Asta Lasagna
mother fucker.
ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the
copter's underbelly and turns away from it.
PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING --
-- but the gum EXPLODES.
The force of the blast rockets
ETHAN forward, he lands on the train's windshield.
The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers
wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under
the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball.
ETHAN, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the
wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him.
It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor
blade barely missing his throat.
ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly
drained.
LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while
he sips a beer.
A television screen is featuring follow-up
coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in
the chunnel.
Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of
a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in
the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was
there were no other fatalaties.
There are intermittent
sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of
arrivals and departures.
ETHAN into shot.
He sits beside
LUTHER.
LUTHER
Reach your folks?
(ETHAN nods)
How they feeling?
ETHAN
About what?
LUTHER
The official apology from the Justice
Department, the VIP treatment, you know,
the whole nine yards.
ETHAN
Well my Mother was a little confused
about how the DEA could mistake her and
Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida keys.
LUTHER picks up his beer.
LUTHER
(Laughs and with a British accent)
Cheers.
They drink.
ETHAN
Here's to
you, Luther. (clink glasses)
To
being off the disavowed list.
LUTHER
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
ETHAN
You're more than that, Luther.
They were
mistaken about you and they're trying to
show you they know it.
They want you
back in.
LUTHER
Sure.
They want me back in so I won't
break in!
They still can't figure out
how we did it.
ETHAN
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
LUTHER
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back
pay, give me a promotion, check out my
office at Langley and then, maybe, talk
about it.
ETHAN
(laughing)
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
LUTHER
Why don't you come back with me?
ETHAN
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
LUTHER
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
ETHAN
He was a good guy for a long, long time.
Just - not long enough. (looks up) Gotta
catch my flight..(rising)
So.
How's it feel being a solid citizen
again?
LUTHER
Oh man...I don't know.
I'm gonna miss
being disreputable.
ETHAN
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any
better I'll always think of you that way.
The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no
more.
The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a
moment ETHAN disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative
LUTHER looking after him.
