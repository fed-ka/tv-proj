A PRESENTER is standing behind a lectern, with a large crystal
vase award. Behind him, on the stage, we see a 'European
Entrepreneur of the Year Award' banner.
PRESENTER
Orphaned when he was just a boy, Harry
Papadopoulos came to this country with
nothing.

We cut to the family seated at a round table. The children look

PRESENTER (CONT'D)
Harry was a grafter, entering the
restaurant trade as a young man.
(Beat) That's a euphemism for 'Greek
waiter' isn't it?
There is some laughter in the audience. We cut to HARRY again,
who attempts to smile off the joke.
PRESENTER (CONT'D)
Only joking Harry. He then started the
now famous Papadopoulos & Sons - doing
all things Greek. From taramasalata to
olive oil and frozen mousakas - which,
I must admit, my wife and I are
partial to occasionally. Not one to
settle, Harry's made the move into
commercial property where he's about
to embark on one of the most audacious
developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza.
A two million square foot
redevelopment in the heart of our
great city. (Applause from the
audience) Ladies and Gentlemen, I give
you European Entrepreneur of the Year.
Harry Papadopoulos.
Awards music. We now cut to HARRY getting up from the table. He
momentarily acknowledges the applause. The children are clapping
politely but absently.

It's the photo call for 'European Entrepreneur of the Year.' A
PHOTOGRAPHER is taking shots of HARRY holding his award. KATIE,
JAMES and THEO stand alongside their father. The children look
disinterested.
PHOTOGRAPHER
That's lovely. (Referring to the
vase) Now just hold it up a bit for
me. Yeah, that's nice. Bunch up a
bit.

Just look at the camera.

Come on guys. Big smiles. Big smiles

Daddy?
HARRY
A long time ago. Touch it.

DAVE
Nice one Mrs P.
MRS PARRINGTON
Oh, thanks Dave. Would you like to
stay for some supper?
DAVE
Oh no. Best not. Got some dinner at
home. That's a nice vase, isn't it?
HARRY
European Entrepreneur of the Year.
DAVE
That's impressive.
JAMES
Dave. Did you g.. g.. get my cuttings?
DAVE
I did mate. It's in the greenhouse.
I got you a Caryopteris and a

JAMES
Cheers man. Thank you.
DAVE
See you later.

DAVE
I was just helping him out during the
holidays.
HARRY
Well, I need him to complete his
studies and you're diverting his
attention. And frankly, it's not what
I pay you for.
Dave doesn't answer.
HARRY (CONT'D)
Please don't be so churlish. You know,
if you were worked for my company
you'd probably be fired.
DAVE
Yeah. Is there anything else?
HARRY
No. That's it.
DAVE
Goodnight Mr. Papadopoulos.
DAVE exits. JAMES comes through the hallway. He has overheard
some of the conversation and he's upset. He walks past HARRY and

HARRY taps on JAMES' door. There is no answer. He walks in.
HARRY
James? Can I come in?
JAMES' room resembles a botanical garden. JAMES is at his desk
with pots of plants and various tools and test tubes with soil
and desk lamps. JAMES looks through a microscope, studying a
leaf, ignoring his father. HARRY surveys the room trying to
accommodate his son's interest in botany. He notices a poster of
Charles Darwin with a quote. He reads it out.
HARRY(CONT'D)
It is not the strongest to survive,
nor the most intelligent but those
adaptable to change. Fascinating.
Charles Darwin. (Latching onto a
random plant) Ah. Look at that. (Beat)
And that's...
JAMES answers without looking up from the microscope.
JAMES
Did you know, that the average garden
contains over three and a half million
species?

HARRY
Look. Finish your studies. The plants.
It's a hobby. Sure. Give yourself
options. You may change your mind
about the business. You know, there
are a lot of creative roles now in
business.
JAMES
Like what?
HARRY
Like marketing. Alright. Defer the
final year. Take a year out, why not?
Fine. But don't quit. Your mother
would have said the same.
JAMES
Would she?
HARRY
Well, your mother would probably have
said do what you feel was right but
I'd argue she was wrong. And then we'd
argue. Probably. And she'd win. That
was your mother. At least consider
deferring.
JAMES thinks about it.
JAMES
Okay. I'll consider deferring.
HARRY
Yeah? Great. Great. So, there you are,
it's not a definitely not?
HARRY wants to bond but doesn't know where to start. HARRY
latches onto an English Ivy in a Union Jack plant pot.

For a fish.
Nicholas points towards a fish hung across the wall.

Sweet mother of God. They are sons of

FAT LAKI
They've taken a new position on the

It's triggered the guarantees.

Can you sell it?

It's not even a building site yet.
SOPHIE
So, its bankruptcy.

Well, the obvious is to buy back your
own business.
SOPHIE
Trick is finding the investors to back
you.
HARRY
And the banks will sell back to me

ROB
Because nobody makes pink slop like
you do Harry.

shop. This deal you're working on
could take ages. In the meantime,
you're getting cash in and you're
saving money because it's got two
bedrooms. Eh? The Three Brothers is a

THEO picks out an old plaque-mounted stuffed fish.
SPIROS
This is Mr Charles. Our lucky fish. He
helped us make the busiest chip shop
in London.
SPIROS takes in a deep breath.
SPIROS (CONT'D)
I can smell the past. Your father and
I. Young. The women. Young. Making
good money.
HARRY
Wasting it. Gambling it. Losing it.
SPIROS
Happy days.
KATIE
It's a crack den!
SPIROS
Don't worry. Let me show you the rest.
We'll make it homely. Furniture, beds,
TV. Come on. Let me show you. So...
here is the prep room...
The children follow SPIROS through the shop. HARRY is left
looking at the place, taking it all in. He takes out his mobile
and calls.

SOPHIE
Oh hi. It's Sophie. We met at your
office, the other day.
HARRY
Oh hi. Any news?
SOPHIE
We're lining up interest.
HARRY
Right. Well, I just need to know... I
need to know if this is going to work.
SOPHIE
Rest assured. We'll be driving the
herd to Abilene.
HARRY
Sorry.
SOPHIE
It's an old American, Mid-West
expression. (Beat) Are you okay Mr.
Papadopoulos?
HARRY
Yep, all good. Just keep me informed
please.
SOPHIE
Of course.
HARRY hangs up. ROB enters.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)
Harry Papadopoulos called. You should
call him back.

Let's go out, yeah. Let's celebrate.

New York. Yes, you can stay friends
with Matt. And Bill and Susan. Mom,

SOPHIE puts the phone down.
ROB
Parents. Is Matt your...
SOPHIE
Ex.
ROB
Right. A bit of a tosser, yeah?
SOPHIE
I wouldn't say tosser exactly. We
just wanted different things.
ROB
Yada, yada, yada. Yeah, I hear ya.
It's like me and my ex. She was
keen and everything but I don't
know, her forward thinking sort of
killed the romance. Yeah. (Silence)
It's good to have these little

You'd still be key to running the

HARRY
But?
ROB
Money isn't cheap Harry. These guys
will want at least 95% of the company.
HARRY
Leaving me with nothing. I'd do the
same thing. I'd be CEO of
Papadopoulos & Sons. Get a salary.
Get my house back. My children's
future.
ROB
It beats fish and chips.
SOPHIE
You'd be working for someone else.
HARRY
I'd be working for someone else. By
the way, I'm not actually running a
fish and chip shop. Just helping my
brother relaunch.
ROB
Sure. Listen, there maybe another
way. Came up in conversation with
the Norske Velconan Bank. It'd be
along the lines of a straight loan
to buy back the business.
HARRY
Why would they lend me the money?
ROB
Well. Let's ask them. Want me to look
into it?

Sure, no choice.

An internet ready, wireless, crapper

For the love of God. Because taking a
dump needed an overhaul. Still,
somebody's got to bury them. Inomine

SOPHIE
Got to love a downturn.
ROB
Laters.
ROB exits. SOPHIE starts to pack her files.
SOPHIE
I think what you're currently doing
with your brother sounds liberating.
HARRY
I'm liberating myself of my last 25
grand on a disused chip shop.
SOPHIE
But its like a startup. Isn't that the
most exciting phase of any venture?
Taking a bit of a risk. Developing
your products and your services.
Learning about your market. Look, some
of the largest companies on the planet
never make a profit. Like a real
profit. It's all accounting tricks and
leveraged debt. What I'm trying to say
is, does it matter if the business is
a small one? As long as it makes a
profit and the people who work there
are happy?
HARRY
What are you doing working in a place
like this?
SOPHIE
This is only temporary. I got divorced
recently. Came to London for a fresh
start. I'm actually looking into
setting up my own business.
HARRY
Well, I'm sorry about that. About the
divorce, I mean. Not...

Trading. I watch trends. Making trades

SPIROS
The fundamentals?
THEO
You know, capital employed, gearing
ratios etc. Not even turnover or
profit. It's short term, but I can
spot a trend. I know what's going to
happen.

So, you can see the future? And?

Don't worry. I'm not too religious.
I'm a lapsed Buddhist. I do

SPIROS farts. Harry shuts his eyes and shakes his head in

SPIROS (CONT'D)
Ear plugs.
SPIROS gets into the sleeping bag and turns off the light.
SPIROS (CONT'D)
Oi re. This is a fantastic thing. Did
you ever imagine, 30 years ago? Back

HARRY
No.
SPIROS
Remember how excited we felt when we
got this place? It feels like that

Alaskan Pollock. Over Cod! What do you

HARRY
I should never have taken out that
loan.
SPIROS
Ah. We'll talk fish after we fix this

see HARRY sitting alone in the van. He's not part of the
activity. We see scrubbing, cleaning, fixing. Boards are
taken down. Inside we see people painting and the fish fryer
cleaned. We see product displays go up. We see SPIROS with
manic and crazy enthusiasm. JAMES and KATIE messing around.

FAT LAKI
There's a reason Hassan's still in
business. Texture, very good. Way
above average. Meat content. High.
Mechanically recovered cheap
rubbish? You wish. This is a
quality donner, nicely cooked with
all the right combination of herbs.
It's beautiful.
SPIROS
It doesn't mean we can't take them on.

We'll make a better product at a
cheaper price with larger portions.
We'll lose money on the kebabs in the
short term, put Turks out of business
within a year, make our margins on the
fish and when the rest of this crummy
street has packed up we'll raise our
prices and cut our portion sizes.

Dropped me down. I was just a baby.

told Mihalis to jump. But he... he ran
right back into the house. We'll never

He probably wanted to save his Mum and
Dad.
SPIROS
You know what? I never thought
about that. You could be right.
Yeah. You are a wise boy James.
Your soul is old. Tell me. This has

This includes, and is not limited to.

I didn't steal the shoe. Are you
going to read all of that?

SPIROS
Harry, you were so fast. You were
like a plane, like a supersonic

HARRY
But I gave you everything you
wanted. Did I ever once turn you
down? In all the years after I left
the business. Did I? And after it
went bust? But it was never enough.
Every week something new. Writing a
cheque to... I don't know. You had
some weird friends. Who was that
bloke with the pin head? Kept
turning up at the house.
SPIROS
None of my friends anymore.

And then drunk at Elizabeth's funeral?

ROB
With the help of Lars and the Norske
Velconan Bank, we aim to buy Pap and
Sons back from the receivers.
LARS
Also, I have to say Harry that I
believe there is an intuitive bond
between the Greek and the Nordic
peoples, yah? And so, maybe the very
first vikings were descended from
Ancient Greeks, somewhere in the deep
mists of time. And so it's so... so
Wagnerian, yah?

SOPHIE
We should point out the new approach.
ROB
To buy Papadopoulos & Sons but divest
the food manufacturing side of the
business.
HARRY
Divest the food manufacturing? What
else is there?
ROB
Sell off the food but keep the
property.
LARS
Papadopoulos Plaza. It's going to be
worth a fortune.
HARRY
That's not what I had in mind.
SOPHIE
It's an asset breakup.
LARS
Tusk. Tusk, yah? Makes us sound like
barbarians.
ROB
With the new loan, you'd buy back your
old assets and then sell off the
brands in the Pap & Sons stable.
LARS
Yah. And you know how to squeeze the
value Harry.
SOPHIE
That's a break up.
HARRY
Please. I know what it is.
LARS
The pitta bread, the cakes get sold to
a bakery.
ROB
The halloumi and feta to a dairy
company.
LARS
I love your halloumi! Grilled. It's...

ROB
The sell off value of these brands
will exceed the new loan.
LARS
So my bank will get its money back
faster than you can say 'knife'.
HARRY
And what do you get?
ROB
Lars wants 50% of the Plaza
development. Which is what will remain
after the debts have been settled.
HARRY
So you get 50% of the development for
free.
LARS
Sure, yeah. But you get 50% of the
same development yah, also for
free.
SOPHIE
What do you want Harry?
HARRY
I want my food business back.
ROB
Guy,
guys, guys. Reality check. Harry.
It's
not going to happen. Okay? The
best
you can hope for is to work with
Lars
here and save something.
HARRY
I can't say no.
LARS
Okay. So. Yah. I need to take this to
the board. Take two, three months. But
pish, yah?
SOPHIE
It seems criminal to buy the business
back only to break it up.
As an aside to SOPHIE.
ROB
Can I just point out that you are
skating. Figuratively speaking. On
thin fucking ice.
HARRY
I'll do whatever the bank wants.

HARRY and SOPHIE are walking towards the lifts.
SOPHIE
Taking out a loan to pay off a loan?
So you can remortgage a property? It's
got nothing to do with business. It's
got nothing to do with making stuff.
HARRY
I get my life back.
SOPHIE
No. You get a loan for some land.
HARRY
My children get their lives back.
SOPHIE
I'm sorry. This isn't very
professional.
HARRY
Do you give all your clients a hard
time Sophie?
SOPHIE
No. Just the interesting ones.
HARRY
You got five minutes?
SOPHIE
Yeah. Of course.
HARRY
Just want to talk about the shop and
make sure my brother's got the right
plan before I go.
SOPHIE
Okay. Let's grab a coffee.

Food preparation montage. Music. Harry is filleting a fish.
Fish is being fried. Potatoes are being sliced and fried.
Pickled onions are being poured into the European
Entrepreneur vase. The shop is being cleaned and the kids
mess around. Fish and chips are being prepared.

HARRY and HASSAN are sitting in the living room. SPIROS sits
between them. Almost like a referee. HASSAN drinks a cup of tea.
HASSAN
It's not just fish and chips.
SPIROS
There's room for all of us.
HARRY
What do you want Hassan?
HASSAN
Remember when we were children? When
we were friends. We weren't Greeks,
Turks. Respectfully, I would like you
to take your kebabs off the menu. This
is a fish and chip shop.
SPIROS
What do we get?
HASSAN
I won't do fish.
HARRY
You don't do fish Hassan.
HASSAN
You are going to put us on the street.
HARRY
It's business.
HASSAN
It's not about business. Perhaps you
would not be like this if we were
Greeks.
HARRY
I'll tell you what. We'll take kebabs
off the menu, if you ask your son to
stay away from my daughter.
HASSAN thinks about this. He sips his tea.
SPIROS
More tea?

HASSAN
No. Thank you. This is very
difficult.
HARRY
Come on. It's easy.
HASSAN
My son is his own man.
HARRY
Right. There's no deal.
HASSAN
Is this because he's Turkish? Because
he's a Muslim?
HARRY
Oh no. I don't have a problem with
that.
SPIROS
Harry's not like that.
HASSAN
Because he works in a kebab shop? Is
that it?
SPIROS
Yeah. Harry's more like that.
HARRY
I would ask you - both of you - to
respect a man's aspiration for his
daughter.
HASSAN
I have similar aspirations for my son.
Spiro, perhaps you should remind your
brother where he is now. Tell him to
look around. Perhaps he still sees a
big mansion with gardens and servants.
Well, I don't. But more importantly,
neither does my son.
HARRY
This is only. We'll be gone in a
couple of months.
HASSAN
I hope so. It's going to be a very
long couple of months.
HARRY
For both of us.

HASSAN finishes his tea. There is an uncomfortable silence. At
this moment THEO comes in with a camera and takes a photo of the
three men sitting together.
THEO
Say cheese!
Flash. The scene of the three men is captured as a still
photograph. Music - 5000 Lies by George Zambetas.
CUT TO:

Music continues. We now see a series of photo stills, as you
would find in a family album or on a rotating screen saver. The
images cover over two months of activity at the shop and beyond.
Some of these shots are out of focus. Some are over exposed etc.
Some are badly framed. Sometimes the people in the shots are
aware of being photographed, sometimes not. They rotate once
every four or five seconds throughout the song. The images we
see are:
1. KATIE dangling two fish from her ears as if they are
earrings.
2. MRS PARRINGTON behind the counter of the fish bar having a
cup of tea.
3. HARRY in his fish and chip shop coat and hat looking
miserable behind the counter.
4. JAMES is sitting at one of the tables with half a dozen
plants. He is repotting.
5. KATIE and MEHMET outside the shop having a cigarette.
6. PHIL THE TILL juggling potatoes.
7. HARRY on the sofa fast asleep.
8. JIMMY THE PRIEST playing cards with FAT LAKI and PHIL THE
TILL. He is showing the photographer his three kings, while
the other players look on bemused.
9. HARRY with a tomato ketchup dispenser goofing around.
10. MRS PARRINGTON and JAMES present FAT LAKI with a birthday
cake.
11. HARRY and SOPHIE in the shop together having fun.
12. The three children, JAMES, KATIE and THEO pulling a see
no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil pose on a bench, outside
the shop.

THEO.
16. The entire family behind the counter posing for a shot,
as if for a local newspaper.
17. HARRY and SOPHIE sitting outside the shop, smiling.
18. SPIROS looking serious - staring out of the shop window.
Unaware.
19. A shot of HARRY and SPIROS outside the shop, looking at
at the camera. We are pulling out of the shot. SPIROS is
happy and smiling but HARRY is stern and serious. This photo
is held for longer. We pull out.

THEO looking at the same
photo on his laptop. He closes the lid.
The family is sitting at
a restaurant area table - SPIROS, MRS
PARRINGTON, HARRY, THEO,
KATIE and JAMES. On it, there is a
mobile phone. They watch
it in silence.
HARRY
So, here we are.
SPIROS
Here we are.
MRS PARRINGTON
I'm sure it will be good news.
HARRY
If it's good news Spiro, I want you to
have the shop. All of it.
THEO
Will we get to visit Uncle Spiros
again?
MRS PARRINGTON
Yes, of course we will.
SPIROS
Who's going to help me to run the
store? I'm going to need you little
man.
MRS PARRINGTON
I expect Uncle Spiros will always find
you a holiday job here.

The mobile phone rings. HARRY answers.
HARRY
Hello. Lars. Yeah. I'm just...
HARRY steps away from the table and exits the restaurant area.
We watch the family. They do not talk. HARRY comes back.
MRS PARRINGTON
What is it?
THEO
Did you get the loan?
HARRY
Bad news I'm afraid.
KATIE
Really?
HARRY
Yeah. We're going home! We got it!
We're going home.
The family's response is muted.
SPIROS
Congratulations.
HARRY
What's wrong? We're leaving, we're out
of here. We got the loan. We should be
celebrating.
The family are still unmoved.
SPIROS
He's right. It's a good day. You, you
made it. You're a survivor. Sorry.
SPIROS shows some discomfort and starts to get up.
HARRY
What is it with you Spiro? Why can't
you be happy for me? Whenever I have
any kind success you always have to
stamp on it. (Spiros gets up) Where
are you going?
SPIROS
I am happy for you. I am.
HARRY
What is it? What's wrong?
Spiros staggers off.

SPIROS is on an oxygen mask. HARRY, KATIE, JAMES, THEO and MRS
PARRINGTON are watching him.
THEO
He looks dead to me.
MRS PARRINGTON
No, he's not dead. He's sleeping. He's
still sleeping.
THEO
Like sleeping beauty?
MRS PARRINGTON
Yes. That's a good way of looking
at it.
SOPHIE enters. SOPHIE is carrying a cake.
SOPHIE
Sorry. I hope I'm not.
HARRY
No, no. Come in. (Indicating to
James to get a chair) James, James.
And take the erm... (Refering to
cake)
SOPHIE
Yeah, I heard the news and I really
wanted to bake something so I made
a Greek Easter cake. Don't ask.
HARRY
No. That's really... lovely. Thank
you very much. We'll, we'll have
some of that. He's in a mild coma
apparently and we have to talk to
him and play music and... James,
put the... turn the music on. (To
SPIROS) Hey, wake up. The
accountant's here. You've got to
wake up.
JAMES plays an Ipod in its dock. We hear the first bars of an
inappropriate song.
HARRY (CONT'D)
James!

Fuck off slag.
MRS PARRINGTON
Katie! James!
THEO
Let me do it!
HARRY
Wait! I can felt something. Katie. Get
the doctor.
KATIE
I don't want to ask.
JAMES
Oh for fuck's sake, I'll go shall I?
James exits and fetches a female doctor.
HARRY
Doctor. I felt something just now. A
gripping movement.
DOCTOR
Anything else?
HARRY
No, just a slight squeeze, is that
a sign?
DOCTOR
It could be a decorticate response.
It's difficult to tell.
HARRY
Right. How long's he going to be like
this?
DOCTOR
He's suffered a heart attack. It's
hard to predict. You should all take a
break. I'm sorry about him.

MRS PARRINGTON
Yeah. Okay. We'll leave you to it.
Come on. We'll just say goodbye to
Uncle Spiros.
The family depart. SOPHIE also goes to leave.
HARRY
Would you mind staying around?
SOPHIE
Of course.

HARRY and SOPHIE sit at SPIROS' side. It is late. HARRY is
gently singing Varka Sto Gialo (A Boat in the Harbour) to
SPIROS - a traditional Greek song. He is humming the parts he
cannot remember.
HARRY
So, he saved me twice. Once in the
fire, and once after the banks. I was
always embarrassed by him, you know.
By his thing that he does. You know,
his... 'thing'. But the thing that he
does. It's a good thing really. These
last few months. This year actually.
This whole year. God. What a year.
What a year. And yet. I've never felt
so alive. I've never felt so engaged.
Why is that? I mean why? I mean, I'm
frying chips.
SOPHIE shrugs with smile.
HARRY (CONT'D)
I love him. I've always loved him. And
I love my children. I love... I love
my life. I love it. Why is that? Why
do I love it now? What was wrong with
it before?
SOPHIE
It's okay. It's okay.
HARRY
It's a crazy, crazy, world. It's up,
it's down. You fight. You win.

You lose. You become exhausted. And

There's no logic. It's insane. It's

SPIROS wakes. He rips out the respirator from his mouth.
HARRY (CONT'D)
No, no, no, no. Spiro.
SOPHIE
I'll get someone.
SOHPIE exits.
HARRY
Spiro mou. Spiro mou.
SPIROS
Ella bethi mou. Ella tho. You have
to let me go. It's good. Michael's
with us. Michael. O Mihalis. He was
always there. Always with us.
Always. Three brothers.
HARRY
When I was a little boy. You cooked
for me. Every time I came home.
They were good times Spiro.
Efharisto.
SPIROS
Itan Kali zoi. A good life. Now you
understand. Levendis mou.
SPIROS smiles. He closes his eyes and dies.

Fade from black. Music continues. Close up on HARRY who is
sitting by himself. He has just come from the funeral and
wears black. We see a hand on his shoulder. As the camera
tracks back we see it is KATIE's hand. She is also wearing
black. He touches it. He is starring into the distance. KATIE
sits next to him. JAMES and THEO appear, also in black, and
sit next to KATIE. They stare into the distance. The camera
continues to track back towards the entrance of the shop.

It is another working day at the Three Brothers. HARRY, FAT LAKI
and JAMES are behind the range frying and placing fried fish
into the display. There are lots of customers queuing up and the
restaurant is busy with customers at the tables. KATIE is taking
an order. THEO, in a school uniform, and MRS PARRINGTON walk
into the shop.
HARRY
Theo mou. Good day at school?
MRS PARRINGTON
Very good day. Impressed the teacher
with his ability to solve quadratic
equations.

SOPHIE
Hello.
HARRY
You may have to take a few shifts

THEO is at one of the restaurant tables. He is trading on his
laptop. Mrs PARRINGTON comes into the shop.
MRS PARRINGTON
Quick. Theo. Come and see your father.
He's making the most delightful fool
of himself.
THEO jumps down and runs out. We pick up the screen of THEO's
computer. On it, we see a trading screen with THEO's name, a
'triple A' status trader logo, and a current account balance
of 22 million.
FADE TO BLACK.
