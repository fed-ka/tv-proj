the scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.
We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
then.
We move to the eyes, pure in their fury.
Finally we
encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.

A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security
and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury
items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes
quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.
The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor,
dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat
preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Max-my with a phony
effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now
Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the
heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and
bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.
LOPEZ
How ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet
you.
How 'bout a drink?
TONY
Mr. Lopez... real
