MIKA
Do you ever stop being a cop?
MASLOW
Not the way I was raised. My dad
always said, being a cop has
nothing to do with a clock. It's
a consequence of consciousness
often interpreted as desire.

So you got something else?
MIKA
I think so. Same template as
before. The transfer was made the
day before a multiple homicide in
Osaka. The police and newspapers
are calling it a gangland slaying.
MASLOW
How do you know what the police

She shakes her head.

MASLOW
Denied.
It was a long shot at

MIKA
But you said you found something.
MASLOW
A report. A friend of mine in
Moscow, tipped me to it.
He slips an envelope from his briefcase and gives it to
her.
MASLOW (CONT'D)
It was written during the height
of the Cold War by a high ranking
KGB agent named Aleksei Sabatin.
In it, he raises the possibility
that several political
assassinations were conducted by
an ancient but very sophisticated
network he calls the Nine Clans.

He scoffs.

No idea-
He finishes his soda and takes his garbage to the can.

Raizo walks down a street where repair work is being
done. To keep cars from falling into the hole, they've
covered the street with big steel plates. As the cars
and trucks pass over the plates, they make a bump-thump
sound. Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump. We PUSH IN

He whispers.

You shouldn't do that. It's
against the rules. If they catch

KIRIKO
Then they catch me.
RAIZO
They'll put you in the box.

He hesitates, then approaches. Kneels down beside her.
She reaches toward him. He flinches...a sword he can
handle, but kindness has become something foreign...then
allows her to undo the top button of his shirt. She
presses her ear to his chest. Listens.
Then she gently whispers to it.
KIRIKO (CONT'D)
Hello....hello, you in there.
She listens again.

Mrs. Sabatin watches the young man leave then hurries

MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)
It was unlike Alexei not to see
him out. I remember being very
scared. But when I opened the
door, he was just sitting there.
For a moment, he didn't even
notice me. Then he stood up and
kissed me and told me that he

FIVE CHILDREN- who we see only from the back- run past.
Shouting laughing. The last one jostles against Raizo as

Raizo keeps walking, but he is holding an envelope in his

Mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment

Candles and flashlights are visible in some of the

outside. Mika approaches a NEIGHBOR.
MIKA
Hey....

Hi.

Power's out. Us, the building

Raizo, still wearing his bloody clothes, climbs up onto

He waits as the shadows around him come to life: Ozunu,
Takeshi, and several other clan members surround him.
All but Ozunu wear their masks.

Several of the other ninjas step back. Revealing
Takeshi. He pushes a small hooded figure forward.
OZUNU (CONT'D)
Weakness compels strength.
Betrayal begets blood.
Takeshi yanks the hood off revealing a young girl.
She
is bloody, bound and gagged and for a flash-
Raizo sees her as Kiriko.
OZUNU (CONT'D)
A daughter that turned her back on
her family. She tried to run.
Takeshi hunted her down.
He unsheathes his blade, offering the hilt to Raizo.

It is the law of the Nine Clans.
Raizo looks at the girl, her tears lost in the rain.
We cannot tell if Raizo is crying as he takes the blade-

OZUNU (CONT'D)
Kill him!
Raizo meets their attack. Throwing himself into the fray
as only a man who is no longer interested in living can.
But the ninjas are everywhere. They hurl shuriken at him
by the handful, a storm of jagged steel racing for
Raizo's flesh.
Raizo blocks some of the shuriken, misses many more. The
shuriken strike muscles, tendons, flesh. He SWINGS
around, still trying to attack, there are too many of
them.
He stumbles back towards the edge of the roof as Takeshi
SWINGS what he believes will be the death blow as --

the rooftop, tumbling through space, until he --

Bubbles dancing between the ribbons of blood.

Raizo blocks and parries. Counterattacks with a reverse

this honor.

He can
hear her heart pounding.
Takeshi knows where she is looking as he prepares to
strike.
Blood pounds in Raizo's ears.
The sword plunges into her heart.

And feels his own heart stop.

carrying Mika in his arms.

Mika!
He runs to her side as Raizo lays her gently on the
ground.
MASLOW (CONT'D)
What happened?
RAIZO
She saved my life.
Raizo puts his hand on her chest. Closes his eyes.
We
can FEEL her heart-beat. Bump-thump. Bump-thump.
Raizo opens his eyes.
RAIZO (CONT'D)
She will be all right.
MASLOW
How can you be sure?
Raizo touches her face as she takes in a sudden breath.
He smiles distantly.
RAIZO
Her heart is special.
MIKA
Medic!
Over here now!
Several medics rush to them, Raizo gently laying her on
the stretcher.
As they immediately begin working on her, Raizo fades
back.
Maslow remains at her side.
Her eyes flutter open.
MASLOW
Is she going to be okay?
MEDIC
I don't know...she's got a hole
right through the middle of her
heart...but shes not really
