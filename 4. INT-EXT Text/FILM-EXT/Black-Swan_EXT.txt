Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street.
She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few
other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They
all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,
wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.
She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima
ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.
Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to
the STAGE DOOR.
Nina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her
jacket, for warmth and comfort.
Her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and
checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away.
Up ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction
site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the
scaffolding.
Nina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on.
The passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and
flickering.
She walks quickly, trying to get to the other side.
She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She
stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop.
She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN
standing there, almost ghostlike.
Nina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the
other woman continues as well.
13.
As they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and
discovers...
The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER.
But the moment passes as the woman continues walking.
Nina stares after her, perturbed.
Her cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence.
Nina continues out, ignoring the phone.
Leroy escorts Nina out. It's a couple hours later and she's
tipsy. She stumbles a little and grabs onto Leroy.
NINA
I think I drank too much. All those
toasts...
LEROY
You did well.
NINA
Really?
LEROY
They tried to eat you alive, but
here you are, in one piece.
NINA
(MELTING)
I guess.
LEROY
I'll get you a cab. Where you
going?
NINA
Oh, Upper West Side.
LEROY
Why don't you come to my place
first? It's on the way.
She gives him a coy glance, reading between the lines and
hiding her excitement.
LEROY (CONT'D)
For a drink. Unless you've had
enough.
NINA
No, that's good.
He starts to look for a cab.
32.
MRS. BRINSON (O.S.)
Thomas!!!
They turn, see Mrs. Brinson, the host of the party, standing
at the door.
MRS. BRINSON (CONT'D)
You need to say hello to Karen
Halloway before you disappear.
She's from Texas. Correction: she
is Texas.
LEROY
(TO NINA)
A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait
here.
He runs back inside to say his goodbyes.
Nina smiles after him, giddy and anxious.
She notices a slender figure watching her from the shadows of
the adjoining doorway. In the dark, she looks like Nina.
NINA
(CONCERNED)
Hello?
Spotted, the figure backs up, seeming to disappear.
Nina cautiously approaches, but can't see anyone.
She gets closer to the doorway...and someone JUMPS OUT,
startling her.
It's Beth, drunk and shivering. Cheeks streaked with mascara.
NINA (CONT'D)
Beth? What are you doing out here?
Beth stares her down. Nina backs up, nervously grabbing her
earlobe.
NINA (CONT'D)
I was crushed to hear that you're
leaving.
BETH
What'd you do to get the role?
33.
Nina shakes her head, confused.
BETH (CONT'D)
He always said you were a frigid
little girl.
Her words needle Nina, too close to the truth.
BETH (CONT'D)
So what did you do to make him
change his mind? Suck his cock?
NINA
Some of us don't need to do that.
Nina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her.
BETH
You fucking little whore.
NINA
(GUILTY)
Beth, I'm-
LEROY (O.S.)
What's going on?
They both turn to see Leroy returned.
BETH
I need to talk to you.
LEROY
You're drunk. You should go home.
BETH
Don't do that! Don't just dismiss
me!
LEROY
(EXASPERATED)
Poor, poor little princess. Try to
hold it together.
BETH
I'm going to drop by later, okay? I
have something I want to give you.
LEROY
(IGNORING HER)
Come on.
He puts his arm around Nina, starts to lead her away.
34.
BETH (O.S.)
A token of my appreciation.
He ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab. As they
enter the cab, Beth calls after them.
BETH (CONT'D)
Make the most of it Nina.
Through the cab window Nina looks at Beth, troubled by her
words.
Nina sits as Leroy, worse for the wear, stares at the jets of
water.
NINA
What happened?
40.
LEROY
She walked into the street, got hit
by a car.
NINA
Oh my god...
LEROY
I'm sure she did it on purpose.
NINA
How do you know?
LEROY
Everything Beth ever did came from
within. From some dark impulse.
It's what could make her so
thrilling to watch. Even perfect at
times. But also destructive.
Nina hesitates, but has to ask.
NINA
Was it right after we saw her?
LEROY
It's not your problem. This has
nothing to do with you.
She looks away, not so sure.
LEROY (CONT'D)
Nina, don't let yourself be
distracted. Dance is not
immortalized like music, poetry or
art. It lives for now. For this
moment only. And this is your
moment.
She attempts a nod.
Nina pushes her way out of the club, starting to panic. She
looks around, trying to figure out where she is, but the city
is dark and non-descript.
LILY (O.S.)
Nina!
Nina turns towards the voice and, with relief, sees Lily exit
the club.
LILY (CONT'D)
Where you goin'?
Nina pushes out the stage door, and passes the ROW OF
POSTERS.
They now advertise Swan Lake and feature a beautiful
photograph of Nina.
Nina stops and looks at them.
Nina approaches the theater with harried steps.
Quickly past the row of SWAN LAKE posters.
She reaches the side of the building, flings open the stage
door and enters.
