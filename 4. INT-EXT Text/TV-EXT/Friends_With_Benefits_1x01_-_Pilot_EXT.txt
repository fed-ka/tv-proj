    Ben follows Devan out onto the street. As they start to walk, 
    we WHIP PAN across the way where Sara is walking with Rich 
    (who really does have terrific Anchorman hair).

                              SARA
                  Ben?

    Ben hears his name.

                              BEN
                  Sara!

    The two couples come together. Sara gestures to Ben, 
    impressed. Ben signals back --  I know, right? 

                              SARA
                  And this is Rich. 

    Ben shakes his hand. Introduces himself. 

                              BEN
                  Great hair.

                              RICH
                      (that s weird)
                  Ok.

    When Rich isn t looking, Ben gives Sara the thumbs up. She 
    nods assent. Then it s time for them all to move on. They go 
    in different directions. Meanwhile:                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       26.



    Aaron and Hoon exit the restaurant. Hoon tries to hi-five him.

                              HOON
                  You got digits, dude! 

                              AARON
                  From Carl.

                              HOON
                  Still digits. 

                              AARON
                  I m going home now.

                              HOON
                  The night is young! There s 
                  breadlines for boners out there. Just 
                  follow the Hoon.                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       30.


                              AARON
                  I m really not feeling --

                              HOON
                  Hey. You re my friend. This is what 
                  friends do. Friends take care of each 
                  other.

    A PRETTY BRUNETTE walks by. She makes eye contact with Hoon.

                              HOON
                  Friends stand by one another. 
                  Friends... 

    ZOOM IN on her Star of David necklace. Hoon s eyes light up.

                              HOON
                  ...Shalom!

    And Hoon goes after the girl, leaving Aaron just standing 
    there, alone, miserable, not at all surprised.


                              BEN
                  I actually had fun tonight.

                              DEVAN
                  You sound surprised?

                              BEN
                      (beat; he s going for it)
                  So I was wondering... my sister --                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       32.


    And that s when Devan kisses Ben. Or more accurately mauls his 
    face with her mouth. It s the sloppiest, filthiest, most 
    disgusting kiss in television history. When it s over:

                              BEN
                  Riiight.

                              DEVAN
                  You... wanna come up?

                              BEN
                      (beat; wipes his face)
                  I ll call you. 

                              DEVAN
                  Oh not again. 

                              BEN
                  Sorry?

                              DEVAN
                  This is just what happened last time, 
                  Ben. We had a great date and you blew 
                  me off. 

                              BEN
                  No. It s --

                              DEVAN
                  Be honest with me, will you? I 
                  deserve that at least. What is it? 
                  What do I do that s so --

                              BEN
                      (beat)
                  It s the kissing.

                              DEVAN
                  The what?

                              BEN
                  You kiss like a thirsty bird, like a 
                  hobo cleaning out a margarine 
                  container.


                              DEVAN
                  So you re saying you don t like it.

                              BEN
                  It s like going through a car wash 
                  with my face.

                              DEVAN
                  Wow.                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       33.


                              BEN
                  You wanted honesty.

                              DEVAN
                  Honesty. Huh. Well here s some 
                  honesty. Whatever it is you're 
                  looking for... doesn't exist. There's 
                  no one who likes all the music you 
                  like and hates all the movies you 
                  hate, who eats french fries and pizza 
                  yet still has a great ass. That s a 
                  fantasy, Ben. Everyone s got 
                  something. You think you re perfect? 
                  You talk with your mouth full, your 
                  wallet is velcro, your ears are 
                  crooked. There s plenty wrong with 
                  you. I may use too much tongue but 
                  all things considered you could do a 
                  lot worse.

    Ben realizes. She s right. And as Devan turns to go:

                              DEVAN
                  Oh and by the way, you have no idea 
                  what else this tongue can do. And now 
                  you never will. 

    She shuts the door and is gone. Ben thinks about that a beat.


    Ben comes around the corner to his apartment building. Keys 
    out, ready to go inside. And finds Sara on his stoop. Sits.

                              BEN
                  So... how was the date?


    Where Rich says to Sara:

                              RICH
                  I could really see this going 
                  somewhere. What do you think?                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       34.


    CUT TO: QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS

    - Sara and Richard get married. Rich takes a drink mid-vows.

    - Sara giving birth in the delivery room. Rich checks his 
    phone for a sports score, not paying any attention.

    - Sara and Rich, with their three kids, open Christmas gifts. 
    Rich opens one of them.

                              RICH
                  Heather would have loved this shirt.


    Where Sara looks at Rich. And that look says it all.


                              SARA
                  Maybe I could be a little choosier.

                              BEN
                      (sighs)
                  Maybe I could be a little less.

    FADE UP:  Real  by Dogs Die in Hot Cars

                              BEN
                      (he stands)
                  But, in the meantime... 

    Ben reaches out to her. She takes his arm. He helps her up. 
    Opens the door. Sara enters and Ben follows her in. As they 
    make their way inside, we hear:

                              BEN
                  Are my ears crooked?

                              SARA
                  Yeah. I think it s adorable. 

    The door shuts behind them. Ben s Voice intones:

                              BEN S VOICE
                  All friendships have benefits. 
                  Friends can support you...

                              BEN S VOICE
                  ...make you smile...

    - IMAGE: Hoon lights the matchbook on fire (from page 8).

                              BEN S VOICE
                  ...they tell you the truth.                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       35.


    - IMAGE: Ben and Sara splitscreen (from page 14).

                  As you get older, the world gets more 
                  confusing...

    - Riley sleeping soundly in her bed. REVEAL, next to her, 
    Aaron is wide awake, stunned!!!

                              BEN S VOICE
                  ... the rules change...

    - Hoon lip-locked with the Jewish Girl he picked up on the 
    street. As they bound towards his bedroom, he wipes  Jewish  
    off the wipe-off board without her seeing. He then kisses his 
    fingers and points to the big man upstairs like Manny Ramirez.

                              BEN S VOICE
                  ...the boundaries disappear...

    - And finally, Ben and Sara. In bed. Back where we started. 
    Are they having sex? No. They re watching  Top Chef.  And Sara 
    is totally enraptured. 

                              BEN S VOICE
                  And you begin to realize the biggest 
                  benefit of all...

    - Aaron comes home to find Hoon on the couch in his underwear 
    playing XBOX next to the puppy. Aaron plops himself down, 
    still in a daze. 

    Hoon notices Aaron s state. Throws him a controller. Aaron 
    looks at it a beat before sitting back to play.

    - And finally, BACK TO Ben and Sara in the bed. Easy. Relaxed. 
    Comfortable. They watch the show and laugh. 

    Ben sees through the window a LONELY ELDERLY NEIGHBOR watching 
    TV by himself. 

                              BEN S VOICE
                  ...is going through it together.

    He looks back at Sara. Doesn t say anything. Doesn t need to.

                              SARA
                  This is a really good show. 

    And on Ben s knowing smile: 

                                  END OF ACT THREE                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       36.
