Bloodied and battered, the King's GENERALS are
disagreeing loudly about strategy. A loud BANGING sound
pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to --
KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome
face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands
the room --
KING ACRISIUS
Now we end the debate about
tactics... and begin to plan for
victory.

AT THE BACK OF THE HALL
The Dog stares at the King. Then slips away.
Unseen by exhausted Guards, the Dog bounds up the stairs.
NIGHT
The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the
shadows.
NIGHT
In the dim bedchamber, the SILHOUETTE of QUEEN DANAE as a
LADY-IN-WAITING removes her gown, revealing the Queen's
perfect body as she slips into bed. The Lady-in-Waiting
leaves.
The Dog's eyes. He moves forward.
FLOOR-LEVEL
TRACKING WITH the Dog's legs as they MORPH INTO HUMAN
LEGS. The CAMERA RISES BEHIND a towering male figure,
who roughly pulls a curtain aside.
In the bed, the Queen is startled, then pleased.
QUEEN DANAE
My King! Has the strategy been
set so quickly?
REVERSE ANGLE
The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius,
including the distinctive scar. He regards her hungrily.
QUEEN DANAE
Come to your Queen, my King.
The real King Acrisius wearily climbs the stairs with
AIDES and Guards. Suddenly, the King stops.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged
creature -- and now it appears:
The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the
men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power.
Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others
raise their weapons.
The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes
close by. No one dare move. The Dog disappears into the
shadows below.
DISSOLVE TO:
(OLYMPOS)
- DAY
THOTH THE QUICK enters the wide courtyard, his cape
billowing. He strides past the reflecting pool in the
center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging --
-- each of the TEN FIGURES seated around the perimeter...
THE OLYMPIANS. APOLLO is here, and bronze-helmeted
ATHENA; APHRODITE and muscular VULCAN -- we are dazzled
and lose count.
Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic,
bearded, awe-inspiring. An EAGLE is perched on his arm.
THOTH
My lord.
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED:
ZEUS
(rumbles, like
THUNDER)
We have debated, we have voted,
and it is decided. We offer the
Humans peace. Thoth, you will
take them the terms of a treaty --
TIAMAT
(O.S.)
(SCORNFULLY)
A treaty!
Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are
familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog.
In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE
Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose countenance is death made
visible, and --
-- TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, the only God fearless
enough to challenge Zeus' rule --
TIAMAT
We don't negotiate with them! We
dictate to them. Their place is
to beg. They have forgotten their
role and have denied us the
sustenance of their prayers.
APHRODITE
Our mercy will give them reason to
be grateful. They will bow down
and whisper our names with more
passion than before.
TIAMAT
They will bow down when we snap
their backs! Mercy? We are Gods!
Some of us remember that and are
not afraid --
Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to
the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage.
ZEUS
Silence! Or learn what it is to
be afraid! The debate is over,
the votes cast...
Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of
alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian.
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
ZEUS
We guarantee an armistice, we
shield the bridegroom and the
Joppan royal family.
(turning again on
TIAMAT)
And we do not interfere in their
actions. We leave them
undisturbed unless-invoked by name
to enter their affairs.
SET
And if they refuse our terms?
ZEUS
They have suffered terrible
losses. They will not pass up a
chance for peace.
Only Tiamat and Set now. Tiamat regards Zeus' throne.
SET
This is your rightful place to
take.
TIAMAT
Soon enough, Set. Zeus has grown
weaker than I knew.
Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks
up the two black shards representing their votes. He
hands one to Tiamat.
SET
So have they all. They no longer
see clearly.
TIAMAT
(DISDAINFUL)
They're beginning to think like
Men. But you and I shall not.
Set agrees, his eyes searching her face.
TIAMAT
We will manage these thick-witted
Humans to our own ends.
(off his look)
Yes, we will be bound by great
Zeus' rules... until their fragile
membranes tear. We dare not
interfere with these insects...

TIAMAT
(CONT'D)
but we may be invited to
intervene.
Tiamat flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool --
the whole pool darkens and choppy waves crash over the
sides... a tiny tempest.
KING KEPHEUS, the aging, worried ruler, sits on his
throne, then stands, paces, sits again. Expecting
someone.
Flitting nearby is his Queen -- CASSIOPEIA, a fading
beauty, fiercely intelligent, but not wise; she can be
impulsive and vain.
AMOUN stands calmly by -- he is special advisor
(or Magi
Strategos) to the King and will be central to our story.
AMOUN
The emissary approaches. Take
your time in your responses,
debate nothing...
KEPHEUS
(TESTY)
I've received ambassadors before.
AMOUN
None like this.
KEPHEUS
I'm not cowed. If these arrogant
Gods are so powerful, why are they
the ones seeking a truce?
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
AMOUN
(PATIENTLY)
I only recommend you take care
with the tone of the conversation.
A truce would benefit all...
KEPHEUS
In my palace, I decide how the
discourse proceeds, not some
messenger sent on errands by Zeus.
THOTH (O.S.)
You are correct, Your Highness, I
do the bidding of Zeus...
To their astonishment, the emissary is already in the
Throne Room, behind them. Startled, they turn to see
--
Thoth the Quick, Messenger of the Gods, float forward.
THOTH
... as do all Gods... and all men.
Thoth removes his hood, revealing his crystal skull.
THOTH
(with an edge)
King Kepheus, as humble messenger
of Zeus, I've come to talk of
peace.
AMOUN
(DEFERENTIAL)
Thoth the Quick, I am Amoun, the
King's Magi Strategos. We welcome
you with humility, honored by your
visit from the realm of the Gods.
The King shoots Amoun a look, but he is still shaken by
Thoth's sudden appearance. Cassiopeia tries to recover
her composure.
KEPHEUS
I am a reasonable man. Everyone
wishes for the conflict to cease.
THOTH
Zeus above all. He has so long
desired the tragedy end, he made a
plan that began twenty-five years
ago.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
CASSIOPEIA
Twenty-five years! How is that
possible?
Amoun winces at her tone. Thoth sends a scary glance her
way. Icy --
THOTH
Beauteous Queen, let Thoth limn
for you the forethought and wisdom
of Zeus, God of Gods.
Kepheus and Cassiopeia sit stunned. Amoun watches
without surprise.
KEPHEUS
A treaty marriage?
THOTH
You have a daughter of age.
CASSIOPEIA
(GASPS)
Andromeda!
KEPHEUS
Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal
father to give his daughter to a
God.
THOTH
No. Such a union would be
unclean. Years ago Zeus created a
scion of mixed blood. Half-man,
half-God. Bred for just this
union. That is how important Zeus
considers this truce.
CASSIOPEIA
Is my only daughter to marry a
demigod, not of this earth?
THOTH
A prince, of both Olympian and
Human royalty. A chosen one.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
THOTH
(CONT'D)
Zeus has given his son to the
cause of peace.
KEPHEUS
I have heard of no such demigod.
AMOUN
Majesty, if I may -- the young man
does exist. He lives in a small
fishing village on the isle of
Seriphos.
Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge.
KEPHEUS
You knew about this and said
nothing?
CASSIOPEIA
(ACCUSATORY)
Just which king do you serve?
AMOUN
My Queen, I serve only the great
order of things. I was the boy's
tutor years ago.
KEPHEUS
How haughty this boy must be, who
knows he is half-God.
AMOUN
He knows nothing and believes
himself an ordinary man. He has
never left his village. He can be
overconfident, but it is from
inexperience, not arrogance.
Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks. Sharply
CASSIOPEIA
What assurance do we have that our
daughter will be safe?
THOTH
(LOSING PATIENCE)
You have my word, as Ambassador of
the Gods.
KEPHEUS
With our daughter's future at
stake, we do not bestow trust
easily.
(THREATENING)
If any harm should come to her --
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
Amoun reacts, but it is too late -- Thoth has been
IRRITATED:
Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL
SHUDDER. The room TILTS. Kepheus and the Queen grab for
a solid handhold, frightened.
The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and
pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward
Thoth.
THOTH
(ICY)
The Princessa shall not be harmed.
AMOUN
(urgently, to the
KING)
Your Majesty...
KEPHEUS
(SHAKEN)
Of course... of course your word
is unquestioned here.
Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the
table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet. TILT
UP TO his intimidated face:
KEPHEUS
Where is the lucky young suitor?
Perseus eats with his adoptive family: Spyros, his wife
MARMARA, and Tekla. Spyros is patient and twinkly with
his wife though he disagrees with her beliefs.
TEKLA
I still don't understand.
SPYROS
Your mother can explain. She
believes everything has an
explanation, even if we have to
make it up.
(OFF MARMARA'S
WARNING LOOK)
It's one of the reasons I love
you, Marmara.
TEKLA
Tell me! Why is there war between
Man and the Gods?
Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food.
MARMARA
At the beginning of time, when Man
was young, he prayed to the Gods.
His belief in the Gods gave his
life meaning. It was a good
thing.
(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:
SPYROS
If you consider superstition, fear
and darkness good things...
MARMARA
(IGNORING HIM)
But Man grew, as children do, and
he turned away from the Gods. Be
began to put his faith in other
things.
Perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes.
TEKLA
What things?
SPYROS
Learning, science... love.
PERSEUS
(PASSIONATE)
self-determination! Those
things that give Man dignity and
independence.
MARMARA
But what of the Gods, who had
protected and guided us so long?
They must breathe our prayers to
survive. They hunger for
WORSHIP --
SPYROS
-- as lions hunger for blood.
MARMARA
Spyros!
(TO TEKLA)
Your father's mind is closed on
these matters.
SPYROS
The Gods were desperate to claim
our awe again.
TEKLA
Desperate... the Gods?
SPYROS
Yes, even the Gods. If they could
not earn our faith with love, they
would demand it with fear.
Whatever was necessary to ensure
L
their continued existence.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
Marmara and the wide-eyed Tekla sit down.
MARMARA
And that is how war broke out
between Man and Gods.
(turning to serve
PERSEUS)
Now eat your dinner, which the
Gods -- and your father -- have
provided.
Middle of the night. Perseus lies wide awake in his tiny
space. He stares, thinking about his friend. Suddenly,
a KNOCK at the door.
Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty
electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is
oddly faded, washed-out.
PERSEUS
You... I saw you watching our boat
at the cliff.
WILTING GIRL
It was not the boat I was
watching.
PERSEUS
Can I be of service?
WILTING GIRL
Yes, of service. I need you to
come with me on a journey.
Perseus gives her a look.
PERSEUS
Right now?
(as she nods)
It wouldn't take much persuading
to get me to leave this village,
but tonight is impossible. My
family can't wake and find me
gone. Where do you want me to go?
WILTING GIRL
It's not what I want. I am in the
service of others.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
Perseus can't get over her beauty, the dulcet sound of
her voice. Even so --
PERSEUS
Come back in the morning and we
can talk about it.
WILTING GIRL
I'm sorry.
PERSEUS
For what?
Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry
between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a
swarm, racing toward him.
He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures
climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he
stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and
falls.
PERSEUS' WOOZY POV
The Wilting Girl standing placidly in the doorway
watching him.
BACK TO SCENE
He blacks out.
(JOPPA)
- SCULLERY CLOSET - DAY
CLOSEUP: A hot embrace. In the blur of movement our
first good look is at the GIRL, a beauty -- PRINCESSA
ANDROMEDA,

The BOY is AGENOR, a kitchen helper -- ripped and sexy.
It's hard to tell who's the aggressor here. Gasping,
Andromeda holds him at bay --

ANDROMEDA
Do you think you can manhandle a
Princess this way?
(as he kisses her)
As though she was hungry and needy
as you, a mere servant?
Another steamy kiss. In between liplocks, she whispers
HOTLY --
ANDROMEDA
very mistaken... a woman of my
station... never be attracted...
They go at it again.
Andromeda freezes at her mother's voice, stops Agenor,
finger to her lips.
He ignores her, starts again. Andromeda does something
below the frame that jolts him off. The girl can take
care of herself.
A lavish room. Cassiopeia and Kepheus sit in golden
chairs, looking off. Andromeda ENTERS FRAME, furious.
with conviction --
ANDROMEDA
To please you, I would submit to
such a marriage... except I would
rather die; Please let me know
you're serious about this perverse
plan so I can make arrangements to
kill myself.
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:
She stomps out. Their gaze follows until she's gone.
FINALLY:
KEPHEUS
It will take more than half-a-God
to handle her.
CASSIOPEIA
She'll be a great ruler one day.
Cassiopeia hurries down a corridor to the parlor. WE
FOLLOW to find:
Kepheus speaking sternly to Perseus, before him.
KEPHEUS
. before I am a king or a
peacemaker, I am a father. Do you
know what that means?
PERSEUS
I'm not sure, Your Highness. I
did not know my father.
KEPHEUS
(THROWN)
Yes, well... it means I had no
desire for my little girl's
carefree springtime to be cut
SHORT --
(to Cassiopeia,
IRRITABLY)
What is she?
CASSIOPEIA
(EMBARRASSED)
I'm sure she's preparing herself
to make the best possible
impression.
Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple.
Kepheus paces with mounting impatience.
KEPHEUS
(LECTURING PERSEUS
AGAIN)
-- and all so she could be thrust
into a momentous conflict... of
which she knows nothing at all.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
She's not the only one, sir. I
don't know much about the events
for which I've been drafted.
KEPHEUS
(disarmed, but tough
GUY)
I take no comfort in that, young
man. In fact, I find little to
take comfort in here. You are a
stranger from a distant place, and
I am asked to entrust the welfare
of my daughter to you.
(LEANING INTO
PERSEUS)
If you are not kind and patient
with her, if any harm of any kind
should come her way, I will have
your head on a stake.
Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face. He puts
his hand on the hilt of his sword.
KEPHEUS
Is this amusing to you?
PERSEUS
Not even a little, my lord. It's
just that I myself was waylaid --
snatched also, as you say, from my
happy springtime...
Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him.
PERSEUS
I've been told I'm to play a
part in events which serve a
higher purpose... of which I'm not
at all convinced.
KEPHEUS
Does a truce in the war between
Men and Gods not strike you as a
higher purpose?
PERSEUS
With all respect, I have never
seen a God. On my island, they're
no more than a story.
KEPHEUS
You will learn there is more to
this universe than is found on
your island.

KEPHEUS
(CONT-D)
(TO CASSIOPEIA)
This is supposed to be the son of
a God, yet he doubts their
existence!
CASSIOPEIA
(TO PERSEUS)
They exist, young man. But if you
doubt their power, I join you --
KEPHEUS
(ANGRY)
Cassiopeia! We have agreed such
talk has no place in this palace.
CASSIOPEIA
(DEFIANT)
Have we?
PERSEUS
I can only proceed based on what I
have experienced, not on a faith I
do not possess.
KEPHEUS
Where does a young person get such
ideas?
PERSEUS
Perhaps from my adopted father,
sir. I admire him greatly, and he
believes in little he cannot hold
in his hand.
KEPHEUS
Is he a scholar?
PERSEUS
No, Your Highness, a fisherman.
AMOUN (O.S.)
I know this mentor who so
influences young Perseus.
Amoun has silently entered the chamber. Perseus reacts
in amazement.
PERSEUS
Master Amoun!
He hurries over to the older man, who embraces him
warmly.

AMOUN
Porpoise... You've grown tall and
strong since my departure.
Perseus laughs at his old nickname and holds Amoun at
arm's length.
PERSEUS
What are you doing here?
AMOUN
I am honored to serve the King as
an advisor. His Magi Strategos.
PERSEUS
From my village tutor to Magi
Strategos... What a path!
The King's patience is exhausted. To Cassiopeia
KEPHEUS
Where is Andromeda? At the least,
the two should meet before
tomorrow's ceremony...
PERSEUS
(FREAKED)
Tomorrow? Is the wedding so soon?
CASSIOPEIA
The wedding comes later. Tomorrow
we will have the public
announcement.
AMOUN
And a celebration of the treaty.
A Page enters and whispers in Kepheus' ear. Kepheus is
irritated.
KEPHEUS
It seems our Andromeda has
wandered away.
Cassiopeia reacts, upset.
AMOUN
Perhaps the thought of her new
life has made her frantic to enjoy
the vestiges of her old one.

KEPHEUS
Perseus, if you're to take the
wild girl for a wife, this is a
good time to start your training.
Go into the city and retrieve her.
PERSEUS
How will I know her?
CASSIOPEIA
She is unmistakable.
PERSEUS
I'm a stranger here. Any hints?

Follow the lights and the sound of
profane music.

Perseus, in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor,
moves through the crowd of REVELERS. The grandiose room
is hemmed by columns and statues. The royal family sits
on the dais. Andromeda motions Perseus up beside her.
ANDROMEDA
You're late.
PERSEUS
I didn't know how to get this
outfit on.
ANDROMEDA
I want to thank you for seeing me
home. I was so flushed with wine
I can't recall much of the
evening.
Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd.
PERSEUS
Me either.
PERSEUS' POV - THE WILTING GIRL

the union. MUSIC STOPS and the crowd begins to settle.
ROYAL HERALD (0.5.)
The Queen will speak!
The room QUIETS as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of
the dais with a cup of wine, not her first.
CASSIOPEIA
I won't be long-winded. You all
know I am a modest person, no
matter my rank.
Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her
mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus,
watching from his throne.
CASSIOPEIA
(WITH EDGE)
This is not a celebration of a
betrothal...
(as Kepheus is on
ALERT)
not the celebration of the
happiness of two parents, or of
our good people.
Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal
Entourage.
CASSIOPEIA
This union represents new hope for
a lasting peace! That is the only
cause for celebration.
The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause. Amoun
wills her to stop. Cassiopeia takes another drink, looks
over at the Princess.

Her subjects agree loudly. Andromeda wishes this would
end. Cassiopeia raises her glass.
CASSIOPEIA
To my beautiful daughter... more
beautiful than all the women of
Joppa. More beautiful than the
Gardens of Nineveh...
Kepheus is about to pull her away. She throws him a
spiteful glance.
CASSIOPEIA
More beautiful than the turquoise
ocean and its sublime Goddess of
the Deep... Tiamat herself! My
daughter is a beauty even a
Goddess must envy.
Amoun reacts in dismay. A distressed MURMUR roils the
crowd. Andromeda goes to her mother.
CASSIOPEIA
I've gone on too long --
She stops with a look of sudden dread. The Great Hall
DARKENS. The torch flames TURN BLACK. The temperature
drops. The statues lining the hall shut their eyes and
the doors burst open.
TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats forward, parting the
terrified celebrants. Perseus sees his first Olympian.
Tiamat arrives at the dais. Cassiopeia drops to her
knees.
TIAMAT
You have blasphemed powers beyond
understanding... You, a stupid
braying goat before the
unfathomable galaxies. You dare
put this frivolous, scrawny
slut...

the Deep!

Tiamat tears off her cloak and STANDS NAKED. Her body,
made from the elements of the sea, is magnificent -- sexy

Fantasos, the priest who proselytizes for Tiamat in the
streets, is in the throng. His reaction is a mix of
religious ecstasy and outright lust.
The celebrants shield their eyes, but Cassiopeia can't.
She crumples, aging before our eyes. Every word shakes
her frame --
TIAMAT
Look upon the sublime and know
your error. You'll not blink.
Tell me now, mortal, how bright
your preening urchin shines?
No one dare look long at the Goddess. No one but
Perseus. Tiamat notices Perseus... and his boldness.
TIAMAT
People of Joppa, hear me. For the
sacrilege of this arrogant
creature, I will loose Leviathan
upon you.
The people react in terror. Cassiopeia starts to faint,
but Tiamat snaps her back to consciousness
--
TIAMAT
I'm not finished. Hold your gaze.
(to the people)
For thirty days, Joppa shall
suffer the scorn of Leviathan.
And on the final day, you will be
wiped from the earth.
(as the crowd quakes)
Unless...
Instant silence.
TIAMAT

so impertinently compared to this
GODDESS --

Desolation or sacrifice. Choose

Clouds of black sea ink swirl and swallow Tiamat, then
implode. Tiamat is gone. Cassiopeia, palsied and
withered, collapses. Kepheus and Royal Aides rush to
her.
Cassiopeia lies blank and wan. A LOW DRONE grows.
Kepheus rushes to the window. And then, a deep, EARTH-
SHATTERING BELLOW from the creature. The room SHUDDERS.
KEPHEUS
Leviathan awakes...

A figure passes by a window in silhouette -- Andromeda
steals through the shadows toward the Throne Room.
Andromeda edges into position to see the room below.
AMOUN (O.S.)

the deep. Hewn by Tiamat from the
dark blood of the earth...

A council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS gathered before
Kepheus, who seems lost in thought, head down. Perseus
stands off to the side.
Amoun reads from a scroll.
AMOUN
. All monsters of the sea are
but shadows of Leviathan the
Kraken -- colossal, rapacious, and
nigh indestructible.
The men turn to Kepheus; when he raises his face, he
looks exhausted.
KEPHEUS
My Queen lies near death. Am I
now to choose between the survival
of our state... and the life of
Andromeda, my only child?
Amoun watches Perseus, at the fringe of the group,
expectantly. But Perseus looks only perplexed, an
observer.

Highness. Andromeda must.be
saved, and the city too.
REPHEUS
Impossible.
AMOUN
(TURNING FROM
PERSEUS)
No... We need only the will to do
it.
KEPHEUS
You spoke the words -- the monster
is indestructible!
PERSEUS
(QUIETLY)
How can that be?
Amoun alone takes notice: he spins toward Perseus, with
relief.
AMOUN
Perseus! You had something you
wanted to say to the King?
All eyes turn to Perseus, who shrinks before them, self-
conscious.
PERSEUS
What? No, Master Amoun. I'm
listening.
AMOUN
You're 'listening'? We're talking
about the precious life of your
betrothed.
Perseus meets his gaze, confused.
PERSEUS
I'm a newcomer here. I would not
presume to tell these men --
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
AMOUN
Exactly! A newcomer with a fresh
perspective. Share your thoughts
with the King, your future father-
in-law.
The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence.
Perseus, uncertainly --
PERSEUS
I know that I am young and have
not seen much of the world, but it
seems to me that nothing is
indestructible.
The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance.
SPYROS
(O.S.)
I am far from young and have seen
much of the world... and I agree
with my son.
Everyone turns to the new arrival: Perseus' adoptive
father, Spyros. Perseus goes to embrace him.
PERSEUS
Father, how did you find me?
KEPHEUS
I thought this boy's father was a
God. How does a stranger walk
unmolested into the Throne Room of
the King?
AMOUN
I sent for him, Lord. This good
man raised Perseus from infancy.
He will help him now.
KEPHEUS
Help him with what?
SPYROS
With whatever is needed...
Perseus approaches the King. Surprising himself --
PERSEUS
He will help me destroy Leviathan.
Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: "Yeah, okay,
sure."
46.
UP ON THE BALCONY
Andromeda reacts, falling in love with Perseus.
IN THE THRONE ROOM
KEPHEUS
But how?
Perseus has no idea.
AMOUN
Majesty, we can seek the counsel
of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia.
They know the hidden ways of the
Gods. If Leviathan can be slain,
they'll know how to do it.
PERSEUS
We have thirty days to find its
weakness.
MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR
Twenty-nine.
PERSEUS
(flashes him a look)
We'll leave tonight.
KEPHEUS
With what army? I dare not weaken
our forces when the city is about
to be besieged.
PERSEUS
(uncertain, glances
AT SPYROS)
We'll go alone.
SPYROS
(CATCHING UP)
Yes. Give us a map.
Amoun laughs. When some of the others join in, the
King
gives them a look that stops them dead.
AMOUN
My King, with your permission...
The King assents, seemingly lost. Amoun speaks to
Perseus.
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
AMOUN
I'll give you a map and much more.
I'll go with you and bring a small
band of comrades to help you on
your mission. We can leave at
first light.
(to his Aide)
Diokles, the map.
The men move to the work area, where the Aide selects a
map from dozens. Something catches Perseus' eye.
PERSEUS' POV
Andromeda, up in the balcony, has made herself visible
only to him. She silently mouths these words --
"Thank... you."
AT THE MAP
which has been hung for all to see, Amoun uses a pointer.
AMOUN
We head north on the Via Dahlia.
If we can make it to the Disputed
Territories...
MOVE IN ON the tip of Amoun's pointer on the
AMOUN (O.S.)
. we'll join the Cleon desert
legion, the most formidable unit
in all the army... With their
escort, we can safely reach our
destination in Skolothia, which
lies to the east...
We DISSOLVE THROUGH the map and pointer, which remain
LIGHTLY SUPERIMPOSED over the following:
Tiamat's storm is pounding Joppa. LIGHTNING stabs
through the dark clouds. RAIN POUNDS the tiles outside
Andromeda's lavish bedroom.
Peshet glides to Andromeda, who's wide awake, red-eyed,
distressed.
PESHET
You must sleep.
(off no reaction)
Princessat You must take care of
yourself.
A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her,
thinking.
ANDROMEDA
My father was ready to sacrifice
me to the monster.
PESHET
I'm sure that is not so.
ANDROMEDA
I saw it. I heard the words. My
loving father, his beloved child.
Only Perseus stayed his decision.
(TEARS COME)
And do you know the worst part,
Peshet? He was right.
Peshet's feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING.
ANDROMEDA
The city is besieged, the people
suffer.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
Because of me, because he did not
offer me up. Is that right?
PESHET
Go to sleep, my lady.
ANDROMEDA
(wiping her eyes)
Sleep? Sleep will come soon
enough for me, faithful one. In
one month... at the latest.
The palace shakes with the ROLLING THUNDER.
- NIGHT
A CADRE of REVOLUTIONARIES led by Fantasos is gathered.
Agenor, the handsome scullion who made love to Andromeda,
leads Peshet in from the rain. She is frightened; Agenor
has misled her.
PESHET
Where have you brought me?
AGENOR
It's okay...
Peshet tries to leave, but Agenor stops her.
AGENOR
Just listen to this good man. He
needs your help.
Fantasos comes forward. He fixes her with a hypnotic
gaze.
FANTASOS
Do you know who I am, child?
PESHET
You are the Priest of the Streets.
(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:
FANTASOS
That's right. You know that the
good common people of Joppa trust
that I will look after their
welfare.
PESHET
Some do...
FANTASOS
Do you love the people of Joppa,
Peshet?
(as she nods,
FRIGHTENED)
Do you want them to be destroyed
by this awful curse?
(as she shakes her
HEAD)
No, of course not. You want
what's best for the people.
PESHET
I have always served the royal
family.
FANTASOS
Yes, you have, good Peshet. And
now you may be in a better
position than anyone to help the
Princessa save the city.
Peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on
Andromeda's bed. On instinct, she hurries to the bed and
throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no
Andromeda. Peshet races out.
64.
Spyros looks inside. A cauldron BUBBLES over a fresh
fire. ALKALI LOTUS blossoms bob on the boiling broth.
Spyros, uneasy, backs out.
Perseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious. Vidalia
replaces the dressing on his bite wound. Knowing he
cannot hear her --
VIDALIA
To save me, you risked everything
-- your mission, your friends...
the fate of multitudes. Men need
better judgment in the one who is
meant to lead them...
No longer able to lecture, she regards him with love.
TENDERLY --
VIDALIA
You shouldn't have risked your
life for me. It is a waste to
save me when I'll be gone so soon.
She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead.
VIDALIA
Thank you for your reckless
disregard. Thank you, Perseus...
Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a
quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT
PODS. Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers
Perseus' wound.
The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus.
Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest. Vidalia gently
lays him down.
Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and
slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its
stomach.
VIDALIA
The poison is gone now.
PERSEUS
Where... Where are we? The
DJINN --
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
VIDALIA
In the Djinn caravan. They're
escorting us to the Skolothian
border.
PERSEUS
But I thought the Djinn...
VIDALIA .
We all did. But their leader,
Shaikh Suleiman, has some special
interest in you.
(off his confusion)
Just sleep.
She waves her palm over his face, and he does sleep.
Perseus fights through cobwebs and hanging roots. The
torch REVEALS piles of armor, bones, and broken weapons.
A round edge catches his eye. He pulls it free -- A
SHIELD, TARNISHED AND DENTED. Unsure why it attracted
him, he shoulders it and leaves.
80.
In the center of the dark hall, SET overtakes Medusa,
L.
forcing her down.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
His cloak ripples as SHAPES PUSH THROUGH THE SPECTRAL
FOLDS -- the girl's reaching fingers, her screaming face.
AMOUN (V.0.)
He ravished her on the cold floor.
She felt the heartless passion of
a God.
SAME SCENE - LATER
Alone, Medusa crawls with bloody fingernails toward the
altar.
AMOUN (V.0.)
Despoiled and broken in the shadow
of Tiamat's altar, she prayed for
comfort and pleaded for courage...
But the Goddess of the Deep
regarded Medusa with disdain. The
prayers of such a frail and filthy
mortal angered Tiamat.
A bust of Tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens her
BLAZING eyes, THROWING A LONG SHADOW OF MEDUSA onto the
wall.
AMOUN (V.0.)
The Goddess twisted young Medusa
into a loathsome new thing...
The contorting shadow shows the transformation. Legs
twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads
wriggle from her skull.
L
Dark, hot and loud: PIPES, STEAM, GEARS and PISTONS.
CHARON, a grizzled old sea captain, shovels coal and
slams the furnace closed. He walks past his "crew"
--
MECHANICAL OARSMEN of tarnished brass, rowing tirelessly.
Charon dons furs, then climbs up to --
In a small space among the stores, Vidalia circles
Perseus, whose eyes are shut. Suddenly, she sweeps his
legs out. He lands hard.
VIDALIA
She's got a tail and she'll use it
just like that.
Perseus opens his eyes.
VIDALIA
Keep your eyes shut! Open them
with Medusa and it will be your
last look.
PERSEUS
(CLOSES EYES)
You're enjoying this too much.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
He can't see her smile. Or that she regards him with
something hotter than amusement. She tries to punch him,
but he blocks it.
VIDALIA
Good!
Pleased, he doesn't sense her right cross, which knocks
him down.
VIDALIA
Do you think the Gorgon will hit
once and then surrender her head?
He gets up, eyes closed, and resumes the defensive
position, turning as she moves around him.
VIDALIA
Listen... you will hear her
muscles coil. Feel her hunger in
your gut. Ask, how will she feed
it?
PERSEUS
I wish it, but I can't perceive
the world that way.
VIDALIA
You can. You're the son of a God.
PERSEUS
Nothing I have done has convinced
me of that.
VIDALIA
You do not see yourself clearly
yet. In time, your actions in
crisis will sharpen your view.
Her faith touches him deeply. She resumes the lesson:
VIDALIA
You can do those things, Perseus,
and much more.
He shadows her movements more closely, back and forth.
VIDALIA
We think a room is silent until
someone points out the wind. Then
the wind is all we hear.
She strikes. He dodges and locks her neck. Pleased, she
flips him.
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
Surprisingly, he lands on his feet, and immediately
sweeps her legs. She starts to fall backwards, but --
SLOW MOTION as Perseus dives forward and cradles her
gently as they both fall to the floor. A move beyond
human. She looks up at his closed eyes, worried. Their
lips are inches apart. REGULAR SPEED --
PERSEUS
I'm beginning to hear the wind.
(senses something,
CONFUSED)
Vidalia... why are you afraid?
She kisses him, deeply. He returns it. Suddenly, she
rolls free and stands up, turning away from him.
PERSEUS
Wait...
She is already climbing the ladder. She stops for only a
MOMENT --
VIDALIA
You've learned enough for now.
In the subterranean temple, we HEAR Ixion landing above;
dust rains into the cavern. SUNLIGHT angles through
holes in the roof.
Draco, Spyros and Perseus move blindly through the
debris. CORPSES everywhere, faces frozen in stone
screams.
The men can't see it, but one wall suddenly frames a
silhouette of MEDUSA: HAIR OF HISSING SNAKES atop a
woman's torso, the body of a mammoth reptile.
WE SEE only GLIMPSES of Medusa as she slides through the
shadows. Her forked tongue tastes the air.
CUTTING BETWEEN Spyros, Perseus and Draco, moving
silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary.
OUR VIEW of Draco is suddenly BLOCKED by Medusa -- she
coils around Draco without touching him. He HEARS the
RASP of SCALES ON STONE.
DRACO
I hear her, Perseus. She's near!
Her torso behind him, she RATTLES her tail in front.
Draco spins and slices the air. The RATTLE stops. Draco
waits, confused.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
(O.S.)
(from across the
ROOM)
Draco, be wary --
!
Medusa gingerly tugs Draco's blindfold free. Draco sees
the tail before him. Unthinking, he instinctively spins
and looks.
Medusa's face is inches from Draco's. His muscles lock
and his flesh hardens to scabrous stone, emanating SMOKY
GAS. Medusa breathes in the vapors ecstatically.
AT THAT MOMENT a hole blasts through the roof of the
cavern as Ixion crashes down in a cloud of dirt -- dead,
a gaping wound in his head.
Medusa regards her fallen minion in horror, loosing a
MOURNFUL SIGH.
Spyros HEARS HER and blindly hurls his harpoon toward the
sound.
WITH THE HARPOON as its sails cleanly through slanted
pillars and debris, WHOOSH, WHOOSH, until it comes
through a tiny opening and --
THUDS into Medusa's body! The Monster SCREAMS, whipping
about. She tries to pull the harpoon out, but can't.
SPYROS
(O.S.)
Perseus, I think she's hit!
PERSEUS
(O.S.)
Where?
SPYROS
(O.S.)
Near to the left!
Medusa's enraged attention shifts back and forth between
the VOICES of the two men, deciding which to attack.
Perseus tries to control his shakes, jumping at every
sound, head swiveling blindly. From a distance --
SPYROS
(O.S.)
Perseus... I don't hear her near
me!
Perseus steps back and BUMPS into a column.
90.
ABOVE HIM
F-
Medusa is coiled around the column, harpoon stuck in her
bloody side. She CRAWLS DOWN toward Perseus.
Perseus against the column. FROM THE TOP OF FRAME,
Medusa's fingers reach for his blindfold. She pulls the
knot and the blindfold falls.
Eyes closed, Perseus slashes the air, sweeping the sickle
about until it SMASHES into the column -- BRINNNGI The
SOUND ECHOES, then FADES.
Perseus waits and listens. Then, PING!, one drop of
Medusa's blood lands on his shield.
Perseus opens his eyes and peers into his shield. In the
reflection on the bronze, he SEES: Movement. Snakes.
Searing eyes... Medusa!
Eyes shut, he windmills his weapon above him. Medusa's
talons DEFLECT the blade and the sickle flies from his
grip.
Perseus scrambles for it on his hands and knees. Behind
him, Medusa SLITHERS down the column and heads for
Perseus.
Perseus reaches the sickle. He lifts his shield up in
front of him and sees Medusa's reflection growing closer
behind him.
He shuts his eyes and wheels around, blade sweeping. A
soft F-THMMP as the blade slices through something...
SILENCE. Perseus turns away and opens his eyes, looking
into the shield. Still, Medusa looms behind him!
But suddenly, Medusa's head THUDS and rolls on the
ground. The headless reflection topples over, dead.
r-
Perseus drops into a dim, earthen den. Vidalia stands
motionless before a bare altar.
VIDALIA
This is my church. Where I was
born to the world. Where my
people prayed to me.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
Who were they?
VIDALIA
(UNCERTAIN)
I know they were humans. They
seemed so fragile. I sheltered
them because I thought the harsh
world would break them. Now I
know I underestimated them.
Her eyes pierce Perseus.
VIDALIA
When I saw you come out with
Medusa's head, I saw that a Man
had done an impossible thing.
Beautiful, yes, but not fragile.
Resilient. Fearless.
PERSEUS
I was mad with fear. I was no
hero. I just didn't want to die.
Perseus turns toward the altar.
PERSEUS
What is this?
A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced.
Vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring.
VIDALIA
When the war began, Men ranged
through the hills, stamping out
any trace of God-worship they
found.
(touching the tablet)
My true name was carved here.
When it was obliterated, my
worshippers lost faith and my last
season began.
PERSEUS
How long do you have?
VIDALIA
Only days.
PERSEUS
What will happen?
VIDALIA
I will vanish, quick as dew
evaporating at dawn.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
VIDALIA (CONT'D)
No one will notice the moment
because all thought of me will be
gone.
PERSEUS
What about me?
VIDALIA
Nothing can save me.
He takes her in his arms. Vidalia is riven by anguish
and desire.
PERSEUS
I don't believe that. Will love
not buy another day, Vidalia?
VIDALIA
(TEARS FLOWING)
I was cut free of earthly longing.
Why did you have to give me a
name?
The light is almost gone now. They kiss. The wilted
blossoms in her crown slowly open with color. They begin
to make love.
DISSOLVE TO:
Perseus and Vidalia lie together, listening to the SOUNDS
of nightingale, cricket and owl.
PERSEUS
When you vanish, I'll find you.
VIDALIA
Close your eyes.
1
PERSEUS
I'd rather look at you.
VIDALIA
Do what I tell you.
(as he does)
I'm going to give you a spell.
PERSEUS
Don't give away your secrets. You
still have need of them.

99.

VIDALIA
Let me give you this sliver of
magic. I'll write it on your
instinct. When the time comes,
you'll know how to use it.
She takes his head in her hands, pressing her forehead to
his. Gently, her fingers slip into his mind. A TEAR
runs down her cheek.
PERSEUS' POV
In QUICK FLASHES: A white lid opens to a black eye.
Reflected in the eye -- clouds roll over a stormy sky.
THEN:
Feathered WHITE WINGS beat the air. Then:
Racing over the surface of a blue SEA, and then down,
down, to SMASH THROUGH the surface, into the depths.
Tiamat and Set the Void stand over the corpse of Medusa.
Baby snakes and beetles spill out of her neatly-sliced
neck. Tiamat is furious.
TIAMAT
How did he do this? They were not
even to reach Medusa.
SET
Fate has begun to shift. The
future ripples with uncertainty.
TIAMAT
Spare me your pitiful maundering!
There is no Fate beyond my actions
and no uncertainty in the face of
my will.
SET
(COWED)
I meant only that the demigod
bends the path without knowing it.
He is ignorant of the rules, or
unconcerned with them.
She turns on him with such a violent look, he flinches.
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
TIAMAT
Then there shall be no rules!
Prove to me you have not lost that
which makes you most valuable.
Set absorbs her tirade, stung.
SET
And Zeus... the others?
TIAMAT
I am your ally. That is all you
need to know. Bloody your hands
and rid me of this pestilence.
SET
You have liberated me, my Queen.
Watch as your desires are quickly
satisfied.
Set disappears.
Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for Vidalia, but she is
gone. Amoun stands over him, his manner severe.
PERSEUS
Where is she?
AMOUN
This is my fault. I've permitted
.this infatuation to progress too
far.
PERSEUS
It is not yours to permit,
Master... with respect.
Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of
berries.
VIDALIA
Look what I've found for us --
She startles when she sees Amoun, dropping the berries.
AMOUN
(TO VIDALIA)
Have you forgotten Perseus is
engaged to the Princessa?
PERSEUS
I won't marry Andromeda.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
Both Amoun and Vidalia are surprised.
AMOUN
If by some miracle you survive
this encounter with Leviathan, the
hand of the Princessa is your
reward.
PERSEUS
I want no reward.
AMOUN
Are you so selfish? Would you
risk everything for the foolish
love of --
A BLAST of HOT DESERT WIND blows into the Shrine. The
berries turn brown and shrivel.
Amoun grabs his chest. Perseus and Vidalia crumple in
agony.
SET THE VOID COMES INTO THE SHRINE. Amoun tries to
invoke a spell, but Set touches his chest and Amoun
splits open.
Set points at Vidalia, slamming her into the earthen
wall. The God is there in an instant, strangling her.
Perseus staggers up and swings his sickle, but Set
points, ripping the weapon from Perseus' hand. It flies
across the shrine and sinks with a CLANG into the tablet
that once held Vidalia's true name.
Still choking Vidalia, Set grabs Perseus' arm. Perseus
doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch. Suffocating,
Vidalia FADES MORE.
Immobilized, Perseus watches her struggle and searches
HIS BEING:
PERSEUS
(low, rasping)
I am half God... and now is the
time...
Perseus rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an
ear-splitting CRACK OF THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF
WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and lurches back,
aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth.
Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The
God's body SPASMS and deforms in DEATH THROES.
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
Perseus slams the God down in a ghastly heap, which
liquefies into thick black blood. It seeps into the
sandy floor, leaving an ugly stain.
Perseus rushes to embrace Vidalia, who is more evanescent
than ever. They look with pain at the remains of Amoun.
VIDALIA
I'm so sorry, Perseus.
A look of brutal, determined resolve grows in Perseus'
face.
VIDALIA
(IN AWE)
You faced a God in lethal
combat... and vanquished him.
Never have I heard of such a
thing.
He looks at her, mind racing, then lifts her as he
stands.
PERSEUS
We must go quickly now.
He pulls the sickle from the marble with a BRINNG! The
light flashes off Zeus' LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN on the
blade.
PERSEUS
The combat has just begun.

Fantasos and the LEADERS of the Revolution are gathered
around a SACRIFICIAL FIRE. They fill the room with their
CHANTING.
SUPERIMPOSE: JOPPA... THE EVE OF THE 30TH DAY
FANTASOS
We invoke thee, Queen of the Deep.
We attend thee only to listen and

Fantasos moves through smoke to an altar, on which is a
fearsome IDOL OF TIAMAT, unlike any representation we've
seen.

FANTASOS
We serve your will so that we may
be absorbed into your
perfection... Holy of holies...
Tiamat!
The Sanctuary is suddenly filled with the VOICE of --
TIAMAT
(V.0.)
Loyal servants...
it may be an illusion, but the Idol seems to have taken
on the most subtle of life. It does not move, but it
breathes.
TIAMAT (V.0.)
You have sown the seeds of revolt.
Now comes the harvest. My legions
stand ready at the gates. Only
one rite of consecration remains
before the Ascension.
Fantasos, closest to the Idol, flinches, buffeted by an
unseen draft.
TIAMAT
(V.0.)
The hour of sacrifice is upon us.
Offer up the Princess Andromeda to
Leviathan.
A GONG sounds ONCE in the night. Repheus sleeps fitfully
on a divan by the bed of the desiccated Cassiopeia.
The GONG sounds again. CLOSE ON Andromeda's tortured
face staring down at the city -- too CLOSE to see exactly
where she is.
L
Peshet enters, dagger held at her back. No sign of
Andromeda.
PESHET
My lady? Princess Andromeda?
She goes deeper into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off,
ALARMED --
Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony,
preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound,
teetering.
Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a
knife of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid.
ANDROMEDA
Peshet, stop! I know what I am
meant to do.
PESHET
My lady, please --
ANDROMEDA
I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to
understand that the fate of so
many could rest with me.
PESHET
Princessa, give me your hand.
Andromeda, please. Please.
ANDROMEDA
(looks at the drop)
I'm not afraid anymore. I will do
what I must. I will die so that
they may live.
R
She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her, pulling her to
safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING
on the marble.
PESHET
I won't allow it, my lady. Today,
you are only a Princess. One day
your people may need a Queen ready
to die for them.
Peshet snatches up the dagger from where she dropped it.
PESHET
C
Come, we have to hide you... right
now.

She stops, picks up Andromeda's knife and hands it to
