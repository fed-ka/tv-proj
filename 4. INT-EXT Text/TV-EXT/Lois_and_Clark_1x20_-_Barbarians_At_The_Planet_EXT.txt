    in her mid-thirties.  She pushes a tea service cart.

               Let me.

    He does the honors for both of them.  Mrs. Cox takes a 
    chair, puts her feet up on the desk.

               Should we begin to switch some of
               the LexCorp advertising accounts to 
               other papers?

               Not yet.  We need to preserve the

               How will this affect your proposal
               to Lois Lane?

                             LUTHOR
               It's _designed_ to help.  If you
               expect to utterly defeat a
               battlefield opponent, you must
               destroy their support system, their
               allies, and any avenue of retreat.

    A CHIME sounds.  Luthor and Mrs. Cox exchange a
    significant glance.  Both rise and move inside to Luthor's
    office.






    People gather on the street and watch smoke and flames
    curl around the building.  Fire trucks arrive and hurry
    into action.  Superman emerges from the building, sets
    Jack down next to Lois and Jimmy, begins CPR.  A tense
    moment, then Jack COUGHS, tries to sit up.

                             SUPERMAN
               Yes you will.

    Superman grabs several hose ends, begins to _LEVITATE_ up

    coffee.  Perry drains his, gets up to grab the pot and
    freshen all of theirs.  A waitress moves toward him, but
    he waves her off.

               What about Jack?  Is he going to
               help him?

    Lois remembers, turns snidely to Clark.

               _Perfect_ example.  Lex is 
               convinced that Jack set the fire, 
               but because I asked him to, he's 
               gotten an excellent lawyer to 
               defend him.

                             CLARK
               Yeah, _perfect_.  With Luthor's
               help I'm sure Jack will never again
               see the light of day.

    Lois and Clark walk in silence through the park.  Clark
    spies an empty bench and they sit.  It's hard for him to
    say what he must.

                             LOIS
               What is it, Clark?

                             CLARK
               Lois, when I thought about losing
               my job at the Planet, saying
               goodbye to Perry, Jimmy,
               everyone... I realized something.
               I realized I could lose all that
               and still go on.  I realized there                 *
               was only one thing I didn't want                   *
               to live without... and that was
               you.  Seeing you every morning,
               working with you, being with you.

                             LOIS
               That's why you should...

                             CLARK

               No.  Lois, listen to me.  I'm not
               talking about the partnership.  I'm
               talking about us.
                     (beat)
               I've been in love with you for a
               long time.

    Lois looks into Clark's eyes.

                             CLARK (Cont'd)
               You must have known.

                             LOIS
               I knew... well I knew that you
               liked me, were attracted to me,
               but... I'm sorry.  I don't think
               about you in that way...
               romantically.
                     (beat)
               Clark, you're my best friend, the
               only partner I could ever stand to
               work with.  I admire you, respect
               you, and I do love you, but only
               as a friend.

    Clark is crestfallen..

                             CLARK
               And Luthor?  Do you love him?

                             LOIS
               I don't know.  I do have feelings
               for him.
                     (beat)
               I haven't said yes, yet.  And I
               won't, until I've talked it over
               with someone else.

                             CLARK
               Who?

                             LOIS
               I think you know.  If you see him,
               will you tell him I'm looking for
               him?

                                                CUT TO:



    A sign reads: Future Site of Lex Tower XVI.  The Lex Limo
    slowly CRUNCHES along the dirt path and comes to a stop.
    Headlights switch off.  The remaining light is from a 
    single bulb attached to a construction trailer.  Devane 
    steps from the trailer.  He carries a small case.

    The door to the limo opens and Luthor emerges carrying a 
    thick attache case.  He and Devane approach until they're 
    five feet apart.

                             DEVANE
               You have the money?

                             LUTHOR
               Five million dollars.
                     (beat)
               The stone?

    Devane taps his case.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               My information suggested the stone
               had been tested extensively by a 
               University laboratory.  Who else 
               knows about its properties?

                             DEVANE
               There were some loose ends... but 
               they've been trimmed.  Bureau 39
               was thorough that way.

                             LUTHOR
               And the research?

               Destroyed.

                             LUTHOR
               Then I'll have to take your word
               for what it's capable of.

                             DEVANE
                     (sneering)
               You want a money back guarantee.

                             LUTHOR
               Yes, I do.

    Luthor opens his otherwise empty attache case and takes 
    out a .45 automatic.  He motions with it and Devane raises 
    his hands.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               Put the case down and walk away.
               If it works, I'll pay you your 
               money, with a bonus.

                             DEVANE
               You double-crossing...

                             LUTHOR
               Uh, uh... careful.

    Devane puts the case down, turns, begins to move away.
    Luthor bends to retrieve the case, opens it to find... an
    ordinary rock inside.  Devane darts behind the trailer.

                             DEVANE
                     (yelling)
               Now!

    Two men appear and begin firing at Luthor with handguns.
    Luthor, firing back, retreats toward the limo.  The limo
    driver leaps out to cover his retreat with a machine gun.
    Bullets PING off the limo, but it's armored and doesn't
    even dent.  One of Devane's men vanishes, then the other.     *
    Devane, trying to escape, is hit, but before he falls he
    shoots Luthor.  Luthor crumples, Devane too.  Suddenly,
    it's eerily quiet.  The limo driver takes off his/her cap.
    It's Mrs. Cox.

    The other door of the limo opens and a man emerges, moves
    to the fallen body of Luthor. The man shines a flashlight 
    on Luthor's face, then rips off the latex mask covering
    the face:  it's not Luthor.  The man holding the 
    flashlight _is_.  Mrs. Cox joins him.

               The voice wasn't bad, but I never
               felt he got the mannerisms down.

                             MRS. COX
               It's not easy playing you.

                             LUTHOR
               Nonsense.  I do it all the time.

    They move to Devane's body.  He's still breathing, trying
    to crawl away.

               Is that Kryptonite in your pocket,
               or are you just glad to see me?

    Luthor quickly frisks him, finds the leather pouch.
    Inside is the stone.

               Pay him his bonus, will you,.Mrs.

    We FOLLOW Luthor as he moves away, admiring his
    acquisition.  From near Devane's body, a burst-of GUNFIRE.



    Middle Eastern music comes from within.



    Perry, Jimmy, Lois and Clark exit.  Perry, still              *
    singing "Lonely Teardrops," is being helped along by          *
    Jimmy.  They file into the waiting Lex Limo.  Before Jimmy

               The word 'free' is not in Luthor's

    Superman HOVERS, out of sight, but close enough to hear,
    and to see. He throws back his head in anguish and flies
    straight up.



    Superman lands on the frozen tundra.  Here, in the dark
    icy stillness he SCREAMS at the top of his lungs.  The
    echo of his pain is so loud that a massive glacier breaks
    off into the sea.
