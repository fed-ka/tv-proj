Inside, his family are in a state of panic. They seem to
have prepared for this moment. Through their agitation
there is purpose. They gather bits and pieces to carry
with them in their flight. Hector's children are attemp-
ting to take too much. Hector shouts instructions to
them as he puts more wood on the fire. It must stay
burning in their absence.
Hector gathers his family together and they leave the
cave.

19
Hector has returned to his cave home, now cold and empty
of life. He is working on his instincts now, still
emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of
the fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold
some life. Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly
*
and blow at the fire's remains.
We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the
simplest act of physical survival. For him the problems
of emotional survival without his family lie ahead.

This is another, bigger fire. In fact we might be in
hell. A crude furnace blazes. Filthy, sweat-covered
men feed it with wood and charcoal, an endless task given
the ferocity of the fire. To one side of the oppressive,
low-ceilinged furnace room, some small boys endlessly
toil at two large bellows, feeding the flames with jets
of air. OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is
WHISTLING, an odd human sound in an inhuman setting.
Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood.
We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass
of dangerously crude clay pipes, oozing water and steam
at every joint.
12.

Above the heat and filth there is a different world. A
clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning
conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room
of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have
advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the
technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of
the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and
comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance,
some around the edge of the pool, others in the water
rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three
or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie-
torial way that they look after their masters gives the
place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over-
indulged grown-ups.
And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall,
holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more
healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so
*
by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face
that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached
from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He
watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need
that he might have.
Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others
around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older
*
man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying
but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius'
pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older
man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector
*
immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as
Lucinnius climbs out of the water.
LUCINNIUS
I'm going to the cool room.
22
22
*
Hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him,
a look of concern on his face. Lucinnius' worries are
Hector's also.
Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various
chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and
the massage room as they go. All around them slaves
attend to their pampered masters.
23
23
*
After an anxious scan of the cool room, Lucinnius goes
towards three men occupying a marble bench.
(CONTINUED)

Hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for
his master to sit on as he joins the others. Hector then
moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's
behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to
casually join his friends. The eldest of the three
gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked
man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to
the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con-
tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal
hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm
smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his
master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave
and master exist so closely together that many of
their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's
feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange.
From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too,
Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's.
Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic
schizophrenia?
As Luccinius stands to leave we can
tell by their expres-
sions that the THREE MEN are open in
their contempt for
him. Hector is quickly on his feet
and by Lucinnius's
side as he goes. A final sarcastic
remark comes from one
of the three.
MAN #1
Well washed, Lucinnius.
Lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave.
*
24
26
At home, we find Lucinnius and Hector with the diviner
HERMAS. They are gathered around a shrine in the large
public room. The entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of
marble. Hermas prods them with a knife. He makes much
of the mysteries of his craft, as if it were a skill
beyond ordinary men.

26
The other two peer over his shoulders. Suitably mysti-
fied, Lucinnius talks in a reverent low voice.
LUCINNIUS
Are my ships from Sicily still
afloat...?
Hermas tetchily stops him.
HERMAS
No, no... offer the grain first...
sprinkle it on the altar...
Lucinnius obeys.
HERMAS
... and we can't ask the Gods
specific questions like that...
it's a gentle, probing enquiry...
general questions... but let's
see.
He cuts into the chicken liver and prods around the in-
side. The other two wait in silence.
HERMAS
General answer... no...
*
LUCINNIUS
What do you mean?
HERMAS
I mean, no.
The liver says no...
Lucinnius objects.
LUCINNIUS
Do it again... I want you to do it
again... Is it the Gods' will...
*
that Cyprian... be well disposed
*
towards me... in the future?
*
HERMAS
If you want to do it
again, you
need another chicken
and another
fifteen sesterces...
and I'd like
the first fifteen now
please.
Hector looks a Lucinnius, who nods reluctantly. Hector
opens his purse and counts out the coins for Hermas.
18.

Hector is giving Lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage.
Lucinnius is still in a talking mood.
His troubles
won't allow him to relax.
LUCINNIUS
Cyprian loaned me half a million
to fit out these ships... I'm
*
finished. Just when things were
going well... I had plans for you
too, Hector... in four or five
years I was going to make you a
free man... and then in ten years
*
you'd be a citizen... you... you
*
could've found your family...
brought them here... everything...
Hector smiles ruefully.
HECTOR
It sounds good.
Lucinnius misses the irony in Hector's voice and enthuses
about his own future generosity.
LUCINNIUS
It does, doesn't it!
Lucinnius is silent for a while as Hector continues to
*
rub his shoulders.
LUCINNIUS
I shouldn't give up. I can't...
I'll visit Cyprian, first thing
tomorrow... before the others can
get to him... he's got to see
reason... I can pay him back...
sometime. It's the only chance
we have, Hector. Should I do it?
HECTOR
You must.
LUCINNIUS
You're right.
I must.
This burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius.
His tense
muscles yield more to Hector's fingers.
THALIA enters the room. She is a household slave, a
Nubian from Africa. She carries a lighted torch and
moves around the room lighting the wall lamps. Lucinnius
watches her.
(CONTINUED)
19.
27
CONTINUED:
27
LUCINNIUS
Thalia, I think I need one of
your massages. Hector, you can
*
finish the lamps.
Hector does as he is told. He takes the torch from
Thalia and discreetly leaves the room, hearing Lucinnius
as he closes the door.
LUCINNIUS
Lower, Thalia.
28
28
Late at night, Hector is still awake. He rises from his
bed and quietly moves out of the room. He is careful
not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him,
some of them sprawled on the floor. He shares his bed-
room with at least eight other slaves. Privacy is a
master's privilege.
29
29
In the darkened house, Hector makes his way up some
stairs and along a passage. The only sound is a crack
or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage,
Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall.
He climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his
head.
30
31
Hector is back in his bed. A figure enters the room,
steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes
him awake. Hector comes to. Lucinnius stands over him,
whispering.
LUCINNIUS
I can't sleep. Get me a chicken.
I want to make another sacrifice.
We'll do it ourselves.
Hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows
Lucinnius out of the room.
22.

32
32
Hector is in the henhouse, in the dark, selecting a
chicken for sacrifice. He is about to leave when he
sees a MAN and WOMAN, arms around each other, sitting in
a corner. The Man looks at the white hen Hector is
holding.
MAN
Can't you find a woman, Hector...
Hector smiles. He isn't surprised to see them. They are
only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof. The Slaves
have their meeting places scattered all over the house.
HECTOR
Sorry to trouble you... just
fetching a chicken... good night
... the roof's free...
The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the
sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms.
HECTOR
Come on, miss, you can tell
Lucinnius his future.
33
36
Hector and Lucinnius are in his study. Lucinnius is
busy clearing up his papers. He is less hysterical than
in the previous scene, more aware of the reality of what
he has to do.
LUCINNIUS
We'll do it with a knife, Hector.
When everyone has gone to bed.
The two of us, to the end...
HECTOR
I don't understand. What do you
want me to do... I don't think I
can help you...
LUCINNIUS
We'll help each other, Hector. We
must. We've been through this
whole mess together... we must die
together.
(CONTINUED)
25.
36
CONTINUED:
36
HECTOR
I don't know what you mean.
What
mess?
*
LUCINNIUS
You don't understand do you? I'm
asking you to die with me...
you're my closest, my dearest
slave... what would they say about
me if you refused to die with me?
This is honor... we're choosing
*
death... we're not going to submit
to the humiliations that Cyprian
can heap on us, are we?
HECTOR
You say we... I don't know... what
is we? I've done nothing... I
*
know nothing...
Lucinnius changes his tone, becomes more, in his own
mind, frank, man-to-man.
LUCINNIUS
Hector... at Cyprian's this morning
... I had to sign certain papers
... tell a bit of a story...
*
HECTOR
What kind of story?
LUCINNIUS
A confession. That we were
plotting against Cyprian and the
provincial senate... we were short
of names... most of the people I
know were in the room... people I
thought were my friends... so I
mentioned you... I had to...
Hector is stunned with shock...
HECTOR
So I'm a conspirator?
LUCINNIUS
Yes. So you see, I don't want you
to die with me just because of my
honor... it's more complicated...
I'm sorry, Hector. I would be
honored... if you would die with
me... I mean it...
Hector manages to speak.

HECTOR
Can I sit down?
LUCINNIUS
Of course.
HECTOR
This is the worst it's been.
37
38
Lucinnius is at it again. In the lamplight, a live
chicken stands on the altar.
(CONTINUED)
28.
38
CONTINUED:
38
Hector and Lucinnius watch it as if their lives depended
on it. Perhaps they do.
LUCINNIUS
If he eats the grain it means yes.
He scatters some grain on the table.
The chicken at once
begins to peck them up.
HECTOR
It's saying yes... there's a way...
LUCINNIUS
No, it's saying yes, we should die.
HECTOR
But you asked it if we had to die,
or if there was another way... it's
saying yes, there is...
LUCINNIUS
No, it's saying yes, we should die.
The bird is certainly enjoying his food.
HECTOR
Maybe it's just hungry...
The chicken is inscrutable, as they are prone to be.
39
39
A dead chicken adorns Lucinnius's table. He and his
wife, DALMIA, and their son are lying on their couches
picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius is
drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other
household slaves are in attendance. Thalia is also
there, serving her mistress.
Dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what.
She attempts to break the silence. She calls on the cook
from the kitchen.
DALMIA
Solus!
The kitchen slave quickly appears.
DALMIA
Solus... I'm eating chicken again.
I ate chicken yesterday and the
day before... will I be eating
chicken again tomorrow? Why am I
always eating chicken?
(CONTINUED)
29.
39
CONTINUED:
39
SOLUS looks up at Lucinnius and Hector, but they offer
him no help.
SOLUS
It's what we have to hand in the
kitchen, ma'am... I always try to
use the fresh stuff... the
chickens have just been turning
up...
He looks again at Lucinnius and Hector. They look at
each other. Thalia looks at Hector. Dalmia looks at
them all looking at each other, more intrigued than she
was before.
A SLAVE interrupts them.
SLAVE
Two men have come to see you.
From Cyprian.
Lucinnius and Hector look at each other and share a
moment of hope. They might be coming with good news,
perhaps a softening of Cyprian's heart.
40
40
The two VISITORS that await Lucinnius and Hector are an
unpromising sight. They are big men, unsophisticated and
look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas. A couple of
the godfather's foot soldiers.
They greet Lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that
they would break his back at the whim of their master.
VISITOR
Good evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian
asked us if we could be of any
*
assistance... in the business that
you have to conduct tonight... to
make that business as...
*
comfortable... as you could wish...
Lucinnius sighs, as his last hope expires.
LUCINNIUS
Thank you, gentlemen... But I feel
that I will be capable of taking
care of my affairs tonight without
your help... Thank Cyprian for his
kind thought...
The heavies metaphorically keep their foot in the door.
(CONTINUED)

VISITOR
We're
spending the night at the
house
of Nepos, not far from here.
Don't
hesitate to send your man for
us...
at any time... We're anxious
that
things should go well for you.
LUCINNIUS
Thank you.
Good night.
VISITOR
We'll call in the morning at any
rate... just to make sure.
LUCINNIUS
Thank you.
Hector is closing the door when one of the Visitors talks
roughly to him.
VISITOR
You.
Come here.
Hector instinctively looks to his master. Lucinnius
doesn't protest, but retreats into the house. Hector is
left alone with the Visitors.
VISITOR
He looks like the kind that'll
want some help. Have you ever
killed before?
HECTOR
Only chickens.
VISITOR
He's not much different. Use a
thin blade, but long. Get it in
deep... the heart... feel for a
space between the ribs...
He prods at Hector's body freely, showing him what to do.
If it is ticklish, Hector doesn't let on.
VISITOR
... or go in from the back... any
place he'll let you...
We leave Hector nodding obediently as this weirdest of
coaching lessons continues.
VISITOR
Getting it out's not as easy as
you might think... you have to
twist a bit... to get over the
stickiness...
31.
41
41
Late at night in Lucinnius's study, an oil
lamp and a
candle cast their shadowy light, adding to
the tension in
the room. Hector stands beside Lucinnius,
who is
counting out coins and other valuables on
his table.
LUCINNIUS
Eight hundred sesterces... cash
... that's all that's left... what
a failure... my father left me
three farms and forty thousand...
Lucinnius places the money in a box on his table. He is
quite drunk, resigned now to his fate. Hector however is
cold sober, grim-faced. Lucinnius looks up at him.
LUCINNIUS
Nothing else to be done.
Don't
you want some wine?
HECTOR
No... but I want something...
LUCINNIUS
What is it?
HECTOR
I want to die a free man... I
don't want to die a slave...
Lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile. He
*
clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony
into his voice.
LUCINNIUS
Hector,
by this proclamation, I
make you
a freed man... I don't
know the
exact words... I've never
done it
before... But you're free,
Hector.
*
HECTOR
In writing... so that when they
find me... they know I died a free
man... please...
Lucinnius looks at him for a moment, then reaches out for
his paper and pen.
LUCINNIUS
Very well...
He scratches out a few words on the paper, Hector looking
over his shoulder, keenly watching what he writes.
Lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen.
(CONTINUED)
32.
41
CONTINUED:
41
LUCINNIUS
They'll find it in the morning.
It's a nice thought, Hector... you
were right to ask.
HECTOR
Thank you.
LUCINNIUS
Well... freed man, let's do it.
*
Lucinnius picks up a large kitchen knife which lies on
the table. He fingers its blade.
*
A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.
Will the
half-drunk Lucinnius want to kill him first?
HECTOR
What do you want me to do?
LUCINNIUS
Nothing... I mean, not to me... I
have to do it first... you
understand that... and then you...
if I don't succeed... then you
must help me...
HECTOR
I understand.
LUCINNIUS
No point in messing up the room.
Let's go downstairs.
Lucinnius stands and leaves the room.
Hector follows
with the oil lamp.
42
42
The house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the
passage and down the stairs to the washing room. Hector
walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius's crumpled,
defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first
quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. Hector
looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping,
that Lucinnius's moans will wake the household.
43
43
Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of
distress, with drink and terror and self pity.
(CONTINUED)
33.
*
43
CONTINUED:
43
He runs into the tiled washing room, wails loudly and
makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. Hector sees all
of this from behind as he enters the room. Lucinnius
crumples to the floor and squats on his knees. He calls
out in pain.
LUCINNIUS
Oh, that hurts, that stings!
Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool,
holding his stomach. Hector sits down beside him. They
both look down at the blade, still in Lucinnius' body.
LUCINNIUS
This is hopeless.
They sit absurdly like this for a long moment, neither
of them knowing what do do next. It's awkward, like in a
waiting room. Then Lucinnius speaks.
LUCINNIUS
Help me, Hector...
HECTOR
You've done it... you've done it
... lie down...
Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.
He helps Lucinnius lie out on the marble floor.
HECTOR
Close your eyes... you did it...
LUCINNIUS
Thank you, thank you.
The movement has increased the spread of blood over
Lucinnius' clothing. He raises his head.
LUCINNIUS
You do it now, Hector... hurry...
HECTOR
Lie still... lie still...
LUCINNIUS
Do it Hector... do it... you
promised...
It looks as if Hector is playing for time.
HECTOR
Shush... I'll need the knife...
(CONTINUED)
34.
43
CONTINUED:
(2)
43
LUCINNIUS
Take it... do it...
Lucinnius' voice is fading now. Hector waits, then
reaches down for the knife in Lucinnius' stomach. We
see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we
detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius
on his way? Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little. It's
as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released
from the wound. His voice is even more faint.
LUCINNIUS
Do it, Hector... do it... do it...
Hector has the knife in his hand, but still he waits,
looking at Lucinnius, willing the last dregs of life from
him.
LUCINNIUS
Do it... do it... do it...
The whispers fade to a croak. Lucinnius lies still.
Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands
up,
suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly
he
gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws
the
knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor.
Hector has run out of the room before it has come to
rest
against the wall.
44
44
Hector runs into the study and makes for the box contain-
ing the coins. He puts most of them into a leather money
bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on
Lucinnius's cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns
quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the
table. Then just as he is leaving, he again stops, sits
down on the chair, pulls off his worn shoes and places on
his feet a pair of Lucinnius's stout street sandals.
45
46
Thalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor
with two other women. Hector gently shakes her shoulder,
trying not to wake the others. After a moment or two
Thalia opens her eyes.
(CONTINUED)
35.
46
CONTINUED:
46
Hector whispers to her before she has time to open her
mouth.
HECTOR
I'm leaving... come now if you
want to... but we must hurry...
I'm a free man... I'm free.
Will you come?
47
49
Hector and Thalia are asleep, huddled together in a cor-
ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters.
A CREWMAN comes and shakes Hector awake. He stirs himself
to the sounds of a SHIP UNDERWAY, the sounds of the SEA-
WASH, the WIND in the CANVAS, the MOANS of the TIMBERS.
CREWMAN
Captain says to come on deck.
Hector wakes Thalia and they clamber out of the darkness
of the hold onto the brightest, freshest of days at sea.
37.
50
56
The Farmer and his Wife have laid out a table with
simple food, a stew, bread and wine. The travellers settle
down to eat. The Priest, however makes a performance out
of his more modest needs. He calls loudly to the wife
working at the open fire.
(CONTINUED)
43.
56
CONTINUED:
56
PRIEST
Just bread and water for me,
Mistress. I have no need of wine
or meat.
She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving
thanks to God for his simple meal, muttering his grace
quietly to himself, excluding all others from his conver-
sation with the Almighty.
57
57
In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an
upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a
blanket of soft sound over the human forms.
One of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector,
in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes
aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and
picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure
pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the
distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to
toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and
moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs.
Hector rouses himself and follows the other.
58
58
Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. The
*
figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING
there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the
Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth
as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under
his arm. He emerges from the pantry. He sees Hector
standing by the table. They recognize one another and
relax. The Priest doesn't re-enter his holy act. He
speaks normally, cheekily.
PRIEST
God, I'm starving. Do you think
I dare heat that up on the fire?
He indicates the large pot containing the remains of the
stew.
PRIEST
No... I'll eat it cold... I
deserve to suffer.
He pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the
table to Hector.
(CONTINUED)
44.
58
CONTINUED:
58
Then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks
of meat as they talk.
PRIEST
Have some wine.
Hector takes a drink.
HECTOR
I saw some fighting today... back
up the road...
PRIEST
So, the mad knights are at it
again... what were they, Swiss
or English?
HECTOR
I don't know.
They all look the
same to me.
PRIEST
It might help us get through...
if there's a bit of confusion...
we'll still travel separately
though, for now.
The Priest changes his tone of voice, mocking his own
holy act.
PRIEST
But, Hector, you must keep out
of the way of temptation... I saw
the way you were eyeing up that
widow... now stay away from
that... although she is beautiful,
is she not... but we're going
home, remember.
Hector is smiling.
HECTOR
How do you know she's a widow?
PRIEST
Look at her eyes... hungry eyes...
she could lead you into trouble...
she smells like paradise, though.
He changes his tone yet again.
He talks straight.
(CONTINUED)
45.
58

58
PRIEST
Listen, Hector, let's get this
clear... if anyone's going to dally
with that widow it'll be me... you
couldn't handle her... she'd
bewitch you... at any rate, you're
not a sinning kind of fellow, are
you... why don't you get off up
the road tomorrow, and I'll catch
you up, in five or so days...
Hector doesn't answer, but smiles. The Priest has
stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely.
PRIEST
You're not a sinning fellow,
remember... another month and
we'll be at the channel, then
home... the little ones you only
talk about when you're drunk...
don't forget them...
Hector still remains silent.
The Priest is worried.
PRIEST
Why do I always talk so much...
you weren't even thinking of her
'til I opened my mouth... but I
trust you... don't worry. I know
you wouldn't do anything to anger
your God, or me. Get me some
bread.
Hector obeys the Priest without thought.
The Priest is
*
happier now that he is in control again.
PRIEST
Who saved your neck in Venice?
HECTOR
You did, Ronald.
Hector approaches the Priest with the bread.
PRIEST
And don't you forget it.
He raises his cup to Hector.
PRIEST
May the Lord forgive us our sins,
those we have committed and those
we as yet only dream of. She's
a glory of a woman.

For all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of
vulnerabililty in Ronald. For all his bluster, there is
the feeling that he needs Hector as much as he claims
Hector needs him.

The travellers look out on the exciting scene, and talk
as they eat their breakfast of bread and milk.
PEDLAR
Hostages, too, they've got... they
only take the rich ones...
He turns to the forlorn Girl.
PEDLAR
Have you ever seen so many fine,
rich men, my girl?
Hector talks to the company, but means his words for the
Priest.
HECTOR
I won't be travelling today.
The Priest looks him straight in the eye.
PRIEST
The fighting's behind us, brother
... you'll be safe enough.
Hector shakes his head, catching Beatrice's eye.
HECTOR
I'll stay.
PRIEST
You should go.
The Nun puts an arm around the Girl.

We're going. God will protect

Suddenly the door is thrown open and four SOLDIERS man-
handle an inert body, dressed in full armor, into the
room. They scatter the food from the table and lay out
the MOANING suit of armor on it. A young SQUIRE follows
them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. The MOANS
are MUFFLED because the knight's helmet has been battered
out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. The
ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the
head inside. The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the
helmet. Their efforts are useless. Blood oozes from the
joints of the helmet. The MOANING suit of armor seems
inhuman, robot-like.
SOLDIER
Must be sore in there.
Is it your
dada?
The Squire looks at him and nods his head.
Hector looks
*
with sympathy at the boy.
*
SOLDIER #2
If he's got a little head it might
be alright. Has your dada got a
big head?
An OFFICER comes into the room.
OFFICER
Is there a blacksmith here?
Where's the smith?
FARM WOMAN
In the village, sir, half a day
away.
The Officer looks at the moaning suit of armor, then at
the astonished group of Travellers. He picks on the
Priest.
OFFICER
You, Priest, come here... get to
work on him... he's not ready for
heaven yet... there's a hundred
thousand livres on his head if I
get him to Paris alive... Start
*
praying... there's fifteen livres
in it for you if he lives...
The Priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to
pray earnestly. The Officer turns to the Soldiers.
(CONTINUED)

OFFICER
Get that helmet off... get
hammers, anything you can find...
*
and one of you get back down into
the valley and fetch an armorer.
The Soldiers scatter to
carry out their orders. Hector
*
takes time to watch the
Squire still kneeling beside his
*
father, quietly stroking
the helmet. Ronald the Priest
mutters every prayer he
can remember. The suit of armor
twitches and MOANS.
Hector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow
him outside. The Priest looks on helplessly as they
slide past the table and head for the door.
61
62
Ronald the Priest still kneels by the inert knight in
armor. The boy Squire still sits by his father's head.
Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. The knight
is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or
moaning. The suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid
as we look at it. There is no sense of it containing
life. The Officer re-enters the room from outside.
OFFICER
How is he?
PRIEST
Sleeping now... at peace, for the
moment.
OFFICER
Leave him for a while. There are
*
a few souls out here you can help
on their way to heaven. Ten sous
*
a soul to you... come on.
The Officer leaves.
Ronald quickly follows him outside.
*
RONALD
*
Twenty sous is normal.
How many
*
are there?
*
When they have gone the Squire gives his father a nudge,
*
but there is no response from the knight, just the
impression of lifeless bulk.

The Priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness. He
yawns, a long, contented yawn. He has completed the
hardest day's work that he has undertaken as a priest,
if he really is a priest. If he is not, then the pre-
tence has been just as exhausting. He wants to sleep.
68
68
In the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the
darkness. Some officers have moved in and the place is
more crowded than before. The Priest makes his way to
his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She
snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long
sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration.
He steps over her and settles into his own space by the
window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He
looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the
Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging
her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of
sleep.
The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know
why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of
Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose
detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his
*
cloak over his head.
Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering
beside Beatrice. They make love quietly in the dark,
also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest.
69
69
The Priest wakes up. Outside he can hear the first
sounds of the day, the murmuring VOICES of Soldiers in
the yard, the CLATTER OF MILK PAILS. In the room it is
still semi-dark. The Priest sits up. The others have
already left, but Beatrice is there, stretching herself
and fixing her hair. Hector is not with her. She smiles
at the Priest. Then, in another part of the room, Hector
emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing, sits up
and smiles too.
HECTOR
Good morning.
Hector and Beatrice look at each other. The Priest looks
at them in turn. Their cheeky act of innocence mocks
him.
56.

83
Beatrice turns to him when they are inside.
BEATRICE
Here we are... home... you want
some food... and then I'll show
you everything. We have a spring
... you can wash...
Hector stands looking around the small dark room.
Beatrice suddenly seems shy and awkward.
BEATRICE
This is when I wish you could
understand me. You'll have to
learn, you know... I want you to
stay here. You want to, don't
you?
Hector looks at her in silence.
BEATRICE
I look after the hens, and I make
*
dyes from the plants, and perfumes
too. I'm good at that. But I'm
*
no good with the sheep and the
goats. I wish you could
understand... Arnaud's been dead
two years...
*
She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window.
(CONTINUED)
65.
83
CONTINUED:
83
She lifts the lid and removes some men's clothing, rough
working trousers and a hide jacket.
BEATRICE
I still have his clothes.
I'll
make them fit you...
She holds the jacket up against Hector to measure it.
Hector's reaction to a dead man's clothing is
*
predictable.
*
HECTOR
*
What did he die of?
*
BEATRICE
I'm getting shy. Imagine me being
shy with you... I made this for
him... tonight we'll try them on.
You're the same height as Arnaud,
but a little thinner. I'll make
them fit. I'm a good sewer. And
we have a big bed upstairs for
you and me, in the rafters... You
and me... sleep...
Hector is beginning to understand what she means, but he
keeps his feelings to himself. Beatrice talks on. Now
that she has started, she wants to say it all.
BEATRICE
I like you. You like me too,
don't you? We were lucky to meet
the way we did. All the men around
here are old.
*
Beatrice falls silent, overtaken
by her shyness. Hector
understands fully what she means
now, but his mind is
a confusion. He can't respond.
She tries to direct his
thoughts to the one area she is
sure about.
BEATRICE
Come up and I'll show you the bed...
She climbs a
ladder nearby and lifts open a trapdoor
on the wooden
ceiling. Hector climbs up to join her and
together they
stand on the ladder with their heads poking
into the tiny
space above.
84
84
*
Beatrice is proud of her bed, a rough mattress on the
floor covered in some blankets she has probably made
herself.
(CONTINUED)
66.

CONTINUED:

The bed takes up most of the space of the small attic.
They look at it together.
BEATRICE
A good bed, eh? For you and me.
We can have fun up here... better
than a ditch...
She laughs. Hector's expression lightens a little too.
It occurs to him to take up her offer immediately. She
*
catches his thought, and the moment tingles happily.
*
Then from outside they hear voices. Firstly a young Boy
calling.
BOY (O.S.)
Mama, are you home?
85
85
Beatrice and Hector
descend back in the room. A BOY
of about eight and
a GIRL of ten are coming in from the
*
garden. They have
been working outside. Beatrice goes
to embrace each of
them. Hector's face is a confusion
once again.
GIRL
You were gone a long time.
Who's
this?
The Girl eyes Hector up and down.
BEATRICE
This is Hector.
Beatrice pronounces his name with care.
She stands
proudly by her children.
BEATRICE
These are my children...
The CREAK of a door makes Hector turn his head.
BEATRICE
... and this is my mother....
An OLD WOMAN stands in the main doorway, smiling at
Hector and nodding her head. She speaks to her daughter.
MOTHER (OLD WOMAN)
So... you found one, eh?
Hector stands, surrounded by instant family, and doesn't
know what to do. Eventually he speaks.
*
(CONTINUED)
67.

85
CONTINUED:
85
HECTOR
Is there water... to drink... to
wash?
He mimes with his hands. Beatrice understands that he
wants some breathing space. She talks to her son.
BEATRICE
Take Hector to the well... but
come here first.
She takes off the dead Squire's shoes and puts them on
the Boy's bare feet. He is delighted. He does a little
dance in them before leaving with Hector.
86
87
The Mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to
a comfortable chair that the house has to offer. She
is working on some lace. Hector enters the room to
watch her. He smiles and stands shyly at the door. The
Mother thinks he wants her chair for himself. In a
flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and motions
for Hector to have the good seat. He is full of
embarrassment.
HECTOR
No, no... sit down... I just came
to watch... please... sit...
He guides the Mother back to the good chair. They
struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows
Hector to settle her there. She mumbles unhappily.
(CONTINUED)
68.

MOTHER
We can't have this... this was
Arnaud's seat... it's yours
now... I can sit on the box...
Hector gently pacifies her.
HECTOR
You must sit there... look...
you need the light from the
window... it's your
seat... I don't want it... it's
yours... I can sit on the box.
The old woman
allows herself a shy smile. Whether in
innocence or
mischief, she has secured the best seat in
the house for
herself. If he stays, Hector will never
dare rest his
bones in it.
88
89
Hector sits at the table with Beatrice and her family.
There is an air of awkward silence, although the Boy
and Girl look openly at Hector, perhaps assessing him as
a future father.
The meal has been served in a communal pot. In Beatrice's
house there is the luxury of small individual plates.
The others wait for Hector to begin, but he indicates
to the old Mother to help herself first. She does, and
she doesn't stop until her plate is heaped high with
food. There is definitely some power play going on in
the old woman's mind, although her face is all innocence.
Hector submits, taking only a modest portion of food.
The old Mother's appetite is prodigious. It is comical
to watch her little frame consume so much, quietly
and methodically. She is an eating machine.
During the meal Beatrice and Hector exchange glances. But
this time their talking without words is a serious affair.
HECTOR
Mmmm... good food....
90
99
Hector goes inside his little
house. He puts his back
to the entrance and opens the
canvas sack which contains
all his possessions. He pulls
out his prize, a sizeable
chunk of bread and some dried
fruit. He guiltily gnaws
at the hard bread.
He is surprised by the sound of the boy, Nuno outside.
NUNO
Senor Hector?
Hector quickly stows his food back into his sack, and
with a grunt of irritation sticks his head out of the
shelter.
Nuno is holding four fruits, about the size of large
apples, but green and thick-skinned.
NUNO
This was all they found in the
forest. Four for each of us.
They taste kind of milky, but
sour.
HECTOR
Thank you, Nuno.
NUNO
My mother ate three and she was
sick. So try two... but she's
sick anyway... maybe you can try
three...
(CONTINUED)
81.

CONTINUED:

HECTOR
I'll start with two.
Nuno makes to leave, but then hesitates.
NUNO
Hector, will you help me?
Nuno is looking down the beach to the remains of the
raft on the shoreline. The shapes of the two Deserters
chained there can just be seen.
NUNO
Lopo... the boy they're going to
hang tomorrow... he was cook's
cabin boy... I was going to take
*
him something to eat... I thought,
perhaps, one of yours and one of
mine...
He looks at the fruit he has just given Hector.
NUNO
You said you might just eat two...
HECTOR
But there's tomorrow, Nuno... we
must eat tomorrow too...
Nuno looks disappointed. His eyes turn again to his
playmate tied to the raft.
HECTOR
Dom Paulo would call it a waste.
You must keep yourself strong, Nuno,
that's what he'd say... so that you
can help the others... God knows
what we have ahead of us... we'll
need strong people like you...
Nuno is silent, unconvinced.
HECTOR
Try not to think about Lopo any
more... The guards wouldn't let
you near him anyway.
Nuno stomps away in silence.
Hector shouts after him
cheerily.
HECTOR
Goodnight!

In the privacy of their tent Dom Paulo and his son are
engaged in their nightly ritual, practicing on their
recorders. Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an
intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is
an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are
to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of
circumstances. But there is also a feeling of madness
about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of
what is going on about him. Down on the beach men are
waiting to die in the morning on his orders. The blend
of formality and madness make the scene comic.
101
107
Sadly for Hector, the harmonium enthusiast is very close
to his shelter. The JANGLY MUSIC is loud and insistent.
Hector removes six large eggs from a bag and takes them
outside to his fire.
108
110
Inside his tent Dom Paulo goes to his small mirror. He
takes off the heavy silver chain and medallion from
around his neck, and a valuable brooch from his coat. He
stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its
hiding place in the sand floor. Then he adorns himself
in the cheap rosary and other trashy items. Dom Paulo,
*
catching sight of his watching Son in the mirror, holds
*
a silencing finger to his mouth.

Ursula is lying in a darkened corner. Hector is shaken
by the sight of her, ashen and fevered, but tries not to
show it. He kneels beside her.
HECTOR
Ursula... it's Hector.
She turns her eyes to him but doesn't speak.
HECTOR
We're leaving soon. I've come to
say goodbye...
Her voice is a whisper.

URSULA
Goodbye.
HECTOR
I won't forget you... I won't

how I hurt you...
She looks at him but doesn't or cannot speak.
HECTOR
We should have talked... I could
have explained... many things...
She manages a whispered word.
URSULA
Lisbon...
HECTOR
Yes... I'll pray for you in
Lisbon... at the Cathedral...
She lies still.
Hector lingers for a moment.
Then he
speaks again.
HECTOR
I'm sorry I hurt your pride...
Hector has blown it. Ursula pulls herself up on an
elbow, finding wells of energy from sheer indignation.
Hector is astonished, almost jumping out of his skin.
URSULA
What? What did you say?
What are
you talking about?
HECTOR
Nothing, nothing...
Ursula speaks one word, and then falls back into a dead
faint.
URSULA
Idiot!
She lies still. Hector leans over her to make sure she
is still breathing. He whispers nervously.
HECTOR
Ursula?
104.

141
They are safe and snug in their hideaway. Hector has lit
his candle. He is reading his letters, holding them close
to his eyes in the dimness. He has the air of someone
putting his affairs in order. Bobby is thinking aloud.
BOBBY
Maybe he's lost too... on his
own... must be Delaware... they
were chased up here years ago...
everybody thought they'd cleared
off west... the other side of
Ohio... they were an angry lot...
no wonder... they used to farm on
the coast.
He looks up at Hector, and allows himself a small smile.
BOBBY
Go on, read it out...
Hector looks up.
HECTOR
What?
No... not tonight...
BOBBY
I've had to listen to it every
night since April... why not now?
Hector gives in. He holds a scrap of paper close to the
candle and reads.
HECTOR
Dear, Father, I miss you. Three
frogs are dead. Everybody misses
you.
Bring me a bear's head and
claws and a gun. School is good.
Miss White has married a fireman.
Come back soon. Do not worry
about the frogs, they did not
have names. Nathaniel.
Hector looks up at Bobby.
HECTOR
It's not so funny now as it was.

BOBBY
It wasn't funny then.

BOBBY
I had a father like you... nine
months on a whaler and then three
weeks at home telling us all how
much he missed us...
HECTOR
I'm going home, for the winter...
Bobby doesn't pursue his argument.
He tenses, then
sniffs the air vigorously.
BOBBY
Smell it?
HECTOR
No.
BOBBY
Goddam it... smell it?
Hector sniffs some more.
HECTOR
Tobacco?
They whisper.
BOBBY
Where the hell is it coming
from?
He puts his head out of the shelter.
BOBBY
I can't tell... a night like this
it could carry for miles...
He huddles back inside the shelter.
BOBBY
I wish I had a smoke.

After a tense silence, Hector takes a small package from
an inside pocket. He hands it to Bobby.
HECTOR
I was saving it... you have it...
It is a wedge of tobacco.
Bobby takes it.
BOBBY
What do you mean, you were saving
it? You know the rules... no
hoarding, tobacco or food... you've
listened to me for a month, day and
night... wanting a smoke...
HECTOR
Well have it now... I don't smoke...
take it...
BOBBY
You've kept it from me, and you
don't even use it...
HECTOR
I was saving it for my birthday...
I was going to give it to you then...
BOBBY
I have to wait until your birthday
for a smoke? Who are you... the
fucking king?
HECTOR
Go on, smoke it... have it now...
BOBBY
I bloody won't... I'm not smoking
on your command... I bloody won't.
There is a brooding silence.
BOBBY
God,
your poor children... what do
they
have to do for a piece of
candy
in your house? It's very
hard
to like you sometimes... d'you

BOBBY
No... I'll have it in the morning.
HECTOR
Come on... tell me... who would
you rather be sitting here with...
have a think...
Bobby does, and then breaks into a smile.
BOBBY
Daniel Boone?
Hector smiles, too.
HECTOR
Yeah. He would be a help... but
after Daniel Boone...
BOBBY
I can't think of anyone else... but
you're impossible to like sometimes.
Suddenly Bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy.
BOBBY
We should sleep. We've got a lot
of running to do in the morning.
But Hector has other plans.
He is in control of their
friendship now.
HECTOR
No we're not... we're going to
talk... all night...
Bobby yields to this with the softest, most vulnerable
smile we have yet seen on his face.
HECTOR
So... where do you want to start?
Bobby is silent, but still smiles his acquiescent smile.
Hector reads the silence well.
HECTOR
I know where you want to start...
Bobby is still silent.

Bobby is mischievous now.
BOBBY

It will be a worthwhile night for both of them.

Hector climbs to the fourth floor.
A POLICEMAN goes with
him.
Two paramedics come up the stairs behind them, carrying a
stretcher. The Policeman stops.
POLICEMAN
You guys are downstairs... third
floor... thirty-eight...
The paramedics turn around and head back down the stairs.
Hector looks at the Policeman curiously.
POLICEMAN
You're forty-eight.
They continue climbing.

Hector and the Policeman squeeze past a cluster of people
at the door and enter the apartment.
POLICEMAN
This is Troup!
A DETECTIVE is with another man who looks like a city
official.

Come here, Troup. I'm Cobb.
Hector joins them.
DETECTIVE
You bring everything?

Slow down, Troup... so it's 3:15
on a Friday... you're staying here
'til Mr. Santiago gets the
paperwork... get your partner over
here, with everything... this is
serious...
Hector looks at his watch.
HECTOR
3:35...
MR. SANTIAGO
I might have to close the place
down.
HECTOR
Where is she?
The Detective and Hector walk down the hall. They stop
at the door of the bathroom. Hector looks inside. There
is a large ragged hole in the floor. At the far side of
it the toilet unit dangles at a dangerous angle into the
hole, held only by its plumbing. Firemen are working to
secure it and what is left of the floor with metal props
and hydraulic jacks. Lying on the floor below,
surrounded by rubble, and being attended by the
paramedics, is an old lady, MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS. She
tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over
the rim of the hole. She looks angry.
MR. PHILIPPOPOLIS
I phoned you Monday... I told you
the floor was making noises...
HECTOR
Not me, Mrs. Philippopolis... my
ex-partner... I think you spoke
*
to him... How are you feeling?
Hector says this clearly, for the benefit of the
Detective and Mr. Santiago. The Detecitve is unimpressed.
DETECTIVE
Come back from there, Troup, the
floor's still moving...

DETECTIVE
They waited for a portable X-Ray
machine... they can move her now.
HECTOR
She seems in good spirits...
As if in response, Mrs. Philippopolis shouts up to
Hector as she sees him leaving the bathroom above her.
MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS
Wait 'til my son sees his mother
lying here like this... he's gonna
sue you... you're a lousy landlord...
you should be ashamed... to let old
people live like this... I phoned
you Monday... I have a witness!
I was dancing with a prince on my
eighteenth birthday, and now look at
me... you have me falling down a
toilet!

Hector retreats into the hallway. Takes out his mobile
phone and dials, while watching the ominous Mr. Santiago
making copius notes in his book. Hector gets connected.
HECTOR
Boris... why did you do this to
me? Get down here now... they
want all kinds of certificates...
They won't let me leave the
building... I have my kids tonight,
I haven't seen them in four years...
I did tell you, I've been talking
about it all week... how come they
phoned me, this isn't my building?
What? Don't tell me anymore... I
want you here, now... and on your
knee... I'll phone the lawyer...

Please... right... okay...
He finishes the call just as Santiago approaches, waving
his notebook now full of incriminating notes.
SANTIAGO
It looks like water rotted the
floor... You have any plumbing
maintenance records?
HECTOR
At the office... I might have some
bills... it's not my building.

Santiago is talking almost to himself now, absorbed in the
mundane mechanics of Hector's building.
SANTIAGO
It's a weird one... I don't know
how water could sit in there for
so long without somebody noticing
... you didn't use water-resistent
paint on the ceilings did you?
Hector shakes his head wearily.
HECTOR
I don't really know...
SANTIAGO
You're going to have to check out
*
the whole building... you know
that, don't you?
HECTOR
Can I do it Monday?
SANTIAGO
Good joke... it'll take you a
month.

Hector is already dialing another number as Santiago
wanders off in search of further fascinating discoveries.
HECTOR
Can I speak with Leonard, please...
Mr. Deutsch? My name is Hector
Troup, Borlonski and Troup, Real
Estate...
There is a moment's pause.
HECTOR
Leonard... it's Hector... Borlonski
and Troup... yes... listen, we've
had a domestic accident at our
Eighth Street building... a floor
*
... and an old lady... she did
mention the word sue, but it might
have been hysterics... what I need
to know is what certificates you
have on file for the building... I
*
know it's Friday... just do one
*
thing... let me know if the
insurance is current... I need to
know that... I'm on my mobile...
anything you have... before five
... thank you...
During the call Hector has walked
down the hall and back
to the hole in the floor. He sees
Mrs. Philippopolis,
now strapped in a stretcher, being
carried out of the
room below. At the sight of him,
she tries to sit up,
straining on her straps.
MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS
My son's downstairs... when he
sees me like this he'll kill you...
go on... jump through the hole...
see what it feels like! Break both
legs!
Hector is almost tempted to do what she says.

Hector is following the paramedics as they negotiate
Mrs. Philippopolis down the three flights of stairs.
He is on the phone again. This time to his former wife.

HECTOR
I'll be on the way in thirty
minutes at the outside... I can't
say... Queens to New Jersey, on
a Friday... what do you think?
I'll be there... it's important to
me too, I've been trying to put
this weekend together for years...
I'll be there... I won't take
it out on the kids, I can walk
away from problems... as soon as
I get the car... I'll be there...
All the while Mrs. Philippopolis issues a non-stop
*
torrent of Greek expletives -- calmly and in a considered
*
tone, but obviously obscene. Hector is shocked.

Anna drives skilfully through the busy Friday streets.
HECTOR
You bring my bag?
ANNA
Yeah. Your camera's in there too.
Take some photographs of the
kids...
HECTOR
Sure.
Thanks.
ANNA
Nervous?

HECTOR
Not much... just like I'm being
executed...
ANNA
Well you deserve to suffer.
Our Hectors have been hearing this for centuries, but at
least Anna smiles when she says it.
ANNA
Don't worry... this is the
beginning of something... not the
end... you can start being a
father again.
HECTOR
I'm glad you talked me into it.
ANNA
I didn't do much... you were
ready...
HECTOR
You're right... you're absolutely
right... I was ready... I am
ready, for everything... I'm
fixing all that shit with Boris...
I told him... it can't go on...
I want my freedom.
Anna is looking at him amusedly, nodding her head with
every earnest pronouncement that he makes.
HECTOR
... and the kids... that'll work
out... we can have them over
sometimes... Yeah?
ANNA
Sure... that was the plan... when
we have the space...
HECTOR
Right, when we have the space...
when we get the bigger apartment...
together...
ANNA
There you go... you said it...
the bigger apartment together...
Hector is pleased with himself.

HECTOR
Yeah... I said it, didn't I?
ANNA
You're a man of decision,
Hector...
Hector is high on his optimism now, and cheeky with it.
HECTOR
Yes I am... Together... I said it
... and get out of my car at the
corner here... I don't have the
time to go 'round the block.
Anna pulls into the curb. Hector leans over to embrace
her before she has stopped the car.
HECTOR
Thanks... for the car...
everything...
ANNA
Do the best you can with them,
Hector... and one more thing...
deliver these...
She indicates a massive bouquet of flowers wrapped in
cellophane, taking up the whole of the luggage space in
the car.
HECTOR
What?
Anna, I can't...
ANNA
Here's the address... just two
blocks before the bridge... a
five minute detour. It's a
golden wedding... you have to...
She looks him straight in the eye.
ANNA
We have to help each other...
Hector accepts this.
ANNA
Oh, you'll need gas too... Go to
it, Hector...
She kisses him quickly, but lovingly.

around the corner OUT OF SIGHT. He is almost home.

A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five o'clock on
a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence
whatever you do with it, and that's fine.
Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us
than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of
our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did
or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the
threads together.
And after so many images of the natural world, a world
little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in
all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen-
sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film,
when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit,
then it will be somewhere around here that it happens.
Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching
for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New
Jersey Hector will complete his journey.
We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the
avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE
RINGS ONCE.
HECTOR
Hello... Leonard, hello... yes...
we're insured... thank God... yes
now I know God's a lawyer...
thanks...
On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban
street he is looking for. If the last crosslight holds
on green then he might even make it on time.
Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out
a sigh of relief.
154
155
They are driving on the freeway. It is dusk. Hector is
on the telephone again. He can't let go of business.
HECTOR
Excuse me, kids... I have to
consult the oracle...
He gets connected.
HECTOR
Hello... God? No, Leonard, it's
Hector... just a joke... sorry to
phone you at home, did Boris call
you? The insurance is fine? Good
... but she could claim negligence
... oh, she's got a lawyer
already? That's a bad omen...
Betsy and Tom are listening in the back seat, eager for
clues about this virtual stranger in front of them.
HECTOR
Is there anything we can do right
now... make her an offer... Sure,
with the insurance company... sure...
you're right... me, too... I have
the kids in the car with me right
now... sorry to bother you...
'bye...
(CONTINUED)
137.

Hector throws the phone onto the passenger seat, lets out
a sigh, and catches sight of the kids in the mirror.
Their perplexed expressions make them look younger than
they are, and vulnerable. Hector's heart aches for them.
He smiles and puts on an act of brightness.
HECTOR
That's it! The last call... the
weekend starts right now... we
have things to do... look out for
a Safeway... we need some
supplies... and gas... oh my God,
gas... soon...
They return his look with blank expressions.
He picks up
the phone and offers it to them.
HECTOR
Want to make any calls?
Betsy?
She shakes her head.
HECTOR
Tom?
TOM
No... and it's Thomas...
HECTOR
But we called you Tom... that's
what it says on your birth
certificate...
THOMAS (TOM)
I changed it.
Hector wisely lets it go.
HECTOR
Right... it's your name... you
*
can do that... Safeway... keep your
*
eyes skinned... and I could murder
*
a Chicken McNugget.

156

Hector is pushing a cart around a large Safeway. The
place is almost deserted. Betsy and Thomas are tagging
along.

For every four items Hector puts in his cart Betsy
removes three and returns them to the shelf. Hector
notices and puts up with it for a while. But when Betsy
returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he
makes a stand. He turns to face her.
HECTOR
What's wrong with that? It's a
kitchen roll... why can't I pick
a kitchen roll?
Betsy is defiant.
BETSY
It's bleached... and it isn't
recycled... you don't care...
you just buy junk...
She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from
the shelf and throws it into the cart. Hector has the
sense to back down.
HECTOR
Good point, Betsy...
Betsy keeps on the attack.
BETSY
Everything you buy is junk... I
don't eat steak... and what's
this...
She prods a packet of frozen hamburgers.
BETSY
Ugh! Why don't you ask us what
we like... it'll save you money...
you buy junk, we won't eat it...
A trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice.
Hector warms to her.
HECTOR
You're right.
Hector pushes the cart to her.
HECTOR
Well, get to it... I'll just tag
along...
Betsy moves off with the cart.
BETSY
I do it every week anyway.

Thomas backs her up.
THOMAS
She does. She tells us what to
eat. We let her.
Hector follows them up the aisle.
HECTOR
Can I just keep a couple of those
steaks? We can't live on chicken.
*
157
158
Back on the road, it is later. The kids have fallen
asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep,
searching for some traces of the little children that
have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots
he abandoned.
159
160
Later, Hector can't sleep. It has been too eventful a
day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW.
A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking
to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones
which he regularly scatters on the floor.
TV MAN (V.O.)
This is good, Tony, the stones
are talking to me already... now
here's something... travel...
movement... Tony, are you planning
a move... travel... anything?
TONY (V.O.)
Yes I am... I've been thinking
about a move to California...
TV MAN (V.O.)
The big one, eh, Tony? These
stones are really talking here...
what are you planning for yourself
in California?
TONY (V.O.)
I'm hoping for an acting career,
Mel...
TV MAN (V.O.)
Tony, these stones really like
what you're planning... there is
no doubt in my mind about that...
now listen... you have to be
specific... these stones really
want to tell you something, be it
love, money or the purpose of your
life... but I want a specific
question from you... think about
it... what do you want to know...
love... or your income level next
year? Be as specific as you
can, Tony...
Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier
Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He
stands up and leaves the room.
161
161
Next door, he watches the kids sleeping in their little
holiday beds. Hector watches them. We've seen our
Hectors do this before, and we feel the echo. But as
he turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright.

Betsy starts talking loudly. At first Hector thinks she
is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is fast asleep.
BETSY
Get me the books... all the books...
all of the books... no, no, no...
not the pancakes... not the
pancakes... no...
She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a
tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully.
BETSY
... not the pancakes...
Hector is a confusion of feelings: frightened,
fascinated, impotent. How can he help her? How could he
possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort
could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is
a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than
the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door.
TV WOMAN (V.O.)
... find your true cosmic partner
first time around... every weekday
morning at three here on the Psychic
Network... Lucinda's Horoscope Dating
Show... remember there is an answer,
and there is a special partner out
there for you...
Hector moves quietly out of the room, Betsy's sobs having
subsided. Just as he is closing the door he gets
another surprise, this time from the sleeping Thomas.
THOMAS
... don't let the oil run out...
yes you did... watch the oil...
why... why?
Hector closes the bedroom door.
He is one spooked, moved
human being.
162
162
In the morning, they are making breakfast in the kitchen.
The kids are having juice and cereal. Hector is
scrambling some eggs.
HECTOR
How about some eggs?
They shake their heads.
(CONTINUED)
142.

CONTINUED:
162
HECTOR
You don't eat eggs?
BETSY
How many have you got in there?
HECTOR
Three.
Is that all right?
BETSY
For a week, maybe.
Hector does a little probing.
HECTOR
How about pancakes, Betsy... d'you
like pancakes?
BETSY
Not much... why?
HECTOR
I just wondered. Pancakes don't
mean much to you?
BETSY
They don't mean a thing.
Why?
HECTOR
Nothing.
The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in
infinity. Hector changes the subject.
HECTOR
I thought we could walk into town
this morning. I saw the Funfair
when we came through last night.
THOMAS
We don't go to Funfairs.
HECTOR
Let's take the walk anyway.
THOMAS
I brought some books.
I want to
stay home and read.
Hector is determined to make it work.
HECTOR
No.
We're taking a walk.
143.
163
163
They are preparing to leave the house.
Thomas is still
reluctant to go.
THOMAS
It's going to rain... we should
stay.
HECTOR
Here's an umbrella... and there
must be some old coats in here...
and shoes... I only have these
I'm wearing...
THOMAS
Donald has some shoes...
Thomas is already in the cupboard under the stairs.
He
emerges with a pair of sturdy walking shoes.
HECTOR
I don't know if I want to wear
Donald's shoes.
THOMAS
Why not?
Hector declines to explain the complex
reasons that he
might have for not wanting to wear the
shoes of his
children's replacement father. He sits
down on the
*
stairs to put them on. Then something
on the wall
catches his eye.
HECTOR
Wow.
Look at this.
The kids' heights have been marked on the wall on some
long-ago holiday. The dates are beside them.
HECTOR
Six years ago. Look at that...
What's this?
He points to a mark and a date lower down on the wall.
THOMAS
That was the flood. The sea came
right up. Donald says it's the
icecap melting. It's going to get
worse. That's why Mom's selling
the place.

HECTOR
It comes up every year?
BETSY
The last two.
164
166
The only place the small town has to offer is a deserted
coffee shop on the shorefront. Hector, Betsy and Thomas
sit at a corner table, beyond them through the window is
the beach and the ocean.
HECTOR
Sure you won't have a pancake,
*
Betsy?

Betsy gets impatient.

BETSY
*
No!

HECTOR
Okay, first question?
*
The kids are ready for this.
There is no coyness now.
THOMAS
Where have you been?
BETSY
What he means is why did you stay
away?
Hector begins like a story-teller embarking on a long
saga.
HECTOR
Well, that's a fair question...
your mother and I got divorced...
you're big enough to remember...
she must have told you all that?
BETSY
Sure she has... but lots of people
get divorced... that doesn't mean
they disappear...
HECTOR
You're right... what can I tell
you... I went kind of crazy after
that, for a good while... I came
around a few times... remember?
THOMAS
Not really.
HECTOR
Well, it wasn't easy... everything
with her and Donald happened
pretty quickly. I missed you both
really badly... but for a while I
thought I should stay away, until
your mother got settled... no,
that's not really true... I missed
you... but I was kind of crazy at
the same time... your mother and I
married young... I wasn't used to
the freedom... it went to my head
... then you moved to New Jersey.

BETSY
It's forty minutes away on a slow
bus...
HECTOR
You're right, you're right. I
don't have too many excuses for
the first year... the second year
is easier... I was in jail.
Hector is pleased with this.
A solid excuse.
THOMAS
What for?
HECTOR
We were doing government work,
big contracts... there were some
temptations... my boss asked me
to shuffle a few papers... there
was a lot of money in it... I had
to testify against him... it was
like killing somebody.
Hector thinks about this, remembering the pain. For us
there is the echo of the real killing that was done long
ago.
BETSY
Thomas wanted to visit you in
jail, but Mom wouldn't let him.
*
Hector looks at Thomas.
HECTOR
You did?
Thomas nods proudly.
HECTOR
Well I appreciate that... but I'm
glad your mother didn't let you.
I'll tell you all about it some
day.
It was no fun. One year
and eight months.
THOMAS
We didn't even know when you got
out.

HECTOR
I wasn't in great shape... I sure
didn't want you to see me then...
so I got back to work... in real
estate... found a partner, we met
*
in jail...
*
The kids look shocked at this.
*
HECTOR
*
No. He's a good man, a good man.
*
I like him. I mean it. He's my
*
friend.
*
BETSY
That's what you do now?
HECTOR
Yes. We rent apartments... but
we want to get into commercial
property... people are a
nuisance... does that sound bad?
Betsy shrugs her shoulders.
BETSY
How should I know?
Hector carries on with his story.
HECTOR
Just recently I've been feeling
good, things have been going
well... and I missed you two...
so here we are...
BETSY
What about your girl friend?
HECTOR
Who told you about her?
BETSY
Nobody.
HECTOR
Anna... she's nice... she wants to
meet you, real soon... she sells
flowers... well, you know that...
and on Monday she's probably going
to kill me...
The kids smile.

gas station...
BETSY
Shut up, Tom...
Hector has to think to remember.
HECTOR
No... heck... no... did you think
she was following us?
THOMAS
She's always thinking up stories
like that... she never stops...
BETSY
Well, if people don't tell you
things...
HECTOR
She's right, Thomas... people
should talk more.
THOMAS
So you haven't been staying away
because of us?
HECTOR
What do you mean? Is that what
you thought? I was avoiding you
two? No... you mustn't think
that... that's terrible...
They have almost exhausted themselves in this first bout
of talking. Hector looks out at the sea.
HECTOR
The rain's off. Let's go.
