They walk inside.
We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another
room.

Clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to
powder. Laser watches.
LASER
I don't know, dude.
Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card.
CLAY
B minus in geometry, yo!
This
shits the bomb!
Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort.
Then hands
the rolled up bill to Laser.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Add it up, son.
Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.

Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning
against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room.
She pours over a game of Scrabble.
Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18).
Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE.
2.
Joni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her,
calculating his next Scrabble move.
SASHA
Oh my God, Joni, there are so many
hotties in your class. You are so
gonna hook up the first week.
JAI
Just cause you're a 24 hour drive-
thru doesn't mean everyone else has
to be...
SASHA
Hey, she worked her ass off! She
deserves some hot jock sausage!
Jai looks repulsed, and hurt.
SASHA (CONT'D)
(flip)
Whatever. Why don't you guys just
do it and get it over with?
Joni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their
crush on each other.
SASHA (CONT'D)
What? I'm just asking.
JAI
Uh, maybe because we're friends...
SASHA
Oh, really...?
Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur.

Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches
a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad
looks back, menacing.
CLAY'S FATHER
Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch.
The boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills. Again, they
knock into the couch. Clay's dad spins around, pissed.
CLAY'S FATHER (CONT'D)
What did I just say?!
3.
The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the
couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face
into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the
brutal play. Clay laughs manically.
CLAY
Let me go!
CLAY'S FATHER
Don't do the crime if you can't do
the time.
CLAY
Dad, your pits smell like burnt
ass! Get off me!
As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son,
we note a trace of longing on his face.

Joni, Laser and JULES ALLGOOD (40's) fair-skinned,
attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. Still buzzing,
Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table.
JONI
Laser!
Knock it off!
LASER
What?!
I'm not doing anything.

Nic enters.
Drops her bag and heads for the table.
NIC
Hi guys.
Sorry I'm late.
4.
JULES
Don't worry. We just started.
NIC
27 fibroids. All in the lining.
She kisses Jules.
JULES
Honey, that's disgusting.
We're
eating.
JONI
Did you do that laparoscopically?
NIC
That's right, Smart Girl.
And we
got `em all.
As Nic settles in...
NIC (CONT'D)
Hey, whose truck is that?
JULES
Mine.
NIC
Yours?
JULES
For the business.
NIC
What business?..
(getting edgy)
The gardening?
JONI
(protective)
Isn't it landscaping.
JULES
Yes, thank you very much.
NIC
(strained)
Okay...
(then)
Do we have any Cabarnet left?
JULES
I didn't look, honey.
5.
Nic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine.
Laser's cell
phone RINGS. He answers it.
LASER
Hey, what's up?
Jules puts her hand on Laser's arm.
JULES
Laser, no phone calls at the table.
LASER
(into phone)
Lemme hit you back.
Laser hangs up.
Nic re-enters with a large glass of red.
NIC
(sitting down)
Who was that?
LASER
Nobody.
Clay.
Jules and Nic share a look. Jules starts making maternal
windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm.
JULES
Can I ask you something?
What do you get from your
relationship with Clay?
LASER
What do you mean, "get"?
Laser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm.
JULES
Do you feel like he's the kind of
person who will help you grow?
LASER
Mom, you're windshield wiping me.
NIC
Hey, did you start on those thank-
you notes for your birthday gifts?
JONI
Not yet.
But I will...
6.
NIC
I just think it's easier to knock
them out when it's fresh.
JONI
Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight.
NIC
Great...I mean, you don't want to
have to start with an apology. You
know? Then it's embarrassing.
JULES
Okay, honey. She got it. Let it
go.
NIC
Okay, I'll let it go...
(then)
I mean, if it was up to you, our
kids wouldn't even write thank-you
notes, they'd just send out good
vibes.
Nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through
increasingly plum-stained teeth.
NIC (CONT'D)
I can't believe my baby's 18.
JULES
I know...
NIC
(devolving into baby talk)
Big girl. You're a big girl...
JONI
Mom...
Joni mimes wiping her teeth.
Embarrassed, Nic starts licking
at her stained teeth.
11

As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters.
JONI
What?
Laser looks nervous.
7.
LASER
Have you thought any more about,
you know, making that call...?
JONI
Yeah.
I don't want to.
LASER
Okay...I was just wondering if you
changed your mind.
JONI
I haven't.
He starts to leave, but her answer bugs him.
He turns back.
LASER
How can you not even be curious?
JONI
Sorry, Laser. I just don't want
to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I
don't want to deal with that right
now.
(co-dependent leak)
And also, that could really hurt
moms' feelings...
LASER
God, why do you worry about them so
much? They don't even have to know
about it!
JONI
Look, you can do it when you turn
18, okay?
LASER
I never ask you for anything.
Laser walks out of the room.
Joni feels horrible.
12

Nic and Jules lay in bed watching TV, unwinding from the day.
NIC
I just don't understand why you
bought the truck now.
8.
JULES
Because if I'm starting this
business I need something to haul
my equipment in.
NIC
Okay. It just seems a little
cart before the horse.
JULES
What does that mean?
NIC
Sweetie, you don't even have any
clients yet.
JULES
Well you're the one who's always
telling me to "act as if!"
NIC
(back peddling)
That's true. I do. You're right.
The women settle back.
Nic sees Jules feels bad.
NIC (CONT'D)
Look, I'm sorry. It's good you
bought the truck. Its proactive.
Nic caresses Jules' arm, wanting to make it better.
NIC (CONT'D)
Hey...
Jules doesn't look at Nic.
She keeps her eyes on the T.V.
NIC (CONT'D)
Wanna watch a movie?
Jules perks up.
Nic immediately regrets her suggestion.
JULES
A movie-movie?
NIC
Yeah. We haven't done that in a
while.
MINUTES LATER -- NIC AND JULES
are cozied up side-by-side facing the TV.
9.
ANGLE ON - THE TV
The volume is turned low on TWO NAKED MEN lying on a chaise
longue. One guy fellating the other.
13
13
Joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the
mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a
drawer. She rummages though with clear intention.
She pulls out a FOLDER and studies the cover. We see the
words: "Pacific Cryo Clinic: Bringing your dreams to life."
14
14
ANGLE ON - THE BED
We now only see Nic. Jules has slipped under the blanket,
and is now between Nic's legs. We see Nic trying to get into
it, but having a hard time.
NIC
I don't like the guys in this one.
They're too shaved.
JULES
Don't focus on it.
NIC
How about the one with the biker
gang?
JULES
We left it in Hawaii.
Jules wrestles with the blankets.
Wants them out of her way.
NIC
(pulling them back up)
I'm cold, honey.
JULES
Sorry.
I couldn't breathe.
Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner.
The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top
sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME
CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full
volume.
10.
MAN IN MOVIE
Suck that fat cock mother-fucker...
NIC
Shit!!
Where's the remote?!
MAN IN MOVIE
I'm gonna fuck that tight ass!...
Jules and Nic both dive for the remote. It's lost under the
mass of bedding. They struggle to find it as the grunting
and 70's disco music blares.
15
15
Joni turns to the wall, confused.
She hears the porno music
pulsing though.
16
16
Nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.
NIC
Jesus Christ!
Nic flops back, traumatized.
NIC (CONT'D)
The whole neighborhood heard that!
JULES
No, they didn't.
NIC
Well, that was a vibe kill.
Jules looks defeated.
17

Joni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though
some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4
YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a
camera with a big, open grin.
MATCH CUT TO:

Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches
TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess.
PAUL
How you doing, foxy?
TANYA
Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.
PAUL
Oh, sorry...
TANYA
No, I like it. It's earthy.
PAUL
What can I say. I've just been out
there, you know...hoe-ing.
(looking at the seating
chart)
How's it looking tonight?
They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.
TANYA
Gonna be tight.
PAUL
Really...
Paul's cell rings. He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads
for the kitchen, answering.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Hello.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Hi, is this Paul Hatfield?
PAUL
It is.
Who's this?
12.
WOMAN'S VOICE
My name is Wendy Minter. I'm
calling from The Pacific Cryobank.
PAUL
Okay.
What can I do for you?
WENDY
I just need to confirm that you
donated sperm with us between 1991
and 1993.
At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale.
PAUL
Yeah...I did a little bit of that
back then...
20
20
Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for
the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot.
WENDY
As you know the Cryobank has a
confidentiality policy which
prohibits us from releasing your
identity without your consent.
A cook, MARGO, approaches Paul to speak with him.
Paul nods:
"Can't talk." Hands her the box of tomatoes.
PAUL
Uh-huh.
Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.
21
21
Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.
WENDY (O.S.)
Well we've been contacted by a
young woman conceived using your
semen, and she's asked if you'd be
open to having contact with her.
Paul's speechless.

Paul and Tanya enjoy a hot, sweaty fuck.
LATER THAT NIGHT
23

Paul gets dressed while Tanya lays on her messy bed.
TANYA
You must of figured you'd get a
call at some point.
PAUL
Not really. I mean I was 19 when I
did it. It was so long ago...I
just figured no one actually used
my stuff.
Tanya moves closer to him, flirty.
TANYA
Why?
I'd use it.
PAUL
(ignoring the innuendo)
This is so weird. I mean, a part
of me's really curious...
TANYA
So what are you gonna do?
PAUL
I don't know.
24
24
Joni and Jules play scrabble at the table. Joni's cell
rings. She grabs it off the counter and answers.
JONI
Hello?
28
28
Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance.
He nervously
checks the door as customers enter.
MINUTES LATER-
Joni and Laser enter the restaurant.
They look nervous too.
ANGLE ON PAUL
He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around.
Figures they must be "his kids." They look in his direction,
spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over.
The moment is rife.
Paul holds out his hand to Joni.
PAUL
Joni.
Hey. Nice to meet you.
JONI
Nice to meet you too.
Paul holds out a hand to Laser.
PAUL
And Laser, right?
LASER
Right.
PAUL
Very cool name.
LASER
Thanks.
17.
PAUL
Thanks for making the trek all the
way over here.
No one knows what comes next.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Cool, I got a table set up for us
out here...
Paul turns and leads them out to the outdoor dining area.
31
31
Joni and Laser head back home.
JONI
I just never pictured him that way.
I just...I don't know...He was so
cool and interesting. I can't
believe that was him...He was so
nice, you know?...
LASER
I guess...
JONI
You guess?
LASER
Yeah...
JONI
God, Laser! You're the one that
wanted to meet him so bad!
LASER
I know.
JONI
Well what did you think of him?
LASER
I don't know. He seemed kind of
into himself.

Nic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch
watching cable. They see Laser on his way out of the house.
JULES
Hey bug, come here. We're watching
"Locked Up Abroad: Uganda."
LASER
I saw it.
It was gnarly.
NIC
Where are you going?
LASER
Clay's.
Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look.
NIC
Don't be back late, okay?
LASER
I know.
JULES
Can I have a hug before you go?
LASER
Mom...
JULES
Just a quick one.
Please!
LASER
Hug her.
That's what she's there
for.
Laser leaves.
Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules.
NIC
Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him
down and ask him already.
JULES
What?
"Are you and Clay fucking?"
NIC
"Exploring" is the word I'd use...
23.
JULES
And what if he is "exploring?"
This is the age for that. Why
should we care?
NIC
We shouldn't...
(then)
I just don't understand why he's
exploring with that loser.
JULES
Look, we don't even know what the
deal is. We're jumping to
conclusions.
NIC
I feel like he has so much
potential and he's just wasting it.
Nic's comment hits a nerve in Jules.
JULES
What are you trying to say?
NIC
What do you mean, what am I trying
to say?
JULES
It feels like there's some subtext
here.
NIC
What are you talking about?
JULES
I don't know: Like mother like son?
Is that it? Both of us aimless,
wandering in the darkness, "wasting
our potential?"
Nic won't go there.
NIC
Okay, honey, you're on a whole
other tangent and I have no idea
what you're talking about.
JULES
Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the
plane of consciousness for you yet.
24.
NIC
Yeah.
Maybe not.
Nic clicks the volume back on, freezing Jules out.
PAUL'S RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON
34
34
Paul and Tanya sit at the bar, eating family-meal.
TANYA
So what were they like?
PAUL
Sweet. They were really good kids.
The boy's kind of a sensitive jock
and the girl's kind of innocent but
whip-smart and super cute.
TANYA
Sounds like you connected.
PAUL
Yeah, we kinda did.
TANYA
Where'd you leave it?
PAUL
We didn't really leave it anywhere.
Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a
basket of freshly-picked fruits.
BROOKE
Hey Paul.
Paul leans over the basket.
PAUL
Whatcha got? Oh cool. First
strawberries of the season.
BROOKE
Don't they look awesome? I thought
you should have the first taste.
And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves.
25.
TANYA
(mimicking Brooke)
"I thought you should have the
first taste...of my pussy."
Paul can't help smiling at the nasty talk.
PAUL
Whoa...
35

Clay rummages through the top drawer of Jules' dresser.
Laser stands behind him, uncomfortable.
LASER
Dude, I don't think they smoke pot.
CLAY
Hold up.
Clay freezes. CLOSE ON a row of sex toys including a fancy
pink, Japanese "all-in-one" dildo and a few DVD's.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Whoa!
Clay turns on the dildo.
It starts to gyrate.
CLAY (CONT'D)
Yo, it's alive!
LASER
Dude, put it back!!
Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer.
Then he
grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around.
CLAY
Dude, we're watching this.
36
36
Laser and Clay sit on the bed.
They look at each other.
Then Laser hits play.
ON SCREEN
We see a COP giving a young MAN a BLOW-JOB. Laser and Clay
sit motionless, shocked, disgusted, riveted.
26.
CLAY
Think the whole thing's like this?
LASER
Want me to fast-forward?
Clay doesn't answer.
They just keep watching.

Laser and Clay are still watching the porn...as Jules walks
in the room.
JULES
Laser, you left your bike out...
Laser reflexively grabs for the remote. As he fumbles for
it, Jules sees what they're watching. She looks mortified.
41
41
We enter a family conference already in progress.
Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their
15-year-old son found their porn.
NIC
Laser, your mom and I accept you
and love you unconditionally? You
know that, right?
LASER
Yeah.
NIC
And you know you can be open with
us about anything.
27.
LASER
Yeah, I know.
Jules steels herself for a frank discussion.
JULES
Laser, is there anything you want
to talk about?
LASER
Like what?
NIC
Anything.
Anything on your mind.
Laser cracks his knuckles.
LASER
Well there is something.
Nic and Jules share a look.
"Here we go."
LASER (CONT'D)
It's more of a question, really.
NIC
That's okay.
JULES
We won't judge you.
Laser looks at his moms.
Nic and Jules brace themselves.
LASER
Why do you guys watch gay man-porn?
Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown.
NIC
Well, first I have to say we rarely
watch that movie--
Jules touches Nic's arm.
JULES
Honey...
NIC
And secondly, I really don't
appreciate you snooping around our
room. Was that Clay's idea? I
have to say again, I don't like
him. He seems untended...!
28.
JULES
Honey, that's not what he asked--
NIC
(snapping)
Fine. Do you want to answer his
question?!
JULES
Well, sweetie, human sexuality is
complicated. And sometimes,
people's desires can be...counter-
intuitive...
(soldiering on)
For instance, since women's sexual
responsiveness is mostly internal,
sometimes it's exciting for us to
see sexual responsiveness more, you
know...
(beat)
...externalized.
Laser looks at them, still baffled.
JULES (CONT'D)
Like with a penis.
LASER
But like, wouldn't you rather watch
two women doing it?
JULES
You would think that. But in most
of those movies, they've hired two
straight women to pretend and the
inauthenticity is just unbeara--
NIC
Okay, that's enough! Laser, your
mom and I have a sense there's some
other stuff going on in your life
and we just want to be let in.
LASER
What do you mean?
JULES
Are you having a relationship with
someone?
NIC
You could tell us, honey. We'd
understand and support you.
29.
Laser looks confused.
How did they find out about Paul?
LASER
I just met him once.
Nic and Jules share a worried look.
NIC
What do you mean once?
JULES
Did he find you on-line?!
LASER
What?!
NIC
Who did you meet once?
LASER
Paul!
I met him with Joni.
NIC
Who's Paul?!
JULES
Why was Joni there?!
LASER
She set it up.
NIC
Forget the set-up!
Who is Paul?!!
LASER
Our sperm donor.
Jules and Nic go white.
LASER (CONT'D)
Wait, did you guys think I was
gay?!
42
42
Joni has been pulled into the family conference. Nic and
Jules are trying to remain as calm as possible. Nic slugs a
gulp of wine.
30.
JULES
Look, guys, we understand why you'd
be curious about your biological
father. That's totally natural.
NIC
But why didn't you tell us?
JONI
Because we knew you'd be upset.
NIC
WE'RE NOT UPSET!!
Jules calms her riled-up partner.
JULES
Honey...
(to Joni; expressing her
upset more calmly)
We just wish you'd have included us
in your thinking. But what's done
is done. You met him, and now you
guys can move on--
JONI
(sheepish)
Actually...
(beat)
I want to see him again.
JULES
LASER
You do?!
You do?!
JONI (CONT'D)
(to Laser)
Yeah. I was gonna tell you.
NIC
Whoa! Whoa! No. No way.
(regaining dominance)
Nobody is seeing anyone until we
meet him!
Joni looks at Laser.
They knew this would happen.
43
43
Nic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss.
31.
NIC
Yeah, I get it. He's their
biological father and all that crap
but it still feels really shitty.
Like we're not enough or something,
you know?
JULES
Of course I know. I don't want to
time-share our kids with someone.
Especially when it's Joni's last
summer home. No way.
When Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red
hair out of the sink.
NIC
Jesus, Jules! The plumber was just
here!
Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash.
44
44
NIC
(getting tactical)
Look, we need to be smart about
this. If we act like grubby
bitches, we're just gonna make it
worse.
JULES
I know...
NIC
Let's just kill him with kindness
and put it to bed.
JULES
I'm with you, honey.
(then)
We're gonna get through this, okay?
Nic smiles.
She loves when Jules shows confidence.
NIC
I love you, chicken.
The women bump fists.
They have a plan.
JULES
I love you too, pony.
32.
47
47
Paul rings the bell. Waits. The door opens and Nic and
Jules are there smiling with "kill him with kindness" faces.
NIC
Paul! It is so great to meet you.
I'm Nic. This is Jules.
Paul shakes their hands.
PAUL
Hi, great to meet you two.
JULES
I hope the traffic wasn't too bad.
PAUL
No, I've got my bike so...I just
sort of weave through.
Nic clocks the motorcycle, stifles the impulse to judge.
NIC
Great.
Well, come on in.
As they enter, Paul holds out a bottle of wine.
PAUL
This is for you. I don't know if
you guys like wine...
Nic takes it.
NIC
Are you kidding? We love it.
(checking the label)
And a Petit Syrah. What a treat!
Let me get some glasses.
Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules. Little silence.
Jules steals a look at him, unable to contain her curiosity.
33.
PAUL
Beautiful house.
How long you guys
lived here?
JULES
Almost ten years. Wait, has it
been that long?
(rambling nervously)
We moved right after Laser broke
his leg, I remember that because we
had a ramp for a while, so that
would have been...ten, no, nine?
No, ten years this fall.
Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness.
PAUL
Okay.
Laser and Joni enter. Joni lights up when she sees Paul.
Jules watches Paul hug her. Uncomfortable, she heads for
THE KITCHEN --
Jules finds Nic's pouring herself a sizable glass of wine.
JULES
You okay?
NIC
(not okay)
Yeah. Fine.
Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest.
JULES
Go easy on the wine, hon.
It's day
time.
NIC
Okay. And same goes for the micro-
managing...
50
50
Nic pushes a cart piled high with gardening supplies. Jules
grabs a couple BAGS of fertilizer, throws them on top.
NIC
...I'm just saying, the plan was to
limit his involvement--
JULES
You're unbelievable. You're all
over me about getting clients, I
finally get one and you're--
NIC
He's not just a client, Jules.
,
He's our sperm donor! Have you
ever heard the phrase "Don't Shit
Where You Eat?"
JULES
Yes, and I think it's disgusting.
The two separate, go down separate isles.
When they rejoin,
Nic is contrite.
NIC
I'm sorry. He just seemed sort
of...self-satisfied to me.
41.
Jules grabs the olive branch.
JULES
Yeah, he was working the whole
"alternative" thing pretty hard.
NIC
(mimicking)
"I just need to get outside and
`do' things, not sit on my ass and
learn. But that's just me. I'm
weird that way."
They both laugh.
Nic's funny sometimes.
56

Jai and Joni and Sasha play Scrabble.
Sasha checks out the
photos of Paul on Joni's phone.
SASHA
Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox.
JAI
Must you take everything beautiful
and make it dirty?
SASHA
I'm just saying. Spermster's a
hottie. Is he single?
JONI
Okay, first of all, ewww. Second,
he's a really good person and I'd
prefer it if you didn't taint him
with your whore juice.
Sasha hops up, energized by the banter.
47.
SASHA
Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta
here. You love birds can split my
letters...
Sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous
tension.
JONI
You want to keep playing?
JAI
Sure.
As Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni
gathering her nerve to make a move. Jai probably feels it
but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni.
JAI (CONT'D)
Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha,
you know...
JONI
Yeah...
Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch
by inch.
Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him
which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same
time. To the point where he lets slip...
JAI
It's like she has to sexualize
every experience, you know? It's
just sad...
That stops Joni in her tracks.
JONI
Yeah, it is. It's really sad.
Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.

Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at
the rim of a RUNNING BATH. There are candles burning.
JULES
Wow.
What's this?
48.
NIC
Come here.
Sit down.
Jules takes a seat beside her.
Nic holds her hand.
NIC (CONT'D)
I'm sorry I've been such a bitch
lately. I know I'm not being my
highest self.
JULES
Yeah, well...
NIC
You've been really patient with me.
I just want you to know that hasn't
gone unrecognized.
Nic gives her a long, sweet kiss.
Jules is warming up.
NIC (CONT'D)
Get in.
CUT TO - JULES
In the tub, revelling in the warm bubbly water.
Nic is
sitting on the ledge, massaging her feet.
JULES
Oh god, chicken, that's the spot.
NIC
How's the water?
JULES
Perfect.
You wanna come in?
NIC
In a bit.
You enjoy it first.
Nic goes deeper with the massage.
Jules' eyes roll back.
NIC (CONT'D)
Oh, I forgot the lavender salts.
Nic starts to get up.
Jules grabs her hand.
JULES
No, don't stop...
NIC
No, I meant to put `em in....
49.
Nic gets up and sashays to the door.
NIC (CONT'D)
Don't move...
Nic exits.
Jules sinks back, wishing Nic had stayed.
CUT TO JULES - MINUTES LATER
58
58
Still waiting.
Getting impatient and upset.
JULES
Nic?!!
No response.
CUT TO THE KITCHEN --
54
54
Nic is on her cell with a patient, a glass of wine in her
hand. Jules walks in wearing a bathrobe. Nic turns. Raises
a finger and mouths: "Sorry..."
NIC
No, we're planning on being here
through mid-August so...
(beat)
No, I promise, I'm not going
anywhere.
Jules' face drops; she turns and leaves.

PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY
60
60
Paul watches Jules work in his backyard.
Luis hauls shrubs.
61
61
Paul and Jules stand at the kitchen table, looking over her
sketch for the yard.
JULES
Look, I'm gonna go to the nursery
in the morning so we should
probably make sure you're signed
off on the Bougainvillea...
Jules looks over at a pan on the kitchen counter.
50.
JULES (CONT'D)
What's that?
PAUL
Strawberry rhubarb pie.
Fresh from
my garden.
Paul hands her a fork and she takes a big bite.
Her eyes
roll back in her head.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Good, huh?
JULES
Oh my god.
That is criminal.
PAUL
Have more.
JULES
No, please, just take it away...
PAUL
You had one bite.
JULES
I have another you may as well just
tape it to my ass cause that's
where it'll end up.
PAUL
Hey now, don't go negative on your
ass.
Jules blushes at all this talk of her ass.
JULES
So...you're good with the plants?
(off his silence)
Look, we don't have to do that. We
could do go in a totally different
direction if you--
PAUL
No, I'm just thinking. Hang on.
(covers his eyes)
Yeah, I'm good with the plants.
JULES
Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence
for criticism.
51.
PAUL
I wasn't criticizing you.
JULES
No, I know...I just...
(beat)
Sometimes Nic can be a little
critical, you know. She's a
perfectionist.
PAUL
That doesn't mean you have to be
negative.
Jules looks away.
We HEAR a knock from the back.
LUIS (O.S.)
Excuse me, Senora? Hello?
Jules turns, sees Luis standing at the glass door.
JULES
What's up?
LUIS
5 o'clock.
JULES
Yeah.
Okay.
Jules wants Luis to leave her alone.
But he's not going.
LUIS
Same time tomorrow?
JULES
Yes!
Same time!
Luis leaves.
Jules turns back to Paul, laughs nervously.
JULES (CONT'D)
Okay.
I'm gonna take off too...
PAUL
(in Luis's accent)
Same time tomorrow?
Jules pushes Paul, laughing.
JULES
That's mean.
Paul hands her a Tupperware with some of the pie in it.
52.
PAUL
Here, take this...
JULES
No!
PAUL
Just give it to the kids.
JULES
Okay!
God, you're such a pusher!
Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost
as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out.
Jules snaps back, freaked.
JULES (CONT'D)
Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I
don't know where that came from...
PAUL
(freaked himself)
It's okay...
JULES
Okay.
I'm gonna go now...
Jules starts backing away, acting as if nothing happened.
PAUL
Jules...?
JULES
(overcompensating)
...but I shall return!
Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie.
Paul watches
her go, stunned by what just happened.
62
62
Nic's in bed reading a magazine. Jules gets in bed,
paranoid. Nic puts her magazine down.
NIC
So how'd it go with Paul?
JULES
(jumpy)
What do you mean?
53.
NIC
I don't know. Did you break
ground? Did you dig in? I don't
know the terms.
JULES
No, we just talked...conceptually.
NIC
Oh, so it was less of a "doing"
day, huh? Was he okay with that?
JULES
You know, maybe we should lay off
the Paul digs a little.
NIC
Okay.
You're right.
Chastened, Nic looks back at her magazine.
Jules rolls over.
JULES
And I also think we should start
composting.
OMITTED
63
63
68
68
The ladies sit in the living room watching TV.
JULES
Relax. She'll get home when she
gets home.
NIC
Quit telling me to relax!
They go back to watching TV.
After a beat, we HEAR a
motorcycle pull up.
NIC (CONT'D)
What the fuck...!
71
71
Nic knocks on the door.
Get's no response.
NIC
Joni?
(silence)
I was just upset. You know how I
feel about motorcycles.
Joni opens the door.
JONI
(patronizing)
I know how you feel about them.
But I'm an adult now and you have
to respect that. Goodnight.
Joni closes the door on her.

From his house, Paul watches Jules working on her knees in
the garden.
CLOSE ON Jules' thong peaking out of her jeans. Luis walks
across Paul's field of vision, interrupting his reverie.
74
74
Jules steps tentatively into Paul's house.
59.
JULES
Paul?
Jules walks further into the house. She looks anxious.
Paul
opens his office door and sees Jules in the hall.
PAUL
Hey.
What's up?
JULES
Look, I'm sorry about last night.
I'm really embarrassed.
PAUL
Don't be.
She's the one who wigged
out.
JULES
I know, she's just going through a
lot of stuff right now...
PAUL
Jules, it's okay.
You don't have
to defend her.
They stare at each other, unsure how to act.
JULES
And look, I just want you to know,
about the other day, the kiss,
that's not something I...do.
PAUL
Yeah, I sensed that.
She takes a step toward him, feverish.
JULES
I just wanted to clear the air.
They stare at each other.
It's like watching two magnets.
PAUL
The air is clear.
Jules grabs Paul and starts smothering him with kisses.
It takes a second for Paul to get his bearings, but when he
does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing
her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs.
JULES
Paul, I can't!
60.
PAUL
You don't want to?!
JULES
No, I do! It's just...
(urgent whisper)
I have a guy outside!
Overcome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and
Paul walks her into...
HIS BEDROOM
75
75
Quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. Somewhere
between slapstick and animal. He pulls her hair back hard.
She loves it. She pulls his hair back harder. He yelps.
She pulls down his underwear. Her eyes widen. It's been
decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh.
JULES
Oh.
Well.
Hel-lo!
Cut to them fucking. It's gawky and passionate.
Somewhere
in the middle of it, Jules starts laughing.
PAUL
What?
JULES
Nothing.
Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some
more.
She keeps laughing. Paul goes harder to make her stop. The
paces grows quicker. They're getting closer. And then...
LUIS (O.S.)
Hello?
Excuse me, Senora Allgood?!
They stop mid-thrust.
JULES
You gotta be fucking kidding me!
She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously.
PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY
76
76
Jules runs out to meet Luis, waiting patiently at the door.
61.
JULES
What's up?
LUIS
Where do you want the stones?
JULES
(catching her breath)
The stones? Over by the fence.
Luis stares at his employer. She looks totally disheveled.
Jules starts feeling her hair, smoothing it into shape.
JULES (CONT'D)
(defensive)
What? I was using the bathroom.
(then)
Do you need to use the bathroom?
Luis stares at her feet.
She looks down.
She's barefoot.
78
78
Joni and Sasha are at a table eating dinner. Tanya has
temporarily joined them. Sasha checks out Tanya's oversized
African bead necklace. Joni watches Paul charm customers.
SASHA
God, I love your necklace!
Where'd
you get it?
TANYA
I don't know, some flea market--
63.
SASHA
In Africa?
TANYA
No, more like Pasadena.
SASHA
Well, it's really awesome.
Paul saunters up to the table and stands behind Sasha.
He
mindlessly places his hand on Sasha's shoulder.
PAUL
Sorry guys, I need to steal Tanya
back now.
Sasha clocks Paul's hand. She carefully and without looking
back places her hand on top of his.
SASHA
That's okay, Paul.
TANYA
(getting up)
Well ladies, it was fun talking
with you.
SASHA/JONI
You too.
Paul pulls his hand away from Sasha's and walks off with
Tanya. Sasha turns to Joni.
SASHA
Okay, I'm sorry but your donor
daddy is giving me the sex vibe.
JONI
No he's not. He wouldn't do that.
SASHA
Why not?
He's not my dad.
JONI
God Sasha, that's totally gross!
Not everybody wants to have sex
with you, okay? Especially when
you act like a slut.
SASHA
Fuck you.
64.
JONI
Well it makes you seem insecure and
desperate.
SASHA
I'm not insecure and desperate!
I'm just a normal sexual person!
And maybe you'd get that if you
weren't so uptight!
JONI
Fuck you.
I'm not uptight!
79
79
Nic and Jules dine with their friends, JOEL and STELLA.
Nic's drinking like a fish.
STELLA
Oh my god, these heirloom tomatoes
are insane.
JULES
Joni brought some home from Paul's
garden the other day. They were
huge!
Nic tightens at the mention of Paul.
JOEL
So, the kids have been spending
time with him?
NIC
Oh, yeah, they're spending all
kinds of quality time together.
STELLA
(senses the sarcasm)
Well, it's great they like him so
much.
You know, you hear these
stories about kids meeting their
donors and the guys end up being
nothing like they were on paper.
NIC
No, everyone's getting along
famously. Apparently Paul can do
no wrong...
Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm.
65.
NIC (CONT'D)
Can we get another bottle of the
Seavey Cabernet?
Jules gives Nic a look.
Joel and Stella feel the tension
between them.
STELLA
Hey, have you guys tried those Aai
fruit packs?
JULES
No, but they're pushing them like
crack at Whole Foods.
STELLA
I know.
Joel's addicted.
JOEL
What I do is I throw one in the
blender with some bananas, frozen
strawberries and hemp milk and I'll
tell you, it's sensational.
Nic slaps her forehead.
NIC
Oh, just fucking kill me...
Everyone stiffens.
Jules is embarrassed.
JULES
Honey...
NIC
I'm sorry guys, but I just can't,
with the fucking hemp milk and the
organic farming and heirloom
tomatoes.
(mocking-voice)
"Oh no, don't throw that in the
trash, no man, you gotta throw that
into the composting bin so the
fucking worms can shit all over it
and turn it into glorious multch
and we can all feel better about
ourselves." God! What a bunch of
bullshit!
Nic takes a big swallow from her glass.
Jules windshield
wipes Nic's forearm.
66.
JULES
(sotto)
How about some green tea, honey...
Nic slams her glass on the table.
Explodes.
NIC
You know what, Jules?! I like my
wine! Okay? So fucking sue me!
And fyi, red wine has a chemical
called Resveratrol in it, which has
been proven to significantly extend
human lifespan!
JULES
Yeah, if you drink a thousand
bottles a day!
NIC
Fuck you.
Nic storms off.
Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen.
JULES
I'm sorry.
80
80
Jules walks over to the bar. Nic is sitting in the corner.
JULES
What the hell is going on with you?
NIC
This whole Paul thing is driving me
crazy! I feel like he's taking
over my family.
Jules tries to bring it down.
She yells in hushed tones.
JULES
No. He's not!
NIC
(nerves fraying)
Okay! Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm just
exhausted...
JULES
Maybe you need to take some time
off and recharge.
67.
NIC
(self-pitying)
Sure, and who's gonna pay for that?
Jules looks pissed off, and hurt.
NIC (CONT'D)
Look, I'm sorry, I just feel like
I'm carrying the whole load here.
JULES
Because that's the way you like it!
That's the way you keep control!
This is Jules' break-point.
NIC
What are you talking about?
JULES
Oh come on! You hated it when I
worked! You wanted me at home,
taking care of the kids. You
wanted a wife!
NIC
That is just not true!
JULES
You didn't trust any of those
nannies! And you sure as hell
didn't back my career!
NIC
What are you talking about? I just
helped you start another business!
JULES
Yeah, so you can feel better about
yourself!
NIC
No, so you can feel better about
yourself!
JULES
Are you even attracted to me
anymore?
The BARTENDER holds out the bottle of Cabernet.
BARTENDER
Do you still want this?
68.
NIC
No. Just the check please.
JULES AND PAUL
81
81
Fucking again in his bedroom. Jules writhes beneath him, her
eyes closed.
Paul seems to be in some kind of zone. He
stares at her, enthralled.
CUT TO:
POST - COITUS
82
82
Jules and Paul lie naked in the bed. Jules slithers around
the covers, stoned on post-coital endorphins.
JULES
God, I feel so drugular right now.
(sitting up quickly)
I really want a cigarette! Do you
have any? I haven't had a
cigarette since Laser was born. Do
you smoke?
PAUL
Sometimes. But I don't have any
here. Want me to run to the store?
JULES
(bouncing off the walls)
Yeah. Wait, no. Don't.
Sorry.
Jules pops up on her knees, getting in his face.
JULES (CONT'D)
Do you think I'm just like some sad-
sack middle-aged lesbian?
PAUL
God, that's it. I was trying to
figure out how to describe you to
my friends. Thank you.
Jules punches his arm, mock hurt. They start rough-housing.
Then kissing. Then the phone rings.
JULES
You want to get that?
PAUL
No. I want to get this...
69.
Paul grabs a handful of Jules' ass. Jules throws her leg
over Paul and climbs up for another round. Suddenly, Joni's
voice echoes through the machine.
JONI (ON MACHINE)
Hi Paul. It's Joni. I just wanted
to apologize for my friend, Sasha.
I was really embarrassed when she
put her hand on your--
Paul grabs the receiver.
PAUL
Hey, Joni.
I'm here...
Jules visibly recoils.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Listen, don't worry about your
friend.
Jules pales. She mouths: "What are you doing?!"
Paul
gesticulates: "I'm sorry!"
PAUL (CONT'D)
No. Honestly. I didn't even
notice...
Jules throws on her clothes and starts to leave.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Hey, Joni?
Can you hold on a
second?
Paul grabs Jules' wrist and mouths "wait!"
Jules rips her
arm free and walks out.
MOMENTS LATER - JULES
83
83
walks outside and is stunned to find Luis already back from
Home Depot, sneezing and wiping his nose.
JULES
Did you go to Home Depot?
LUIS
Yeah.
I just got back.
JULES
That was fast!
70.
LUIS
Yeah, no lines.
His look of confusion trips off her paranoia.
She's
convinced he knows everything.
JULES
What's that look?
LUIS
What look?
JULES
The look you're giving me right
now!
LUIS
That's no look.
That just my face.
JULES
Look, I'm not gonna play this game
with you! You need to keep your
judgements to yourself!
LUIS
Senora, I didn't give no looks!
JULES
I don't ask you why you keep
blowing your nose constantly! I
mean, if you have a drug problem
that's your business...
LUIS
I don't have no drug problem!
I have the allergies!
JULES
Then why are you a gardener?!
Luis stares at Jules, innocent.
LUIS
Cause I love the flowers.
JULES
Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll
pay you through the end of the day
and then we're done.
Jules walks past a totally confused Luis.
71.
84
84
Jules lies on her side. Nic shuffles to get to close to her.
Jules moves away, still pissed at her. Nic realizes she
needs to make amends.
85
85
The family sits in silence, having breakfast.
Nic looks
around the table, feeling like a pariah.
NIC
Look, I know you've all been
enjoying your time with Paul. And
I know I haven't been as open to
him as everyone else and this has
caused some...friction...between
us. But I'd like to try and change
that...
Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted.
"And...?"
NIC (CONT'D)
So I was thinking. Maybe it would
be nice if we all had dinner at his
house sometime. That way, I could
get to know him a little better,
and I could see all the good work
mom's been doing with his backyard.
Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods.
They
recognize this is a big step for Nic.
OMITTED
86
86
89
89
Paul and Jules lie in bed. Jules looks nauseated.
Paul
offers her a pack of smokes.
PAUL
I got you some cigarettes.
JULES
(ignoring him)
Jesus, what's wrong with me? I
shouldn't have fired Luis like
that. That was totally wrong...
PAUL
Come on. Don't be so hard on
yourself. Things get messy
sometimes...
JULES
That wasn't messy. That was fucked
up. I'm totally fucked up...
73.
PAUL
I think I'm really falling for you.
JULES
Paul, don't...
90

Jules takes a shower, washing off the evidence.
She looks
nauseated by her lack of willpower.
87
87
Tanya walks over to Paul who's on his computer. She flops on
the couch next to him. He doesn't look up.
TANYA
Pretty good night. That table had
like 5 bottles of wine.
PAUL
Wow.
Yeah. Good night.
TANYA
Joni's pretty. She's got some of
your genes.
PAUL
I think she looks more like her mom
actually. But thank you.
TANYA
It's cute seeing you in dad mode.
PAUL
Yeah?
TANYA
Yeah.
(lowering voice)
It makes me want to fuck you.
PAUL
(uncomfortable)
Oh yeah?...
TANYA
Yeah...
Tanya moves imperceptibly closer.
74.
TANYA (CONT'D)
I've been missing our sleep-overs.
Paul finally stops what he's doing.
PAUL
Yeah, it's been a while.
TANYA
You want to meet up later?
Paul hesitates.
He doesn't know how to say no.
PAUL
Tanya, you're so sexy and
beautiful, but I don't think we
should do that anymore.
Tanya's face drops.
TANYA
What happened?
PAUL
You know, our thing is really fun
and easy, but...I don't want to be
50 and still "hanging out." You
know? If I really want a family
then I have to stop getting in
these situations that don't go
anywhere.
Paul just looks at her.
Tanya gets it.
TANYA
(welling up)
Oh.
Paul knows enough to say nothing.
Tanya gets up and walks
off.
TANYA (CONT'D)
Fuck you.
Paul sits there, feeling like an asshole.
92
92
Paul gets dinner ready with Joni and Laser as his sous-chefs.
Both kids seem really jazzed to be cooking with him.
IN THE BACKYARD -EVENING
Jules tours Nic around the backyard, looking a little freaked
out as she shows her the work she's been doing.
JULES
I'm gonna do some planting over
there so it won't look so bare...
NIC
It looks great, honey. Very
indigenous. I'm so proud of you.
Nic kisses Jules spontaneously. Jules looks nauseous again.
They head back up the stairs, toward Paul's house.
NIC (CONT'D)
Hey, so how's that guy Luis working
out?
JULES
Oh, I had to fire him.
NIC
(surprised)
Really?!
JULES
Yeah, he had a drug problem.
NIC
Whoa.
What kind of drugs?
JULES
Blow, I think...
93
93
Nic flips through Paul's album collection, including Joni
Mitchell's Blue.
94
94
Everyone digs into the meal, enjoying themselves.
Especially
Nic, who's committed to redeeming herself.
76.
PAUL
Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love
this `98 Screaming Eagle.
NIC
You know what, I think I'm gonna
stick with water tonight. But
thank you so much.
The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first.
NIC (CONT'D)
God, Paul, this steak is delicious.
What's the seasoning?
PAUL
I just mist it with a little
truffle oil.
Nic looks at Jules and smiles in full overcompensation mode.
NIC
What a good idea. We should try
that. Right, honey?
JULES
(taken aback by Nic's
cheerfulness)
Mmm-hmmm.
NIC
And it's done to perfection.
PAUL
So it's not too rare?
NIC
No, it's perfect. Juicy. Tender.
Exactly what rare's supposed to be.
PAUL
Good. A lot of people in the
restaurant order a steak rare and
they freak out at the slightest
sight of red.
NIC
Ugh, isn't that annoying? That
happens to me all the time when I'm
grilling.
77.
PAUL
Don't people know that rare means
red?
NIC
Right?!
It means bloody!
PAUL
Exactly! They should see what rare
looks like in Argentina. The cow's
practically still mooing.
Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in.
Joni tries
to insert herself in the conversation.
JONI
I really want to go to Argentina.
Buenos Aires is supposed to be--
NIC
(interrupting)
...So Paul, I was checking out your
album collection over there. Quite
the eclectic mix...
PAUL
Thanks...
NIC
You don't meet too many straight
guys who love Joni Mitchell.
Joni glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog.
PAUL
Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan?
NIC
(smug)
Not really. We just named our
daughter after her.
PAUL
Cool. Right on...
NIC
What's your favorite Joni album?
PAUL
I think I have to go with "Blue."
Nic raises her hand in a testify.
78.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Yeah?
You too?
They high-five across the table.
NIC
Oh God, I probably spent half of
high school in my room crying to
that album. That record kills me.
PAUL
I know, it never lets up, you got
"River," "California..."
NIC
"A Case of You..."
PAUL
"All I Want.."
NIC
Mmm!!
Nic pulls her hands to her chest, shuts her eyes...and starts
to sing.
NIC (CONT'D)
I am on a lonely road and I am
traveling traveling, traveling,
traveling/Looking for something,
what can it be/Oh I hate you some,
I hate you some/I love you some Oh
I love you/when I forget about
me...
Jules, Paul and the kids watch, open-mouthed as Nic soldiers
on, skipping ahead to another verse.
NIC (CONT'D)
I want to talk to you/I want to
shampoo you/I want to renew you
again and again/Applause, applause/
Life is our cause/When I think of
your kisses/My mind see-saws...
Nic takes a breath. Just as Paul's about to say something,
Nic resumes her unfortunate solo.
NIC (CONT'D)
Do you see/do you see/do you see
how you hu-urt me baby/so I hurt
you too/then we both get/soo-ooo-
ooo blue...
79.
Nic stops, eyes still closed. She's connected to a part of
herself she rarely lets herself visit. The moment is
punctured by her smart-ass 15-year-old son.
LASER
Don't quit your day job, mom.
PAUL
Hey. It's hard enough to open your
heart in this world. Don't make it
harder.
LASER
You're right.
(to Nic; contrite)
I'm sorry, mom.
Nic looks at Paul.
Stunned.
Then looks at Jules and points
to Paul.
NIC
I like this guy.
Paul looks at Joni.
PAUL
You didn't tell me you were named
after Joni M.
JONI
It's just so dorky. I don't really
like to bring it up.
PAUL
I think it's cool.
NIC
(getting up)
Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom?
PAUL
Just around there.
On her way to the loo, Nic turns back to Paul.
NIC
You know what? I think I will try
some of that Screaming Eagle.

Nic washes her hands at the sink. Something catches her eye.
She lifts Paul's hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and
examines it. She reaches into the bristles and pulls out...
A few strands of long red hair.
Nic pales.
CUT TO
Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell-
tale red hair from the drain.
CUT TO
Nic skulks out of the bathroom.
She looks out and b-lines
for the bedroom.
CUT TO
Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed.
Her look tells us she's
found hair here as well.
THEN WE CUT TO
Nic sitting back down at the table. She looks drained.
Nobody notices. The sound drops out.
NIC'S POV:
Paul and Jules talking comfortably.
Joni and Laser chiming in, smiling, one big happy family.
REVERSE ONTO NIC:
Totally disconnected. Shell-shocked. She wants to scream
but it feels like she's trapped in cement. Things slow way
down...

Nic and Jules perform their nightly ablutions.
Jules is
sonic-caring her teeth.
81.
JULES
(through the sonic buzz)
Well, you and Paul seemed to get on
like gang-busters...
NIC
You're sleeping with him, aren't
you.
JULES
(freaked)
What?
Nic turns to her, eyes red with anger.
NIC
Just be honest with me. Don't make
me feel crazier than I feel right
now!
JULES
Where is this coming from?!
NIC
I found your hair in his drain!
JULES
(scrambling)
What? I was working.
I got dirty
so I took a shower.
NIC
Oh yeah?
You take a nap, too?
Jules pauses a second too long.
The jig is up.
98
98
The truth has come out.
Nic is so angry she's calm.
NIC
Are you in love with him?!
JULES
No!
NIC
What, are you straight now?!
JULES
No. It has nothing to do with
that!
(MORE)
82.
JULES (CONT'D)
(beat)
I've just felt so cut off from you
lately...
NIC
Oh, right, so it's my fault!
JULES
No! Who said anything about fault?
Just listen to me!
NIC
I'm listening!
What?!
JULES
I just needed...
NIC
What?
To be fucked?
JULES
No, appreciated!
NIC
It's always what I'm not doing for
you, isn't it? Well here's what I
don't to you. I don't work out my
issues by fucking other people!
Nic starts heading for the door.
Jules follows.
JULES
He's not just "other people!"
NIC
No, you had to go fuck our sperm
donor! You couldn't have picked a
more painful way to hurt me...
JULES
Where are you going?!
NIC
I need water! My mouth is dry!
Nic opens the door. There's Joni and Laser, looking
devastated. They've been listening to the whole thing.
99

Jules wakes up looking crusty from a rough night on the
couch. She looks like she hasn't slept at all.
83.

Jules enters and walks over to her sleeping son.
She gently
nudges him awake.
JULES
Hey Laser.
Honey?
Laser turns over, semi-conscious.
LASER
What?
She sits down on his bed.
JULES
Listen, I know you and Joni heard
what's going on. I just want you
to know that what happened with
Paul and me is over. There's
nothing going on now.
LASER
Okay.
JULES
I know you might need some time to
process your feelings around this,
but I just want you to know that
I'm here for you if you want to
talk about anything.
(beat)
Is there anything you want to talk
about?
LASER
(leave my room)
Not really.
JULES
(fighting the impulse to
push it)
Okay then. Go back to sleep.
Jules pats her son and leaves.
101
101
Jules enters and touches Joni's shoulder.
JULES
Joni?
84.
JONI
I don't want to talk to you.
JULES
Can we just--
JONI
I said I don't want to talk to
you!!
JULES
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Jules slowly retreats to the door.
102
102
Jules drinks coffee at the table. Nic walks in, dressed for
work. Jules looks at her, wanting to "process." But Nic
isn't in the mood. She grabs a banana from a bowl and walks
out. Jules feels like a leper.

We can tell Joni's been crying and downloading the whole
thing to Sasha.
SASHA
How's Nic doing?
JONI
She's a wreck. I've never seen her
like this before.
Joni's cell rings. She gets off the bed, looks at the phone.
It's a picture of Paul.
SASHA
Is it him...?
Joni nods gravely, answers.
JONI
(cold)
Hello.
85.
110
110
Jules walks in to find Nic, awake, in bed.
JULES
Just getting another pillow.
The
couch is kind of saggy.
NIC
Is your back okay?
Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again?
JULES
It's a little ache-y.
NIC
You should take some Advil.
Guess not.
Suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs.
89.
111
111
Jules walks downstairs to find Joni stumbling toward her
bedroom.
JULES
Hey.
How was the party?
Joni tries to avert her mom's questioning gaze.
JONI
Fine.
JULES
How big was it?
JONI
I don't know. Medium...ish...
Jules takes in the glassy look in her daughter's eyes.
JULES
Are you drunk?
JONI
No.
Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece.
NIC
I hope you had a designated driver.
JONI
Why?
I'm not drunk.
NIC
Well, you seem drunk to me.
JONI
Yeah, well, you should know.
NIC
(furious; incredulous)
What did you just say to me?!
JONI
I'm going to bed.
Joni starts to leave.
Nic grabs her.
NIC
No, you're not!
I'm not done
talking to you!
90.
Laser opens his door and watches the scene progress.
JONI
What do you want from me?! I did
everything you wanted! I got all
A's! I got in everywhere I applied!
Now you can show everybody what a
perfect family you have!
JULES
Don't talk to your mom like that!
Joni spins to face Jules.
JONI
You're really gonna tell me how to
act? Now?!
JULES
Hey, I'm still your mother.
JONI
Whatever...
Jules reaches out and Joni backs away, sickened.
JONI (CONT'D)
Don't touch me!
Joni heads for her room.
JONI (CONT'D)
I'm so sick of both of you!
113
113
Jules wakes up on the couch.
Sits up.
Rubs her aching back.
114
114
Joni packs for college. The room is littered with half-
filled packing boxes. She picks up a pile of clothes from
the corner and sees the farmer's hat Paul gave her. She puts
it aside, not sure what to do with it.
91.
116
116
The family has their last supper - before Joni leaves.
NIC
Did you pack that lamp I gave you?
JONI
Yeah.
NIC
Well, we can always get stuff up
there, too, if you need it, I mean
if the room's dark or you need
extra bedding...
JONI
I'm not going to Siberia, mom.
Jules looks at the family unit, misty.
JULES
I can't believe this is our last
dinner together.
LASER
Oh God, are you gonna cry?
Jules looks at her son, fed up.
JULES
I wish you were gay.
You'd be so
much more sensitive.
The doorbell rings.
JONI
It's probably Sasha.
I'll get it.
Joni runs to the door.
Opens it. It's not Sasha.
It's Paul.
JONI (CONT'D)
(shocked)
What are you doing here?
92.
PAUL
I needed to talk to you before you
left.
JONI
There's nothing to talk about.
PAUL
I just want to apologize again for
what happened. I can't tell you
how much I regret it.
118
118
Laser, Joni and Nic watch "Locked Up Abroad" Jules walks in
front of them, picks up the remote and turns off the TV.
JULES
I need to say something.
94.
Everyone sits up.
Jules acts stoic but she's wrecked.
JULES (CONT'D)
Look, it's no big secret your mom
and are in hell right now. Bottom
line...marriage is hard...really
fucking hard. Just two people,
slogging through the shit, year
after year, getting older,
changing. It's a fucking marathon,
okay?!
Everyone is silenced by the outpouring.
Jules soldiers on.
JULES (CONT'D)
So sometimes you're together so
long, you just stop seeing the
other person. You just see weird
projections of your own junk. And
instead of talking to each other,
you go off the rails, and act
grubby and make stupid choices.
Which is what I did. And I feel
sick about it because I love you
guys and I love your mom and that's
the truth. Sometimes you hurt the
ones you love the most. I don't
know why. Maybe if I read more
Russian novels I would...
Nic looks down, overwhelmed by it all.
JULES (CONT'D)
Anyway, I just wanted to say how
sorry I am about what I did and
that I hope you'll forgive me
eventually.
(awkward)
Thank you.
And, without further ado, Jules hands the remote back to
Laser and departs the field. Everyone's silenced by Jules'
rambling apologia, especially Nic.

Joni wakes up. She looks around her room. There's nothing
on the walls. The floor is covered with boxes taped and
labeled. It's time to go.
95.
122
122
The Allgoods are on the road, heading to college.

As they drive past buildings and dorms, Joni sees STUDENTS
swarming the campus. She takes it all in, nervous, excited.
Nic and Jules steal looks back at Joni, feeling her
nervousness, wishing they could take it away.
Nic and Jules follow Joni to the door.
They all jam up at
the threshold.
JONI
Guys, it's okay.
I got it.
Nic and Jules get the hint. They move back and Joni enters
the room alone. Nic and Jules quietly turn and leave.
96.

Joni stands among her bags and boxes looking around. She
goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens. She starts
making her bed but suddenly stops mid way. She stares out
toward the hallway.
Finally she moves to the doorway and looks out.
She realizes
her family isn't there.
130
130
The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the
passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back.
No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds.
Finally
Laser breaks the spell.
LASER
I don't think you guys should break
up.
A long beat.
NIC
No?
Why's that?
LASER
I think you're too old.
Both Nic and Jules crack smiles. Their son's rudeness is
unsurpassed. But then his words have an unexpected gravity.
98.
NIC
Thanks, Laser.
Jules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts
her hand on Nic's leg. She gives it a gentle squeeze and
doesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed.
Nic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight.
Nic and
Jules look at each other, and then away.
Laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat.
Their small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself,
grateful for a sign.
