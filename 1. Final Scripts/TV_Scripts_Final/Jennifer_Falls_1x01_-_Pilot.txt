                We have to let her go, Don.  Half of

      JENNIFER DANTE, (40S) ENTERS.  SHE HAS A LOT OF STRENGTHS.  
      SHE S BEAUTIFUL, SMART, SUCCESSFUL--  BUT ONE WEAKNESS: SHE 
      HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SICILIAN TEMPER.  WHICH CAN BE CHARMING 
      AND AMUSING.  AS LONG AS IT S NOT DIRECTED AT YOU.

                                  JENNIFER

                You wanted to see me, Don?

                in the past, that I sometimes speak my

                Hey, Bro, can you give me an advance 

                on my check?  Gretchen s kinda  bummed 

                and I told her I d take her clothes 

                  shopping.  Just like a hundred bucks.

                                  WAYNE

                You know what?  This feels good.  I 

                have to admit all those years you were 

                so successful it was hard being your 

                older brother.  It feels nice to have 

                some power.  Let me just check with 

                  Stephanie.

                Oh.  Well, there s no shame in that, 

                  Jennifer.

                It s a great opportunity to talk about 

                money management.  Now, I don t know 

                about you, but the way Wayne and I 

                manage our money is we don t spend 

                money we don t have.  

                                  JENNIFER

                I just needed to step away from your 

                wife for a minute because if I didn t 

                there was a very strong chance I would 

                stick an ice pick in her skull.  I 

                don t know about you guys, but the way 

                I manage my anger is, I stick an ice 

                pick in someone s skull.  Does that 

                make sense?"Epidode Title"26.


                                  WAYNE

                Uh, you re kinda  freaking me out.

                                  JENNIFER

                Oh, come on.  You don t actually think 

                I m going to stick an ice pick in your 

                wife s head on my first day of work.

                yells at me to leave him alone, then

                to do with my life.  God, remember 

                when we used to hang out in my 

                backyard and smoke cigarettes and talk 

                about boys and what we were going to 

                do with our lives?  I was going to be

                                  MAGGIE

                You need to be in therapy.  You have 

                anger issues.

                                  JENNIFER

                No.  When did you lose her?

                                  DINA

                Lose her?  She s healthy as a horse now.  

                Running triathlons.  It s too late to 

                visit her in the hospital.  (THEN)  What 

                happened to you, Jennifer?   

                                  JENNIFER

                I don t know.  I started making all 

                this money and I thought everything 

                would be great but after a while I 

                didn t know what I was doing anymore 

                or who I was.  People say I have anger 

                issues but I don t feel angry inside, 

                I just feel scared.  And I don t think 

                I like myself much.

                                  DINA

                Yeah, well that I get.

      JENNIFER STARTS TO REACT BUT SEES DINA GRIN A LITTLE.  A RAY 
      OF SUNSHINE?

                                  JENNIFER

                Look, Dina, I can t change the past but I 

                can change the future.  Well, I can t 

                change the future.  Nobody can.  The 

                future hasn t happened yet.  Forget the 

                future.  I really just want to go back to 

                the way things were.  We used to have 

                fun.  Remember?

                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                And I can t throw money at you.  I don t 

                have any money.  Can t you give me 

                another chance?

                                  DINA

                I don t know.

                                  JENNIFER

                You have to.  I need you.  And I will 

                totally be there for you whenever you 

                need me.  I promise.

                                  DINA

                It s not that easy, Jennifer.

                                  JENNIFER

                You have to forgive me or I ll do 

                  something crazy.  I ll, I ll tell your 

                team you hate Birkenstocks.

                                  DINA

                (LAUGHS)  Shut up.  Don t even kid 

                like that.  (THEN)  Okay, okay.  One 

                more chance.

                                  JENNIFER

                Yes!  (HUGS HER)  I love you, Dina.

      OVER DINA S SHOULDER JENNIFER SEES DINA S TEAMMATE SANDY 
      SMILING AT HER AND GIVING HER THE THUMBS UP.  AFTER HER 
      MOMENT WITH DINA, JENNIFER CROSSES BACK TO THE BAR TO FIND 
      ETHAN SITTING THERE.

                  (CONSIDERS)  No.  No, I work here now.

                                  ETHAN

                Cool.  Can I see a foam list?

                Hey, I ve got it down now.  Watch.

      SHE POURS A PERFECT GLASS OF BEER.

                                  ETHAN

                Very nice.

                                  JENNIFER

                Wait, I ve always wanted to do this.

      SHE SLIDES IT DOWN THE BAR TO HIM BUT HE S REACHING FOR HIS 
      WALLET AND IT FLIES RIGHT BY HIM AND OFF THE END OF THE BAR.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)

                (BEAT)  Pretty good, huh?

                                  ETHAN

                You really are a natural.

      SHE POURS HIM ANOTHER ONE.

                                  JENNIFER

                I ll just hand you this one.

                                  ETHAN

                No.  (PUTS HIS HAND OUT)  Come on.

      SHE TRIES AGAIN AND HE CATCHES IT.  THEY SHARE A SMILE.

                Okay, for a long time you ve been mad 

                at me for not paying enough attention 

                to you and I ve felt guilty about it 

                and bought you a lot of crap you don t 

                need.  Well, that s over.  If I m 

                going to be poor, the least I can do

                house drinking beers that we didn t 

                swipe from her.

                No, I swiped them.  I m totally broke. 

                Hey, you know what I have?

      SHE LOOKS AROUND THEN PULLS OUT TWO CIGARETTES.

                How did I get so angry?
