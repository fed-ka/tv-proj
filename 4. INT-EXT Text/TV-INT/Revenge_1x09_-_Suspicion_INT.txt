  we begin work on the first season of this very exciting program, we would 

  like to emphasize that any disclosure of such confidential information to

  areas or leaving scripts lying around unattended. As it is imperative that 

  we maintain the confidentiality of such information, ABC Studios will 

  investigate any unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and any

                    Lydia? What on earth? The doctor 
                    was very specific about keeping you

      Victoria brings a tray of food in for Lydia. Sets it on the 
      end table. 

                                  VICTORIA

                    Well, you have to eat eventually. 
                    You don t want to be stuck here 
                    forever, do you? How about a book 
                    to read?

      Victoria pulls a book out of a drawer, it s DR. BANK S SIGNED 
      COPY OF HER SELF-HELP BOOK. Victoria sets it on the table 
      next to the re-framed black and white photograph of herself 
      and Lydia at the New Year s 2003 celebration.

                      Victoria... You don t have to keep 
                    doing this. I remember what happened 
                    the night of the benefit.

                      I remember you told me that you d 
                    never accept me. That your hatred 
                    ran deeper than any apology I could

                    And I don t blame you. I ve been a

                    for betraying you is part of the

      Victoria exits Lydia s room to find A MAID allowing DETECTIVE 
      GUNTHER and a team of POLICE INVESTIGATORS into the house. 
      Victoria shuts Lydia s doors tightly behind her. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Detective Gunther? What is all this?

                                  DETECTIVE GUNTHER
                    There s been a development in the 
                    Frank Stevens case. We have a 
                    warrant to search your home.

      Victoria takes the warrant, rattled. As the police disperse 
      with GPS trackers, Victoria stands guard by Lydia s door.

                                  VICTORIA
                    A friend is convalescing in there. I

                    We won t if we don t have to. Cell 
                    tower picked up Frank Stevens  phone 
                    signal late last night. GPS tracked 
                    it to inside your property lines.

                                  VICTORIA
                    That doesn t make any sense. The 
                    last call Frank made to me was 
                      definitely not from inside this 
                    house.

                                  DETECTIVE GUNTHER
                    You re right, near as we can tell, 
                    his last call was placed near a 
                      gentlemen s club about a four and a 
                    half hour drive from here.
                          (off Victoria, baffled)
                    Mrs. Grayson, we know that you and 
                    Mr. Stevens had regular contact. We 
                    also know that your husband 
                    abruptly fired Mr. Stevens shortly 
                    before checking into a hotel the 
                    night of the murder. Would you 
                      characterize Mr. Grayson as a 
                    jealous man? 

      As Victoria processes that, a UNIFORMED COP approaches.

                                  UNIFORMED COP 
                    Sir, I think we found the phone...

                    a killer bod. Pun intended.

                    whatever you have to say to keep him 
                    away from her. He s already been

      As they disconnect, we STAY WITH EMILY at the game just as a 
      PLAYER on Daniel s team sets up a lob. Daniel smashes the 
      ball right past Tyler, who misses it.

      As Daniel is slapped high fives by his team mates, he passes 
      Tyler under the net, goes for a hand shake. Tyler declines 
      the gesture. Daniel shrugs, looks to see if Emily saw his 
      win. Instead, he sees her leaving. 


      Conrad sits at a table with Daniel (both dressed nice, but 
      casual) as Tyler approaches, also casual. Sits.

                    morning s volleyball tournament. 

                                  TYLER
                    Not my best showing, I m afraid. Of 
                    course, Daniel practically grew up 
                    on that stretch of sand.

                    A little friendly competition is

                                  TYLER
                    That s quite an opportunity, sir. 
                    And you ve made the job easy, your 
                    firm s returns doubled the market 
                    averages last year.

                    That s something my guests are 
                    already aware of. This weekend s 
                    not about pushing stocks, bonds or 
                    rates of return. We re selling the 
                    Grayson lifestyle. So it seems once 
                    again, Daniel may have a slight 
                    built in advantage.

                    Amanda got to know you. She s a

                    keep this from her.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I wish I could, but I still haven t 
                    told Daniel I m leaving his father, 
                    so... I m afraid we ll have to keep 
                    this a secret just a little while 
                    longer.

      And OFF Victoria, knowing that it s only a matter of days...


      Victoria snaps back. Emily eyes her, so sincerely -- 

                                  EMILY
                    Victoria, I m glad we had this 
                    talk. I d like to make things right 
                    between us. Especially since 
                    there s a chance we could be family 
                    someday.

      That thought sickens Victoria, she exits. Off Emily, very 
      aware she s turning the knife even deeper.

      Emily pours a glass of wine as Daniel unpacks groceries.

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry, Detective Gunther asked me 
                    to go down and give a written statement 
                    about the night Frank was killed. I 
                    didn t want to ruin your fun.

                    They need me to vouch for your 
                      whereabouts?

                                  EMILY
                    I don t think so. But thanks. Seems 
                    they ve moved on to other suspects.

                                  DANIEL
                    The fact that they even suspected 
                    you at all... I don t think I ll 
                    ever forgive my mother for putting 
                    you through that.

      Emily hands Daniel a glass of sparkling water.

                    She came by this afternoon.

                                  DANIEL

                                  EMILY
                    It might have to be. If you and I

                    can t continue to let her hold this

                    Which is what? 

                                  EMILY
                    To separate you from anyone who

                    to forgive her.

      Tyler hands Nolan his credit card. Nolan glares.

                                  TYLER
                    Thanks for the use of your card. A

                                  NOLAN
                    So do his actions. By my estimation, 
                    that makes you a common thief.

                                  TYLER
                    Then by the same logic, it also 
                    makes you a liar. You said you 
                    wanted to help me up the ladder. 

                                  NOLAN
                    You don t want to play this game 
                    with me, Ty. Or can it be that you 
                    actually think I m as stupid as the

                    thought we had a mutually 
                      beneficial thing going here. You

      towards the foyer and Lydia s bedroom...


      Victoria enters to find Lydia in the dim light. She seems a 
      little out of it. Victoria goes to the bedside, picks up a 
      bottle of sedatives, next to a host of new meds. Lydia stirs.

                    haven t noticed, she wants you 
                    gone. And when Emily wants someone 
                    gone, trust me, they go. Usually in

                    wants me gone, she might want to 
                    consider the ripple effect. 

      Amanda walks away, touches Jack s shoulder in the crowd.

                    Told you friend, she s a nomad. I m 
                    outta here.

      Nolan rises. Just as he is about to head out through one 
      door, he notices VICTORIA entering from the other end. 

                                  NOLAN (CONT D)
                    What d you put in my drink?

                    Oh boy... 

      Nolan skulks off to the side, and out the door -- 

                                  VICTORIA

                    Then I believe you also know my

                    Upstairs. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    If it s all right I d like to have

      Victoria heads for the stairs. OFF Jack, WTF?

                    Uh... sure. 


      Declan, whistling, exits the bathroom in a towel, then nearly 
      jumps out of his skin when he sees Victoria standing there.

      He grabs a t-shirt and yanks it on, clutches the towel.

      Nolan attaches the WHALE CAM to his laptop. Opens a video 
      file of Tyler at Nolan s computer from earlier. Nolan looks 
      closer. Trying to make out what Tyler has in his hand. Nolan 
      clicks to enhance the image and turns it clockwise. Zooms in 
      on the fractured text and struggles to read:

      Conrad enters, dressed for the cocktail party. A JAZZ TRIO 
      tunes up, piano, bass, and drums. A MAID exits Lydia s room 
      with a half filled water pitcher. She goes to lock the door 
      behind her, but Conrad stops her. 


      He enters, finds Lydia on the bed. The bed stand filled with 
        prescription bottles...

                                  CONRAD
                    Lydia?...

                                  LYDIA
                          (turns, alert)
                    Conrad, where the hell have you 
                    been? Victoria s been keeping me 
                    locked up in here like a prisoner. 

                                  CONRAD
                    Why didn t you call me? 

                                  LYDIA
                    Because that witch took my phone. She s 
                    been feeding me pills. I think she s 
                    planning to finish what Frank started. 

                                  CONRAD
                    What do you mean?

                                  LYDIA
                    You can drop the charade. I heard 
                    you arguing at the front door the 
                    night she changed the locks. You 
                    said she sent Frank to kill me. 

                                  CONRAD
                    That s not exactly what I said. 
                    Frank may have been acting on his 
                    own impulses.

                                  LYDIA
                    But you don t know for sure. 
                          (true, he doesn t...)
                    Just find the damn wheel chair and 
                    get me the hell out of here. 


      The party is in full swing. The jazz trio vamps in the foyer. 
      A rainbow of INVESTORS mingle. SERVERS bring champagne and 
      hors d oeuvres. Tyler chats up a TYCOON. Across the room, 
      Daniel talks to a Japanese business man, SATOSHI TAKEDA, 
      communicating through his beautiful young translator, HIKARI.

                                  DANIEL
                    My parents took me to Disneyland *
                    Tokyo when I was little. I ve been *
                    wanting to go back ever since. *
                    Tokyo. Not Disneyland.*

      As Hikari translates to Satoshi, Emily steps up.

                                  EMILY
                    Sorry I m late.

                          (the cavalry)*
                    No, you re just in time. I want to *
                    introduce you to Satoshi Takeda. *
                    Mr. Takeda is the CEO of Japan s *

                    This is my girlfriend, Emily Thorne.*

      Hikari translates. Satoshi responds in Japanese.

                                  HIKARI
                    He says,  You are a lucky man. She 
                    is very beautiful.

                    Thank you. It s a pleasure to meet *
                    both of you. 

      Hikari and Satoshi are impressed. So is Daniel. 

                                  DANIEL
                    I learn something new about you

      Satoshi speaks directly to Emily in Japanese.          REVENGE EP 109 "SUSPICION" 2ND Blue ProdDraft  10/21/11 36.

                    Hai.

                                  DANIEL
                    What did he say?

                                  EMILY
                    He said he s tired of using his 
                      translator so he wants me to join 
                    him for a drink and explain why I 
                    speak Japanese so well.

                                  DANIEL
                    By all means. *
                          (to Satoshi)*
                    She s a woman of many surprises.*

      Hikari translates. Satoshi nods to Daniel, offers his arm to *
      Emily. She takes it and they stroll away. *

      WE PICK UP EMILY AND SATOSHI IN A PRIVATE AREA-- out of *
      earshot of Daniel and the other guests...*

                                  EMILY
                          (in Japanese)
                    Thank you for coming. I fear I may *
                    have lost control.*

      Emily catches sight of Victoria making her entrance down the 
      grand staircase. Satoshi clocks Emily s face, then Victoria.

      Nolan and Tyler are alone. Nolan holds all the cards.

                    Perfect. You won t regret it.

      Through the window, Nolan sees someone approaching, so -- 

                                  NOLAN
                    Hello? A little thank you?

      Tyler realizes, goes to him. Puts on a smile.

                                  TYLER
                    Of course. Twenty million of them.

      Tyler plants a big kiss on Nolan. CRASH. Two full martinis 
      drop to the floor and shatter simultaneously.

                                  ASHLEY (O.C.)
                    Oh my god. 

      They turn to find Ashley standing in the entrance, empty 
      handed. Busted. Nolan waves and grins.

                                  NOLAN
                    Hey Ash, love the dress. 

      Ashley is dumbfounded. She gasps, then hurries out.

                                  TYLER
                    Ashley, wait! 

      Tyler follows after her. Once he s gone, Nolan quickly finds 
      the pants Tyler was wearing at his house. Nolan reaches in 
      the pockets and finds the taped together SPEECH. Bingo.


      Tyler catches up to Ashley as she hustles through the party. *

      She takes a breath, Tyler s words ringing in her head.

                                  ASHLEY
                    Why did you hire me? You re having 
                    far fewer parties than last year, 
                    and you ve basically made me your 
                    personal assistant, so... I m just 
                    curious. 

      Ashley s tone is surprising. Alone as she is now, Victoria 
      knows she can use an ally. She turns around to face Ashley --

                                  VICTORIA
                    All right then. I hired you because 
                    you re close to Emily. 

                                  ASHLEY
                    Well... as close as anyone can be 
                    to a person like her.           REVENGE EP 109 "SUSPICION" 2ND Blue ProdDraft  10/21/11 46.


                                  VICTORIA
                    I see. Were you surprised that she 
                    and Daniel moved in so quickly?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Not entirely. She knows how to get 
                    what she wants.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What do you mean by that?

                                  ASHLEY
                    Just that she can be... tricky.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Let s go out for brunch tomorrow 
                    and discuss this further. 

                                  ASHLEY
                    I ll make us a reservation... 
                    Victoria. 

      Victoria raises an eyebrow. It s the first time Ashley hasn t 
      called her  Mrs. Grayson.  Victoria smiles. Maybe she s not 
      entirely alone after all.


      Home from the party, Emily puts Lydia s SPEECH into the 
      INFINITY BOX. Lifts the floorboard, hides the box. Just as 
      she puts everything back in place, Daniel arrives home, sees 
      her still on her hands and knees. 

                                  DANIEL
                    Lose something?

                    No, Tyler did great. How does a guy

                    He got lucky, that s all...

                                  DANIEL
                    Or maybe he s just better at this 
                    than I am. You coming up?

                    At least things are better with 
                    your mom, right?

                                  DANIEL
                    For now.

      Daniel goes upstairs. Once he s gone, Emily walks over to the 
      door. SHUTS THE DOWNSTAIRS LIGHTS OFF. But a KNOCK at the 
      front door stops her. She answers. To her surprise...


      Jack stands on the porch. Emily steps out.

                                  JACK
                    Hey. Sorry to come by so late. 

                                  EMILY
                    Something wrong?

                                  JACK
                    Not at all. Everything s great. Remember 
                    when I told you about the girl who used 
                    to live in this house with her father?

      Emily notices Amanda standing at the end of the porch. She 
      has to do her best to keep her composure.

                                  EMILY
                    Yes. Of course...

                                  JACK
                    Well, that friend from Nolan s pool? 
                    She s that girl. Only she doesn t want 
                    anyone to know. Her dad wasn t exactly 
                    popular around here. Especially with 
                    your neighbors. I told her she could 
                    trust you. You mind if I show her the 
                    swing her father built? 

      Emily is floored. Barely able to speak.

                          (waves her over)
                    Emily, this is Amanda. A very 
                    close, old friend of mine.

                                  EMILY
                    Nice to see you again, Amanda.

                                  AMANDA
                    Jack has the nicest things to say 
                    about you. I m happy my house is in 
                    good hands. It was a very special 
                    place for me and my father.

      SLOW MO -- Emily notices as Jack grabs hold of Amanda s hand.

                    It s good to be home. 

      As Jack walks Amanda over to the swing, Emily burns.


      Teen Emily stands by the door with Teen Amanda, who is packed 
      and about to leave. Tears in both their eyes. A far cry from 
      the place they find themselves today.

                                  EMILY
                    Take care of yourself. And thank 
                    you again for doing this.

                    I d do anything for you... 

      Amanda and Emily hug. Tightly. Like sisters.

                    Stay strong. Amanda.

                    You too, Emily.

      Emily smiles. Amanda exits. Emily, alone, shuts the door, 
      wipes her eyes. This is it, she s really on her own. Alone.

      Victoria comes down the stairs, enters Conrad s office. 
      Through the windows she can see the ominous darkness of the

      As she faces into the room and sips, her eyes fall on a half-
      open drawer. Curious, she moves closer and looks inside:

      sets her drink down and picks up the wallet. Slowly walks 
      towards the center of the room as she opens the wallet, 
      somehow knowing exactly what she s about to see: Frank 
      Stevens  driver s license, smeared with traces of his blood. 
      She stares at the face of the second man who s dead because 
      of her... Starts to tremble. She lifts her eyes and gazes out 
      to the darkness of the patio, the wind begins whipping the 
      trees as a summer storm approaches, thunder rolling in the 
      distance. And off Victoria, eyes wide, alone and unsettled:
