      Beckett and Castle head up to the front door. A man, late 
      50s, comes chasing two little girls, BELA, 8, and SIMONE, 6, 
      around from the back of the house. We notice he has a slight 
      limp. This is Melanie s father, BEN DAVIDSON.

                    Those must be the daughters.

      Ben lets out a huge Jurassic ROAR to the scary delight of his

      The storage facility is an old printing warehouse along the 
      Westside Highway near the river. Esposito and Ryan approach
