STREETS #1 -- NIGHT
A TAXI pulls UP with a SCREECH.
VANITY
slouches in the backseat.
Black
boots,
black skin-tight pants, and a mane of
thick, black hair presents a beautiful
and imposing
figure. Her eyes are
large and dark -- her look open and
ripe.
She knows what she's got, and
doesn't make any excuses for it -- but
the fact is she's scared as hell,
possessing a
vulnerability that
surprises her by its suddenness.
An
expensive gold chain is fastened on one
boot.
She scrounges through her bag -- pulls
out her remaining cash. It's drastically
short of what she owes and she knows it.
She tosses it onto the front seat,
JUMPS from the cab, streaks across the
street.
The CABBIE lets out a YELL and
JUMPS out after her.
"Let's Get
Crazy" continues as we ...
CUT TO:
CORNER,
STREETS
#1 -- NIGHT
A POLICE CAR, lights FLASHING, sits at
the curb.
A small CROWD has rathered
about.
The Cabbie stands on the
sidewalk gesticulating angrily to a COP.
Vanity stands by the police car,
obviously board, another COP by her
side.
Her eyes are fastened on a good-
looking BUSINESSMAN standing nearby...
A silent negotiation seems to be going
on.
Understanding wafts between them
like a passing breeze.
Without taking his eyes off her, the
Businessman approaches the Cabbie,
starts talking ...
"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...
CUT TO:
CLUB (1ST AVE.
ST.
BAR) -- NIGHT
The STREETS are swollen with TRAFFIC.
KIDS are packed onto the sidewalk,
waiting to get into the club. Prince,
riding his MOTORCYCLE, weaves between
jammed cars, then blasts down a narrow
alley leading to the rear entrance.
His
guitar is slung across his back.
He
chains up his bike, moves past a CROWD
of KIDS, cuts inside.
'Let's Get Crazy" continues as we ...
CUT TO:
STREETS #2 -- NIGHT
A SEVILLE sweeps to a stop.
The
Businessman is at the wheel. Vanity
steps from the car languidly and offers
a curt wave goodbye.
The car pulls
away.
She stands serenely a moment as the CAR
twists around the corner.
She grabs
her bag, rushes into a dark alley.
She
pulls a handful of CASH from her pocket,
counts through it quickly.
'Let's Get Crazy" -continues as we ...
CUT TO:
MORRIS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT
The DOOR opens -- Morris steps
confidently into the night. The change
in his appearance is breathtaking. A
cashmere coat is draped over his
shoulders, a white scarf hangs loosely
about his neck.
Wearing a sharp,
gangster-style suit, his hair is a
pompadour, and Stacy Adams on his feet -
- Morris is the very picture of
elegance.
He doesn't just walk to the
curb, he slides -- his promenade
punctuated with a dip at the knees you
could snap your fingers to.
JEROME is at the curb, buffing down the
bumper of a yellow, 1970 Fleetwood
Cadillac.
Jerome is solidly built,
smooth-faced handsome with a boyish
charm all his own.
He's a member of The
Time, and acts as Morris' chauffeur,
valet, and all-purpose shadow.
He moves quickly to the door, holds it
open as Morris settles himself into the
backseat. He closes it with a flair,
hops behind the wheel, pulls out.
'Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...
CUT TO:
CLUB -- NIGHT (VANITY'S POV)
... KIDS are crowded in front of the
CLUB.
A YELLOW CADDY SCREECHES up in
front.
TRAFFIC is jammed all around.
The night is electric -- the scene
beckons ...
CLUB (1st AVE.
ST.
BAR) -- NIGHT
Jerome opens the door of the CADDY,
helps Morris out.
The CROWD recognizes
them immediately, rushes in for a closer
look.
Morris loves the attention,
plays to their enthusiasm with a relish.
Jerome snaps a comb into his hand, holds
up a pocket mirror ...
Morris combs his hair dramatically, the
Crowd encouraging him on.
Jerome gives
him the OK sign, ushers him into the
club.
"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...
CUT TO:
CLUB -- NIGHT
COMMOTION! The CROWD has become
unwieldly -- TRAFFIC is snarled all
around.
HORNS are BLARING.
COPS try
desperately to ward off the inevitable
grid lock.
Vanity runs against the light, moves to
the head of the queue to the
accompaniment of JEERS and CATCALLS.
She doesn't budge an inch, KNOCKS
rapidly on the glass door, catching the
attention of CHICK, a burly, 6'5", 285
pound bouncer with a white beard and
long flowing hair.
An ex-Marine,
Chick's function is obvious.
He cracks
the door--
CHICK
What?
VANITY
I have an appointment with the
manager.
CHICK
No you don't -- he doesn't see
anybody.
Suddenly a FIGHT breaks out at the
INSIDE MONEY WINDOW.
Chick spins
instantly, SLAMS the door -- but Vanity
jams her boot into the narrow space.
The door crashes against her instep, she
winces in pain --but Chick doesn't
notice.
He's already upon the
OFFENDERS,
heaving them against the
wall.
Vanity streaks inside, blazes up the
stairway, ducks behind a GROUP of
GIRLS...
CHICK turns instantly -- the door is
closed -- VANITY, gone.
His eyes dart
up the stairway -- nothing.
He shrugs,
drags the Two Guys off.
CLUB -- NIGHT
FRANTIC!
The STREETS are thick with
TRAFFIC.
She scans them wildly --
nothing.
Suddenly Prince, astride his
motorcycle, BLAZES past her from the
opposite direction.
She starts running,
shouts--
VANITY
Hey
wait!
But Prince is too far away, the traffic
too coneested for him to hear.
He whips
down the street, disappears around the
corner.
Vanity continues running, then slows,
dejection overcoming her in waves.
She
looks around -- KIDS are staring at her,
passing
jokes.
Embarrassed, She moves
to the front door but Chick is there,
his eyes upon her cold, impassionate.
Exhausted and slighlty tearlul, she cuts
across the street, heads back to her
apartment.
Prince WHIPS down the street, cuts his
motor, coasts up the drive. He comes to
a stop against a wooden gate.
His house
is a nondescript, one-family structure
with a wide front porch.
He lives in a
neat and tidy, homogeneous, lower middle-
class neighborhood whose occupants are
hard-working type fiercely protective of
their privacy.
He climbs the steps to the porch, opens
the front door...
...his mothers SCREAM is like ice in his
veins.
Fear trickles into the hollows
of his body like cold water,
His pain
commands him to move, but the impulse
short circuits somewhere at the waist,
leaving his legs twitching
uncontrollably.
Then another SCREAM
from his mother, and his father's voice
now, LOUD and FURIOUS--
FATHER (O.S.)
Listen to me!
You come home
when I say come home!
You've
got no business in the
streets!
WHACK!
His mother SCREAMS -- Prince
BURSTS into the room.
STREETS AND ALLEY -- DOWNTOWN -- DAY
Morris and Jerome move briskIy down the
sidewalk--
MORRIS
This just ain't happening. The
bitches are okay, but we need
something more exciting-
JEROME
You're right.
We could be
doing much better.
Any ideas?
MORRIS
That powder fine babe we saw
last night.
JEROME
Oooh, yeee! -- Why don't we
find out who she is?
Morris snaps an address in front of his
face--
MORRIS
I already know that.
Jill
gave me everything last night.
Whawhak!
JEROME
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go!
MORRIS
No, no -- that ain't classy
enough.
I want the bitch to
come to me -- I'm the only
star in this town.
Suddenly
a BEAUTIFUL BABE lunges into
the sidewalk from the alley--
BABE
(yelling)
Morris Day, who do you think
you are?!
I waited up all
night for you.
I'm so tired
of you doing that
to me. You
think you're so hot?
You're
nothing special.
This is the
third time you pulled that
shit.
Who the fuck do you
think I am?!
MORRIS
Jerome!
Jerome puts the girl in a headlock,
DRAGS her into the alley--
BABE
(screaming)
Leave me alone you ape! --
What are you doing to me?!
Morris!!
He flings her into the dumpster, SLAMS
the lid with a CRASH.
Morris pats his
brow--
MORRIS
Lo-rd..!
Such nastiness.
(a beat)
Hee, hee -- Let's break.
They streak across the street, double-
time it to the CADDY.
A COP sweeps by,
gives them a curious look.
Morris puts
on a dignified air, then stops,
stupified--
MORRIS
Jerome, this car --
it's...it's lacking something.
What do you think?
JEROME
Hmm... I don't know...
MORRIS
I got it!
The hubcaps.
We
need something sweeter.
JEROME
I think I know what it needs.
Morris is pondering his Stacy Adams--
MORRIS
Yeah ... I know what these
need.
AFTERNOON
The SIDEWALKS are alive with bustling
SHOPPERS.
Vanity walks aimlessly past
store windows, staring longingly at the
expensive items.
BRIDAL SHOP
as she stops suddenly and stares
transfixed.
A YOUNG WOMAN, startingly
similiar to her in looks and coloring,
tries on a beautiful bridal gown as a
SEAMSTRESS adjusts the hem.
The entire
scene is warm and endearing.
Vanity is
struck by lt's beauty and seems to sigh.
The Young Woman looks up suddenly,
catches Vanity's gaze, and gives her an
affectionate smile.
Vanity smiles back
avidly, then--
PRINCE (0.
S .)
Give me that.
She looks up startled--
PRINCE
There ... on your boot.
She looks
down -- it's the expensive
gold chain.
She hesitates, then hands
it to him.
He drops it into his pocket,
walks away--
VANITY
Hey, wait!
She runs after him--
VANITY
Give it back to mel
He continues to walk briskly -- she
starts pulling on his coat--
PRINCE
You can have it back later.
VANITY
I want it back now, okay?
PRINCE
Who gave it to you?
VANITY
A person
PRINCE
Female or male?
VANITY
Huh ...
PRINCE
You're lying.
I can tell just
by your reaction that you're
lying.
He moves away briskly -- Vanity stands
her ground, amused--
PRINCE
So you gave it to me -- it's
not yours anymore.
He stops short -- something has caught
his eye.
She's curious, comes up behind
him, then--
VANITY
You see something you like?
He puts on his sunglasses.
A GUITAR
stands prominently in the window.
PRINCE
Let's go for a ride.
He flips her the gold chain' -- turns
hastily.
She weighs it in her hand,
studies the guitar--
VANITY
It's pretty.
HIGHWAY -- DUSK
Prince and Vanity on his MOTORCYCLE
blazing down the HIGHWAY, twisting
through TRAFFIC.
The CITY is behind
them, receding into the distance.
(29) Ext. COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK
They pull off an access road, drop down
a small embankment, ride down a narrow,
dirt road.
LAKESIDE
The pull to a stop.
A LAKE stretches
before them.
Vanity gets off the bike,
walks around exploring, casting curious
glances at Prince.
He stands by the
water, idly tossing stones--
VANITY
My psychic told rne I was
going to be famous.
PRINCE
How much did that cost you?
VANITY
Fifty bucks.
It was a good
investment.
He doesn't respond -- she suddenly feels
shy--
VANITY
No seriously -- My psychic did
tell me.
I was in a play
once.
PRINCE
Oh, yeah -- what did you play?
VANITY
Isadora Duncan...
She stretches her arms like a butterfly,
does a little step--
VANITY
That means I can sing and
dance.
(a beat)
Want to help me?
PRINCE
(swiftly)
Nope.
VANITY
(surprised)
Pardon me?
PRINCE
Nope.
She's Perplexed--
PRINCE
Want to know why?
VANITY
(defensively)
Nope.
PRINCE
(a beat)
Because you wouldn't pass the
initiation.
VANITY
What initiation?
PRINCE
Well, for starters ycu have to
purify yourself in the waters
of Lake Minnetonka.
VANITY
What?
PRINCE
You have to purify yourself in
Lake Minnetonka.
Her brow furrows, she looks out across
the lake.
He's calmly throwing stones.
Recognizing a challenge when she sees
one, she formulates a plan, faces him
seductively, shoots him an open look.
He stops suddenly, locks eyes with her,
feels his knees go weak.
Her hold on
him is unmistakable.
She pulls off her
blouse in one fluid motion, tugs off her
boots, drops her pants to the ground.
She's exquisite, takes a step toward
him.
Passion rings in his veins ...
Suddenly she turns on her
heels, moves
purposefully toward the water.
He's
shocked,
realizes that she's about to
go in--
PRINCE
Hey, wait a minute! Thats--
But she silences him savagely--
VANITY
We made a deal!
And before he can react she scampers
along a log, DIVES beneath the surface.
He can't believe it -- her spirit really
impresses him.
She breaks the surface
coughing and sputtering, hops and jumps
to the shore--
PRINCE
Hold it.
VANITY
What?
PRINCE
That ain't Lake Minnetonka.
He tries to keep a straight face, jumps
on his motorcvcle, STARTS it up.
His
words take a moment to sink in, then--
VANITY
(enraged)
You bastard.
I don't believe
it.
How could you do that to
me?!
She gathers up her clothes, tries
desperately to put them on.
She slips
and falls -- Prince can't help laughing-
-
VANITY
Damn you -- I'll kill you.
She starts throwing stones.
He laughs,
blasts up the path--
VANITY
(screaming)
You prick! Are you sick?! Is
this some kind of ritual
--
getting your kicks! How many
girls have you done this to?
ACCESS ROAD
He blazes up the embankment, SAILS
through the air, drops expertly onto the
road.
He fishtails to a slick stop.
Vanity is by the lake, flailing about,
throwing things, trying to get into her
boots--
VANITY
Bastard!
He laughs heartily, wants to kid her,
rides down the road as if he's leaving.
Having his fun, he slows, turns to go
back ...
...his smile dissolves instantly.
Vanity is in the middleof the road,
flagging down a small PICKUP TRUCK.
She
hops in, slams the door.
The truck
peels out, bears down upon him.
He
gesticulates his arms wildly --
wants
to explain--
PRINCE
Hey ...
But the truck streaks past -- Vanity's
look is cold, triumphant.
Vanity stands in line waiting to get in.
She wears a short, black dress and red
heels, carries a black and red
clutchbag.
Her hair is swept back and
wind-blown, her eyes dark and dancing.
She looks wickedly wonderful and knows
it.
CHICK stands by the window, arms folded,
as massive as a Sequoia.
He regards her
suspiciously--
VANITY
(sweetly)
I'm paying ... see?
(to cashier, gruff)
Keep the change.
Chick advances on her -- her eyes widen
with fear--
CHICK
The manager wants to see you.
VANITY
Really..?
Oh, great...like to
see him too.
She breaths a sigh of relief.
JEROME watches as Chick escorts Vanity
to the upper level.
He stays short
distance behind.
ALLEYWAY #2, REAR CLUB -- NIGHT
Vanity leans against a brick wall,
hiding in the shadows.
Suddenly
FOOTSTEPS approach.
Prince appears,
gets on his Motorcycle--
VANITY
Hey...
He doesn't look up--
PRINCE
We have to go to your place.
VANITY
What for?
PRINCE
I want to show you something.
She's embarrassed by her apartment--
VANITY
No...no, we can't.
PRINCE
Why -- is there someone there?
VANITY
Why do you always think
there's somebody else?
He averts his eyes -- kick STARTS his
bike--
PRINCE
Let's go.
VANITY
(Getting on)
Yeah -- but we're not going to
my place.
He remains silent, snaps the bike into
gear, blasts down the ally into the
street.
(42) PRINCE'S HOUSE AND STREET -- NIGHT
Prince and Vanity whip down a
residential street.
As he approaches
his house he slows, moves past it
quietly.
He makes a deft U-turn, crosses his
house again -- seems to be listening
intently...
After a moment, he cuts down a narrow
path, turns up a back alley.
He rides
to a wooden gate, detaches a hidden
lever.
The wood slats rotate like a
garage door -- Prince coaxes his bike
through.
BACKYARD
Vanity's mesmerized.
They ride down a
narrow sidewalk, cut through a garden,
and emerge from the back of a garage.
He leans his bike against it--
VANITY
That was a grand entrance.
Where am I?
He silences her with a look, moves
quickly across the grass, comes to a
window.
He stands on a pipe, looks in--
BACKYARD -- NIGHT
Prince hops from the pipe, leans coolly
against the house. Intrigued. Vanity
looks in--
BACKYARD -- NIGHT
Vanity's scared -- tries to be cool--
VANITY
So -- friends of yours?
PRINCE
Yeah -- the freak show.
He walks off.
She jumps off the pipe,
follows.
SIDE OF HOUSE
as they emerge around the corner.
Prince squats by a basement window,
adjusts an old coal chute, then slides
down it--
VANITY
Hey...
PRINCE (O.S.)
C'mon.
She hesitates a moment, then slides down
too.
Vanity moves quickly along the side of
the house, trying desperately to find
her wav.
Suddenly a HAND reaches out of
the darkness, GRABS her by the throat.
She SCREAMS, swings her bag desperately
-- something CRASHES, into the bushes--
VOICE
Damn, baby, hold it!
Hold
it!!
(wails)
Oh, God -- God!
You broke my
nose!
She sees it's Morris -- she's beside
herself
with fear and rage--
VANITY
You shit! What the hell are
you doing here?
He struggles in the bushes -- DOGS start
BARKING--
MORRIS
Shh! Shh! Shh! oh, Lord help
me outta here.
(a beat)
Hee, hee -- I know you
wouldn't want to spend the
whole night with ol' pencil
dick.
VANITY
Your nose alright?
MORRIS
My nose is fine, I'm just
wondering if I fucked my shoes
up...
(a beat)
C'mon ...
They cut across the yard, head to the
street.
The CADDY is parked at the
curb.
Jerome leans against it, reading
a newspaper--
VANITY
Hi, Jerome.
Wow!
Nice
hubcaps.
He grins proudly from ear to ear -- the
Caddy sports new chrome wire wheels--
JEROME
You like them, huh?
VANITY
Beautiful.
Morris MOANS dismally--
MORRIS
Jerome...you think these can
be fixed?
His shoes are badly scuffed, the leather
torn across the top--
JEROME
I think they're dead, man.
VANITY
God, I'm sorry.
MORRIS
Shit -- it's so rough out
here.
Just then a PATROL CAR cruises by.
The
COP regards them suspiciously.
Morris
and Jerome snap to attention--
MORRIS
You lock the door, baby?
Let's go!
They pile into the Caddy, pull out.
(51)
The CADDY blazes by in the night.
The
CITY LIGHTS glimmer spectacularly in the
distance.
(52)
Jerome drives.
Morris and Vanity sit in
the backseat. He gazes at her ardently--
MORRIS
Jerome!
Jerome snaps a look in the rear-view --
Morris gives him a deft nod. Jerome
opens the glove compartment, searches
through the cassette tapes. He finds the
one he wants, snaps it into the player.
RESTAURANT AMBIANCE fills the car...
Note:
The restaurant ambiance will grow
in volume, and will be followed by
exaggerated dinner music, punctuated
with strings and delicate cymbals.
The
MUSIC plays throughout this scene -- and
Morris times his words to the ebb and
flow of the piece to insure the proper
dramatic effect.
...dinner MUSIC begins--
JEROME
Cocktails before dinner?
MORRIS
Yes -- two pia coladas.
VANITY
Uh...make mine a virgin.
JEROME
Okay...
Jerome braces his knees against the
wheel, pours two premixed coladas into
plastic glasses--
JEROME
(to Morris)
Will you be having a virgin as
well?
MORRIS
Ye-es!
For dessert!!
Whawhak!
Jerome stifles a laugh, pours a rum
miniature into Morris' glass.
He hands
them back--
MORRIS
Thank you.
Here you are,
dear.
They savor their drinks -- Morris'
fervor grows by leaps and bounds--
MORRIS
Jerome, uh, get your pad and
pencil, I think it's gonna be
kinda right.
If my judge of
character is correct, it's
going to be about loving
tonight.
(a beat)
Stop me when I get to
seventeen.
Jerome places a pad by his side, pencil
at the ready. He settles the Caddy to a
cruising 55 -- Morris looks deeply into
Vanity's eyes--
MORRIS
Excuse me, baby...I bet you
didn't know I had a piece of
this restaurant, did you?
(a beat)
May I taste that?
He takes Vanity's drink, slurps a
little, burps--
MORRIS
Huh, excuse me, that's kind of
weak...here, try mine.
She does, and begins coughing violently-
-
VANITY
Good God!
MORRIS
Y'know...they say that saliva
is an aphrodisiac.
(a beat)
You look so lovely tonight.
VANITY
(couching)
Why...thank you.
MORRIS
Probably you'd look better
under exotic...red...liqhts.
(another though)
I wish you could see my home.
It's...it's so exciting.
He leans close to her, speaks in a soft,
sexy voice--
MORRIS
In my bedroom, I have a brass
waterbed ...
VANITY
Oooh!
MORRIS
I have an Italian cook, Gino
Izogochograchi, or something
like that.
She giggles, looks at him deeply--
MORRIS
It's funny...your eyes -- when
you stare at me like that, it
causes my stomach to qui-
quiver.
Oh, Lord...
An idea flashes across his mind--
MORRIS
Do you like diamonds?
VANITY
Uh, huh.
MORRIS
Yeah ...?
VANITY
Yeah.
MORRIS
I know it's rather masculine,
but -- try this one on.
He slides a large glass diamond on her
finger--
VANITY
Ohhh!
MORRIS
My God, darling it fits.
He studies her hands closely--
MORRIS
You must have strong hands,
but -- they're so soft...like
oils in my bubble bath.
(a beat)
Damn ...
He leans close to her--
MORRIS
Darling...?
VANITY
Yeah...?
MORRIS
I'm not usually so forward,
but -- would you like to make
love to me?
I can make it so
nice ...
She giggles freely, looks at him with
big eyes--
MORRIS
Do you know what is meant by
the words, huh, I hate to use
them, they're so harsh, so
American...I mean, and yet on
the other hand, they're
exciting words.
The words...
(pause)
...chili sauce.
Oh, Lord.
(a beat)
MORRIS
You know, I haven't made love
in so long, but with you I
know it would be just like
riding a bike.
I'd remember
everything I've ever learned.
(a beat)
Baby, if the kid can't make
you come, nobody can.
Jerome checks off his pad--
JEROME
(whispers)
Morris..!
MORRIS
Yeah...?
JEROME
Seventeen.
Morris fixes Vanity with his half-
lidded, pouty-lip look--
MORRIS
Huh, what's it gonna to be
baby?
She's on the spot, thinks fast--
VANITY
PULL OVER THERE!
MORRIS
What?!
JEROME
What?!
VANITY
Over there -- that's where I
live.
Jerome SKIDS the car to a stop.
They're
directly in front of a slick, hi-rise
apartment building--
MORRIS
Here...?
VANITY
Yes.
MORRIS
Uh, what one is it?
VANITY
That one, right there, see?
On the 14th floor.
MORRIS
It's nice, huh?
VANITY
Oh, it's great.
Real pretty.
Big open rooms, balconies,
fireplace -- the works.
He smiles lovingly--
MORRIS
Jerome!
Jerome puts the Caddy into
gear, pulls off into the night-
-
VANITY
Hey, wait!
C'mon!
(a beat)
Okay -- where are you taking
me?
MORRIS
Home.
(smiling)
You and me are a lot alike.- I
like that.
So, I'd like to
help you out.
I think I have
something you may be
interested,
in.
VANITY
Oh yeah -- what?
Jerome hands Morris a cassette -- Morris
waves it in front of her nose--
MORRIS
A little song and dance.
That
is, if you can sing and dance.
VANITY
(defensively)
Prince is goinq to help me.
Jerome and Moris suppress their laughter-
-
JEROME
Motherfucker needs a haircut.
MORRIS
Hee, hee, uh, excuse me.
No
he won't.
He's never done
anything in his whole life for
anybody but himself.
VANITY
Guys better than you have
promised me things before.
MORRIS
I know that's right, but--
Jerome hands him a card with an address
on it.
Morris hands the card to her--
MORRIS
(con't)
-- not Morris Day.
(he smiles)
Jerome pulls up in front of her motel.
Vanity reads the card--
MORRIS
Come by any time.
(53)
She gets out of the car, stands on the
sidewalk.
Morris pushes the window
button -- nothing happens--
MORRIS
Jerome!
Jerome leans over, taps the glass -- the
window glides down--
MORRIS
(to Vanity)
One more thing ...
Jerome snaps the glove compartment,
hands Morris a neatly folded camisole.
Morris presents it to her--
MORRIS
Here's a little something for
you.
If you get cold when you
wear it, call me.
He snaps his fingers -- Jerome pulls the
Caddy away with a screech.
Vanity stands on the sidewalk a moment,
slightly bewildered and very amused.
She watches the Cadillac screech around
the bend.
She turns, goes into the
motel.
PRINCE stands in the alleyway across the
street, his motorcycle parked nearby.
He watches as Vanity cuts inside.
(55)
AERIAL SHOT
Prince and Vanity on his motorcycle
whipping down the highway.
The DAWN
LIGHT breaks over the horizon.
A SERIES OF SHOTS
Streaking down a two-lane blacktop
obviously exhilarated by the velocity of
their ride.
The landscape becomes lush,
the trees a riot of autumn splendor.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as Prince and Vanity whip up to the top
of a small hill, skid to a stop.
He
scans the area quickly, gets his
bearings.
He pops the clutch, skids off
to the valley below.
PRINCE AND VANITY ride cautiously
through a series of hiking paths, then
twist down a small embankment.
A STREAM
flows before them.
They climb off the
bike, look around quietly--
VANITY
God, this is beautiful.
It
reminds me of where I grew up.
My father used to ...
He waits for an answer, it's not
forthcoming--
PRINCE
Your father used to what...?
VANITY
Nothing...it's just...
(changes subject)
You must like places like
this.
He goes to the stream, balances on
several rocks, moves to the other side.
The stream flows between them--
VANITY
So, have you reconsidered my
proposal?
PRINCE
What...?
VANITY
What we talked about last
time.
PRINCE
You can't be serious.
She starts a little dance step, climaxes
it with spins and twirls--
VANITY
Oh, come on -- you know you
really want to.
You've been
waiting for this opportunity
...all...your...life...
He can't help laughing -- she freezes,
looks at him coldly--
PRINCE
I'm sorry -- excuse me.
VANITY
God -- so why do you come
around?
You don't want to
help me, not that you have to.
You don't want to sleep with
me, not that you have to do
that either.
So why am I
here?
He smiles, walks off--
VANITY
There's a lot of things you
don't know about me.
You'd be
surprised how many things I
could do.
He disappears around some trees--
VANITY
Take me home immediately!
I
want to go home.
I can't
stand this!
I can't take this
anymore!
Prince!
PRINCE moves through the trees smiling,
studying nature--
VANITY(O.S.)
I don't need this!
I was
doing alright before I met
you.
Motherfucker, you need a
haircut!
He comes to a tree, leans against it
contentedly, studies the foliage.
VANITY paces back and forth frantically
along the stream--
VANITY
(to herself)
I don't get this.
(yells)
Prince! Who do you think you
are?!
You don't care.
You
don't care about anything!
I
never wanted you to help me
anyway!
PRINCE rests by the tree, observes TWO
HIKERS walking down the path toward him-
-
VANITY (0.S.)
You think you're a good
musician?!
You're nothing!
Morris is better.
I never
wanted to make it with you
anyway.
The Hikers pass him startled--
PRINCE
Good morning.
VANITY
PRINCE, I HATE YOU!
HIKERS
Good morning, sir.
And they walk down the path, disappear around the bend.
Just then--
VANITY is standing by his side, a
wildflower in her hands--
VANITY
(softly)
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have
said those things.
Will you
forgive me?
PRINCE
(softly)
Yes.
He takes the flower, slips it into his
jacket, kisses her forehead.
as they ride down a leaf-strewn path and
pull to a stop near an old, weathered,
dilapidated BARN.
It stands laarge and
silent like a painting.
A low THUNDER
rolls across the land...
Leaves scatter as the bike whips thru
the wet path.
The STREETS glisten with the rain.
Prince and Vanity pull up in front of
her motel.
She hugs him fiercely, steps
off the bike, her face alive and fresh
as a flower.
His eyes sparkle--
PRINCE
See you later?
VANITY
When?
PRINCE
Why?
VANITY
'Cause I have to do something
first.
PRINCE
What?
VANITY
(coyly)
A secret...
PRINCE
Tell me.
VANITY
No.
PRINCE
Okay, come by -- eight
o'clock.
He kicks the bike into gear -- she
touches his jacket longingly--
VANITY
Bye...
He blasts off.
She watches him a
moment, her eyes glowing.
She heads to
her motel, then stops short -- a single
CARNATION lies oon the sidewalk.
She
looks around quickly, almost expecting
someone to claim it.
But no one's
around, so she picks it up, goes inside.
Morris and Jerome standing by the curb,
their eyes fastened excitedly on her
window, leaning against a flower truck.
We catch a glimpse of a Man bringing her
a dozen chrysanthemums--
MORRIS
Good morning, dahling.
(INTERCUT)
VANITY
You're crazy! -- What are you
doing?
MORRIS
(excited)
Come down -- come down.
VANITY
I can't -- I've got things to
do.
MORRIS
C'mon, ten minutes.
I want to
show you something-
She shakes her head--
VANITY
I'm sorry, but thanks for the
flowers.
You're really crazy.
She disappears from the window.
They
stand expectantly a long time.
Finally
Jerome looks at Morris--
JEROME
Well...what do you think?
Morris is staring intently at the window
-- he purses his lips sensualy--
MORRIS
Chili sauce.
Just then Vanity steps outside, looks
stunning in her tight, black pants and
boots.
Her eyes dance vivaciously, a
red sash is tied around her waste.
Morris gives Jerome his sexy, half-
lidded, pouty-lip look--
MORRIS
Oh, Lord...
Vanity climbs over a fence, moves
through some bushes, emerges along side
Prince's house.
She has an excited,
ravenous look on her face.
She hurries
to the casement window, climbs into the
basement.
Rush hour TRAFFIC.
Billy sets the pace
down the sidewalk -- Prince keeps up--
BILLY
Morris called me this morning.
Seems he's got himself a new
group called Vanity Six.
You
know anything about them?
PRINCE
(a beat)
No.
BILLY
He tells me they're great.
Thinks I'll be interested.
That's cool, but now I've got
a problem.
PRINCE
What's that?
BILLY
I book three acts -- I can't
afford four.
If they're as
good as Morris says they are,
one of you will have to go...
Suddenly a HORN BLARES off screen.
Billy looks up -- a BEAUTIFUL BABE in a
black BMW waves--
BILLY
Go around the block!
The Babe pulls into the flow of traffic-
-
BILLY
It won't be The Time --
they're playing backup to
Vanity.
So it's either you or
the Modern Aires.
(a beat)
What would You do in my
position?
Prince has a sinking feeling in his gut-
-
BILLY
(musing)
I like the Modern Aires.
They
have a good following -- they
show up for practice -- and
the kids like all their music.
The BMW sweeps up to the curb.
Billy
opens the door, slides in--
BILLY
'Nough said.
Get smart.
Straighten up your shit.
Prince WHIPS down a dirt access road
locked in thought, the pain and anger in
his eyes apparent.
Suddenly a TRAIN
WHISTLE BLASTS just behind him, sending
a shot of fear through his guts.
He twists backwards in amazement.
A
FREIGHT TRAIN ROARS around the bend
BLASTING its HORN violently.
Prince
shudders with fright, loses control of
his cycle for an instant.
He hits a
series of ruts that almost topple him to
the ground.
He looks back at the train confused,
when another BLAST seems to SOCK him in
the teeth.
He twists wildly to the side
of the road, kicking up dirt and debris,
lurching him into the handlebars
violently.
The TRAIN ROARS abreast of him!
Prince
snaps an angry look at the engineer.
The Guy coolly gives him the finger and
BLASTS the HORN violently.
Prince becomes enraged!
He snaps a look
to the speedometer: 65 mph.
He snaps a
look to the Engineer -- the Guy sends
him another obscene gesture and BLASTS
his HORN.
Prince grits his teeth, twists the
throttle full.
He lurches forward in an
instant, blazing in front of the train,
The Engineer BLASTS the HORN
mercilessly, and throws on the coals.
They blast down the stretch neck to
neck, twist round a wide bend.
Prince edges in front!
The Engineer
BLASTS the HORN and moves up.
Prince
snaps a look to him -- the Guy mouths
the words:
Fuck You!
Prince wants to scream!
He twists the
throttle, snaps a look to the
speedometer:
75 mph.
He RIPS past ruts
and gullies like a madman.
The TRAIN
moves up.
They blast around another
bend neck to neck
Suddenly Prince's eyes widen with
horror.
A CAR is parked across the
access road, waiting to cross the track.
He shoots a look to the Engineer -- the
Guy is laughing hysterically now,
BLASTING his HORN wildly, mouthing the
words:
Bye Bye!
Prince screams like
a MADMAN!
He
twists his
throttle FULL!
He blazes
ahead of the train, BLASTS! up the
embankment, SAILS through the air...
...a BRICK WALL cuts the access road in
two!
He SCREAMS in bloody terror!
He hits
the road and fishtails wildly, locking
his brakes.
The WALL comes at him like
a locomotive.
He's going to hit it,
knows it and...
He twists his throttle violently BLASTS!
directly into the path of the train!
The Engineer looks on in horror!
Prince
throws his weight forward and...
...the train ROARS past him as he
fishtails wildly to a stop.
The Engineer sails off into the dusk,
his mouth agape.
Prince sits there
breathing fiercely, the adrenaline
shrieking though his veins, watching
the train disappear into the distance.
SHOPPERS flood the sidewalks, rushing for the buses that
take them home.
TRAFFIC clogs
at the 77 intersections
while PEDESTRIANS walk against the lights.
Prince rides
down the streets, hugging the right shoulder, impatient with
the delays.
He blasts down a side street, sees FLASHING
LIGHTS up ahead.
GAWKERS are already crowding around.
He moves through the TRAFFIC slowly,
glides past a POLICE CAR, and a small
CROWD.
A CAR has run onto the sidewalk,
knocking down the marquee to a rundown,
neighborhood bar.
Something catches his eye -- he stops
suddenly.
His Mother stands against the
wall, idly watching the goings on.
He
jumps off his bike hurriedly, walks up
behind her, taps her on the shoulder--
PRINCE
Ma...?
She turns, he gasps out loud.
Her left
eye is swollen shut--
MOTHER
(drunkenly)
Hi, ya, baby...
Her drunken breath washes over him --
his head spins--
PRINCE
Ma...what happened?
She rubs up against him--
MOTHER
Can you give me some money?
C'mon, just some money...
She gropes for him drunkenly -- he
suddenly realizes she doesn't know who
he is--
MOTHER
Here...here...
She tugs at her wedding ring--
MOTHER
Give me something for
this...just a little.
It'll
be okay...
PRINCE
C'mon...I'll take you home.
Just then a COP moves through the Crowd-
-
COP
Okay, c'mon now -- break it
up.
Let's go..
The Crowd moves out.
Police RADIOS
cackle.
Three WOMEN stagger over, one
of them grabbing his Mother--
WOMAN
C'mon, honey -- we're goin'
in...
She fixes Prince with a glare--
WOMAN
You're a little young aren't
you?
Get out of here.
Leave
her alone.
Prince BLASTS down the STREET, sweeps
into his drive, and jumps off his bike,
practically smashing it into the gate.
His eyes are burning with anger.
He
flies up the steps three at a time, cuts
across the porch, bursts throuch the
front door and--
KIDS are hanging out in front of the
club.
The usual queue, however, is
noticeably absent.
The yellow Caddy sweeps up.
Jerome is
at the wheel, Morris and Vanity sit in
the back.
Morris is dressed elegantly,
resplendent in a 5O's-style suit.
She's
beautiful in a sleek black dress, with
long black gloves, and heels--
VANITY
What are we doing here,
Morris?
MORRIS
What do you mean?
VANITY
I don't want to be here.
I
don't want to hurt anybody.
MORRIS
It's not about hurting
anybody.
This is business.
We can use the exposure.
Just then Brenda and Susan come up to
the car excitedly.
Brenda is dressed in
a 40's-style dress, Susan wears a form-
fitting leopard one.
They both look
gorgeous--
BRENDA
Hi -- you coming in?
Their excitement and nervousness is
endearing.
Vanity's heart goes out to
them.
She forces a smile, climbs out
unaided--
VANITY
Your horns are showing,
Morris.
MORRIS
Yeah...but they're holding up
my halo.
as she comes down the stairs stumbling
slightly, tears streaming down her face.
Chick sees her, reached out to help--
CHICK
Hey ...
But she pulls away, runs out the door,
cuts across the street.
COMMOTION.
CARS are THICK in front of
THE TASTE, a small NIGHTCLUB located in
the poorer part of the city.
Because of
its location, The Taste books different
dance bands four nights a week and then
hosts a Variety Night the remaining two.
Aspiring comedians, dancers and jugglers
flock to Variety Night, desirous of
trying their material in front of a live
audience -- and hoping to catch the
discering eye of a talent scout on the
prowl.
Billy Sparks pulls up to the curb, gets
out with a beautiful WOMAN and cuts
inside.
Morris and Vanity stagger down the ALLEY
obviously very drunk.
Morris pulls from
a FLASK.
Vanity is still in her
lingerie, wears an open coat over it.
Her speech is slurred--
VANITY
Did you hear these people
applauding?
They loved us --
they wanted to rip us apart,
and this is just our first
night.
I can see it now,
we're all going to be big
stars.
I can feel it.
MORRIS
(singing)
Ain't nobody bad like me.
She kisses him spontaneously on the
cheek--
VANITY
Morris, you're a genius.
MORRIS
Ye-es...
He fixes her with a sexy look, takes a
healthy look from his flask, then gives
it too her.
Vanity throws her head
back, drinks fully, the liquor coursing
over her cheeks.
He devours her with
his eyes, opens the door to the Caddy--
MORRIS
Let's go, Bebe.
She stops as if remembering something--
VANITY
Huh, where's Jerome?
MORRIS
In his skin...hee, hee...
He's trying to nudge her into the Caddy-
-
VANITY
Is he coming?
MORRIS
I gave him the night off.
VANITY
Why?
He staggers back from the car, undulates
his hips wantonly--
MORRIS
Whawhak!
She busts up.
Just then a MOTORCYCLE
can be heard off screen.
They look
around drunkenly, trying to discern its
direction.
Suddenly Prince BLASTS
around the corner FULL OUT!
He streaks
by Morris and KICKS him flat on his ass
into the garbage--
MORRIS
(wails)
Oh, no -- Oh, God...No!
Prince skids to a slick stop.
Vanity is
transfixed.
The entire episode
took
less than five seconds.
He twists the
throttle, BLASTS down upon her...
She breaks in a panic!
She runs
clumsily down another alley, her coat
flying.
He WHIPS after her like a
madman.
She flies around the corner --
a dead end!
He fishtails to a slick
stop--
PRINCE
Get on!
There's no way out!
Suddenly she lets
out an excited YELP, jumps on.
He guns
the bike, BURSTS up the alley.
Morris
jumps into his path drunkenly, his arms
extended--
MORRIS
Stop! Stop!
But Prince BLAZES down upon him, sending
him slipping and sliding to safety.
He
BLASTS around the bend--
MORRIS
Motherfucker!
You long-haired
faggot!
TO EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT
Prince and Vanity WHIPPING down the
highway.
They streak down the road, slow, then
move down a small embankment.
He stops
the bike and gets off.
She's in a foul
mood, staggers around dully, her head
pounding, her speech slurred--
VANITY
So here we are again.
So this
is it, huh?
What do you want
this time?
He looks at her painfully, upset about
her drunken state--
VANITY
What's your problem now?
What's your main problem?
PRINCE
No problem.
I just wanted to
talk, alright? I just want us
to be okay, to really get
along.
No big deal.
She cackles, falls flat on her ass,
hoists herself up--
VANITY
No big deal, huh...
She pulls Morris' FLASK from her jacket
-- his eyes blacken--
PRINCE
Give me that.
VANITY
No, definitely not.
Who are
you?
You can't tell me what
to do.
She puts it to her lips--
PRINCE
Please don't drink that.
Give
it to me.
She holds the flask to her lips
defiantly, then goes to drink.
He lashes out suddenly, SMASHES it from
her grip.
She SCREAMS wildly, SLAPS him
hard across the face.
He stands shocked
a moment, his rage surging within him,
smashing through every safety valve he's
acquired in his life.
He BACKHANDS her
savagely across the jaw.
She hits the ground like a rag doll.
He
looks at her curiously, bends over her -
- she sucker-punches him with everything
she's got!
He SCREAMS in rage and grabs
her hands as they flail about his face.
He squeezes her fingers back while the
tears stream down her cheeks and her
mouth forms a silent "ow"!
She bares
her teeth angrily and he sucks at her
mouth, biting and kissing her in a fever
pitch.
She kicks at him violently, hot tears
streaming down her cheeks.
He jams his
leg between hers, rubs it firmly against
her bottom.
She struggles helplessly
against him as he covers her breasts,
her stomach, her thighs with his lips.
Quick breaths escape from her -- her
breathing begins to race...
He snaps her panties in two, pulls them
from between her legs.
She spreads
herself as he releases his pants.
She
squeezes his buttocks, pulls him toward
her -- but Prince resists her coldly,
regards her with contempt.
Suddenly he
flips her onto her stomach, forces her
to stand painfully on her knees.
He
rubs his hand between her buttocks, then
thrusts into her painfully, driving
himself to the very depths of her...
...but she stifles a cry, arches her
back, and meets his thrusts fiercely,
moving quicker and quicker, banging her
buttocks against his thighs again and
again.
She's drawing from him now,
turning the humiliation around,
obtaining all that she needs and
desires.
He's powerless -- her thrusts
set the pace.
She rises, Prince still
inside her and tugs on him rapidly,
causing him to ejaculate suddenly,
drawing from him a sharp and sudden
cry...
She moves away, draws her coat tightly
about her, fixes him with a contemptuous
look--
VANITY
You're nothing, Prince,
absolutely nothing.
You think
you're so special --
but deep
down you're just like all the
rest.
(a beat)
Your whole life you've been
hiding, hiding behind your
music.
But now you don't even
have that, because last
night...last night you used it
to hurt someone, someone who
really cares.
She runs up the embankment, wipes away
her tears, faces him--
VANITY
If you put your hands on me
like that ever again, I'll be
the last person you touch.
She pulls off his Mother's earring,
throws it at him.
Tears flowing, she
streaks into the HIGHWAY blindly,
directly into the path of a SPEEDING CAR-
-
THE DRIVER
spots her in his HEADLIGHTS, SLAMS on
his brakes!
He SKIDS wildly across the
road, comes to a SCREECHING, BURNING
stop inches from her thigh!
VANITY
shoots a look at Prince, her lips
trembling, her love for him, written
plainly on her face.
But his eyes flash
defiantly.
She bites her lip sadly,
then snaps a hot look at the Driver--
VANITY
I
need a
ride.
She cuts around the car, hops in.
The
Driver skids off into the night.
Prince
stands there trembling, watches as it
disappears into the distance.
DISSOLVE
TO:
Prince pulls up to the wooden gate, cuts
the motor, gets off.
He walk wearily
across the porch, moves to the front
door -- it's wide open.
He thinks
nothing of it, cuts into the house,
closes it behind him.
SIRENS!
The SCENE is a riot of COLOR
and FRENZY.
A POLICE CAR, LIGHTS
FLASHING, skids into the drive.
NEIGHBORS jam the STREETS.
POLICE CARS
are parked all around.
He SMASHES open the door, BURSTS
outside.
He sucks in the night air as
if he was drowning.
He wipes away his
tears, rushes to his bike, starts to
undo the chain...
...they're SHOUTING his NAME...
Not randomly, not haphazardly, but...in
unison.
And relentless, very demanding,
downright urgent, and...it's beautiful.
A wry smile crosses his lips.
He heads
back to the door.
Jill is there,
scared, her face a map of tears.
He
flashes her a smile--
PRINCE
Hi.
She's thunderstruck, can barely squeak
it out--
JILL
Hi.
And he whips into the hallway.
Her face
dissolves into a smile of pure joy.
