      WIDE on a DESERTED two-lane ROAD -- flat, cornfields... space
      as far as the eye can see.

      WE make out A LONE FIGURE, FRANKIE HECK, mom, late 30s,
      standing by the side of the road at a pay phone in an ILL-
      FITTING SUPERWOMAN COSTUME... leotard, tights... cape.  She
      tugs at the rear of her leotard, trying for better coverage.

                    Some people call this the middle of
                    nowhere.  You know, one of those
                    places you fly over on your way from
                    somewhere to somewhere else, but you
                    wouldn't live here?


      White, clean, quaint... puffing cute little PUFFS OF WHITE
      SMOKE from its smokestacks.

                    ... Little Debbie Snack Cakes on one
                    side...


      Spewing BLACK CLOUDS of horrible pollution.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    ... and Hoosier Rubber and Tire on
                    the other.

                    So on any given day the town can
                    smell good or awful, depending on
                    which way the wind is blowing.


      A corn-fed middle-aged COUPLE sit on their porch -- look up
      and sniff the air... nod to each other... it's a good day.


      Midwestern, America... malls, muffler shops, Applebee's...

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    We used to have to drive into Indy 
                    for a good dinner, but since they
                    put in an Applebees... well, this
                    place is pretty much heaven.  What
                    can I say?  We like big portions at
                    cheap prices and we don't read
                    nutrition labels.


      Frankie, tired, walks down the road in her costume.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    So how'd I end up by the side of the
                    road in this get up?  Sit tight, I'm
                    getting there.  And no, I'm not an
                    actual superhero...


      Nondescript... one story ... lower middle class.  Everything
      has the effect of being arrested somewhere in the 80's.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    ... not unless you count getting my
                    kids out the door for school every
                    morning.

      Chyron: A few weeks ago.


      FLAT on an empty road.  A teenage boy sprints across.                                                                                        4.

      A BIG CEMENT TRUCK BARRELS ACROSS THE FRAME -- HONK!  HONK!

      When it clears the frame... 

      A MAKESHIFT SHRINE OF CANDLES, FLOWERS, TEDDY BEARS marks
      the spot.  ELVIS, in baseball uniform, enters frame and drops
      a baseball on to the shrine.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    We tried to comfort him -- told him
                    that's just how people die in Indiana,
                    they're roadkill. But it flipped him
                    out to realize how precariously
                    perched we all are.  He quit baseball,
                    dropped his old friends... and after
                    watching a late night movie on cable,
                    found solace by assuming the identity
                    of... Dean Martin.


      The family heads out, licking their frozen waffles... all
      sniff the air in disgust.... smells like tires.  Ew.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE                                                                                        8.

                    We're a two job family.  Two jobs
                    and no career.  Mike manages a bunch
                    of idiots down at the quarry...


                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...And my most recent job is selling
                    cars at Jasper's foremost new and
                    used Ford dealer.


      Brick sits all by himself, waiting for his ride that hasn't
      come.

      BACK TO SCENE 

                                      FRANKIE
                    Dammit.

      She dials.


      Frankie and Brick sit staring out the window drinking out of
      Ford mugs, as in the foreground, Mr. Yamamoto PEELS OUT in
      his own car.  Brick puts his hand on Frankie's knee.

                                      BRICK
                    At least you're still my hero.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Yeah, thanks.


      PAN ACROSS a table set with chips... dip... more dip...
      various "salads" that don't contain lettuce...  

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    Sunday's a day of rest and relaxation. 
                    For God, maybe.  The rest of us have
                    to spend it with our family.

      Frankie gets food ready, as Mike works the barbeque.  The
      backyard's littered with old people in lawn chairs.  Mike's
      Dad, BIG MIKE, 70's, bigoted, gruff, has Elvis cornered.

                                    BIG MIKE
                    Are you queer?  'Cause you dress
                    like you're queer.

      On the patio, Sue practices her show choir audition routine
      for AUNT GINNIE AND AUNT EDIE, two ancient fossils, who sit
      drinking booze, messily eating dip, and chain smoking.  They
      manage to be glamorous and disgusting at the same time.                                                                                        17.

      Sue finishes with a flourish.  They applaud as vigorously as
      old people can... then SHOOT FRANKIE THAT SAME, "OH NO,"
      LOOK.  She shrugs, "I know."

                                      FRANKIE
                          (shouting)
                    Come on, everybody!  It's getting
                    cold.  We should all come in and eat
                    together as a family!

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Frankie and Mike sit at a little table with Brick's teacher,
      MRS. RETTIG, a giant woman in a sweater with applique
      scarecrows on it.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    I'd gotten an hour off work for
                    Brick's teacher meeting by telling
                    Mr. Ehlers I had "woman problems." 
                    Not the most creative in my arsenal,
                    but in a pinch you can't beat the
                    classics.

                                    MRS. RETTIG
                          (delicately))
                    Brick... is a very "quirky" child. 
                    Maybe... clinically quirky, even.

      Frankie and Mike just look at her.

                                      FRANKIE
                    We have no idea what you mean.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    We knew exactly what she meant.

      QUICK CUTS

      A series of Brick's odd behaviors

      - Brick talks close and loud into A KID'S face.  The kid's
      recoiling.

      - Brick walks to the bathroom pulling down his pants before
      he gets there, as KIDS snicker.                                                                                        18.

      - A group of KIDS focused on MRS. RETTIG talking, as Brick
      faces the opposite way, reading the school supply catalogue.

      RESUME SCENE

                                    MRS. RETTIG
                    He's a very bright boy, reads
                      everything he can get his hands on,
                    but the other kids don't really know
                    how to relate to him.  He gets this
                    look a lot.

      She cocks her head to the side, perplexed.

      QUICK CUTS

      One after another, different kids look INTO CAMERA, head
      cocked, perplexed.

                                    MRS. RETTIG (CONT'D)
                    He doesn't seem to mind, but I feel
                    Brick could benefit from a series of
                    more formal tests... to see if we
                    can help him... integrate.  Our "S
                    is for Special" Success Team is here
                    as a resource --

                                      FRANKIE
                    Yeah, okay.  You know, Brick may not
                    be like everybody else, but he's
                    funny and sweet and probably a genius
                    who's gonna cure diseases or invent
                    a new kind of wrench or something
                    and just because he's not fitting
                    into some cookie cutter mold doesn't
                    mean something's the matter with him
                    that needs fixing.  Our oldest son
                    had a completely pointed head until
                    he was six -- 

                                    MIKE
                          (nodding)
                    Like a candy corn.

                                      FRANKIE
                    And sure people stared at us in
                    WalMart, but you know what we did? 
                    We knit him a hat, let it be, and it
                    flattened out all on it's own.

      All three hundred pounds of Mrs. Rettig is staring.

                                    MIKE
                    I think what we're trying to say is
                    thanks for your concern, but our
                    Brick doesn't need any special
                    anything.  He's fine.                                                                                        19.


      The sun is shining, the air is crisp.  Frankie steps outside,
      takes a deep sniff.

                                      FRANKIE
                    Mmmm... snack cakes.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


                                      FRANKIE
                    Woo-hoo!

      The convertible top now down, Frankie and Gail tear down the
      two-lane highway.  Thelma and Louise on the open road!

      VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE CONVERTIBLE

      They zoom past the factory... past the JCPenney's... past
      the Paul Bunyan Muffler Man... and out into the countryside...


      Frankie walks down the road in her costume, wiped out,
      exhausted, as the sun is setting.  She looks up to see a
      HUGE TRUCK barreling down on her.  She doesn't move, stares
      mesmerized as it gets closer and closer... 

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    Oh please, I'm not that desperate. 
                    I just noticed it was a Little Debbie
                    truck and was hoping a chocolate
                    Ring Ding would fall out.

      She steps out of the way and it passes her by in a WHOOSH.

      Lo and behold, right behind the truck is their little old
      family Honda with Mike at the wheel.  He leans out the window.

                                    MIKE
                    Somebody call for a ride?

      Frankie peers in and sees her whole family -- Elvis, Sue,
      and Brick -- are inside.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    That's the thing about family. 
                    They're the ones who suck the hope
                    out of you, but they're also the
                    ones who can give it back.

      Frankie goes to get in, but Mike speeds up.  As she goes to
      grab the door handle again, he keeps going a little faster
      and faster.  Very funny.

                                    MIKE
                    Not very fast for a Superhero.

      Frankie shoots him a look, then finally gets in.


      MUSIC CUE: "This Will Be Our Year" by Pablo

      A WIDE SHOT of Mike parking the Honda in the big parking lot.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.)
                    So yeah, back then on the old license 
                    I didn't know what my life was gonna
                    be.  And Mike's right... now I know. 
                    This is my life.  It's not gonna be
                    in People Magazine or anything, but
                    it's all right.

      The family walks together up to the entrance.

                                      FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    The thing is, some people are meant
                    to be in the spotlight, and some are
                    meant to drag the stools.  I've always
                    been more the stool-dragging kind...
                    all moms are. 'Cause the truth is,
                    if nobody's there to make sure the
                    stools are where they're supposed to
                    be... everybody falls on their ass.

      Through the window of Applebee's, we see the family eating 
      dinner together.  PAN UP to reveal an airplane passing by
      overhead, on its way to somewhere else.  And we...

                                                                                FADE OUT.
