  TWO ADJACENT BACK YARDS in a Houston suburb, divided by a low 
  hedge.  On the far side of the hedge is JOE, early fifties, 
  stocky, crewcut.  On the near side is his neighbor, BETTY, 
  fortyish, well-botoxed.  SUPER TITLE:

                                          JULY

  Joe is on his back patio, swinging a garden hose to and fro.  
  Betty is on her knees weeding the flower bed.  She stands up, 
  wipes her brow.

                              BETTY
                Morning, Joe.  Gonna be a hot one.

                              JOE
                Hot one already!

                              BETTY
                That s the God s truth.  Would you 
                like a lemonade if I fix some?

                              JOE
                Naw.  That s awful sweet of you.  But 
                I m just fine, thanks.

                              BETTY
                It s no tr 

  Betty stifles a GASP.  She has only now moved close enough to 
  see over the hedge.  Joe is hosing down his patio because 
  it s covered in BLOOD.

  There s quite a bit of it.  You would almost think he had 
  gutted a deer.  RIVULETS OF RED run into a grated drain, into 
  the surrounding grass.

                              JOE
                Thanks just the same.  I m fine.

  He gives her a neighborly wave.  Terrified, she turns and 
  walks slowly, deliberately, toward her back door, resisting 
  the urge to peek back over her shoulder.


  Joe s hands are cuffed behind his back as the troopers hustle 
  him to a COP CAR waiting at the curb.

                              TROOPER I
                ... can and will be used against you.  
                Now HOW  BOUT IT, JOE?  What the hell 
                HAPPENED HERE??

                              JOE
                I told you ... it was the Lord ... 
                the Lord came and spoke to me ...

  Trooper I shoves Joe into the (caged) back seat.

                              TROOPER I
                Spoke to you?  What did he say?

                              JOE
                He said,  Joe, clean up this place. 

  The troopers shake their heads.  The door slams shut.


  Next door, on the front porch, Betty and her husband PHIL 
  watch as the cop cars screech off.

                              PHIL
                Poor old Joe.

  Betty gives him a look of utter disgust and storms inside.

  Good-nights and thank-you's as Barney, suitcases in hand, 
  walks down the front steps with Bella, who is fishing in a 
  shoulder bag for her car keys.  As soon as they re out of

                In that case, I should certainly buy 
                you a drink.

  Barney throws his bags in Bella s trunk and the two of them 
  climb into the car.  Meanwhile, on the front porch ...

                Mom!  Dad!  Look!

  Amy points overhead at a BRIGHT LIGHT hurtling earthward, 
    diagonally bisecting the black canvas of the sky.

  As they watch, the  falling star  levels off, makes a mid-
  course correction, and zips off to the north.  Anne and Alan 
  laugh.  Amy groans in disappointment.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                I guess this means I don t get my

                for.  C mon, it s your bedtime.

  As the three of them head inside, Anne discreetly slips a 
  hand onto Alan s ass and gives it a squeeze.

    A STRIPPER in high heels and fishnets is gyrating on the bar.  
  A couple of stools away, averting his eyes as he nurses a 
  soda pop, is a young man in a cheap black suit: RODNEY  *
  BEARDEN, pale, gaunt, and damp.

                              PFC HOLICKY [V.O.]
                He kept fiddling with something in 
                his hand.  Clutching it.  And he s 
                bleeding all over his napkin.
                      (beat)
                It was barbed wire.

  Directly across the bar, watching Rodney, are PFC HOLICKY and  *
  two other G.I. s.  They chuckle as the stripper moves one 
  pole closer to Rodney and demonstrates a series of highly  *
  athletic moves.

                              PFC HOLICKY [V.O.] (CONT'D)
                Well, anyhow, Fawna, she gets right 
                up in his grille, and she s givin  
                him a pretty good show, you know, I 
                think she took him as a challenge.

  Unable to ignore Fawna any longer, Rodney drops his bloody  *
  barbed wire.  He grabs his soda glass and SMASHES IT against 
  the bar.  Clambering onto his barstool, he LUNGES at the 
  stripper, SLASHING WILDLY at her face and throat.

    Screaming, she stumbles backward and falls off the bar.  The 
  BARTENDER whips out a gun, SHOOTS Rodney in the gut. *

                Well, I understand about Rodney, and  *
                why he did it.  I don t understand 
                about you.

                              PFC HOLICKY
                I didn t either.  At the time.  But I 
                know now ...


  TIGHT ON PFC HOLICKY S IMPASSIVE FACE as behind him, two 
  other STRIPPERS help the battered, bloody Fawna to her feet 
  and pull a robe around her.  As they lead her to a dressing 
  room, PFC Holicky gets up off his stool and falls in behind 
  them.  He discreetly removes a SWITCHBLADE from his pocket.

                              PFC HOLICKY [V.O.]
                ... that the spirit of God ...

  Coming up behind the three strippers, he grabs one by the 
  hair and FLINGS HER roughly to the floor.  As the second 
  turns to face him, he drops her with a rabbit punch to the 
  face.  And that leaves Fawna, whom he pins to the wall with a 
  forearm, and STABS REPEATEDLY --

                              PFC HOLICKY [V.O.] (CONT'D)
                ... had entered me, and cleansed me 
                ...

  -- until his horrified fellow G.I. s arrive to pull him off.  
  They wrestle him away from the dying Fawna, who slumps to the 
  floor.  With the bartender s gun trained directly at his 
  forehead, PFC Holicky smiles, raises his hands and lets his 
  knife drop to the floor.

                              PFC HOLICKY [V.O.] (CONT'D)
                ... and at long last made me right.

  They drag him to the exit, past gutshot Rodney, who lies  *
  bleeding on the bar -- using his broken glass to GOUGE AT his 
  own crotch.

  No reply.  Bella is mildly unnerved to realize that PFC

  Without warning, PFC Holicky snakes a hand through the bars 
  and grabs at her. She RECOILS ABRUPTLY, almost falling out of 
  her chair.  Notepad and recorder clatter to the floor.

  She hesitates to pick them up.  He might make another grab at 
  her.  The two of them lock eyes for a moment; then PFC 
  Holicky backs away from the bars, wagging a finger at Bella 
  and LAUGHING eerily.

  whistles, catcalls, crotch-hefting, etc.  Anne instinctively 
  grabs Amy by the arm and quickens her pace.

                              ANNE
                Amy, we need to have a talk about the 
                ... the way you dress.

                              AMY
                Oh, they re just creeps.

  Amy, in a perverse frame of mind, pauses just long enough to 
  WIGGLE HER ASS at the construction workers.  Then, without 
  looking back, she flips them the bird.

                              ANNE
                Amy, Jesus Christ!

  Anne glances back and sees that a HARDHAT has peeled off from 
  the group to follow them down the sidewalk.  She breaks into 
  a trot, dragging Amy behind her.

  As the two of them climb into their yellow VW beetle, the 
  Hardhat tips his helmet, flashes a gracious smile, and FLAPS 
  HIS TONGUE lewdly.


  Something is just a little off   the moonlight too intense, 
  the colors a bit oversaturated, idealized   as a taxi pulls 
  up soundlessly in front of Alan s house and stops.  He pays 
  the driver, sets his suitcases down on the sidewalk, stands 
  for a moment silently regarding the house.

  Then the front door bursts open, and his daughter Amy comes 
  sprinting down the front walk toward him, shouting a word we 
  can t hear:  Daddy.  Daddy. 

  She races into his arms.  He clutches her close to his chest, 
  beaming, overcome with rapture and relief.

  A moment later, Anne appears in the door.  She stifles a gasp 
  of joy and runs to him, tears streaming down her face.

  Arm in arm, the three of them start up the walk to the front 
  steps of the house.

  Amy is standing twenty paces away, next to her mom   who is 
  clutching a .38 in both hands, squinting down the sight at a 
  Diet Sprite can.  She pulls the trigger, hits nothing but 
  air.

                              AMY
                One out of five.  That s an 
                  improvement.

                              ANNE
                Your turn.

  Amy rolls her eyes in exasperation as Anne reloads the gun 
  and hands it over.

                              AMY
                This is so stupid.  I m not going to 
                go out and hunt down some little 
                animal.

                              ANNE
                I m not worried about little animals.

  Amy s first shot goes wide.  The kickback surprises her.

                              ANNE (CONT'D)
                Don t pull on the trigger.  Squeeze 
                it.  Really gently.

                Good!


  The little yellow Volks is still forty or fifty yards below 
  the cabin when Amy and Anne climb out.  Anne starts uphill, 
  gesturing for Amy to stay behind.  But Amy is the first to 
  spot the car parked at the top of the hill ...

                              AMY
                IT S DADDY!!

  And with that, she s SPRINTING at top speed toward the cabin.  
  Anne is, of course, horrified:


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 43.

  She starts to chase Amy, then hesitates   runs instead to the 
  back of the car, pops the trunk, and pulls out the GUN.

  It's nothing.  Just woodsy noises -- branches in the wind,  *

  something much scarier ... *

  ... the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning over.  She stumbles out  *
  of the bushes, tissues in one hand, gun in the other -- just  *
  in time to see the taillights of the yellow Volks as it  *
  vanishes in the distance. *

  CLOSEUP   ANNE S FACE5959

  Darkness.  Then a bare bulb clicks on, and HARSH LIGHT from a 
  bedside lamp angles across Anne s sleeping face, half-buried 
  in a white pillow.  Her bleary, drugged eyes open slowly   
  just as TWO MALE HANDS enter frame to pull a KNIT WATCH CAP 
  onto her head.

  Startled, she raises a hand to defend herself.

                              BARNEY S VOICE
                Shh.  Shhhhh.  It s all right.

  She tries to speak but her mouth is parched.  All that comes 
  out is a croak.  Barney s hand reaches for a paper cup on the 
  night stand, brings it to her lips.

                              BARNEY S VOICE (CONT'D)
                  I brought you some ice.  Now hold 
                still.

  He stuffs as much of her hair as he can under the knit cap, 
  and snips off the excess with a pair of scissors.

                              ANNE
                I was having a dream.

                              BARNEY S VOICE
                That s right.

                              ANNE
                Where am I, Barney?

                              BARNEY S VOICE
                  Hospital.

  Anne s head jerks at the sound of a SCREAM from down the 
  hall, followed by a chorus of distant WAILING.

                            Stewart, British Columbia*
                                        NOVEMBER


  The road is narrow, lined on either side with tall trees.  
  Volks and pickup are both speeding now, skidding on the 
  turns, kicking up gravel.


  The VW comes around a sharp turn, which puts it out of the 
  Hunters  sight for a few seconds.  There s a GRAVEL TURNOFF 
  just this side of the dogleg.  Anne jerks the wheel hard 
  right and takes the turnoff at full speed.

  The Volks skids off the gravel path into the brush, but 
    miraculously avoids crashing into a tree.


  The pickup truck bounces along the turnoff and comes to a 
  stop, its headlights trained directly on the rear of the 
  abandoned Volks.  The Hunters climb out with their dogs and 
  their guns to scope out the scene.

                                HUNTER II
                MISS?  CAN WE HELP YOU?  Do you need 
                some automotive assistance?


  As she runs her foot catches on a root; she pitches forward 
  to the ground, and finds herself face to face with a DEER.

  Just the head, actually.  And the legs.  The rest has been 
  carved off and carried away by a poacher.  Before she can 
  catch herself, Anne lets out a little yelp of shock.


  Their heads jerk at the sound.  They turn in Anne s 
    direction.

                                HUNTER II
                MISSY!  Don t be a tease, now.  We 
                ain t gonna hurt you!


  Anne is frantically clawing her way through the underbrush 
  when a BLINDING LIGHT sweeps through the woods.  It seems to 
  be coming from a CLEARING up ahead.

  A BLAST OF AIR stirs up dead leaves, sends them flying all 
  around her.  Anne gets to her feet, shields her eyes, and 
  changes direction   turning away from the clearing, toward a 
  STEEP, ROCKY INCLINE.


  They re maybe forty yards back.

                                HUNTER II
                Missy!  WHERE YOU AT, MISSY?
                      (to HUNTER II)
                Cut the dogs loose.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 57.

    CONTINUED:7777


  Hunter II is crouching to unhook the leashes when the 
  strange, cold LIGHT sweeps past them.  The beagles let out a 
  low growl as two men stare off at the clearing in obvious 
    befuddlement, their quarry briefly forgotten.


  Anne frantically crawls up the escarpment, trying to reach a 
  shallow plateau that overlooks the clearing.  The sharp rocks 
  tear her clothes, cut her hands, but she keeps going, 
  refusing to cry out.

  She s almost reached the ledge when the searchlight stops 
  raking the woods, and fades to a luminous steady GLOW that 
  fills the clearing.  The rocks, however, hide her view, and 
  she can t see around them to the source of the light.


  The hunters step out into the open and freeze in their 
  tracks, staring in disbelief at:

  A PAIR OF ALIEN CREATURES8080

  -- who are setting up some sort of SCIENTIFIC GEAR in the 
  middle of the clearing.  The creatures are tall, gaunt, with 
  sectioned limbs.  Their insectoid faces are topped, 
    incongruously, by long, flowing HAIR, so pale as to be almost 
  luminous.

  They have huge, multifaceted eyes   and no mouths.

  On their backs, protruding from slits in their shiny tunics, 
  are vestigial WINGS.  Although too small for flight, they 
  vibrate rapidly, like the wings of a hummingbird, producing 
  an eerie melodic DRONE that rises and falls rapidly in pitch.  
  This, it seems, is how the creatures communicate.

  They turn and stare, calmly, curiously, at the hunters.


  Hunter I brings up his gun.  Before he can fire, an ENERGY 
  PULSE strikes him and knocks him onto his back.

  GEYSERS OF STEAM rise from his mouth, nostrils, ears, and 
  eyes; it s as if his innards have been boiled on the spot.  
  SWEAT SIZZLES on the surface of his beet-red face.


  Clinging to the rocks, scarcely daring to breathe, she gapes 
  in disbelief at the spectacle unfolding below.                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 58.




  Hunter II drops his gun.  Enraptured, weeping, he falls to 
  his knees, bows his head and PRAYS HUMBLY to the Angels of 
  the Lord.

                                HUNTER II
                His throne like flames of fire: the 
                wheels of it like a burning fire. A 
                swift stream of fire issued forth 
                from before Him  

  On cue, Alien I fires an ENERGY PULSE at Hunter II, with the 
  same results as before.  The Aliens HUM harmonically at one 
  another, then Alien I picks up a metal case and carries it to 
  where the two stiffs lie.

  The Alien pets a waggy-tailed beagles  aliens and dogs seem  *
  to get along just fine   then he removes a cylindrical device 
  from his case and holds it to the forehead of Hunter I.  The 
  device seems to work like a motorized apple corer: it routs a 
  neat hole in Hunter I s forehead and scoops out a sample of 
  his grey matter.


  Fear gets the better of her.  She can t stay put any longer.  
  She starts climbing up the slope again  

    but her foot dislodges a rock, which goes bouncing noisily 
  downhill.  She freezes, clinging to the steeply-angled cliff, 
  trying to remain motionless in the shadows.


  Alien II is down on one bulbous knee, scooping up soil 
  samples to feed into his chemical-analysis gear.  His head 
  cocks slightly at the sound of the falling rock, but he 
  thinks nothing of it.

  Alien I ambles over with two cylindrical brain-scoopers and 
  screws them into the appropriate sockets of the sample 
  analyzer.  Meanwhile, Alien II scuttles over to a nearby 
  creek so he can test the water supply.

  CLOSEUP   ANNE8686

  Still clinging to the rocks, face streaked with grime, sweat, 
  blood.  She s right on the edge of madness.                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 59.




    Exhausted, Anne pulls herself onto the shallow ledge above 
  the clearing.  She flips over on her back and lies there 
  gasping for breath.

  After a few seconds she crawls to the edge of the cliff and 
  peeks down into the clearing.


  The scientific contraptions are humming happily away, 
  analyzing the soil, the air, the water, the brains of the 
    indigenous fauna.  The aliens are sitting on alien camp 
  stools, ingesting some sort of alien snack through needle-
  like appendages on their forearms.  Occasionally they throw 
  scraps to the beagles, who are romping about happily at their 
  feet.

  It looks like they re having a fucking picnic.

                                                                  FADE THROUGH TO:

  one she saw long ago with Alan and Amy, except for the fact 
  that it s moving in reverse   rising upward from the ground.  
  It gathers speed before suddenly leveling off, making a sharp 
  lateral turn to the north, and hurtling off into the heavens.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "The Screwfly Solution," Blue, 07/10/06 page 60.
