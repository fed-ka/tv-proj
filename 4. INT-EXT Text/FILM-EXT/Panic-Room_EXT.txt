MANHATTAN - DAY
The whole island, from the south.
For a second.
Literally.
NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY
Closer, just the skyline.
For another second.
UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY
Closer still, the Upper West Side.
For another second.
No
time to waste admiring the scenery.
WEST 83RD STREET - DAY
Race across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women
hurrying down the sidewalk.
LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate
broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a
stride.
MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with
her, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.
SARAH, a nine
year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a
basketball as she goes.
The kid's athletic, much tougher
than Meg, who she resembles.
Lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.
LYDIA
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five
feet deep, forty-two hundred square
feet, four floors with a rentable
basement apartment, so five
altogether, courtyard in back --
MEG
Could you slow down a little?
(looking back over her
shoulder)
Or we could wait for the car...
LYDIA
No cars.
Feet are faster.
MEG
How many more do we have after this?
LYDIA
None, there's nothing else, you know
how tight the market is.
MEG
This is it?
I told you on the
phone, I have to be moved in in two
weeks.
Sarah, please don't bounce
that here.
SARAH
Mom, it's the sidewalk.
LYDIA
Oh, that miserable little prick is
already leaving.
They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story
townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or
more.
EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front
door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.
He sees them
coming.
EVAN
One day you will learn to respect
other people's time, Lydia, one day
you --
LYDIA
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a
saint to wait for us!
CUT TO:
GREAT LAWN - DAY
-- in the middle of the Great Lawn, in Central Park.
She
stands, turns in a circle, she's completely alone on the
great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring
day, tall buildings sparkling in the distance.
Meg stretches her arms out, smiles, but far off in the
distance, she hears a voice calling to her, dimly:
SARAH (O.S.)
Mom?!
Mom!!
Meg ignores the voice, she's so happy to be out here, out in
the open, in the beautiful wide open, she could stay here
forever, she spins around, throws her head back, but there's
that voice again, insistent:
SARAH (O.S.)
Mom, please!!
There is the sharp sound of a SLAP, and Meg's face abruptly
jerks to the side.
She touches her cheek, confused, as a hot
red handprint rises up on it.
What the hell was that?
BAM!
Now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a
deafening CRUNCH.
The smile vanishes from Meg's face, she
turns.
Where did that come from?
BAM!
Another one, even louder.
Meg's whole body winces at
the sound.
BAM!
A third one, and on this one Meg falls to her knees,
covering her ears, walls spring up around her, right there on
the Great Lawn, we rush in on her, the walls close in, and
she's right back --
CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY
The swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the
air over Central Park on a crisp fall day.
The leaves float
down, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we
saw in Meg's hallucination.
But on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,
throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing
nothing.
The leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched
out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open
to the ads.
Meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up
at the clouds.
Sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.
SARAH
I mean, uptown is close to Dad's
place, but somebody at school said
the Village is really cool, so... I
don't know, it's so great to be
close to the park and everything...
What do you think, I mean, give me a
clue, here, where are we gonna live?
Meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.
She seems
years younger.
She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her
daughter's hair behind one ear.
She smiles.
She is calm.
Behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the
clear autumn sky.
FADE OUT.
