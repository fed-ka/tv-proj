      PLUMES OF STEAM billow up under the white noise of a shower 
      spray. Eyes closed, Lydia stands underneath the water, 
      letting it pummel her neck and shoulders. 

      She blinks her eyes open when another sound drifts in. 
      VOICES. Distant, but rising. 

      Confused, Lydia turns off the water, listening to what sounds 
      like the muted ROAR of a CROWD. With a shaky hand, she grasps 
      the shower curtain and draws it back to reveal an impossible 
      sight just beyond it--

      THE HIGH SCHOOL LACROSSE FIELD where dozens of fans in the 
      bleachers cheer and holler for their Beacon Hills team.


      Lydia snaps her head up with a shocked gasp. Clutching sheets 
      and blankets in her hands, she finds herself in bed.

      For a moment, her body eases, settling with a relieved 
      breath. Until she draws back the sheets to find CLUMPS OF 
      DIRT from the lacrosse field all over the bed.

                                  LYDIA
                    Leave me alone.

                                  PETER
                      Unfortunately, I can t.

      On the bed behind her, he whispers into her ear.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    At least not yet.

      She doesn t turn around, too frightened to look at him.

                                  LYDIA
                    Are you real?

                                  PETER
                      Interestingly, that question could 
                    also be answered with not yet.

      As she closes her eyes, his clawed fingers glide lovingly up 
      her bare arms to her shoulders.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    I promise things will get back to 
                    normal. All you have to do, Lydia, 
                    is every single thing I ask.

      His claws dig into her skin causing her to snap her eyes 
      open.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/123.



      Finding herself at the top of the stairs, Lydia nearly 
      stumbles into a fall. She grabs the banister to steady 
      herself. But then Peter takes her arm, pulling her down.

                                  PETER
                    Timing is key here, Lydia. Crucial, 
                    really.

      He yanks her roughly down the last steps while she glances 
      back noticing odd drips of BLACK BLOOD seeping horizontally 
      across the wall.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    It all needs to happen by the next 
                    full moon. Do you know what they 
                    call the full moon in March, Lydia? 
                    The Worm Moon.

      Lydia looks down to see her bare feet surrounded by WORMS.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    They call it that because it was 
                    the last moon of winter and the 
                    worms would crawl out of the earth 
                    as it thawed.

      Lydia gazes up at Peter. Now caked in dirt, dozens of 
      glistening EARTH WORMS crawl over him, between his clothes, 
      through his hair.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Kind of has the feel of a rebirth, 
                    doesn t it?

      He puts a gentle hand at her lower back, urging her forward.


      Lydia steps into the living room with Peter who is perfectly 
      clean once again. They stop at a window looking out on the 
      house s back patio and pool where a PARTY is in full swing.

                                  LYDIA
                    But the full moon is on Wednesday. 
                    That s my birthday.

                                  PETER
                    Exactly. And Lydia s birthday is 
                    always the party of the year, isn t 
                    it? Everyone wants to be invited to 
                    Lydia s party.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/124.

      Within the crowd, Lydia spots herself cheerfully handing out 
      drinks in plastic cups.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    So we re going to have to make it a 
                    very special party.

                                  LYDIA
                    What if I don t?

      The view outside changes instantly. The party guests now lie 
      on the ground, dead and bloodied. A BODY floats in the pool.

                                  PETER
                    I think it s best if we just a make 
                    a plan and stick to it. That way no 
                    one gets hurt.

      Peter looks from Lydia to the party guests outside who now 
      stand, silently staring at Lydia with blank, lifeless eyes.

      Arm around her, Peter guides Lydia away from the window.

                                  LYDIA
                    Why me?

                                  PETER
                    Because Lydia Martin is not only 
                      beautiful, not only incredibly 
                      intelligent, she s also immune.

                                  LYDIA
                    Immune to what?

                                  PETER
                    That s right. No one s told you 
                    yet, have they? I bet you ve felt 
                    like the last to know for a long 
                    time. That doesn t feel good, does 
                    it?

      Lydia shakes her head.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Then you deserve to know 
                      everything. And it s probably 
                    better if I just show you.

      Lydia glances up behind her to see what he means. But Peter 
      is gone. She s alone in the living room. Except, she s not 
      entirely alone... 

      Chest rising with each breath, Lydia turns to the window.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/125.

      Outside, within the dark shadows, TWO GLOWING RED EYES drift 
      into focus. As Lydia s own eyes widen in terror, a snarling, 
      fanged monstrosity emerges, the face of the former Alpha.

      With a piercing SNARL, it launches up and SMASHES RIGHT 
      THROUGH THE WINDOW--

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      A MEDICAL KIT snaps open. Argent quickly grabs alcohol swabs 
      and gauze while Victoria slumps into a chair. They begin 
      cleaning and dressing the bite on her shoulder.

                                  ARGENT
                    It s not that deep.

      Argent notices Gerard standing by the stairs, watching.

                                  VICTORIA
                    It s all right. I can clean it 
                    myself.

      She takes the gauze and alcohol from him. Letting her be, 
      Argent eases away from her and toward Gerard.

                                  ARGENT
                    It s not that bad. We don t know. 
                    We can t know. Not for sure.

                                  GERARD
                    It s a bite from an Alpha.

      Gerard keeps a calm stare on his distraught son.

                                  ARGENT
                    She s my wife--Allison s mother.

                    And I m the cold-hearted patriarch

                                  ARGENT
                    If that s your way of warning me to 
                    not be indecisive, I wasn t aware 
                    the code allowed for a choice.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/126.

      Gerard pulls Argent toward the stairs and out of earshot.

                                  GERARD
                    She ll do what she has to and 
                    you ll help her.

                                  ARGENT
                    And what about Allison? How I am 
                    supposed to get her through this? 
                    We just buried Kate.

                                  GERARD
                    Then tell me how long is long 
                    enough? When exactly do you think 
                    Allison will be emotionally 
                    prepared enough to handle the death 
                    of her mother?

                                  ARGENT
                    She deserves longer than a day.

                                  GERARD
                    Or maybe she s lucky to have that.

                                  ARGENT
                    She can t lose her too.

                                  GERARD
                    You re getting your tenses mixed 
                    up. Your wife is already dead. That 
                    thing over there is just a cocoon 
                    waiting to hatch.

      Gerard starts up the stairs while Argent turns back to see 
      Victoria at the table, diligently yet pointlessly bandaging 
      her wound.


      Clicking on a hanging work light, Derek lumbers into the 
      train with an equally weary Scott in tow.

                          (shaking his head)
                    I m the one who turned him. It s my

                                  SCOTT
                    But you didn t turn him into this. 
                    That happened because of something

                    That s a legend in a book. It s not

                    What do you mean? What are you not

                                  DEREK
                    Maybe I do it to protect you.

                    Doesn t being part of your pack

      He gives her a smile, placing his hand over hers. A gesture 
      of friendship. He gets out and shuts the door.

      Allison thumbs the LOCK BUTTON and settles back with a 
      worried sigh. Her eyes fall on the driver s side window. 
      Leaning in, she lightly breathes on the glass.

      It steams up, but there s no secret message from Scott.

      Disappointed, Allison reaches for the gear shift. But then 
      she notices Matt s BAG lying in front of the passenger seat. 
      When she pulls it up by the strap, his DIGITAL CAMERA falls 
      into the seat.

      Allison picks up the camera to put it back in the bag. Her 
      thumb accidentally hits a button and the LCD screen 
      BRIGHTENS.

      With a smile, she peers over a superb image of a BEACON HILLS 
      LACROSSE GAME. Stadium lights arcing out over the players.

      Allison clicks to the next picture. Another brilliant shot. 
      But the next one is a picture of Scott, his eyes GLOWING. 
      Allison sits up, alarmed. She clicks to another picture of

      A picture of her.

      The picture is a candid, obviously taken when she wasn t

      more unnerved, she hits the button again. Yet another picture 
      of her, this one taken during school.

      Heart beginning to pound in her ears, she keeps clicking. One 
      photo after another. Dozens of them. Possibly hundreds.

      KNUCKLES RAP against the window.

      Allison jumps, nearly dropping the camera. Matt looks in from 
      the passenger-side with a somewhat disconcerting smile. He 
      mouths  open the window  and points.

      Allison hesitates.

      A METAL THUNK comes from outside as Matt tries the door 
      handle. He points again. Still smiling.

      Finally, Allison hits the window button, lowering it.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1210.

                    Yeah.

      Allison keeps her finger on the window button as Matt reaches 
      in, scooping his camera into his bag. Hands wrapped around 
      the strap, he doesn t pull out his arm just yet.

                                  MATT
                    Some good pics in there, you think?

                    Yeah. I noticed the lacrosse ones. 
                    They re amazing. You re really 
                    talented. I was really impressed.

                                    ALLISON
                    Really?

      Finger still held on the button, she waits for Matt to pull 
      his arm out.

      Allison glances down to see his hand wrapped around the strap

                    I m sure.

      Finally, Matt pulls his bag out. Allison doesn t even bother 
      to raise the window. She shifts to DRIVE and guns it.

      Gripping his bag in one hand, camera in the other, Matt 
      stares after Allison s car. 

      And he s no longer smiling.

      FADE IN:


      Derek pulls a length of chain out of his family s trunk. 
      Isaac kneels beside him, noticing the spirals repeated on the 
      inside.

                                  ISAAC
                    What is that symbol anyway?

                                  BOYD
                    It s a triskele.

      Boyd steps in to help Derek with the chains while Erica 
      watches from the door of the train.

                    The three spirals mean different 
                    things to different cultures.

                          (impressed)
                    That s right. It s a spiral to 
                    remind us we can always rise to one 
                    or fall back to another. Betas can 
                    become Alphas. But Alphas can fall 
                    to Beta. Or even Omega.

      The others turn to see her flash a smirk. Boyd laughs. Derek 
      even cracks a smile. But only for a moment. He raises a steel 
      HEAD BAND with SHARP PINS that screw into the wearer s skull.

                                  DEREK
                    This one s for you.

      He tosses it forward as--


      The door to Allison s room swings open to reveal an unusually 
      perky Lydia raising two handfuls of bags from Macy s.

                    Clear your schedule. This could 
                    take a while.

      She brushes past Allison and drops the bags full of clothes 
      on the bed.

      While she begins laying out clothes on the bed, Allison 
      gently broaches a worrisome subject.

                    I m just wondering if maybe this

                    You know, things have been a little 
                    off lately. Things and people. 
                      Especially people. Like Jackson.

      Her response is oddly sinister. Breaking into a smile again, 
      Lydia models a dress in front of a mirror.

      She yanks another item out of the bag.

                    No one s seen him since last night

                    This is definitely your color. 
                    Although, honestly, Allison, you 
                    have to start spray-tanning. You re 
                    starting to look goth and I don t 
                    even know if it s called goth 
                    anymore. It s just pale and pasty

      Victoria gives a nod as Allison returns her attention to 
      Lydia. Blood at her shoulder, perspiration on her brow, 
      Victoria starts to leave. But then gives a last look back.

      Allison pulls on a jacket, eliciting a nod of approval from 
      Lydia. They look for once like ordinary teenage girls.

      An unusually sincere smile finds its way to Victoria s lips.

      light of the bedroom. And into darkness.

                    That means you re a witness. You re 
                    going to have to give a statement.

                                  STILES
                    But the concert promoter, Kara, 
                    wasn t in Harris s class. And what 
                    does Mr. Lahey have to do with 
                    Harris?

                                  STILINSKI
                    It doesn t matter. The tire tracks 
                    put Harris at the site of three 
                    murders. That s damning evidence.

                                  STILES
                    It s not enough.

      He yanks open the yearbook again, flipping through pages.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I thought you hated this guy?

                                  STILES
                    I don t hate him. He hates me. And 
                    if he did kill them, then yeah, 
                    lock the psycho up. But there s 
                    something missing. There has to be.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1218.

      Stilinski puts his hand on the yearbook, keeping Stiles from 
      turning the pages any further.

                                  STILINSKI
                    You don t have to solve this for 
                    me.

                                  STILES
                    I have to do something.

      Stilinski moves to close the yearbook once and for all, but 
      then pauses. Hand held on a page, he leans forward.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    What?

      Stiles peers over his hand to see the yearbook opened to the 
      section showing the PHOTOS OF ATHLETIC TEAMS.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Look at the swim team.

      Pictured in speedos and one-piece suits are the Mens and 
      Women s Beacon Hills Swim Teams. Jessica, Sean, the Mechanic, 
      the Promoter. Even Camden Lahey s name appears in the list.

                                  STILES
                    Dad. The coach...

      Stilinski squints to get a clearer look. The now deceased man 
      standing behind his team is unmistakable. Mr. Lahey.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    It s Isaac s dad.

      FADE IN:


      THE DOORBELL RINGS throughout the house while a hand 
      delicately picks up a tray of drink-filled plastic cups. 
      Swinging the tray around, Lydia opens the door.

      A GIGANTIC BIRTHDAY PRESENT with two legs behind it stands 
      before her. Struggling to hold up the massive box, Stiles 
      peers out from behind it.

                                  STILES
                    Happy birthday!

      Lydia opens the door wider. Stiles tries to get in with the 
      present. But it s far too big to get through the door frame.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Um, okay... maybe if I just...

      Pushing the box forward, he begins to shove it in. The 
      wrapping paper tears at the sides, box crumpling until 
      finally, Stiles manages to ram it through.

      The partially wrecked present drops to the floor, but Lydia 
      is already hurrying off into the house.

      Scott steps in beside Stiles and follows him through the 
      house to the glass doors leading out to the patio and pool.

                                  STILES
                    You see Jackson?

                                  SCOTT
                    No. You see Allison?

                                  STILES
                    No. But we should tell her what we 
                    found.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m still kind of not sure what we 
                    found.

                                  STILES
                    We figured out it s something to do 
                    with water. The fact that all the 
                    victims were on the swim team. The 
                    way the Kanima reacted around the 
                    pool.

                                  SCOTT
                    So whoever s controlling the Kanima 
                    really hates the swim team?

                                  STILES
                    Hated the swim team. Specifically, 
                    the 2006 team. So it could be 
                    another teacher, a student back 
                    then. Who are we missing? What 
                    haven t we thought of?

                                  SCOTT
                    Right now, all I can think of is 
                    getting through tonight.

      Scott opens the glass door and steps out to the patio where--


      THE DOORBELL RINGS. As a hand reaches out for the knob, the 
      house falls to perfect silence.

      The door slowly clicks open to reveal the TWO DRAG QUEENS 
      that were fondly attentive to Stiles in the gay club. Behind 
      them, dozens of teens and twenty-somethings, straight and gay 
      alike, wait patiently to get in.

                                  LYDIA
                    And you are?

                                  DRAG QUEEN
                    We re here for the party.

      Lydia sizes her up. Then, surprisingly, pushes the door open.

                                  LYDIA
                    Well, come on in.

      A CHEER erupts and the crowd rushes the house.


      THE CLATTER of chains drowns out Erica and Boyd s nervous 
      breaths as Isaac helps Derek lock them down. Manacles around 
      his wrists and ankles, Boyd watches Derek fit the steel band 
      onto Erica s head.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1223.

                    Then you ll do anything you can to 
                    get out of here. You ll probably 
                    try to kill me. Then you might try 
                    to kill each other. Then you ll try 
                    to kill anything else with a 
                      heartbeat.

      Derek motions to Isaac.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    I need you to hold her for me.

      Slipping behind Erica, Isaac wraps his arms around her.

                                  ISAAC
                    How come she gets the head band?

                                  DEREK
                    Because she ll be able to withstand 
                    more pain of the two of you. But 
                    I ve got an extra if you want one.

                                  ISAAC
                    I ll pass.

                                  DEREK
                          (to Erica)
                    You ready?

      Trying to look fearless, Erica nods. Derek turns one of the 
      pins. She winces in pain as it goes into her skull. As Derek 
      turns the pin again--


      Erica s SHRIEK soars out of the train and throughout the 
      abandoned station. Screaming mixed with animal howls of 
      agony, the sounds nearly shake the walls.


      The train shudders with the CLANKING of chains against bolts, 
      Boyd and Erica beginning to respond to the full moon. A few 
      seats down, Derek hurries to finish securing Isaac. Teeth 
      clenched, the boy s chest heaves with each breath.

                                  ISAAC
                    How do you not feel this?

                                  DEREK
                    I feel every second of it.

                                  ISAAC
                    So how do you control it?

                                  DEREK
                    You find an anchor. You think about 
                    something meaningful. You bind 
                    yourself to it. And it keeps the 
                    human side in control.

                                  ISAAC
                    What is it for you?

                                  DEREK
                    Anger. But it doesn t have to be 
                    that for everyone.

                                  ISAAC
                    You mean Scott?

      Derek nods and locks the last chain to a bolt on the floor.

                                  DEREK
                    That should do it--

      But when he yanks it up to test it, the bolt comes right out 
      of the floor with a puff of dust. Derek and Isaac share a 
      nervous look. Then both glance to the other end of the train 
      car where--

      TWO SETS of GLOWING EYES stare ominously back. Erica and Boyd 
      beginning to transform.


      Under the dim light in the basement, Victoria clicks open a 
      black case. Positioned in foam are different types of KNIVES.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1227.

                    But you re not most women.

                    I ll go up and write the letter.

      She heads for the stairs while Argent turns back to Gerard 
      who has been watching from a corner.

                    Allison will feel the ground

                    It d be easier if she could get

      Allison steps into a bedroom with Matt. She takes a last sip 
      of Lydia s punch, sets the empty cup down and turns to him.

      Matt moves to close the door. But Allison gives him a look.

                    I think you should be the subject 
                    of a perfect photograph?

      Allison keeps her eyes on the door. People pass by, stepping 
      around an odd figure in DARK CLOTHES and BLACK BOOTS.

                                    ALLISON

      He grabs her arm. Allison whips around, kicking Matt s feet 
      out from under him. With a CRY of PAIN, he SLAMS to the 
      carpet, arm pinned behind his back.

      Stunned by her own reaction, Allison backs away.

      stare in at Matt.


      Allison charges down the stairs and into the crowded living 
      room. A FIGURE IN BLACK moves between the party guests. Black

                    No. No, not here.

      Bodies part as the crossbow rises, Allison glancing about for 
      Scott, desperate to warn him.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Scott!

      But the crossbow FIRES. Except the BOLT goes right into 
      Allison. Stunned, she looks down at the arrow in her stomach. 
      Then gazes up to the approaching figure...              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1231.

      CONTINUED:2424

      None other than herself. Dressed in black, outfitted not for 
      a party but for a night hunt in the woods. Loading a new 
      bolt, Hunter Allison raises the crossbow again.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Look at you. Yelling for help. 
                    Always yelling for help. Pathetic. 
                    I can t tell you how much I ve been 
                    looking forward to this.

      She FIRES the crossbow. Allison snaps her head up, back 
      hitting the wall as the pulsing BEAT of the music hammers her 
      back to reality.

      Hands on her stomach, there s nothing there. No crossbow 
      bolt, no blood.

      Still dizzy and distraught, she turns, moving for the front 
      door, charging out of the house and away from the nightmare.


      Argent discovers the door to Allison s room ajar. Victoria 
      sits on the bed, a photograph of her and Allison in her 
      hands.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I didn t get a chance to talk to 
                    her. So I think I want to do it 
                    here. Where I can be with her. But 
                    I need your help.

      Argent shuts the door and sits down on the bed beside her.

                                  ARGENT
                    Tell me what you want me to do.


      Blinking rapidly, Scott reaches out for something to steady 
      himself in the guest house. His hand closes around the 
      banister to the stairs.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1234.

      CONTINUED:2828

      The music from outside gradually fades, replaced by the 
      SOUNDS of KISSING. Soft moans and urgent breathes.

      Scott s glazed eyes drift up to the top of the stairs where a 
      daybed sits underneath a large set of windows.

      Allison leans back on the daybed, Jackson straddling her as 
      he kisses her neck. His lips move to hers and she kisses him 
      back, mouth opening to his.

      Starting forward, Scott blinks.

      It s no longer Jackson kissing Allison. It s the Kanima. Its 
      scaled, wet lips pressing to hers, double-rowed teeth digging 
      into her cheek as she moans. Claws drawing her closer and 
      closer, they stop. Both of them turning to look down at Scott 
      who--

      Opens his mouth with a SNARL, fangs appearing, eyes GLOWING. 
      But just as suddenly, he whips his head to the side and is 
      back to normal. 

      Now there is nothing and no one on the daybed.

                                  SCOTT
                          (realizing)
                    Lydia...


      The train shakes and vibrates, dust popping into the air amid 
      ferocious SNARLS. Erica s mouth snaps open, fangs protruding. 
      Despite the steel band, her head whips back in a frenzy.

      Chains rattling, Boyd grits his teeth in agony as his ears 
      stretch into points. 

      Past him, a ferocious Isaac yanks his hands against his 
      chains, stretching them taut.


      With the SOUND of BENDING METAL piercing the air, an 
        increasingly uneasy Derek puts his phone to his ear.

                                  DEREK
                    Scott, call me back. I think I m 
                    going to need some help here.

      He hangs up and pockets the phone. From inside the train 
      comes an alarming sound. Not metal bending. But BREAKING.

      Derek snaps his fists open to reveal CLAWS, preparing to 
      defend himself.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                      Definitely going to need to some 
                    help.


      Stepping inside the train, Derek peers from one ravenous 
      werewolf to the next, all of them now completely transformed. 

      Then, as predicted, Erica breaks free first.

      CHAINS clattering to the floor, she s on her feet instantly 
      and charging Derek. She swipes a claw through the air, but he 
      ducks it easily and--

      WITH A SPLINTERING CRACK, Isaac tears free of his manacles. 
      He spins, snarling as a full wolf. Derek starts to move, but 
      Isaac is too fast.

      He launches right out of the window to escape.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1236.

      But Boyd drags Derek back, free now as well.


      Claw marks on his skin, tears all over his shirt, Derek 
      fights Erica and Boyd, trying to pummel them back as they try 
      to battle their way free.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1237.

      CONTINUED:3535

      Managing to latch another manacle around Erica s ankle, Derek 
      turns as Boyd starts up. Erica s claws dug into him, Derek 
      can t get up fast enough.

      Boyd is about to escape like Isaac. But then just as he 
      rushes toward the opening at the head of the train.

      SOMEONE SLAMS HIM BACK DOWN, flat onto the floor.

      Derek looks up in astonishment. It s Isaac. Clawed hand over 
      Boyd s chest, he peers back at Derek, seemingly in control.


      Victoria directs the point of the knife toward her heart, but 
      Argent stays her hands.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I can feel it. It s happening.

      Argent keeps his hands over hers, unwilling to let go yet.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    You know what to do? You know what 
                    to tell people, right? You re going 
                    to have to tell them I had a 
                    history of depression. Promise me.

                                  ARGENT
                    I will. Even though I ve never seen 
                    you depressed once in twenty years.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Allison needs to say it too.

                                  ARGENT
                    But I won t let her believe it.

                                  VICTORIA
                    She s going to hear things. People 
                    will say I was weak.

                                  ARGENT
                    Then I ll remind her you were 
                    stronger than the rest of us.

                    She ll know you did it for us.

      MOONLIGHT spills in through the window causing Victoria s 
      breathing to become shallow.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I can t do it myself.

      Argent hesitates, his own eyes glistening.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Chris... Help me.

      Both of their hands gripped tightly around the hilt of the 
      blade, the MOONLIGHT reaches the bed, rising up the side. 
      Victoria s head tilts back, her eyes GLOWING YELLOW.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Now.

      Together, they push the knife in. Victoria s hands squeeze 
      over Argent s. And then relax. The GLOW in her eyes fades.

      Under the soft light of the moon, her head gently falls onto 
      his shoulder while his arms wrap around her. Holding her up.


      With the still feral Erica and Boyd locked back up, Isaac 
      sits down to allow Derek to chain him as well.

                    You sure? I think you could be okay 
                    now.

      But Isaac holds his hands up for Derek to cuff them. He 
      obliges.

                    He didn t used to.

      Derek meets his eyes with a look of understanding. And then 
      locks the chains down. 


      Weary and beaten, Derek steps out of the train for a moment 
      to be alone. But catching a scent, he turns around as--

      Lydia steps out of the shadows. She raises her hand and blows 
      a PURPLE DUST from her palm into Derek s face.

      Staggering back, he gasps, coughing and sputtering as he 
      inhales the dust. Eyelids fluttering, Derek sways and then 
      falls, SLAMMING right to the floor. 

      Unconscious at Lydia s feet.

      FADE IN:


      Allison fumbles for the light switch and steps into her room. 
      Dropping her jacket onto a chair, she moves to the bed to lie 
      down when she notices something.

      A LETTER sits on the bed spread. She picks it up, unfolds it 
      and begins to read. 

        A SILHOUETTE appears at the door. Allison lowers the letter.

                                    ALLISON
                    If this is some kind of training 
                    thing you better tell me right now.

      She searches Argent s face. But there s no sign of deception. 
      Just an exhausted look of defeat.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    This is true?

                                  ARGENT
                    Yes.

      Her fist closes on the letter, crumpling it, fingernails 
      tearing through it as her voice cracks with both pain and 
      anger.

                                    ALLISON
                    Then how about you tell me what 
                    really happened.


      Derek blinks back the blurry haze, slowly returning to 
      consciousness. Eyes drifting left and right, he notices that 
      he s moving. Or more correctly, being dragged.

                                  DEREK
                          (weakly)
                    Stop...

      But Lydia only tightens her grip on the sleeves of his jacket 
      as she hauls him further into the Hale House.

      Above him, Derek sees a bizarre sight. A HOLE in the charred 
      remains of the roof. Positioned around this hole are SHARDS 
      OF MIRROR.

      SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHARDS lie attached to the walls, 
      strategically placed. Vines of WOLFSBANE have grown around 
      the mirrors, snaking down the wall and toward the floor.

      Derek manages to turn his head to see the Wolfsbane collects 
      into a HOLE IN THE FLOORBOARDS. An AX lies amid splinters of 
      wood where Lydia must have chopped out the floor.

      Eyes blinking rapidly in alarm, Derek tries to struggle free.

                    Lydia... stop...

      Paying no attention to his protests, Lydia draws him toward 
      the hole, pushing him onto his side at the broken 
        floorboards.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Lydia... you don t... You don t 
                    know what you re doing.

      Yanking his arm, she positions it down into the darkness.

      BELOW THE FLOORBOARDS - the Wolfsbane vines reach toward 
      Peter Hale s body. Eyes closed, his hand twists up toward the 
      floor of the house as if reaching up to grasp something.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1243.

      Glancing up, Derek sees the FULL MOON through the roof s 
      opening, slowly but inexorably moving into position while 
      Lydia struggles to push Derek s arm further into the ground.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Lydia, stop.

      But Derek s limp hand slides into Peter s open palm as--THE 
      LIGHT OF THE FULL MOON strikes the first mirror. It bounces 
      to the next and the next, filling the dark room with a 
      momentary but BRILLIANT GLOW.

      THE PURPLE FLOWERS along the Wolfsbane vine flutter in the 
      wind as if a kind of magic had taken over the room.

      The moonlight falls over Derek s prostrate body, bouncing 
      down into the open hole of the floor and with a shocking 
        suddenness--

      PETER S HAND WRAPS AROUND DEREK S, claws sinking into the new 
      Alpha s flesh.

      Derek opens his mouth to scream, eyes BURNING WITH A RED GLOW 
      as he ROARS in pain.

      Beneath the floorboards, Peter s eyes snap open, a sickly 
      YELLOW GLOW simmering around the death black irises.

      HANDS SMASH THROUGH THE FLOORBOARDS, cracking and splintering 
      in an EXPLOSION of dust and black dirt as Peter Hale BURSTS 
      out of his shallow grave.

      Derek pulls back while behind him Lydia gazes on with a 
      mixture of fear and awe.

      Caked in black dirt and debris, Peter slowly rises up to 
      stand in front of them. The burns are gone. The red eyes of 
      an Alpha replaced by a greenish yellow, he slowly focuses on 
      Derek and Lydia.
