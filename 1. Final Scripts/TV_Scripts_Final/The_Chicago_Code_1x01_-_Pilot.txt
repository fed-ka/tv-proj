JAREKWYSOCKI(40's) - A local legend and outsized character, Jarek stands atcenter of the

American, Chicago-born and raised DETECTIVE with a wicked senseof humor, a cynic'seye, 

buta romantic'sheart.

entertaining, tough-lookingpuppy dogwho wants badlytobe Jarek'snext "project". Caleb

more driven than his demeanor hints at and ultimatelythe perfect yingtoJarek's yang.


TERESA COLVIN(38) - A fastriser and skilled cop, Teresa hasarrived atthe verytop of the 

Chicago Police Departmentin a veryshort period of time. She did this byprovingherself on the 

streets,bycharmingthose in power above her and byabsorbingeverythingJarek taughther over 

the years.


ANTONIO BETZ(25) - A Latino kid from thedangerous Westsideof Chicago, Antonio 

escaped streetlife due in no small parttoTeresa who oversaw an outreach program for 

disadvantagedkids12 yearsago. She gave him a chance and he took it. He graduated high school 

and became a cop. He'snow Teresa'sdriver/bodyguard and also often her confidant. He's her 

cultural and ethnic touchstone to thestreets and as such he has a ton of influence through her. 

She'salso his mentor as she triestopass on much of whatJarek has taught her over the years. 


VONDAWYSOCKI (26) - A youngbeatcopper (whatChicago cops call uniformed officers), 

VondaisJarek'sniece (and in his mind, hisresponsibility). She's carried on the familytradition of 

becominga copeven though her father waskilled in theline of duty when she was young. She's a 

natural for the job havingspenta lifetime preparingfor it. She and her partner are currently 

tasked to the Organized Crime Division, which meansthatin addition to ridinga beat, theyalso

believescan cloud your mind and getyou killed. 


ISAACJOINER(30's) - A verycharismatic African-American beatcopper who is Vonda's 

partner, Isaac seems to gravitate to the adrenalin and excitementof this job. He naturally 

considers himself indestructible and "lucky" and asa resultputshimself, and thus Vonda, in 

occasionallytricky, dangerous  situations. She always follows himthough. While Vonda is falling 

for him veryhard, Isaac isattracted justenough to gethimself into some real troubleand to set 

her upfor some real heartache. Isaac has a real generational conflictwithJarek, fueled primarily 

  bythisgrowingrelationshipwithhis niece. ALDERMANPATRICK GIBBONS(60)  -- Thelongtime Irish buildingmagnate turned 

politician, Gibbonshasruled hisward witha velvetglove for three decades. His constituents love 

him, butthere have always been loud whispers and knowingglancesthaton the edgesof his 

financial empire are the classic markings of organizedcrime. Gibbons would have been mayor 

years ago, butitwould have been a stepdown for him. Jarek and Teresa are convinced he'sdirty 

athis coreand when theytie a murder in the pilotepisode to Gibbons' empire, theybecome 

determined thatnow is the time to finallybringGibbons to justice.


LIAM HENNESEY(30) - An Irish tough guyin Gibbons' construction empire, with a dangerous

                    We re the South Side and the North 
                    Shore.  We re steak joints and dive 
                    bars.  We re jazz on Rush Street and 
                    shoppers on Michigan Av.  We gave the 
                    world Oprah, Obama and the  85 Bears. 
                    And we would ve thrown a knockout 
                    Olympics if those crooks who run the 
                    thing hadn t bought it for Brazil 
                    instead.  We delivered Kennedy the 
                    presidency and eight years later threw 
                    a convention no one ll ever forget.

                    It s clear!  Come on!

    He proceeds, but not fast enough for Jarek s tastes.

                    People think the city s reputation for 
                    crime started with Al Capone, but 
                    Chicago was such a lawless cesspool, 
                    that when the Great Fire destroyed 
                    half the town in 1871, many thought it 
                    was simply God s retribution.

                                        JAREK (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                    Even after the fire, and before 
                    Capone, one newspaper wrote  Chicago 
                    is infested with a horde of thieves, 
                    burglars and cut-throats, bent on 
                    plunder, and who will not hesitate to 
                    burn, pillage and even murder.

                      Unfortunately, some things never 
                    change.

      BACK TO THE PRESENT AS --

    The car roars past MALCOLM X. COLLEGE and under the 
      EISENHOWER EXPRESSWAY --

                                        JAREK
                    Get there, Bill.

    The car approaches W. Harrison as a BLACK MUSTANG 
      CAREENSpast.  Bill SLAMS on the brakes to avoid hitting 
    it or the 8 POLICE CARS tailing.  It s a high speed 
      chase and Jarek can only sit and watch the parade go by.

                                        JAREK
                    Harrison s closed at Halsted.  He ll 
                    try to cross the river at the 
                    Roosevelt Bridge.  Beat him there.

                                        BILL
                    I ll try.

      Jarek stares daggers at him.

      QUICK FLASHof YOUNG JAREK, in a line of rookies, having 
    his badge PINNED to his chest by his FATHER (his face 
      unseen).  Young Jarek SMILES with PRIDE, shakes hands.

                                        JAREK (V.O.)
                    When my father pinned the badge on me, 
                    he said shake hands with the good 
                    citizens of this city using a velvet 
                    glove, but keep a razor blade hidden 
                     tween your fingers for the rest of 
                     em.  Also told me the moment I ever 
                    felt safe, remember I was just a dumb 
                    Pollock, as capable as the next idiot 
                    of getting my head shot off.

      EXT. W. HARRISON ST. (65 MPH) - DAY

      Inside the Black Mustang, LUIS ESPERANZA, 23, sees a 
        SQUADCARapproach alongside.  He sticks a HANDGUN out 
    the open window, fires a WARNING SHOT.  The SQUAD CAR
      slows down, falls back in line.  Distracted, Luis BASHES 
    the side of a parked car, bounces off and keeps going.                                                                                      3.


      EXT. W. ROOSEVELT RD. (75 MPH) - DAY

      Bill drives as Jarek cranes his head, sees A POLICE 
      HELICOPTER in the sky heading their direction.

                                        JAREK
                    Coming our way.

    As they approach the Halstedintersection, Jarek and 
      Bill both look to their left for oncoming traffic, see --

    THE BLACK MUSTANG heading straight for them. 

                                        JAREK
                    Go!

      Bill ACCELERATES, avoids being sideswiped by the Mustang 
      which FISHTAILS, falls behind them, one lane over.

                                        JAREK
                    Slow down, get even with him.

      Bill slows so that the Mustang catches up.  Luis points 
    his gun out the window.  Bill slams on the brakes, 
      almost gets rear ended by the lead trail car.

                                        JAREK
                    Catch back up to him.

                                        BILL
                    He s armed.

                                        JAREK
                    I know this guy.  He won t shoot me.

                                        BILL
                    Nah, he ll miss you, hit me. 

                                        JAREK
                    Catch up to him or I ll toss you out 
                    right here and now.

      Beat.  Bill doesn t believe him.  Jarek reaches across 
      Bill and unlocks Bill s door --

      Bill accelerates and catches up to Luis.  As Luis raises 
    his gun from 4 feet away, both cars still going 70 --

                                        JAREK
                    Luis!  It s me.

                                        LUIS
                    Wysocki?

                                        JAREK
                    You re gonnaget your head shot off!  
                    What s going on, Luis?                                                                                      4.


                                        LUIS
                    I m in a stolen ride, man.  Plus I got 
                    the gun and some weed and I m on 
                    parole.  How many years is that?

                                        JAREK
                    Doesn t have to be the rest of your 
                    life.  Nobody s hurt yet.

                                        LUIS
                    Lookin to go out in a blaze of glory, 
                    man.  Just stallin  til the news

                    What about your girlfriend, Luis?  
                    What s her name again?

                                        LUIS
                    Maya?  She s pregnant.  It s a boy.

                                        JAREK
                    Yeah?  What about that kid, Luis?  You 
                    don t want to live to see him?

                                        LUIS

                                        JAREK
                    Why don t you explain it all to Maya?  
                    Where is she right now?

                                        LUIS
                    At the flower shop, working.

                                        JAREK
                    Let s go there then.  Okay?

                                        LUIS
                    Don t play games on me.

                                        JAREK
                    Wouldn t do that to you, Luis.  I ll 
                    let you hug her, kiss her goodbye.  
                    You wanna do that, Luis?  You want to 
                    kiss Maya goodbye, feel your son s 
                    kick?  Just drop the gun out that 
                    window and follow us there.

      A beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Today s a good day to trust me.

      Beat, then the gun CLATTERS to the street at 60 MPH, 
      gets run over by a trailing squad car.                                                                                      5.


      HELICOPTER SHOT

      Bill and Jarek s car pulls in front of the black Mustang 
    and the whole line of cars slows --

      EXT. FLOWER SHOP - DAY

      A very pregnant MAYA, 23, waits anxiously outside the 
      flower shop with two BEAT COPPERS (Chicago slang for 
      Uniform Officers) and assorted Lookie-Loos.

      Jarek and Bill s car appears, followed by the black 
      Mustang and the eight Squad cars.  Bill parks, Luis does 
    the same.  Jarek exits, approaches Luis --

                                        JAREK
                    Let s see the hands, Luis.

      Luis complies, gets out of the car.  Jarek indicates the 
      nervous wreck Maya --

                                        JAREK
                    Maya looks beautiful.  Congratson the 
                    kid.  You got one minute with her.

      Luis approaches Maya, who throws herself into his arms.

                                        MAYA
                    Oh my God, Luis.  What s going on?

      Luis puts a hand on her belly.  Kisses her.

                                        LUIS
                    I m so sorry, baby.

      Away from this, Bill stares at Jarek, pissed.

                                        BILL
                    You almost got me killed, asshole!

                                        JAREK
                              (re: citizens)
                    Lose the language, women and children.

                                        BILL
                    I said you almost got me killed.

                                        JAREK
                    You re right.  I m sorry about that.

                                        BILL
                    Just  cause you rub elbows and 
                    whatever the hell other body parts 
                    with the new Superintendent, doesn t

                                        JAREK
                    It s clear this partnership isn t 
                    going to work.  We re just not a 
                    match.  I ll let your Lieutenant know 
                    to reassign you at our mutual request.

                                        BILL
                    After one day together?  Screw you.

                                        JAREK

                                (beat)
                    I need the car keys.

      Bill FLINGS them hard at Jarek s chest.  Jarek catches 
      them though, calmly puts them back in his pocket. 

                                        JAREK
                    Appreciate the time and effort.  Best 
                    of luck to you out there.

      Jarek turns and approaches Luis and Maya --

                                        LUIS
                    They really got me this time, chica.

                                (offher anguish)
                    Before I go though, I know this prolly
                    ain t the right moment...

      Luis drops to a knee, takes her hand.  She wells up.

                                        LUIS
                    And I don t got a ring or nothin , but 
                    will you marry me, Maya?

                                        MAYA
                     course I ll marry you, Luis.

    The civilian crowd applauds, oohsand ahhs.

                                        LUIS
                    You ll wait for me to get out?

                                        MAYA
                    Sure I will.

      Jarek shakes his head at the beat coppers.  No way 
      she ll wait.  As Jarek breaks up the kissing couple --

                                        JAREK
                    Come on, Luis.  Honeymoon s over.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET - DAY

      A DEAD BODY (20 s, Hispanic) lies in the middle of the 
      street, eyes peacefully closed, dressed in an impeccable 
      SUIT and TIE.  Surprisingly, no blood, no mess.

                                        CALEB (V.O.)
                    How does a thirty-eight year old woman 
                    get put in charge of 10,000 Chicago 
                    police officers?

      CALEB EVERS, Early 30 s, boyish, but tall and athletic, 
      walks towards the crime scene.  Caleb eyes Jarek, at a 
      distance, talking with SUPERINTENDENT TERESA COLVIN, 38.

                                        CALEB (V.O.)
                    It helps if the city s first choice, a 
                    fellow from Texas, takes in a little 
                    too much of the local flavor with a 
                    camera-phone nearby.

      QUICK FLASHof a 60 YEAR OLD MAN, in the back area of a 
      night club with two nubile ESCORTS (20 s), one on his 
      lap, the other s 36Cbreast spilling out of his hand.

      BACK ON CALEB as he eyes Jarek gesticulating to Teresa.

                                        CALEB (V.O.)
                    The city s second choice, a thirty-
                    year Chicago P.D. vetseemed like a 
                    lock til he had a heart attack and his 
                    wife made him take early retirement.  
                    So Teresa Colvin, the controversial 
                    choice, became the only choice left.

      QUICK FLASHof a camera PANNING down a long line of 
      PHOTOGRAPHS on a wall -- City Superintendents over the 
      years, from 1861 to the present.  All are OLD MEN, 
      almost all white.

                                        CALEB (V.O.)
                    To understand the tornado this sent 
                    through Chicago establishment, you 
                    need to know the Department s history.

    The Camera finally lands on the PORTRAIT of Teresa.  She 
      could not stand out more from her predecessors.

                                        CALEB (V.O.)
                    For a city that has run for decades on 
                    the good old boy network, they didn t 
                    know what to do with a young broad.                                                                                      8.


      BACK ON Caleb as he walks towards the crime scene --

                                        CALEB (V.O.)
                    My take is a boss with seventeen years 
                    on the Chicago force, someone who hits 
                    the streets with her men rather than 
                    hiding behind her desk or lounging on 
                    the golf course like the last guy, 
                    must be a good thing.  Of course, my 
                    opinion is notuniversally shared.

      Jarek and Teresa consider the dead body --

                    How is this nota murder?

                                        JAREK
                    It s a misdemeanor murder we already 
                    solved from four days ago.  Esteban

                                        TERESA
                    So what s he doing blocking traffic 
                    this morning?

      Jarek points to a FUNERAL HOME across the street.

                    Crew that killed him last week, seems 
                    to have broken into the funeral home, 
                    dragged the corpse into the street, 
                    put another dozen bullets in him.

      Jarek s CELL PHONE rings.  He goes to answer it as  
      Teresa waves to ANTONIO BETZ, 25, Latino Beat Copper, 
    who acts as her Driver/Bodyguard.  Caleb fidgets nearby.

                                        CALEB (V.O.)
                    One thing I know for fact is if you 
                    ride with Jarek Wysockifor more than 
                    three months, you move up in the

                                        JAREK
                    Any stories you ve heard about me, 
                    they re not true.

                                        CALEB
                    Okay.

                                        JAREK
                    I don t appreciate any profanity.

                                        JAREK
                    And the only sane answer to your 
                    question is Audrey Hepburnin any 
                    movie she was ever in.

      Caleb nods.  Takes it as a victory.                                                                                      13.


      EXT. WELLES PARK - DAY

      A husband and wife, jogging clothes, shot dead, lying 
      next to each other.  DETECTIVE GLEN HOWELL, 50 s, mills.  
      Beat coppers troll the scene.  Jarek and Caleb approach.

                                        JAREK
                    Glen, what do you got?

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Well, I got a marriage that ended in 
                    ways unkind.  Husband and wife 
                    joggers.  Steve s a systems analyst at 
                    some data entry company.  Linda s 
                      comptroller for Liffey Construction.

                                        JAREK
                    Yeah, I heard.

                                        DET. HOWELL
                                (suspicious now)
                    Why are you in this part of town?

                                        JAREK
                    New detail.  

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Yeah?  What s that?

                                        JAREK
                    I ride all around the city listening 
                    to the radio, hijack any case I want 
                    from the Primary.

      Beat.  Then Det. Howell laughs.  Must be a joke.

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Really?  How can I get that job?

                                        JAREK

                    You re serious?  Since when is this?

                                        JAREK
                    Sparky, what time is it?

                                        CALEB
                    8:22.

                                        JAREK 
                    New policy commenced at 8:21 and this 
                    is official notification I m taking

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    That s ridiculous.  The Prom Queen s 
                    really giving you that kind of juice?

                                        JAREK
                    Teresa Colvinisn t a Prom Queen, 
                    she s the Superintendent.  And yes, 
                    that kind of juice.  Canvas started?
                              (off his nod)
                    Great.  Anything turns up, hit my 
                    cell.  And keep taking notes.  
                      Paperwork s still yours.

      Caleb kneels down over the husband s body.  He s wearing 
      HEADPHONES, but the cord isn t attached to anything.

                                        CALEB
                      Headphones, but no I-Pod.  Shoot  em 
                    up robbery in this neighborhood?  
                    Guess it s possible, but...

      Jarek starts to walk away --

                                        JAREK
                    Come on...

      Caleb rushes after the fast-moving Jarek --

                                        CALEB
                    We really got free reign to take over 
                    any investigation in the city?

                                        JAREK
                    Ido.  Tomorrow you go back to the 
                    real world.

                                        CALEB
                    Okay.  So why are we walking away from 
                    our crime scene?

                                        JAREK
                    Ever been to Liffey Construction?

      Teresa shares a look with Antonio not to take the bait.

                                        TERESA
                    We re here about your cousin.

      INT. CITY JAIL HALLWAY - DAY

      Teresa walks with a tweaked Antonio.  She notices.

                                        TERESA
                    Say it.

                                        ANTONIO
                    Guys like Paco destroyed my 
                      neighborhood.  Makes threats against 
                    the city like that?  Little soft on 
                    him, weren t you?

                                        TERESA
                    Last time war broke out, three kids 
                    under the age of ten got killed in 
                    Austin and Humboldt Park.  I m just as 
                    soft as I need to be.

      EXT. PARKING LOT (STAGING AREA) - DAY

      ERNIE TREFIAN, 35, muscled, Armenian-American head of 
      this area s ORGANIZED CRIME DIVISION, addresses a dozen 
      cops - some in uniform, others in C.P.D.windbreakers, 
    all vested.  He hands out handmade flyers --

                                        ERNIE
                    Our target in this city-wide 
                      coordinated raid is Jimmy Washington.  
                    You all know Jimmy.  We re expecting 
                    to find at least three weapons in a 
                    lock box under his bed and hopefully 
                    some cocaine and heroin.  He s not Dad 
                    of the Month material, so we think his 
                    son s probably at Mom s, but you never 
                    know.  John and Tim, you got the door 
                    with me and Wiggy.Rick and Octo got 
                    the back.  Isaac and Vonda got crowd 
                    control.  Rest of you, follow us 
                    inside.  Let s do it.

    All head for cars.  Isaac whispers to Vonda, pissed.

                                        ISAAC
                    Crowd control?  Again with this?

      EXT. S. AUSTIN BLVD. (20 MPH) - DAY

      Four unmarked police cars and two squad cars in a line 
      sneak down the street like a snake hunting a mouse.                                                                                      17.


    As they pass through a red light, the lead car 
      ACCELERATES to 50 (no lights or sirens) and the others 
      follow turning on W. 18th street (Residential) and stop 
    in front of a row of APARTMENT BUILDINGS.  Across the 
      street, people sit on porches and stoops watching.

      Cops silently STORM their targeted building.  Isaac and 
      Vonda take a position watching the spectators.

    We HEAR the sounds of  POLICE!  OPEN UP!  asa battering 
    ram pounds into a METAL DOOR fifteen times before we 
      hear it crash in.  Isaac, frustrated, spiethe LOOKIE-
      LOOS.One draws his attention -- QUENTIN SILVER, 20 s, 
      sits on an old car seat -- a poor man s porch swing.

                                        ISAAC
                                (sotto, to Vonda)
                    You see Quentin Silver over there?

                                        VONDA
                    Is that Quentin?

                                        ISAAC
                    Oh, that s him.  Outstanding warrant 
                    on that gas station armed-robbery.

                                        VONDA
                    We re just crowd control.

                                        ISAAC
                    Unless we see a wanted fugitive.

      Isaac smiles.  She finds his charm hard to resist.  
      Isaac walks casually towards the crowd.  Vonda follows.  
      Quentin s played this game before though, sees them 
      approach and he leaps off the car seat, over the porch 
      rail and runs for it.  Isaac and Vonda chase --

      OVER fences, through garbage cans, and around parked 
      cars, Isaac and Vonda storm after Quentin, arrive at --

      EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY

    No sign of Quentin.  Isaac s not ready to quit.

                                        ISAAC
                    You that way, I got this way.

    We stay with Vonda as she peels off the other way.  Gun 
      raised she stealthily approaches a back yard with a tool 
      shed.  The shed door quivers ever so slightly in the 
      wind.  She approaches, FLINGS the door open --

      Nothing.  She closes the door, now REVEALING Quentin who 
      PUNCHES her in the jaw, sending her sprawling to the 
      ground.  He s on top of her, trying to RIP her GUN from 
    her grip.  She hangs on tenaciously.                                                                                      18.


    She deflects the punches with her spare hand, but he s 
      beginning to overpower her as --

      BAM!

      Isaac FLIES into screen, BARRELS into Quentin, knocking

      INT. LIFFEY CONSTRUCTION - HALLWAY - DAY

      Jarek and Caleb walk.  Jarek points to a FIRE ALARM.  

                                        JAREK
                    I say the word  institution , that s 
                    your cue to come back out here and

                                        CALEB
                    Why?

      INT. LIFFEY CONSTRUCTION - ACCOUNTING - DAY

      Jarek and Caleb mid-informing SEVEN ACCOUNTANTS of the 
      death of their boss.  Shock and tears.

                                        FEMALE ACCOUNTANT
                    Oh, my God. 

                                        JAREK
                    I m so sorry for your loss.  Linda was 
                    a good comptroller?  A good boss?

                                        FEMALE ACCOUNTANT
                    She was the best.                                                                                      19.


                                        JAREK
                    Can anyone think of any reason someone 
                    would harm her or her husband?

      A beat.  The group ponders it.  One man in the back, 
      PHILLIP (50 s) just looks down, worried.

                                        MALE ACCOUNTANT
                    Why would anyonedo this?

                    I honestly don t know.  Is this a 
                    pretty good institution to work for?

                                        MALE ACCOUNTANT
                    Sure.  I guess so.

      A beat.  Jarek looks over at Caleb, who doesn t move.

                                        JAREK
                    So it s a good institution.

                                        CALEB
                    I need to grab something from the car.

      Caleb walks out.

                                        JAREK
                    We re going to need a half hour or so 
                    with each of you to discuss what kinds

                    she had financial dealings with.

                                        FEMALE ACCOUNTANT
                    We have to do this now?

      INT. LIFFEY CONSTRUCTION - HALLWAY - DAY

      Caleb looks around the empty hallway.  Lifts the plastic 
      Fire Alarm and PULLS the alarm.  RED INK sprays out onto 
    his hand as the ALARM SOUNDS.  Caleb can t believe it.

      INT. LIFFEY CONSTRUCTION - ACCOUNTING - DAY

      Jarek reacts with surprise to the alarm.

                                        JAREK
                    I guess we can do the interviews 
                    tomorrow.  Everyone should clear out 
                    for their own safety.

    As the accountants quickly take things from their desks 
    and scurry out, Jarek grabs Phillip, the last to leave.                                                                                      20.

                    Hey.

                                        JAREK
                    You get outside, say you re going to 
                    call your wife, then call me.

      Jarek hands him a card.

                                        JAREK
                    Go.

      EXT. LIFFEY CONSTRUCTION - DAY

      Jarek and Caleb lean on their car.  Across the street, 
    the employees wait for the all-clear.  Some smoke, 
      others on cells.  Caleb shows his ink-stained hand.

                                        CALEB
                    Won t come off.

                    Guess your principal was right.

                                        CALEB
                    What are we doing here?

                                        JAREK
                    Linda Walling worked here.

                    Why aren t we going to her husband s

                                        JAREK
                    Because Liffey Construction is 
                    special.

                                        CALEB
                    Special how?

      Jarek s cell phone rings.  Jarek shrugs, answers.

      REVEAL Phillip across the street, away from his co-
      workers, talking on his phone staring at Jarek.

                    You re just chatting with your wife.

      Phillip turns so as not to look at Jarek.                                                                                      21.

                    talk to me without your co-workers
                    being aware of it.  But you do know 
                    something useful though, right?

                    even asking you your name.  Just give 
                    me a place to look.  You liked Linda?

      A beat.

                    due to city hall next week.  It s us 
                    and two other companies.  Linda said 
                    someone at the top knew what the other 
                    two secret bids were.  She said she 
                    was getting pressured to rig our 
                    numbers to come in under them.

                                        JAREK
                    Well, that certainly soundslike the 
                    Chicago I know and love.

                    The last time I talked to her, she was 
                    real nervous, said she was considering 
                    blowing the whistle to someone at city 
                    hall.

      Jarek sees TWO ACCOUNTANTS walk near Phillip.

                                        JAREK
                    I appreciate it.  Now say  I love you 
                    too, honey  and hang up.

      Phillip hangs up.  Jarek hangs up.

                    Please do.  Putting you in the corner 
                    isn t a deterrent unless other 
                    officers know about it.

                                        WORTHEN
                    Hey, you smug little bitch.  This is 
                    my life.

                                        TERESA
                    But it s my city now.  And I can t 
                    take on the rest of it if I can t keep 
                    my own back yard clean.

      Antonio returns, hands Teresa a post-it note.  She reads 
    it --  Alderman Gibbons... IMPORTANT! 

                                        TERESA
                                (rises to leave)
                    You don t like your promotion, you can 
                    always retire.

                                        WORTHEN
                                (livid, yelling)
                    You re nothing more than a pretty face 
                    P.R. stunt, lady.  You think you can 
                    change how things get done in Chicago?  
                    You ve had this job, what?  Six 
                    months?  No way you last six more, you 
                    hear me?  I will getyou first!

    But she s already gone --

      EXT. ALDERMAN GIBBONS  OFFICE - DAY

      Jarek and Caleb on the sidewalk with Det. Howell, who 
      hands them each a Police flyer.  Jarek nods his thanks 
    as Teresa s TOWN CAR pulls up.  Jarek opens up the door 
    for Teresa, who sees Caleb.

                                        TERESA
                      Congratulations.  You ve lasted longer 
                    than his last three partners.

                                        CALEB
                    Just keeping my head down.

                                        TERESA
                    Tell me we ve got something, Jarek.

                                        JAREK
                    You know Detective Glen Howell?

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Superintendent.                                                                                      25.


                                        JAREK
                    Det. Howell and his men just came up 
                    with a solid suspect.  This thing 
                    breaks, we got him to thank.

                                        TERESA
                    Nice work, Detective.

      Det. Howell nods a silent thanks to Jarek.

                                        TERESA
                    Alderman s waiting.

                                        JAREK
                              (to Caleb)
                    Stay here.

      Jarek and Teresa enter the offices as Det. Howell exits, 
      leaving only Caleb and Antonio to kick their heels.

                                        CALEB
                    Caleb.

                                        ANTONIO
                    Antonio.

                                        CALEB
                    You re the driver?

                                        ANTONIO
                    Yeah.

                                        CALEB
                    Me too apparently.

      Antonio tries to write on his notebook, is frustrated.

                                        ANTONIO
                    You got a pen?  Mine s out.

                                        CALEB
                    Let me look.

      Caleb goes to his and Jarek s car, opens the passenger 
      door, scans... opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, finds --

      A BULLWHIP neatly coiled up.  The Polish Cowboy indeed.

    An attractive secretary, LILLY, professional, early

    She rises, leads them to the door which opens to --

      INT. ALDERMAN GIBBONS  OFFICE - DAY

    The kind of office that only 30 years of running a city 
      from behind the scenes can buy.  Behind the desk sits 
      Chicago political machine legend PATRICK GIBBONS, 60.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Good to see you again, Teresa.

                                        TERESA
                    You too.  This is Detective Wysocki.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Can I get either of you a drink?

                                        TERESA
                    No thank you.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Lilly, just a scotch for me, please.

                                        LILLY
                    Yes, sir.

                                        GIBBONS
                              (to Jarek)
                    Or is it too early?

                                        JAREK
                    Is there such a thing?

                                        GIBBONS
                              (to Lilly)
                    I guess it s a double then.

    She nods, exits.

                                        GIBBONS
                    So this murdered couple that happened 
                    this morning...

                                        JAREK
                    Steve and Linda Walling.

                                        GIBBONS
                    This kind of butchery in my district, 
                    it s unacceptable.

                                        TERESA
                    Hopefully, we can eliminate this kind 
                    of crime in the entirecity.                                                                                      27.


                                        GIBBONS
                    Well, I m an optimistic man, Teresa, 
                    but I have the disadvantage of living 
                    in the real world.  Austin, Cabrini, 
                    we whack the moles where we can, but 
                    mypart of town?  We catch the 
                    bastards.  Tell me what you know.

                                        JAREK
                    Our canvass landed a real good looking 
                    suspect.

      Jarek hands Gibbons the sheet Det. Howell gave him.  
      It s a photo and rap sheet for WENDELL HOLMES, 30 s, 
      white, emaciated meth-head.

                                        JAREK
                    Wendell Holmes, was seen in the area 
                    just prior to the shootings.You see 
                    his sheet.  No stranger to violence.

                                        GIBBONS
                    So this looks like a meth-headstick-
                    up gone bad?

                                        JAREK
                    Probably.
                                (beat, casual)
                    But we re also looking into the wife s 
                    place of employment, Liffey 
                      Construction.  She was involved with 
                    some big city stuff, so we want to 
                    cover our bases there.

      Lilly enters with Gibbons  double scotch.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Thanks, Lilly.
                                (toTeresa)
                    Any resources you need.  Anything.

      EXT. ALDERMAN GIBBONS  OFFICE - DAY

      Jarek and Teresa exit.  Caleb and Antonio sit in their 
      respective cars.  Teresa stops Jarek.

                                        TERESA
                    Since when are you so free with 
                      information to the politicians?

                    Mellowing in my old age.

                    Jarek?

      Beat.  He never could hide a secret from her.                                                                                      28.

                    whistle blow on her company.

                    Liffey Construction?

                                        JAREK
                    Guess who owns it?  Not on paper, not 
                      officially... but really.

                                        TERESA
                                (beat, shit)
                    Alderman Gibbons.

                                        JAREK
                    Hey, you keep showing promise, you 
                    might get somewhere in the department.

                                        TERESA
                    You know this for a fact?

                                        JAREK
                    All the city bidding Liffey does, 
                    can t have his name on the letterhead.

                                        TERESA
                    You know this for a fact?

                                        JAREK
                    I ve heard it.

                                        TERESA
                    But you don t know it.

                                        JAREK
                    I feelit.

                    Jarek.  I m trying to get two gangs to 
                    lay down their guns before midnight.  
                    I m taking on the Police Union and a 
                    hundred pissed-off, armed cops.  Don t 
                    drag me into a fight with the second 
                    most powerful man in Chicago after the 
                    Mayor unless you knowsomething.

                                        JAREK
                    He s way more powerful than the mayor 
                    and you wantedto take on corruption.  
                    And besides, now that Gibbons and his 
                    machine know I m sniffing around 
                    Liffey Construction, the next move 
                    isn t mine or yours.  It s his.

      HIGH ANGLE looking down on Teresa and Jarek --                                                                                      29.


      REVEAL

      Alderman Gibbons watches the silent action from his 
      office window as he sips his scotch.

      QUICK FLASHof old time Chicago politics footage, people 
    at the polls, politicians glad-handing, campaigning as --

                                        GIBBONS (V.O.)
                    My Great-Grandfather ran this ward 
                    when it was only Irish and German.  My 
                      grandfather followed him, taught me 
                    you take care of your own first and 
                    foremost.  You wonder why the same 
                    guys get elected over and over again?  
                    It s because someone got the 
                    Fitzgerald family the zoning variance 
                    they needed to build that extra 
                    bedroom for his sick mother.  It s 
                    because someone got the Vittinghoff
                    boy s drag racing citation knocked 
                    down to a simple speeding ticket so he 
                    wouldn t lose his license.  Someone 
                    did that for them.  That someone was 
                    me.

      BACK TO THE PRESENT as Gibbons continues watching --

                                        GIBBONS (V.O.)
                    My father didn t want the job, but I 
                    ran the first chance I had.  My name 
                    got me elected the first time.  After 
                    that, I earned every single vote.  
                    They say Chicago is the city that 
                    works.  What some people never 
                    understand is it works in a lot of 
                    different ways.

      Gibbons watches Jarek s car drive off and Teresa get 
      into her car.  As he takes one last sip --

      FADE IN:

      Vonda and Isaac lean against their squad car as Jarek 
    and Caleb drive up.  As Vonda watches --

                                        VONDA (V.O.)
                    Uncle Jarek s the one who woke me up 
                    and told me my father had been shot.

      QUICK FLASHof 10 year old Vonda shaken awake by Jarek.

                                        VONDA (V.O.)
                    And when Dad died the next day, he 
                    hugged me and told me I was his 
                      responsibility now.

      QUICK FLASHof 10 y.o.Vonda listening solemnly.

                                        VONDA (V.O.)
                    He taught me how to knock down the 7-
                    10 split, taught me when you smell 
                      Blommer schocolate in the morning 
                    air, it s going to be cold that day.

      QUICK FLASHof chocolate being stirred at Blommer s. 
    The camera goes from the pot, to the chimney, up into 
    the air and ZOOMS a mile to Young Vonda s house where 
    she wakes up in bed smelling the chocolate in the air.

                                        VONDA (V.O.)
                    And when I told him I wanted to enroll 
                    in the Academy, not only did he not 
                    stop me, I know he pulled strings to 
                    get me in early.  Though he didn t 
                    admit it then.  And he wouldn t now.

      Jarek and Caleb emerge from their car, approach.

                                        JAREK
                    Need a favor.  We got a suspect in our 
                    double hummer.  Wendell Holmes.  We ll 
                    sit on his house, but I pulled his 
                    contact cards.  He s got three 
                    felonious friends stumbling around the 
                    city.  See if you can get one dirty.

                                        VONDA
                    Love to.

                                        JAREK
                    Let me see it.

      Jarek looks at Vonda s face where she took the punch.                                                                                      31.


                                        ISAAC
                    She handled herself really good.

                                        JAREK
                    Ernie says you two went chasing after 
                    this guy out of position.

                                        ISAAC
                    Wanted felon, what would you have 
                    done?

      Isaac has him there.  Jarek sidles close to him.

                                        JAREK
                    I got to tell you what happens to you 
                    if something happens to her?

                                        ISAAC
                    We ll be just fine.

      Jarek pulls Vonda to the side, out of earshot.

                                        JAREK
                    You sleeping with your partner?

                                        VONDA
                    No.

                                        JAREK
                    I can see.

                                        VONDA
                    I swear on Dad s grave.  No.

      That satisfies him.  Still --

                                        JAREK
                    I m trying to figure out why you d 
                    follow this guy off the reservation to 
                    get popped like that.
                                (beat, off her)
                    Isaac s too cocky.  He s the kind of 
                    guy who s going to drown one day, pull 
                    someone down with him.

                                        VONDA
                    I m being careful.

                                        JAREK
                    Trust me, partners is complicated 
                    enough.

    She nods her understanding.  Jarek walks back to Isaac, 
      who s looking at the contact cards Caleb has given him.

                                        JAREK
                    I need one of them dirty.                                                                                      32.


      EXT. W. CORTEZ ST. (PARKED) - DAY

      Jarek and Caleb on stakeout.  After a beat.

                                        CALEB
                    Top Ten Album Covers of all time.  
                    I ll start.  Nirvana s  Nevermind .  
                    Now you.

      A beat.  Jarek s not going to play this game.  His cell 
      rings through the car s sound system.  He has no choice 
    but to answer on speaker phone.

                                        JAREK
                    Hello?

      INT. DINA S HOUSE - INTERCUT

      DINA WYSOCKI, Jarek s ex-wife, 40, does house chores as 
    she cradles the phone against her ear --

                                        DINA
                    It s me.

                                        JAREK
                    You re on speaker.

                                        DINA
                    Who else is there?

      Jarek looks at Caleb, can t remember his name...

                                        CALEB
                    Caleb Evers, Ma am.

                                        DINA
                    Hi Caleb.  I m the ex-wife.

                                        CALEB
                    I m the soon-to-be ex-partner.

                                        DINA
                    Has he told you about his fiancee yet?

                                        JAREK
                    Dina.

                                        DINA
                    Twenty-seven years old.  Doesn t that 
                    seem a little young for Jarek, Caleb?

                                        CALEB
                    That seems a little young.

      Caleb nods  no  to Jarek.                                                                                      33.


                                        JAREK
                    What can I do for you, Dina?

                                        DINA
                    J.J. lefthis physics project at your 
                    house.  He says it s in the cubby.

                                        JAREK
                    When does he need it?

                                        DINA
                    Can you bring it by around nine?

      Jarek sees in his rear view mirror, WENDELL HOLMES.  

                                        JAREK
                    Sure.  Got to go.

      Jarek and Caleb exit the car.  Six Beat Coppers appear 
      from various nooks and crannies, guns drawn.

                                        JAREK
                    Wendell Holmes!  On the ground!

                                        WENDELL
                    I m not resisting!

      Wendell lays down.  Caleb pats him down as a beat copper 
      cuffs him.  Caleb pulls an I-POD from Wendell s pocket.

                                        CALEB
                    You know what goes well with these?  
                      Headphones.

      Caleb finds some keys.  Jarek turns to the Unis.

                                        JAREK
                    Take him to the station.

                                        BEAT COPPER #1
                    Any help executing the search warrant?

                                        JAREK
                    No.  I don t want any police presence 
                    here.  Clear out ASAP.

      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

      Jarek opens Wendell s door with the keys.  They enter --

      INT. WENDELL S APARTMENT - DAY

      Small, dark, a sty.  

                                        JAREK
                    Never ceases to amaze me how well 
                    crime pays.  Close it and lock it.
                                        (MORE)                                                                                      34.

                                        JAREK (CONT'D)
                                (offCaleb)
                    I m expecting visitors.

      Caleb shuts it, locks it.  They look around the place.  
      It s filthy, depressing, except for --

                                        JAREK
                    Always with the big TVs, these guys.

      A 50  plasma on the wall.

                                        JAREK
                    Find the remote, see if the game s on.

                                        CALEB
                    Game doesn t start until 2:20.

                                        JAREK
                    You mean the Cubs game, right?  
                    Because the Sox don t play today.
                                (Caleb s busted)
                    I knew it.  You re a lying, filthy 
                    Cubsfan.  You thought you could 
                    weasel your way into my good graces by 
                    pretendingto be a White Sox fan?

                                        CALEB
                    I grew up on the North Side.  We had 
                    Sandberg, Maddux, Grace and Dawson.  
                    What was I supposed to do?

      Jarek looks at Caleb like he rapes nuns for sport.

                                        JAREK
                    Search it.

    As they search different parts of the apartment --

      EXT. ROBERT HEALY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

      Antonio opens the car door for Teresa, as he gets off 
    the phone.  As they walk towards the school entrance --

                                        ANTONIO
                    Raids all went off with no friendlies
                    injured.

                                        TERESA
                    Overlords hand over the mortuary 
                    shooters yet?

                                        ANTONIO
                    Not yet.  So what is this event?

                                        TERESA
                    Community outreach thing I got roped 
                    into.                                                                                      35.


                                        ANTONIO
                    I went to school here.

                                        TERESA
                    Really?

      INT. ROBERT HEALY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

      They walk down the hallway, approach Classroom 15.

                                        ANTONIO
                    That used to be Mrs. Estrada s class.

                                        TERESA
                    Still is.

      Teresa opens the door, waves Antonio inside to --

      INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

      Where twenty-five 4th graders (almost all Hispanic) sit.  
      Happy Birthday banners on the wall.

                                        KIDS
                    Happy Birthday, Officer Betz!

      Antonio looks at Teresa.  She smiles, nods him forward.

                                        MRS. ESTRADA
                    Antonio!

                                        ANTONIO
                    Mrs. Estrada.

    She hugs him.

                                        MRS. ESTRADA
                    Class.  Today is Antonio s twenty-
                    fifth birthday.  But fifteen years 
                    ago, he was a fourth grader in this 
                    classroom, just like you.  Who has 
                    questions for Officer Betz?

      Many kids raise their hands.  Antonio points to one.

                                        4TH GRADE BOY
                    How do you become a police officer?

                                        ANTONIO
                    Well, you stay out of trouble.  Decide 
                    you want to help people who can t 
                    always help themselves.  And then you 
                    need someone to give you a chance.

      Antonio sneaks a peak at Teresa.  She beams.                                                                                      36.


      INT. WENDELL S APARTMENT - DAY

      Jarek and Caleb still rooting through the place, when 
      they hear action at the door.  Both draw their guns.

                                        WILL (O.S.)
                    Wendell?  Open up.

      A low knock.  Jarek opens the door to reveal two TOUGHS, 
      WILL and LIAM, both 20 s and Irish.  They see the guns --

                                        WILL
                    Easy...

                                        JAREK
                    And who are you?

                                        WILL
                    We re just looking for Wendell.

                                        JAREK
                    Come on in.  

                                        WILL
                    Nah, that s alright.  

                                        JAREK
                    Get in here.

      Jarek waves them in, closes the door behind them.

                                        JAREK
                    How you know Wendell?

                                        WILL
                    Just friends.

                                        JAREK
                    Oh yeah, how tall is he?

      Will doesn t know.

                                        JAREK
                    Who sent you here?
                                (beat, louder)
                    Who sent you here?

                                        LIAM
                    Screw this.  I m out.

                                        JAREK
                    You re not going anywhere.

                                        LIAM
                    Get an arrest warrant then, asshole.                                                                                      37.


      Jarek KICKS Liam in the GROIN, sending him to the floor.  
      Caleb freaks out.

                                        CALEB
                    Hey!

      Jarek GRABS Liam s head and SMASHES his face hard into 
    the floor.  Caleb tries to stop Jarek, but Jarek gets 
    one or two more shots in before Caleb gets him off.  
      Liam writhes in pain.  

                                        JAREK
                    Search the big mouth.

      Caleb searches Liam, while Jarek searches Will.

                                        CALEB
                    Just a wallet.

                                        JAREK
                    Let me see.

      Caleb tosses is to Jarek.  Jarek pulls out the license. 

                                        JAREK
                    Pleasure, Liam.  Who sent you to find 
                    Wendell?

                                        LIAM
                    Your mother, after I got done three-
                    wayingher and your sister.

      Jarek rushes towards him to kick his ass.  Caleb 
      intercepts him.  Caleb turns to Will and Liam.  

                                        CALEB
                    Get the hell out of here.

                                        JAREK
                    I m not done with him.

                                        CALEB
                                (sotto)
                    Yes you are.  Because if we bring them 
                    in, I ll have to write this all up.
                                (toWill and Liam)
                    Go.


      Jarek tosses the wallet back to Liam.

                                        LIAM
                    What about my license?

                                        JAREK
                    Mail away for a replacement.                                                                                      38.


                                        WILL
                    Come on.  

      Will and Liam beat it out of there.  A pause.

                                        CALEB
                    That was really not cool.

                                        JAREK
                    Starting tomorrow you won t have to 
                    worry about it.

      EXT. N. PULASKI RD. (30 MPH) - DAY

      Vonda and Isaac in their squad car, eyes peeled.

                                        ISAAC
                    Your uncle s really got it in for me.

                                        VONDA
                    He s just over-protective.

                                        ISAAC
                    Doesn t he know I got your back, baby?

    She laughs it off, but inside she s flattered, in love.

                                        ISAAC
                    His generation still sees color.  
                    Time s on the side of the righteous.

                                        VONDA
                    That s one of our plates right there.  
                    White Chevy.

      They watch the car come to a complete stop at a stop 
      sign, then continue.

                                        ISAAC
                    He roll that stop sign?

                                        VONDA
                    Think he did.

      Isaac hits the siren.

      EXT. N. PULASKI RD. (PARKED)- DAY

      Jarek & Caleb pull up.  YANCY, 20 s, scuzzball, stands, 
      hands cuffed in the back.  Jarek rolls down the window --

                                        JAREK
                    What do you got, Officers?                                                                                      39.


                                        VONDA
                    Suspect ran a stop sign.  In searching 
                    Yancy s vehicle, we found some 
                      electronics that come back stolen.

                                        JAREK
                    This your first time getting popped?

                                        YANCY
                    Not exactly.

                                        JAREK
                    We can bring him in for you.  

                                        VONDA
                    That dbe a big help.  Thanks, 
                    Detective.

                                        JAREK
                    Really should eat first, though.  You 
                    hungry, Yancy?

      INT. COP JOINT GREASY SPOON - DAY

      Jarek, Caleb and Yancy finish lunch. 

                                        YANCY
                    That was great.  Thanks again.

                                        JAREK
                    No problem.

      A waitress (PENELOPE) approaches.

                                        PENELOPE
                    Get you fellasany dessert?

                                        JAREK
                    Well, Penelope, that depends on Yancy.
                                (toYancy)
                    You pals with Wendell Holmes?

                                        YANCY
                    That s what that shakedown was about 
                    back there?  Forget it.

                                        JAREK
                    Here s the deal.  We can skip dessert, 
                    process you on the stolen merch... or 
                    we can forget about those charges 
                    while you order any dessert on the 
                    menu and tell us about Wendell.

      Penelope waits, curious.  After a beat.                                                                                      40.


                                        YANCY
                    Slice of cherry pie, heated up.  Scoop 
                    of chocolate ice cream on the side.

                                        JAREK
                    Same.

                                        CALEB
                    Same.

      EXT. POLICE STATION MOTORPOOL - DAY

      Jarek, Caleb and Det. Howell with Wendell, who smokes.

                                        JAREK
                    You want to tell us about this five 
                    grand you were bragging to your 
                    buddies you were getting paid?

                                        WENDELL
                    Who ratted?

                                        CALEB
                    How many people you tell?

                                        WENDELL
                    One too many.  Guy paid me the five 
                    grand to take out the couple.  Extra 
                    emphasis on the wife.  Make it look 
                    like a rip off he said.  I mean I 
                    already got a damn I-Pod.

                                        JAREK
                    What was this guy s name?

                                        WENDELL
                    Never gave it.  Wanted it that way.

                                        JAREK
                    You never saw him before?

                                        WENDELL
                    Not before two nights ago at the bar.

                                        JAREK
                    You ID him for us?

                                        WENDELL
                    You put him in front of me, yeah, I ll 
                    do business with you.

                                        JAREK
                    Okay.  Detective Howell s got 
                    additional questions for you.

                                        WENDELL
                    I know the drill.                                                                                      41.


                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Thanks for the bust.

                                        JAREK
                    Any time.

      Det. Howell leads Wendell back inside.

                                        CALEB
                    We got the shooter, but not the money 
                    man.  So, where to?

                                        JAREK
                    I know where I m going next.  To make 
                    love to my fiance. 

                                        CALEB
                    Excuse me?

                                        JAREK
                    Should only take about an hour.  I ll 
                    meet back up with you then.

                                        CALEB
                    For real?

                                        JAREK
                    You know how to keep a gorgeous twenty-
                    seven year old happy?

                                        CALEB
                    No.

                                        JAREK
                    Figured as much.

      EXT. POLICE MEMORIAL - NIGHT

      Dedicated to slain Chicago Police Officers, this 
      monument lies between Soldier Field and Lake Michigan.  
    Dim lights illuminate hundreds of names of lost souls.

      Jarek enters, looks at a name for a moment, then --

                                        LIAM (O.S.)
                    You could ve warned me to wear a cup.

      Reveal LIAM emerging from the shadows.  Jarek pulls out 
      Liam s license, tosses it to him.

                                        JAREK
                    Doesn t play as well, you know what s 
                    coming.  You got any pals up here?

                                        LIAM
                    A guy I graduated with got killed as a 
                    rookie, but I barely knew him.
                                        (MORE)                                                                                      42.

                                        LIAM (CONT'D)
                                (beat)
                    Your brother s up here, right?  
                    Where s his name?

                                        JAREK
                    Over there somewhere.

                                        LIAM
                    Which wall?

                                        JAREK
                    I don t know.  I never look at it.  
                    What s the word?

                                        LIAM
                    This whole Liffey investigation has 
                    the Gibbons machine freaked out.  
                    Everyone s in lock down mode.

                    I need the guy who hired the shooter.

                                        LIAM
                    I keep hearing a name whispered.  
                    Don t know what it all means though.  
                    Name s Jasper.  Sounds like he s up 
                    here from down south.

                                        JAREK
                    Better than nothing.  I need you to 
                    get closer to Alderman Gibbons though.

                                        LIAM
                    I ve been under for almost a year now, 
                    I ve never even met the man.

                                        JAREK
                    After today you will.  And soon.

      A beat.  Liam looks at the wall.  Takes it in.

                                        LIAM
                    How many of these did you know?

      Beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Take care of yourself, Liam.
                              (re: walls)
                    I don t want to know any more.

      Jarek exits.

      FADE IN:

      INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      Teresa sits alone at a private table eating.  She looks 
      across the restaurant -- Antonio at the bar points Jarek 
    to her.  Caleb is with him.  Jarek tells Caleb to stay. 
    As Jarek walks across the room towards Teresa --

                                        TERESA (V.O.)
                    Jarek wasn t my first or last partner.  
                    But he was the only one to tell me how 
                    being a woman could make me a better 
                    cop.

                    Jarek could have had this job.  Never 
                    wanted to leave his car or play the 
                    political game though.  When I took 
                    the gig, we agreed... Six months to 
                    settle in, then we tear the city up, 
                    make some real overdue changes.  That 
                    was six months ago.

      Jarek arrives at the table.

                                        JAREK
                    Beautiful woman eating all alone?  
                    Doesn t seem right.  How reyou 
                    scaring them off?

                                        TERESA
                    You think it s the gun?

      Jarek sits.  Across the restaurant, at the bar --

                                        CALEB
                    They do this a lot?

                                        ANTONIO
                    They re pretty tight.

                    You hear whisperswhen they rode 
                    together, maybe --                                                                                      44.

                    No way.  He was married back then.  
                    She wouldn t do that --

                                        CALEB
                    Never know.

      BACK ON JAREK AND TERESA

                                        TERESA
                    Less than five hours  til Paco s

                      girlfriends and moms.  Only things 
                      degenerates appreciate sometimes are

                                        JAREK
                    I suppose it s not.

                                        TERESA
                    In the meantime, Alderman Gibbons 
                    wants another update.

                    We know anything that would scare him?

                    Liam gave me the name of the guy who 
                    maybe paid for the job.  Jasper.

                                        TERESA
                    We use it, might expose Liam s cover.

                                        JAREK
                    Nah, I just say our shooter dropped 
                    Jasper s name to me.

                                        TERESA
                    You really want to do this, don t you?                                                                                      45.


                                        JAREK
                    My father hated guys like Gibbons.

                                        TERESA
                    We do it, we can t just wound him.

                                        JAREK
                    Hoping you d say that.

      INT. ALDERMAN GIBBONS  OFFICE - NIGHT

      Lilly leads Jarek and Teresa in.  Gibbons greets them.

                    We have the shooter in custody.

                    Shooter confessed.  Says he was hired

                                        GIBBONS
                    What was the motive?

                                        JAREK
                    We believe Linda Walling was targeted 
                    because of work she was doing at 
                    Liffey Construction.

                                        TERESA
                    We should have warrants by tomorrow 
                    morning to search Liffey for more 
                    information.

                                        GIBBONS
                    I m sure that won t be necessary.

                                        JAREK
                    Is there some reason you don t want us 
                    to search Liffey Construction?

                                        GIBBONS
                    No.  I mean it won t be necessary to 
                    get a warrant.  I know Liffey s owner.  
                    He s a friend.  ifit ll help, I can 
                    get you in there tonight.  You can 
                    have full access right now.

                    Get Owen McDonnell on the phone.

    Off Jarek and Teresa, hiding their surprise --

      INT. LIFFEY CONSTRUCTION - MAIN OFFICES - NIGHT

      A dozen cops accompany Jarek, Teresa and Caleb in this 
      search.  We see Caleb talking on the side with WILL and 
      LIAM.  Jarek gives orders to two Beat Coppers.

                                        JAREK
                    Anything with the name Linda Walling 
                    or any paperwork relating to the 
                    Waterfront construction bid.

    The cops move off.  Caleb approaches Jarek and Teresa.

                                        CALEB
                    You find it odd that the two guys who 
                    came looking for Marshall today happen 
                    to be working after hours at the same 
                    place the dead lady worked?

                                        JAREK
                    I find it interesting, not odd.

                                        CALEB
                    The one, Liam.  Something about him.

                                        TERESA
                    What?

                                        CALEB
                    He s not who he says he is.

      Beat.  Jarek and Teresa feign ignorance about Liam.

                                        JAREK
                    Seems like a regular knucklehead.

                                        CALEB
                    Yeah, he talks that game.  Looks it 
                    even, but he s smarter than he lets 
                    on.

                                        JAREK
                    You get that from two minutes of 
                    chatting up the guy?                                                                                      47.


                                        CALEB
                    It s the way he scans the place.  I 
                    see the gears moving inside his head.  
                    That s not the brain of some lowlife 
                    muscle.  I say we bring him in, figure 
                    out what his game really is.

      That would be awkward.  Before they need to respond, 
      Gibbons arrives with OWEN MCDONNELL, 50 s Irish.

                                        GIBBONS
                      Superintendent Colvin.This is the

                    He may have something useful for you.

      McDonnell offers them a paper.  Teresa scans it.

                                        MCDONNELL
                    We have a vendor named Jasper

                    So you believe this Jasper Franklin 
                    may harbor terrorist intents?

                                        MCDONNELL
                    What?

      INT. POLICE HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

      Jarek and Caleb with JASPER FRANKLIN, 30 s.  There s no 
      table in this room.  Just a bench attached to the wall 
    and two fold up chairs Jarek and Caleb use to get close 
    to Jasper.  Mid-interrogation Jasper s scared, breaking.

                                        JAREK
                    Why dyou want Linda Walling dead,

                    I didn t even know the lady.

                    Then why are you sweating like we just 
                    entered you in a spelling bee?  Oh, 
                    because you re starting to realize the 
                    shooter ID dyou as the man who paid 
                    him five grand to do the deed.

                                        JAREK
                    Go ahead, Jasper.  Take your time 
                    accepting the reality of this 
                    situation.  We ll bring some food in.  
                    You want some menus?

      Beat.

                                        JASPER
                    Gibbons wanted her gone.

      Jarek perks up considerably.  Caleb can t believe it.

                                        CALEB
                    Alderman Patrick Gibbons?

                                        JAREK
                    Gibbons ordered the hit on Linda 
                    Walling?

                                        JASPER
                    Yeah.

                                        JAREK
                    He gave you the order directly?

                                        JASPER
                    Well, no.  I was talking to Owen 
                    McDonnell.

                                        JAREK
                    And McDonnell gave you the order on 
                    behalf of Gibbons?

                                        JASPER
                    Yes.  No.  Not exactly.  I was having 
                    dinner with McDonnell and he made a 
                    real point to tell me how this woman 
                    was becoming a real pain-in-the-ass 
                    for Gibbons, for the company.

                                        JAREK
                    And Gibbons wanted her dead?

                                        JASPER
                    He didn t say that.  He didn t have 
                    to.                                                                                      49.


                                        JAREK
                    So, no one gave you the order?

                                        JASPER
                    They didn t have to, you understand?  
                    She was a pain-in-the-ass to Gibbons.  
                    That s all he had to say.  You need to 
                    know these people.

      EXT. POLICE STATION MOTORPOOL - NIGHT

      Jarek and Teresa.  They watch Caleb clean out the car.

                                        TERESA
                    No wonder Gibbons was so helpful.  
                    There s no real link back to him.

                                        JAREK
                    We didn t kill Gibbons, we just 
                    wounded him.

                                        TERESA
                    We didn t even wound him.  But we did 
                    get the shooter and the money man.  
                    Usually that s a good day.
                                (beat)
                    Your boy sniffed something up with

                                        JAREK
                    Maybe Liam s getting sloppy.

                                        TERESA
                    Or your partner has better instincts 
                    than you think.

      Beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Too bad he s a Cubs fan.

      Ernie approaches from inside, hands Teresa a note.

                                        ERNIE
                    Good news.  I got word to the 
                    Overlords that moms and squeezes were 
                    next.  They want us to call off the 
                    dogs.  They re willing to give us the 
                    crew that dragged that boy out of the 
                    mortuary.  All they re asking for is a 
                    face to face just like Paco got.   

                                        TERESA
                    After what they did?  They don t 
                    deserve a face to face with me.                                                                                      50.


                                        ERNIE
                    Need someone to set terms in person.

                                        TERESA
                    I know someone who s ready for it. 
                    Thanks, Ernie.

      Ernie exits.  Teresa can still see Jarek s pissed.

                                        TERESA
                    Sometimes you just have to go home and 
                    sleep it off.  Who taught me that?

                                        JAREK
                    Whoever he was, sounds like a dumb 
                    Pollock.

                                        TERESA
                    Only some of the time.

      Teresa moves off towards her car, where Antonio opens 
    the door as Caleb approaches Jarek.

                                        CALEB
                    Car s clean.  Where to?

      Beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Look, Sparky.I don t see this 
                      partnership working.  We re just not a 
                    match.  I ll let your Lieutenant know 
                    to reassign you at our mutual request.

      Beat.  Caleb takes it like a man.

                                        CALEB
                    Sure, I understand.

                                        JAREK
                    I wish you luck though, and keep safe.

                                        CALEB
                    Appreciate having the chance to ride 
                    with you.

      Jarek nods.  Caleb moves off, buries his disappointment.

      INT. GANG LAIR - NIGHT

      Antonio stands in front of a council of THREE GANG 
      LEADERS, all black.  Main guy is HORACE, 30.

                                        HORACE
                    Face to face was supposed to be with 
                    the main lady not some Mexican busboy.                                                                                      51.


                                        ANTONIO
                    She doesn t grant face to faces with 
                    gangs who break truces and drag 
                    corpses into the street.
                                (beat)
                    But, if you want the raids and the 
                    arrests to stop, I m here to negotiate 
                    terms... respectfully.

      EXT. W. 45TH STREET (PARKED) - NIGHT

      Antonio gets into the car.  Teresa in the back.

                                        TERESA
                    We good?

                                        ANTONIO
                    We re good.

      Teresa nods, knows her apprentice has learned well.

                                        TERESA
                    Let s go home then.

      INT. DINA S HOUSE - NIGHT

                    Dina?

                                        DINA

      INT. DINA S HOUSE - J.J. S ROOM - NIGHT

      Jarek enters to find Dina making the bed.  Jarek puts a 
      BACKPACK on a desk.

                                        JAREK
                    There s his physics thing-a-ma-jig.  
                    He here?

                                        DINA
                    No.

      Beat.  Then they rush each other and embrace.  Kiss 
      passionately.  He THROWS her on the bed.  Reaches under 
    her skirt and RIPS her panties off.  Animals.

                                        DINA
                    Break up with that tramp already.

                                        JAREK
                    She s not a tramp, she s my fiancee.                                                                                      52.

                    When are you going to tell her?

                                        JAREK
                    It s a bad time.  Her mother s real 
                    sick.  I ll tell her soon.

      INT. DINA S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Jarek and Dina s 16 year old son, J.J., enters.

      INT. DINA S HOUSE - J.J. S ROOM - NIGHT

      Dina s fully dressed, making the bed.  No sign of Jarek.

                                        DINA
                    Would it kill you to make your bed?

                                        J.J.
                    I forgot my phone.

                                        DINA
                    You can t live two hours without it?

                                        J.J.
                    Why chance it?

      J.J. un-plugshis phone, takes it.  About to leave.

                                        DINA
                    Your father brought your physics 
                    project by.

    She points to it.  He grabs it on his way out.

                                        J.J.
                    See ya.

    The door slams downstairs.  She goes to the closet, 
      slides it open.  Jarek stands naked, t-shirtcovering 
    his privates, her panties in his other hand.

                                        JAREK

      FADE IN:

      EXT. N. DOMINICK ST. (PARKING) - NIGHT

      Quiet, residential.  Antonio parks the car.  As he gets 
    out to open the door for Teresa --

                                        ANTONIO (V.O.)
                    When Teresa Colvinfound me I was 
                    twelve years old and acting as a 
                    lookout for a couple local dealers.

      QUICK FLASHof a 12 YEAR OLD ANTONIO on a shittystreet 
      spying the hood with another cholo.

                                        ANTONIO (V.O.)
                    She was starting a charter program 
                    that pulled me and some other kids off 
                    the street, got on me about my grades.

      QUICK FLASHof Teresa TUTORING a 12 Year Old Antonio.

                                        ANTONIO (V.O.)
                    She talked me into joining the P.D. 
                    andwhen I quit  cause I thought it 
                    was too hard, she found me and dragged 
                    my lazy ass back to the Academy.

      QUICK FLASHof Teresa finding Antonio at a BAR with 
      buddies.  She drags him out.

      BACK IN THE PRESENT

    As Antonio closes the car door and Teresa steps out to 
      walk to her house --

                                        ANTONIO (V.O.)
                    When the time came to pick --

      BAM!

      A GUNSHOT interrupts Antonio s memory.

    He SEES a BULLET IMPACT hit Teresa in the CHEST.  
      Antonio THRUSTS himself in front of Teresa just in time 
    to take the IMPACT of a SECOND GUNSHOT.

    The force knocks them both back on their asses, on the 
      ground, backs against the town car, Antonio still acting 
    as a shield in front of her.

      Antonio is hit by ANOTHER shot.  He s unconscious.  
      Teresa takes Antonio s gun from his limp hand and FIRES 
      back in the dark direction of the hostile muzzle flash.                                                                                      54.


    WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS running, a car door SLAMS.  A car 
      SCREECHES off.

      Teresa lays on the ground, GASPING loudly for breath, 
      still CRADLING the lifeless Antonio in her arms.

      INT. ALDERMAN GIBBONS  OFFICE - NIGHT

      Gibbons watches a NEWS REPORT about the shooting of the 
      Superintendent and her driver.  Info is sketchy.

                                        LIAM (O.S.)
                    It s a real pleasure to finally get to 
                    meet you, Mr. Gibbons.

      Gibbons turns and we see Liam with Will.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Will says you can be of some use to us 
                    with constituency services.

                                        LIAM
                    Not sure what that means, but I d love 
                    to help with anything.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Well, thanks for coming by.  He ll let 
                    you know when we need something.
                                (yellsout)
                    Lilly.  Where s that drink?

      Will nods for Liam that s their cue to exit.  They do, 
      passing Lilly on her way in with a scotch.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Close the door.

      Lilly lets Liam and Will exit, then closes the door.  
      Gibbons sits in his leather chair, turns the TV up.  
      Lilly brings him his drink, places it in front of him.

                                        LILLY
                    Anything else?

                                        GIBBONS
                    Kiss my ear.

    She bends down and slowly french kisses his ear.

                                        LILLY
                    Something like that?

                                        GIBBONS
                    Don t stop.  It s working.

    She resumes kissing.  Whether it s the tongue in his ear 
    or the news on his TV, he smiles ever so slightly.                                                                                      55.


      EXT. ILLINOIS MASONIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      Isaac rushes towards the hospital.  Sees a bunch of COPS 
      milling about in front of the ER entrance.  Then he 
      stops.  Looks, sees --

      VONDA sitting in her car.  She appears to be crying.  He 
      goes to the passenger window, knocks.  She looks up.  
      Tears.  She unlocks the door, Isaac gets in.  Sits.

                                        ISAAC
                    Hey...  What s...

      Beat.

                                        VONDA
                    This is where they brought my father.  
                    Where I said goodbye to him.

    She shivers uncontrollably.  He strokes her hair.

                                        ISAAC
                    Don t be scared.  I m not going to let 
                    anything everhappen to you.  You 
                      understand?

                                        VONDA
                    I m not scared of something happening 
                    to me, Isaac... I m terrified 
                      something s going to happen to you.

      A beat.  His hand s still on her head.  They lean in and 
      kiss.  Longing.  Sorrow.  Comfort.  Love.  They pull 
      back and look at each other.  No going back now.

      INT. ADVOCATE MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT

      A few cops inside.  Caleb paces as Jarek STORMS in.  
      Caleb intercepts him in a private spot.

                                        JAREK
                    How is she?

                                        CALEB
                    One bullet hit her vest.  Cracked rib.  
                    That s all.  She ll be fine.

                                        JAREK
                    Antonio?

                                        CALEB
                    He s dead.  Didn t have a chance.

      Beat.  Jarek takes it in.  Makes a choice.                                                                                      56.


                                        JAREK
                    I want the absolute truth... That gut 
                    feeling you had on Gibbons  guy, Liam.  
                    That a lucky guess or can you bring 
                    that kind of thinking on a daily 
                    basis?

                                        CALEB
                                (absolute truth)
                    I m really good.

      A beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Liam s undercover for us.  You re the 
                    third person, besides Liam himself, to 
                    know that fact.  You and I cruise the 
                    city, pick the cases that really 
                    matter, starting with who did this.

      Caleb wanted the job, but not at this price.

                                        CALEB
                    I ll bring up the car.

                                        JAREK
                    Where is she?

                                        CALEB
                    Around there.

      Caleb exits.  Jarek rounds the corner, sees Teresa, in 
      just her white undershirt, ribs WRAPPED, staring at --

      ANTONIO lying, shirtless, bloody, dead on a bed in an 
      otherwise empty room.  Jarek stands close for support.

                                        JAREK
                    You stopped wearing your vest when you 
                    got named Superintendent.

      Beat.

                                        TERESA
                    When I reassigned one of the cops 
                    today he got angry.  Made some 
                    threats.  Not really, but kind of.
                                (beat)
                    Antonio insisted I put on his vest.  
                    Wouldn t start the car until I did.

    She looks at Antonio.  It s too much for her.  Whether 
    she knows it or not, she s been waiting for Jarek to 
      arrive to break down.  He holds her, comforts her.                                                                                      57.


                                        JAREK
                                (softly)
                    Goddamnit.

    As the camera finds Jarek s face --

                                        JAREK (V.O.)
                    People ask me what Chicago is... I 
                    tell them Chicago s family.

      EXT. N. SHERIDAN RD. (50 MPH) - NIGHT

      Caleb drives.  Jarek sits shotgun.  Teresa is in the 
      backseat, visible in the middle of the two of them.  All 
      three stare ahead -- serious, determined.

                                        JAREK (V.O.)
                    You love it.  Sometimes you fight with 
                    it.  But first and foremost you 
                    protect it.

    As we go with the three of them on this ride along --

                                        THE END
