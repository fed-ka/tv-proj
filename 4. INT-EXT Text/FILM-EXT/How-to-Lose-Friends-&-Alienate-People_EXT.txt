4 SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT 4
...a crowd of FANS held back from us by a red rope, craning
their necks to see us more clearly, waving, cheering,
shouting, cameras flashing... Rain lashes down.
A CAPTION reads: "Sidney's Life, One Year Ago. Bafta
Awards. London."
SIDNEY (V.O.)
Looky-Loos. That's what They call
you when you stand out in the
rain all night just to catch a
glimpse of Them going by.
REVERSE - CELEBRITIES walk down the red carpet, pausing to
wave at the fans.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
I used to pretend it was
different for me because I was
getting paid by a magazine or
newspaper, whatever. But that's,
you know...I just loved watching
Them. I'd stand outside looking
in through the window and think
what it would be like to somehow
get inside. But there was only
one way to get past the thin red
line that separates the
celebrities from the civilians.
You had to be famous.
3.
Sidney stands talking to a young PR WOMAN at the security
gate. He has a small, ugly PIG on a leash.
PR WOMAN
Babe?
SIDNEY
Babe Three. Yeah.
She looks doubtfully at the pig.
PR WOMAN
Babe was a cute little piglet.
SIDNEY
Harry Potter used to be a cute
little piglet too. What do you
want? Tempus Fugits...
PR WOMAN
He hasn't got any ID.
SIDNEY
How many pigs are coming tonight?
Look, I was told to bring him,
hand him over to the producer,
Bob Milton, inside. You want me
to leave him here with you,
that's fine...
PR WOMAN
No, you can't leave him with me.
I've got...Hold on, I'll...
She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red
rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement.
PR WOMAN (CONT'D)
If you're positive that you're
supposed to...
An OLDER PR WOMAN stalks over.
OLDER PR WOMAN
(ICILY)
Well, well, Sidney Young.
SIDNEY
(RUMBLED)
Well, well...clipboard Nazi-type
woman.
She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them.
OLDER PR WOMAN
The pig doesn't get in.
4.
She starts to walk away.
SIDNEY
What about me?
OLDER PR WOMAN
I was talking about you.
5 MOMENTS LATER 5
Sidney and the Pig are being "escorted" away from the red
carpet by the Security.
SIDNEY (V.O.)
The Looky-Loos dream is that one
day they will somehow get to
mingle with the stars. But the
Industry can't allow any
mingling. Stars have to be kept
away from civilians, have to be
quarantined, so they don't become
normal. Like us.
They pass a ravishing HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS walking the other
way. She looks curiously at the pig as she passes. Sidney
stares after her, longingly.
A seedy flat in Shepherds bush.
Sidney emerges from the airport, wearing his crumpled brown
suit, dragging his suitcase behind him. He stares around,
excited to be here.
Sidney drags his suitcase down the quiet street and stops
outside an apartment block, checking the address.
Sidney walks down the street, staring bright eyed at the
city around him, in love with New York. A SEXY WOMAN in a
short dress passes him. Sidney ogles her as she walks into
a BAR.
As the song continues we see Sidney swagger down the busy
sidewalk towards us. He is wearing sunglasses and a T-shirt
emblazoned with a photograph of Keanu Reeves and the
caption "Young, Dumb and Full of Cum."The T-shirt is riding
up a little over his belly.
SIDNEY (V.O.)
This is my city.
He stops at a gleaming chrome entrance and stares up at the
Heywood Building towering above him.
The rooftop swimming pool of a hotel. Flowers everywhere,
including in the pool. Guests mill around drinking. We find
Sidney working his way through the throng to where Alison
stands.
SIDNEY
(MOUTH FULL)
There's a couple of hundred
grands worth of food here and I
swear I'm the only person eating
it. You want some?
Alison recoils. Sidney does a little nerdy dance to the
music as he eats.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
This place is amazing. It's wall
to wall totty.
ALISON
Wall to wall what?
SIDNEY
Totty. Babes. Sexually attractive
women.
ALISON
Do you mind?
SIDNEY
What?
Maddox joins them. A man passes, nods respectfully at
Maddox.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Look at that. All night people
have been treating us like we're
royalty. In London, the
journalist's motto is "Everybody
hates us and we don't care."
LAWRENCE MADDOX
Well, now you're one of the High
Priests of what's Hot and what's
Not. So what were you two talking
about?
34.
ALISON
Sidney was just marvelling at the
abundance of "Totty" here.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
(ENJOYING THIS)
Uh-oh. I don't think Miss Olsen
approves of you, Sidney.
Sidney watches some beautiful women pass, dripping
diamonds.
SIDNEY
I shouldn't be here. I get thrown
out of places like this.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
This? This is a McDonald's. I
hate disease parties. (Off
Sidney's puzzled look) Fund-
raisers.
Someone's CELL PHONE RINGS. All of the guests automatically
check their cells.
An OLDER ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walks over - she's a little
drunk.
WOMAN
Lawrence Maddox? Oh my
goodness... Long time.
Maddox examines her coolly.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Rachel!
Lawrence barely bothers to conceal the fact he doesn't
remember her.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
Rachel. How are you?
RACHEL
Well, I'm just wonderful.
Wonderful. How are you?
Lawrence smiles and looks around him without answering.
Rachel tries again.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
Funny I should run into you. I've
just done this great little film
called Five Boroughs and it's you
know, low-budget, first-time
director but very, uh, moving
and... Hey, maybe you could do a
little...?
35.
A handsome YOUNG MAN passes by. Maddox instantly turns away
from Rachel.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
(SMOOTHLY)
Angelo, good to see you.
Rachel hovers for a moment, embarrassed by her abrupt
dismissal then slips away. Sidney watches her go, feeling
for her.
SIDNEY
(TO MADDOX)
You know that was Rachel Petkoff?
She's a fantastic actress. Hasn't
done anything for years, but, in
her day...
LAWRENCE MADDOX
(COOLLY)
I'm sure.
SIDNEY
Seriously, I've heard about that
film. I think she's going to make
a come back. We should get there
first, do a profile or something
before everyone else...
Maddox isn't listening. Instead he greets a fat, angry-
looking VERY YOUNG MAN. This is VINCENT LEPAK, wearing his
customary SHADES.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
(FAWNING)
Vincent! Great to see you.
Children, I'd like to introduce
you to Vincent Lepak, enfant
terrible and in, my opinion, the
most exciting new director in
American cinema.
Vincent nods, frowning, looks around.
VINCENT
I think this is the worst
fundraiser I've been to in my
whole life.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
It's a rat fuck, isn't it?
Sidney walks away.
47 ANGLE ON RACHEL 47
...standing at the parapet, smoking, staring out over the
city with red eyes. Sidney appears beside her.
36.
SIDNEY
Excuse me? Aren't you Rachel
Petkoff?
Rachel turns to look at him.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
This is sort of embarrassing
but...
He holds out a napkin.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Could I have your autograph?
Rachel, suspecting she is the target of ridicule, looks
around to see if there's an audience.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
I'm a big fan.
RACHEL
(HARD)
Is that so?
SIDNEY
Absolutely. I must have seen
everything you've been in. Those
episodes of The Love Boat and the
Bionic Woman? The Song Birds, In
The Night...I've even seen your
first ever TV appearance. The
Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors.
Right?
RACHEL
(THROWN)
Right...
SIDNEY
My all time favorite? A Day Too
Long. (He means it) You were
really great in that.
Rachel stares at him. She hides her emotion with a bright
smile.
RACHEL
(LAUGHING)
What's your name, honey?
SIDNEY
Sidney Young.
She takes the napkin and pen, her face glowing.
RACHEL
(WRITING)
Sidney Young. I'll remember that.
37.
48 ANGLE ON VINCENT 48
...holding court to Maddox, Alison and some of the
Glitterati. Sidney joins them, eating more food.
VINCENT
You look around and it's all
shit. No-one is making movies
that are fucking worthwhile.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
I'd have to disagree with you,
Vincent.
Vincent looks at him, displeased.
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
You're making movies that are
worthwhile.
Vincent accepts this with a curt nod.
VINCENT
This is what I'm saying. You have
to inspire yourself. I am my role-
model. I want to be me...
He stares angrily around, handing his empty glass to his
waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full
one from a passing tray. Sidney watches him with dislike.
SIDNEY
(SUDDENLY)
Greatest film ever made?
VINCENT
Excuse me?
SIDNEY
What's the greatest film ever
made? (To Alison) Go on. Have a
guess.
ALISON
(IRRITATED)
Well, that's...I don't think
there is one single film that...
SIDNEY
Have a guess.
VINCENT
(SNEERING)
Yeah, have a guess - what is the
greatest film ever made?
38.
ALISON
(EMBARRASSED)
I don't, uh...well personally I
love La Dolce Vita but...
SIDNEY
Incorrect. Con Air.
ALISON
(BEAT)
I beg your pardon?
SIDNEY
Uhuh, Con Air. It's got
everything. Malkovich for your
acting chops, Nicky Cage for
action, Buscemi for comedy, John
Cusack for the Gays. It's a
smorgasbord.
The group study him, trying to work out if this is irony or
idiocy. Maddox is staring daggers at him. An extremely
thin, fashionably dressed woman smiles at Sidney.
WOMAN
I don't think we've been
introduced?
LAWRENCE MADDOX
Mister Young, this is Eleanor
Johnson, Queen of New York.
Eleanor this is Sidney Young.
He's from England and he's our
very own Idiot Savant. Without
the Savant.
ELEANOR JOHNSON
Well, it's always nice to have
fresh blood at these things. (To
Maddox) Which reminds me, I'm
here with Sophie Maes, I want you
to meet her. New film, The
Suffragette coming out, the buzz
is A-mazing. The release is tied
in with the roll-out of the
Reebok campaign, and now Louis
Vuitton's on the line. This train
is leaving the station Lawrence.
SIDNEY
(TO ELEANOR)
So, you're a publicist?
ELEANOR JOHNSON
I don't really like that word,
Sidney.
SIDNEY
What should I call you?
39.
ELEANOR JOHNSON
You can call me Eleanor.
She stares past him, across the pool.
ELEANOR JOHNSON (CONT'D)
There she is.
They turn to see a young woman standing across the pool
from them. This is SOPHIE MAES - a natural beauty,
statuesque, no make-up, hair simply pulled back.
Sophie tries to walk around the pool to join them but finds
she can't work her way through the crowd. She turns to her
right but finds her way similarly blocked.
She hesitates for a moment and then with a shrug climbs
down into the pool, the water up to her chest, and begins
to walk through the floating flowers towards them.
Sidney stares at her, TRANSFIXED. Alison notices this with
some contempt.
Gradually everyone notices Sophie and stops to look.
Having reached the other side, Sophie ascends the pool
steps, laughing, her dress clinging to her: Venus rising
from the waves. The Photographers appear, snapping merrily
away.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
(MURMURING)
Oh, this one will go far.
The Paparazzi are still crowding around the group as they
make their way to the waiting car.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
(TO ALISON)
We're going on to the Circle
Club. I'll see you tomorrow.
ALISON
(TIGHT)
Okay. Good night.
Maddox slips his jacket around Sophie's shoulders.
SOPHIE
Aren't you cold?
LAWRENCE MADDOX
I'm from Canada, land of ice and
snow.
They get into the car. Sidney tries to follow them.
SIDNEY
Budge up.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
Where are you going?
SIDNEY
I'm coming to the club.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
Sorry, you're not on the list.
A small CHIHUAHUA - CUBA - on Sophie's lap snarls at
Sidney.
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
See? Even Cuba says so.
Maddox closes the door and the car glides away, Sophie
kissing the dog on the nose. The Paparazzi hurry back to
the entrance as another celebrity emerges, leaving Alison
and Sidney staring after the car.
SIDNEY
(FUMING)
That's... that turns my stomach.
Pawing her like that. He's old
enough to be her father.
42.
ALISON
(IRRITATED)
No he isn't.
SIDNEY
Yes he is. I started producing
sperm when I was thirteen, so you
know, technically...
ALISON
For your information he wasn't
pawing her! He was just doing his
job! In case you haven't noticed
Sharps has to have a star on the
cover every month. And most of
those stars are clients of
Eleanor's. So do not piss her
off.
SIDNEY
She's a flak. Hacks don't take
orders from flaks. And I don't
think you can call that "doing
his job." The man had no blood
left in his upper body...
ALISON
(SNAPPING)
Will you...? Oh, and next time
you want to do the hilariously
ironic I love Con Air skit would
you mind...?
SIDNEY
I wasn't being ironic...
ALISON
...would you mind not involving
me, especially in the presence of
Vincent Lepak who happens to be
very important.
SIDNEY
Yeah, I could tell by the way he
was allowed to stay up past his
bed time.
The car disappears into the distance. They watch it go.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Do you think she'd go out with
me?
ALISON
Who?
SIDNEY
Sophie Maes. You think she'll go
out with me?
43.
ALISON
No. Girls like Sophie don't date
journalists. As far as she's
concerned, you're the help.
SIDNEY
What do you know? A lot of these
starlets are lonely. They spend
their time looking for a man.
Alison starts to walk away.
ALISON
This is New York, Sidney. Women
only date men who are
successful...
SIDNEY
I'm going to be successful.
ALISON
(as she goes)
...and tall.
A small group of GLITTERATI pass the immense line of
hopefuls waiting outside the club and are ushered inside by
the DOORMAN at the entrance. Sidney walks confidently up,
pretending to talk into his cell. The Doorman stands in his
way, impassive. Still talking Sidney turns and walks away
as if nothing has happened.
Sidney approaches the Doorman , takes a ten dollar bill
from his pocket and hands it to the Doorman. The Doorman
crumples the bill up and throws it away. Without a word
Sidney begins to walk away. He comes back and picks up the
crumpled note and then heads off again.
We are TRACKING through Magazine Staff, celebrities,
politicians and children as they mill about the lawns of
the sprawling mansion, enjoying the Fourth Of July
celebrations which are in progress. Clayton greets guests -
the perfect host.
We find Sidney, wearing unfashionable shorts, socks and
shoes. He is talking to Alison.
ALISON
You hired a stripper?
SIDNEY
I didn't "hire" him. Bob did it
for a favour.
ALISON
I thought you wanted to be a
success here?
SIDNEY
I do! It's just...(ruefully) It
wasn't me. It was Clark.
Alison laughs.
ALISON
The famous alter-ego? How long's
he been hanging around?
SIDNEY
Since I was a kid. Anytime
something got broken, or the
bathroom got accidentally set on
fire - it wasn't me. It was
Clark. (Beat.) The weird thing
is, he kind of took over.
ALISON
How old were you?
SIDNEY
I don't know, twenty, twenty
one...
Alison laughs.
70.
ALISON'D)
Well, let me tell you, if only
you could get rid of that Clark,
you could be a real winner.
SIDNEY
(DEPRESSED)
Clayton's not going to print
anything I write. I've been on
salary for six-months and I've
written precisely one hundred and
seventy five words. On a dollar-
per-word basis, I'm the highest
paid writer in the history of
this magazine.(Beat) He's not
going to renew my contract.
ALISON
(SIGHS)
What did you expect, Sidney?
Vincent's one of Eleanor's
clients. I told you. They're
Untouchables.
SIDNEY
I thought Clayton was different.
I really did. (Beat) The only
thing I'm good at is pissing
people off, and he won't let me
do it. (Beat) "My glory walks
hand in hand with my doom." (Off
her look) Troy
ALISON
Troy who?
SIDNEY
Troy, the movie.
He stares around him at the other guests.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Everybody hates me here. You're
the only one who'll talk to me.
ALISON
You cornered me.
SIDNEY
(a little embarrassed)
No, I mean it. You're the person
who's been most, you know...
uh...abusive to me.
Alison laughs again. They smile at each other.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
You want another drink?
71.
ALISON
(beat, smiling)
Alright. I'll have a beer.
Sidney walks off.
Sidney is getting a drink at the bar that has been set up
in the grounds. Suddenly he stiffens, watching as Sophie
Maes, looking spectacular, walks over to where Maddox and
his circle are talking nearby.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
Sophie, my darling. Looking
ravishing as always.
Whilst the two are engaged in kissing cheeks, Sidney takes
a credit card from his wallet and drops it surreptitiously
by Sophie's feet.
JOURNALIST
(TO MADDOX)
You know what I read the other
day? Your collection of poems -
The Hollow Heart? Man, they're
great.
Sidney reacts to this, feeling troubled for some reason.
SOPHIE MAES
You write poems?
LAWRENCE MADDOX
In another life.
The BARMAN is handing out drinks.
BARMAN
And a White Russian?
LAWRENCE MADDOX
Right here.
Sidney stares at the drink, feeling like he's just been
punched in the stomach. Maddox notices him.
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
Well, well, if it isn't Sidalee.
Maddox notices the card at Sophie's feet.
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D)
(picking it up)
What's this? "Hon Young".
SIDNEY
That's...that's mine.
72.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
But your name's not "Hon".
SIDNEY
(reaching for it)
It's short for "Honourable".
LAWRENCE
(whisking it away)
As in, "the Honourable Sidney
Young"?
SIDNEY
Can I please...?
LAWRENCE
(holding it out of
SIDNEY'S REACH)
So how come it says "Hon Young"?
They made you sound like some
Korean medical student.
The people gathered around laugh.
SIDNEY
They screwed it up. Please.
LAWRENCE
Sidney baby, you don't wanna go
faking a British title to impress
Sophie. It's the Fourth of July.
(Handing back the card): We're
celebrating the fact that we
threw a bunch of British
aristocrats out.
Sidney smiles tightly. Suddenly...
SIDNEY
Why don't you shut up, Maddox?
Beat. The others look to Maddox to see how he will react.
Maddox smiles dangerously.
LAWRENCE MADDOX
Careful Sidney. Remember - if it
wasn't for us you'd all be
speaking German.
SIDNEY
You're Canadian. If it wasn't for
us you'd be speaking French.
Sophie giggles. Maddox doesn't like this but before he can
answer Sidney walks off.
73.
Sidney is staring over to where Alison and Maddox are
standing by some trees, deep in conversation. Maddox is
tossing nuts into the air and catching them in his mouth.
SIDNEY
(muttering to himself)
Choke. Choke.
He puts his fingers to his temples as if to channel
telekinetic powers.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Choke...choke...
Sidney realizes Harding's wife is passing with her two
daughters.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Hello, Mrs Harding. Lovely party.
With a look of alarm she shepherds the girls away. A tall
older man dressed in white with a long white beard appears
next to Sidney.
OLDER MAN
How are you?
Sidney nods gloomily.
OLDER MAN (CONT'D)
Has anyone ever told you before
that you have an unusually dark
aura?
SIDNEY
Yup.
74.
OLDER MAN
You should walk with bare feet as
much as possible, ground all that
negative energy.
Sidney examines him.
SIDNEY
So...you're a wizard or...?
OLDER MAN
I'm a spiritual healer.
SIDNEY
You can make a living doing that?
OLDER MAN
Oh God no. I'm a dentist.
They stare at the party for a moment.
OLDER MAN (CONT'D)
You want to do some coke?
SIDNEY
Um...no, thanks.
86 LATER 86
Rachel Petkoff stands talking to some other guests. Sidney
notices her and walks over.
SIDNEY
Hey! Hello again?
Rachel smiles at him distantly, clearly not remembering
him.
RACHEL
Hello. (Turning back to the
others) No, Lawrence is a
wonderful writer. I really felt
like he got to the heart of me.
Sidney snorts. Rachel turns back to him, faintly irritated.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, have we...?
SIDNEY
Sidney. Sidney Young. We met
at...
Another GUEST walks past Sidney and kisses Rachel.
GUEST
I saw Five Boroughs the other day
and wept!
75.
Sidney hovers for a moment, ignored, and then walks away.
87 LATER 87
Dusk. The guests have gathered on the lawns to watch the
fireworks. There are oohs and aahs as the rockets light up
the sky. Suddenly...
SIDNEY (O.S.)
In-ger-lernd!
Puzzled the guests turn to where a drunk Sidney is standing
on the balustrade of the porch of the house.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
In-ger-lernd! In-ger-lerrrrrrnd!
He spots HUGH GRANT amongst the crowd, watching him,
puzzled.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
You! Grant! Come on! In-ger-
lerrrr...
With that he slips from the balustrade and crashes into the
shrubbery below.
88 LATER 88
Sidney limps through the trees, dabbing at a scratch on his
face. He passes Alison who is sitting on a tree-swing, lost
in thought, swigging absently from a bottle of wine.
ALISON
You okay?
SIDNEY
What?
ALISON
I said are you okay?
SIDNEY
I'm fine. Yup. Fine. (Beat) You?
ALISON
Yup. (Beat) No, actually. I hate
my life so, you know, I'm gonna
get drunk.
Sidney nods, vaguely. They stand in awkward silence for a
moment. Then...
SIDNEY
Right...See you...
He walks off. Beat. He walks back into frame suddenly.
76.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
(FURIOUS)
HOW COULD YOU?
ALISON
(STARTLED)
What?
SIDNEY
How the...You...having an affair
with Maddox! I mean...Maddox for
Christ's sake! The Man With
Hidden Shallows! Jesus! I mean, I
used to think you were...I was
starting to...I mean, at first I
thought you were a pain but then
I started to think...but I
mean...Maddox? How can you live
with yourself?
Alison stares at him, pale, blinking back tears.
ALISON
(QUIETLY)
I couldn't. That's why I've
broken up with him.
SIDNEY
Well, that's no...that's, you
know...(Beat) You broke up with
him?
Alison walks off. Beat. She walks back.
ALISON
Which leg did you hurt?
SIDNEY
(POINTING)
This one.
Alison kicks the leg.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
OW!
She walks off again.
Sidney lies beside the pool staring darkly into the water
and nursing the beginnings of a hangover. We hear faint
music and laughter from where the party continues in the
house behind.
He notices the reflection of the starry sky in the water
and reaching out gloomily to hold one of the stars. The
reflection dissolves into ripples. When the water settles
Sophie Maes reflection stares back at him.
77.
She's drunk and a good deal of the movie star mystique
seems to have evaporated.
SOPHIE MAES
You know what? There's something
very damaged about you.
Sidney stares at her, not sure what to say.
SIDNEY
Huh...
Sophie lies down beside the pool, plays with a strand of
her hair.
SOPHIE MAES
Like an animal that's been hit by
a car or something. Like a deer
or...like a pig maybe? When they
walk funny and the other animals
keep away from them. Little limpy
pig. I'm drawn to sick animals.
That's why I picked Cuba -
because he had like psychological
problems? (Her eyes well with
tears) Poor little Cuba. Where is
he now?
SIDNEY
(BEAT)
Huh...
She wipes her eyes, rolls onto her back.
SOPHIE MAES
Jesus, I'm wasted. Are you
wasted? I'm wasted.
Sidney watches her.
SIDNEY
Congratulations on becoming
incredibly famous by the way.
SOPHIE MAES
Thanks.
SIDNEY
(BEAT)
What's it like?
SOPHIE MAES
What's what like?
SIDNEY
Everything.
She rolls her head to look at him solemnly.
78.
SOPHIE MAES
Weird. It's happening so fast
and...it's like it's got nothing
to do with me. It's like I'm not
even really here.
She laughs softly.
SOPHIE MAES (CONT'D)
Am I here?
SIDNEY
You're here.
She turns back to look at the stars.
SOPHIE MAES
I'm so hungry.
SIDNEY
Would you...would you like me to
get you some food?
SOPHIE MAES
Are you crazy? There might still
be a photographer around.
They lie in silence for a moment.
SOPHIE MAES (CONT'D)
(DREAMILY)
You know what would be nice
though? Some coke.
She rubs her face, close to falling asleep.
SOPHIE MAES (CONT'D)
Probably just as well I haven't
got any. Coke always makes me so
horny.
Sidney opens his mouth but cannot speak.
90 SIDNEY RUNNING DESPERATELY... 90
...through the groups of people chatting outside the house.
SIDNEY
(out of breath)
Wizard! Wizard Dentist Man! Need
Wizard Dentist Man!
91 DRIVE 91
Sidney has virtually dragged the Dentist out of his car. He
is handing Sidney a wrap.
79.
SIDNEY
I will never, never, never forget
this. Thank you!
He starts to hurry away.
92 OUTSIDE HOUSE 92
Alison is weaving unsteadily towards the driveway.
Sidney hurries past then slows and stops, staring back at
her.
93 ALISON'S CAR 93
Alison stands rooting in her purse for a tip to give the
VALET MAN who is holding open the door of her car for her,
the engine running.
SIDNEY
What are you doing?
ALISON
None of your business...
SIDNEY
You can't drive. You need to go
and sleep this off somewhere.
ALISON
Firstly, you are a stupid asshole
and I hate you and Secondly...
Secondly...
She muses on what she was going to say next. Sidney looks
over his shoulder, imagining Sophie waiting for him.
ALISON (CONT'D)
Secondly...
SIDNEY
Yeah, okay. Listen, you try
driving in this state you're
gonna kill yourself.
ALISON
Who'd care if I did?
Beat. Suddenly she bursts into tears. Surprised, Sidney
stands, uncertain what to do.
ALISON (CONT'D)
(SWAYING FORWARD)
I've got to go. Got to go.
Sidney holds her to stop her falling. He stares back at the
pool and then down at Alison.
80.
Rain pours down. Eleanor and Vincent climb into a limousine
and close the door. Sidney runs up.
SIDNEY
Wait! Eleanor wait!
The window glides down.
ELEANOR JOHNSON
Yes?
SIDNEY
Let me do the profile on Vincent.
ELEANOR JOHNSON
(AMUSED)
I don't think so.
The window begins to slide up. Sidney hangs onto it.
SIDNEY
You get full copy approval. It'll
be like you've written it!
The window stops. Eleanor stares at him, considering.
Sidney looks past her to Vincent.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
(DETERMINED)
Vincent - think about it, think
how humiliating it will be for
me. I'm begging you.
Vincent leans over, stares over his shades at Sidney.
97.
VINCENT
(Beat, enjoying this)
You don't look like you're
begging.
Beat. Sidney kneels down on the side-walk beside the
limousine. The rain pours down on him. The limousine drives
away. Sidney stares dumbly up at something across the
street.
REVERSE
On the building across the street is an ENORMOUS ANIMATED
BILLBOARD L'OREAL ADVERTISEMENT - SOPHIE MAES, in a gold
ball-gown and make-up, hair coiffured in classic forties
Hollywood style. As we watch she BLOWS US A KISS.
Underneath is the slogan - I'm Here...
Sidney buys a copy of Sharps and flicks through it until he
finds what he's looking for - a four page feature entitled
Vincent Lepak - Long Live The King.
He stares at his byline at the top of the feature.
An elegant apartment building.
Snow falls. Sidney climbs out of a limousine with Eleanor
and Sophie.
The women breeze past the Doorman and into the club. Sidney
hesitates on the thresh-hold, staring up at the sign above
him as if it's a magic portal.
Sidney walks in.
Sophie and her entourage, including Sidney and Eleanor,
climb out of a line of limousines and walk into the Hotel.
Sidney stands for a moment, looking around him. Hollywood.
He's finally here.
We hear the opening of Virgina Plain by Roxy Music.
We are swooping in towards the hotel and an enormous
BILLBOARD ADVERTISEMENT for Sophie's new film - in pre-
production. It's a re-make of Singing In The Rain - with
Russel Crowe.
We BOOM down from Sophie's fifteen foot laughing face to
find Sidney standing on a slim ledge outside his hotel
window. He is drunk and wearing only his underwear. He is
also yelling with fear.
The window behind him is crowded with people shrieking with
laughter.
Gingerly he edges back to the window and climbs back
into...
136 HOTEL SUITE 136
It's a wild party. Music is blaring, people are dancing,
drinking, laughing.
SOPHIE MAES
You didn't do it!
SIDNEY
High.
SOPHIE MAES
You let me down!
SIDNEY
Too high! You couldn't do it. Too
high.
Sophie calmly unzips her dress and steps out of it,
standing in her underwear. There is applause from the on-
lookers. Calmly she steps out of the window onto the ledge
and disappears from sight.
The on-lookers crane out of the window, yelling
encouragement.
After a moment Sophie appears at another window further
along the wall and climbs back into the room to ecstatic
applause. She stares imperiously at Sidney.
106.
SOPHIE MAES
What are you?
SIDNEY
Your limpy pig.
SOPHIE MAES
What?
SIDNEY
I'm your limpy pig!
SOPHIE MAES
That's right! Okay, limpy pig.
You need to pay a forfeit.
Whatcha got?
SIDNEY
I've got my little limpy dance.
Sidney dances a little, jiggling up and down.
SOPHIE MAES
(SUDDENLY)
Give me your ring.
Sidney stops dancing, his smile fading a little.
SIDNEY
I...I can't...
SOPHIE MAES
Give me the ring. I want it.
SIDNEY
I can't.
Sophie stares at him through narrowed eyes.
SOPHIE MAES
Okay, give me the ring and if I
win tomorrow, I'll let you have
sex with me.
The on-lookers shriek with delight.
Sidney stares at her. He looks past her to his reflection
in the window - a drunk man in his underwear, swaying from
side to side...
A conveyor belt of limousines arriving outside the Hilton.
Rain falls. Celebrities wave to the watching crowds as they
make their way up the red carpet, cameras flash...
Sophie emerges from a limo, looking amazing. SHE IS WEARING
A FUR WRAP. She makes her way up the carpet, Sidney walks
behind, smiling vaguely...
Sidney bursts out of the hotel onto the red carpet and is
momentarily stopped by the sight of the massed PAPARAZZI
ahead, behind the red rope. The Paparazzi stare back at
Sidney - his face bruised, shirt collar ripped - equally
nonplussed. There is a frozen moment then Sidney plunges
forward, ducking under the red rope, back amongst his own
kind, pushing through them until he disappears amongst the
crowd.
Sidney is in a cab, still wearing his tux, his travel bag
slung over shoulder. He stares out as the cab passes the
entrance to a PARK. A sign advertises an outdoor screening
of La Dolce Vita.
SIDNEY
Stop the car!
An outdoor CINEMA has been set up. LA DOLCE VITA is playing
on a large screen. A crowd sits around the park, watching
the movie.
Sidney stands scanning the crowd. He locates Alison sitting
near the back.
112.
She is holding her notebook, watching the movie. Beside her
is the remains of a picnic, with lit candles.
Sidney smiles and starts towards her, then stops. She is
sitting next to a MAN. As Sidney watches she rests her head
on his shoulder.
Sidney watches, numb, then turns to walk away...
BOB stands in front of him in full drag, waving
frantically. He starts to run towards Sidney, who sighs and
closes his eyes - as if things weren't bad enough.
Then Bob runs straight past him. Sidney turns to see the
Man next to Alison standing up to embrace Bob. The two
kiss.
ON THE GRASS
Alison watches Bob and her friend embrace with a touch of
sadness. Suddenly she realises someone is standing beside
her. She looks up and sees Sidney.
She stares at him. Long Beat.
Sidney holds out his hand.
Alison hesitates and then takes his hand and stands up.
SIDNEY
How's the novel?
ALISON
Finished.
Sidney smiles. He takes the notebook from her and tosses it
back onto the picnic blanket. Then he kisses her. As he
does so he takes the RING and slips it into Alison's coat
pocket.
Then they begin to dance, cha-cha-chaaing happily at the
back of the park, as the music swells, lit by the
flickering light from the screen.
Suddenly Sidney freezes, staring over Alison's shoulder to
where we can see he has accidentally thrown her NOTEBOOK
onto a lit candle.
It is now ON FIRE.
Sidney shoves Alison aside and dives for the book...
