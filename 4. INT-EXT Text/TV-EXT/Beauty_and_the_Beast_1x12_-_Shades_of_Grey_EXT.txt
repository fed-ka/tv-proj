        At her desk. She winces, touches her temples. We HEAR the
          rhythmic POUNDING in her head, OVERLAPPING with the sound
        of Winslow's pounding deep below the earth. Her
          breathing is ragged, her face pale. She knows this is not
        just an ordinary headache. Something is very, very wrong.
        She leans forward, as if she were ill, closing her eyes,
          cradling her head in her hands. Then she raises up her
        head, and her eyes open wide.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      26.

                                      CATHERINE
                              (frightened whisper)
                      Vincent. . .

                                                                  SMASH CUT TO:



      After the loud, furious POUNDING of the last two scenes, the
        profound silence down in this darkness is almost a shock.
        Vincent is moving stones from the rubble around the
        entranceway. We can see that it's a hopeless task, but he
      works methodically, untiring, with heroic strength. Father is
      a few feet away, sitting against the wall of the cave,
        staring into the darkness. Vincent suddenly stops in his
        labors, pauses, listening.

                                    VINCENT
                      Listen...

                                      FATHER
                      What?

                                    VINCENT
                      The pounding...
                              (touches the wall)
                      Through the stone... someone is
                      hammering against the rock..:

                                      FATHER
                              (listens, scowls)
                      I can't hear a thing...

                                    VINCENT
                      It's coming from the far side of
                      the crawlspace... the children must
                      have made it out safely...

                                      FATHER
                      Yes... good...
                                            (beat)
                      They'll dig down to us then.
                      It's such a long way& How long
                      do you think...

                                    VINCENT
                      As long as it takes.

                                      FATHER
                      Vincent... there's so much I want to
                      tell you... and so little time.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

      There's something in his voice -- a heartache, a fear,
      a yearning -- that makes Vincent stop his labors and come to
      Father's side.

                                    VINCENT
                    We have all the time in the world,
                    Father.

                                    FATHER
                    It hurts... I'm not as strong as I
                    was once, Vincent...

                                    VINCENT
                    They'll be here soon. Rest.

                                    FATHER
                    No... plenty of time for rest
                      later...
                            (with black humor)
                    ... whatever happens.
                            (beat)
                    The quiet, the darkness... so
                      chilling...
                            (beat)
                    I feel so useless... blind... I
                    wish I could see your face...

      Father reaches out blindly, touches Vincent's face with
      his hand, traces its shapes as a blind man might. It's
      enough. Father SMILES.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:



        Elliot Burch's headquarters...

                                                                  CUT TO:



      Vincent and Catherine approach the entry point to Catherine's
      world, both bone-weary from their long ordeal, but finding
      warmth and comfort in each other's presence.

                                    VINCENT
                    Rest well, Catherine.
                    You must be exhausted.

                                    CATHERINE
                      I don't think I've ever been so
                      frightened.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                                      57.

                                      VINCENT
                      It was a desparate time. A shadow of
                      fear fell across my heart.
                      Dark and chilling... thoughts of...
                      losing the man that's given me my
                      life.
                              (beat; trying to find
                                the words)
                      Your bravery saved us, Catherine.
                        Without you...

                                      CATHERINE
                      My life would mean nothing without
                      you to share it.

        They embrace for a long moment, then Catherine starts
        toward the entry point.

                                      VINCENT
                        Catherine... though our worlds
                        separate us, we can never be
                        apart.
