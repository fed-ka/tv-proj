       Captain's log, Stardate 42923.7. 
       We are en route to the Braslota 
       System, site of the first 
       Starfleet battle simulation. 
       Joining the Enterprise as observer 
       and mediator is the Zakdorn Master 
       Strategist, Sirna Kolrami. 
       Despite misgivings, I have agreed 
       to Starfleet's request that we 
       take part in these wargame 
       exercises.

       to a grave miscalculation on my 
       part, the Enterprise has been 
       subjected to a withering attack 
       by the Ferengi. I find myself 
       with little time to decide the 
       fate of forty of my crew stranded 
       aboard the derelict Hathaway.

     where the atmosphere is anything but relaxed -- the

     moment to absorb what is happening.

     are once again playing Strategema surrounded by a

     at the -- 
 
      83   DIGITAL COUNTER (OPTICAL)

      85   SCENE 
 
         DATA 
       Why have you suspended the game? 
 
     Kolrami is beside himself with anger, humiliation, 
     self-doubt and confusion. He doesn't know whether to 
     drop dead or order pizza. 
 
         KOLRAMI 
        (shaking with rage) 
       Because this is not a rematch -- 
       you have made a mockery of me. 
 
     He storms out of Ten-Forward with an urgency that could 
     only be borne of public disgrace. 
 
      86   DATA 
 
     is swarmed by the CHEERING CREW. Riker and Pulaski 
     push their way through to join Worf, Geordi, Wesley and 
     Troi in the inner-circle. 
 
         RIKER 
       Data, you beat him! 
 
         DATA 
       No, sir -- it is a stalemate. 
 
         WORF 
       No game of Strategema has ever 
       gone this high. 
 
         GEORDI 
       What did you do? 
 
         DATA 
       I simply altered my "premise" for 
       playing. 
 
         RIKER 
       Explain. 
 
         DATA 
       Working under the assumption that 
       Kolrami is attempting to win, it 
       is reasonable to assume that he 
       expects me to play for the same 
       goal. 
 
         WESLEY 
       You weren't?

      86   CONTINUED: 
 
         DATA 
       No. I was playing only for a 
       standoff -- a "draw." While 
       Kolrami was dedicated to winning, 
       I was able to pass up obvious 
       avenues of advancement and settle 
       for a balance. 
        (android pride) 
       Theoretically, I should be able 
       to challenge him indefinitely. 
 
         PULASKI 
       Then you have beaten him. 
 
     Data demurring, but with a little preen. 
 
         DATA 
       A matter of perspective. In the 
       strictest sense I did not win. 
 
     Troi and Pulaski lean in close with a "Come on, cut 
     the bull-stuff" attitude. 
 
         TROI/PULASKI 
       Data! 
 
         DATA 
       I busted him up. 
 
     The CROWDED ROOM ERUPTS once again, and amidst the 
     congratulatory noise and the outstretched hands of 
     patting approval, PUSH IN on Data's satisfied 
     expression as he absorbs this new sensation, and -- 
 
             FADE OUT.
