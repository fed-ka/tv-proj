          WALT and SARAH walk home after seeing a movie. It's a
          rainy, romantic evening. Both seem bound and determined
          to enjoy a rare date night.

                                        SARAH
                                (not at all convincing)
                        That was good.

                                        WALT
                                (not convinced)
                        O-kay.

                                        SARAH
                        What?  I liked it.  It won't be
                        winning Oscars, but it was a
                          diverting hour and a half.  

                                        WALT
                        We could've seen that Italian
                        film.

                                        SARAH
                        Oh no.  Two hours of trying to
                        read dark subtitles on a dark
                          background?  I hate that.

                                        WALT
                          Actually, I'm the one who hates
                        that.

                                        SARAH
                        Fine.  Next time, it's an Ingmar
                        Bergman double feature for you.

          They walk along in silence for a moment, but there's
          tension.  Walt senses something's wrong but he can't put
          his finger on it... but it's been out there for a few
          weeks now, that feeling... he's embarrassed, even afraid
          to bring it up but he has to...

                                        WALT
                        You gonna tell me what's going
                        on?

          He stops and looks at her and then away... studying lights
          of the village... this isn't easy for him...

                        Well, I'm sorry.  I'll try to
                        make more time to ignore you both.

                        I had to marry a cop.

          She takes a beat to frame an explanation, an honest
            dishonest one she can live with.

                                        SARAH
                        We're taking time.  Trying to
                        figure out how we fit into each
                        other's lives... or if we even
                        do.

                        Funny cause right now, it seems
                        to me you're trying awfully hard
                        to figure out how you fit into
                        our life.

          And this is an achingly low moment.  Walt studies her...
          and a dozen responses rush through her mind in a fraction
          of a second... including telling him the whole truth...
          but it's moot anyway because before she can answer, the
          familiar buzz of his cell phone breaks the spell...

                        I'll be there.

          Walt hangs up his cell phone.  He really didn't need an
            interruption right now.  But he has a job to do.

                                        WALT
                        You had to marry a cop. 

          Walt gives Sarah a kiss.  It's a bit of an awkward moment
          for both of them.

                                        WALT
                        We're not done.

                                        SARAH
                                (smiles)
                        You've got a conversation
                        raincheck.

          Walt gives Sarah the umbrella, puts the collar up on his
          coat and runs into the rain.  Sarah's light-hearted smile
          fades.



          The rain has stopped, but the ominous dark clouds promise
          more to come.

          Walt's cruiser is parked next to an abandoned SUV on the
          side of a rural road.  Johnny joins Walt, using his cane
          to balance on the loose gravel surface.  An older local
          man in a filthy quilted jacket, EDGAR, searches the area
          with two baying bloodhounds.

          Several other squad cars are nearby and we can hear the
          voices of people scouring the woods.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Walt)
                        So when the dogs fail, you call
                        me?

                                        EDGAR
                        It's not their fault.  They got
                        skunked the other day.

          Walt's not in a joking mood.  And we may notice he's not
          friendly good-old-boy Walt toward Johnny as he carries
          the memory of his interrupted conversation with Sarah
          during the early going here... until the job at hand takes
          priority...

                        This is Tom Hirsch's SUV.  He
                        left the house this morning with
                        his brother Doug and their
                          girlfriends.  

          Johnny touches the driver's door handle of the SUV, gets
          nothing... moves back to the rear door and as he reaches
          in and touches the latch... RAMP TO HIS FACE and...


44A VISION - SAME LOCATION - DAY  

          Johnny stands observing as the four teens unload gear
          from the rear of the vehicle.  TOM HIRSCH (18), a jock in
            a Cleaves Mills letterman jacket; DOUG (16), Tom's younger
          brother, fresh-faced and likeable; ERIN (17), Tom's
          girlfriend, a cheerleader type; and KATE (16), Doug's
          girlfriend, cute, smart, a serious student.

                                        TOM
                        I used to come out here years ago
                        when I was little... you're not
                        going to believe this place... 

            Laughing, Tom exits the SUV.  Johnny spins just in time
          to let him pass.

          Johnny turns to watch the four teens head off into the
          woods, with Tom and Erin the ringleaders and Doug and
          Kate more cautious.  They're carrying a couple of six
          packs, blankets, and flashlights. 



          Johnny heads into the woods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This way.

          Walt and Edgar follow him.



          Johnny pauses to get his bearings... reaches down to touch
          the ground... and in

          Johnny leads the way for the others...

          And then, slowly appearing through a break in the trees...


  77ESTABLISH THE HIGHSMITH MINE

            A looming rock ridge with a black gaping entrance.
            Discarded machinery, faded metal trespassing signs and a
          broken chain fence ineffectually bar the entrance.

          An appropriate music cue suggests strange and eerie things
          lie ahead.

          Johnny pauses as he considers the ominous sight.  And we
          don't have to see what he sees as he stares at it and
          says --

                        I got into a lot of trouble when
                        my dad caught me up here with a
                        girl once... 

          Johnny regrets saying it as soon as it comes out of his
          mouth because that girl was Sarah and Walt is no fool, he
          can figure it out.  The both decide to ignore the obvious. 
          Edgar moves to enter the mine, but his dogs refuse to go,
          kicking up a loud fuss.  They seem scared.

                                        EDGAR
                        Now they're spooked.

          Edgar heads back the way they came.  Johnny and Walt
          tentatively enter the abandoned mine, Walt shining a high
          powered flashlight.  A DRAFT OF WIND from the depths of
          the mine ruffles Johnny's hair.  A WHISPER seems to drift
          past.  It's almost as though the mine is BREATHING.

                        Tom Hirsch!  Anyone here?

          Walt's voice echoes -- "Anybody here... here... here." --
          but there's no human response.  Walt frowns, looks to
          Johnny as they move inside...



          Johnny and Walt emerge from the woods.  The gravel parking
          lot is now swarming with activity.  The SEARCH AND RESCUE
          TEAM is unloading their gear from a yellow County EMT
          truck.

                        this mine after the big cave-in
                        of '49.

                        I think you've all heard of Johnny
                        Smith.  He has some very
                          encouraging news to report.

                        There was a cave-in and they're
                        trapped but I don't believe any
                        of them were seriously injured.

                        I think I can help the search
                        teams find them.

                                        MRS. TYNER
                        My Kate, she didn't want to take
                        her winter jacket.  She was mad I
                          wouldn't buy her a new one.  We
                        had a big fight when she was
                        leaving...

          She begins to cry and this could be a long story.  Purdy

                        Mr. Smith are doing everything in
                        their power to find her.  But if
                        they're going to have success, we
                        need to let them go about their

                        okay.

          Johnny doesn't know, hasn't seen that future, at least

          He turns to see her... (and for the actors: Johnny hasn't
          been calling Dana for dates for a couple of weeks now so
          there's a vague subtext here but it's not something they
          would address under these circumstances.)

          Then as she senses movement at the mine entrance...


          AND SO DOES SARAH

          They turn to see --

          And Johnny is the first one out, walking slowly... soaking
          wet and exhausted...


          SARAH

            reacts...

          and a fraction of a beat later, here comes Walt...

                          I better go call Terry's wife.  I

          team to tell them about Collier... his tired eyes meet
          Sarah's... she smiles with relief... he takes her arm as
          they walk... and he tells her what happened.  (Most of
          the reporters follow Walt for information.) Purdy moves
          to Johnny... handing Johnny a mug of soup which he drinks
          with appreciation... Purdy was close enough to overhear
          Walt's speech and is stunned by the news...

                        back.

          Purdy sighs deeply.  He is sincerely saddened by this
          news, he nods slowly...

                        Still not sure where they are.  I
                          couldn't pick up any traces...

          Purdy acknowledges, moves to the opening of the mine to
          say a silent prayer... by now, Dana has moved over... 

                                        DANA
                        I don't know if this will help
                        but I found an old map of the
                        mine at the County Assessors
                          Office...

          She pulls it out of her large tote bag... as Johnny takes
          it from her, unfolding it... we do a 180 degree turn and
          find...



          At the entrance to the mine, Johnny, standing in for his
          own grandfather, age 50, refers to the exact same map as
          he confers with Eli, with dubious miners around them...
          again, notable among them is Stengel, the man with the
          distinctive scar below his eye...

                        been called to a scene.

                        She made me talk about nothing
                        while she could get it under
                          control.  Her kids were right

                        Terry's crew wasn't trained for
                        this.  It was my call to go in...
                        and now I'm making another one. 
                        We wait.

                        Kate Tyner is in the Four Cross
                        Cut North section.  It's filling
                        up with water.  She's not going
                        to last three hours... or even
                        two.

          Walt glances over at Maggie at the warming tent.  She's
          watching them both with wide, hopeful eyes.

                        There's still time.

          Walt sees the map clutched in Johnny's hands.

                                        WALT
                        Is that a map of the mine?

                        I think it shows a way around the
                          collapsed area.

                                        WALT
                        Let me see.

          Johnny hands Walt the map.  As they touch... RAMP TO
          JOHNNY'S FACE AS...



          as he reacts...



          Johnny snaps out of his vision.  Sarah sees his face and
          already knows it's bad.

                                        SARAH

                        We were buried in a cave-in.

                                        WALT
                        You sure you're not seeing some
                        cave-in from the past...?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (certain)
                        This one's the future.  Our future.

                        Then you can't go back in there.

          A beat.  Johnny knows how dangerous it is going to be...
          but this is now a matter of lives in the balance: theirs,
          the girl's.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The chamber I saw has an abandoned
                        ore cart, number 47...if we see
                        that cart in time, we have a chance
                        to avoid the cave-in...
                                (beat)
                        But if we don't go, Kate dies for
                        sure.

          There's a silent moment between the three of them.  Sarah
          looks at Johnny and Walt both.  She knows what they're
          going to do.  It's the kind of men they are.

          Walt makes his decision; the one a man like him always
          has to make.

          A tear runs down Sarah's cheek.  She hugs Walt tightly. 
          He holds her.  Johnny stands there a beat.  Then walks
          away alone back up the hill toward the mine.



          Johnny emerges from the mine with the kids... they're
          carrying a plank to which an unconscious Walt is tied
          with makeshift strips of clothing...

                                        ROSCOE
                        It's them.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (exhausted)
                        We need help here! 

          The rescue workers rush forward...


  76A76ASARAH

          several yards away, starts to smile, then sees Walt...
          and now panic begins to rise...

                                        SARAH
                        No...

          She drops her coffee and begins to run toward the mine...


          WITH JOHNNY

          as she runs toward them...  rescue workers are wrapping
          the kids in blankets... moving them toward the 
            ambulances... flurry of activity...

                        Walt?

          But he's not moving, barely breathing... medics tend to
          him immediately... she's in their way...

                                        SARAH
                          Please... I need to... Walt...

                                        EMT
                        Would somebody look after her?

          And as Johnny pulls her gently away...


7777A JOHNNY FLASH - HE'S NOW HOLDING SARAH'S ARM 

          for support in a matching cut at Walt's funeral... looking
          into his casket... 


  7878RESUME JOHNNY AND SARAH

                                        EMT
                                (to his men)
                        Get me a backboard, a neckbrace
                        and monitoring equipment. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        The cave in.   He saw it first. 
                        Pushed us out of the way.  He
                          couldn't get out in time.

          Sarah collapses in tears in Johnny's arms.  And then pushes
          him away in anger as though she knows it's wrong to be in
          his arms.


          DANA

          sees this... and so does...


          PURDY

          but he turns his attention to the happier reunion of the
          kids and their parents by the ambulances...


  7979WITH WALT

          medics still working on him (on the plank that's now on
          the ground)... photographers moving in...

                                        EMT
                        People, I need you to clear this
                        area, please!

          Johnny follows the orders, moves a few yards out of the
          way... watching them work furiously on Walt... Sarah
          refuses to leave Walt's side... watches with unbelieving
          eyes...

          As we watches this, Johnny's eyes are caught by


  8080MAGGIE TYNER

          holding Kate tight... she looks over the girl's shoulder
          with tears in her eyes.  And there's someone else in
          Johnny's view too... a very OLD MAN in his seventies... 
          standing alone a few yards away... watching the tragic
          events unfold at the mine entrance...


  8181JOHNNY

          reacts as he begins to recognize something about this
          guy...


  8282CLOSE ON THE OLD MAN'S FACE

          He has a distinctive scar under his eye...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Stengel?

          The old man turns to see Johnny next to him...

                                        STENGEL
                        How do you know my name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        My name is John Smith.  You used
                        to work for my grandfather.
                                (eyes narrow)
                          I wonder if you could help me
                        find some of the families of the
                        men who worked here.

          Stengel looks at him curiously and in time they will talk
          more, but for us, all we need to understand is that Johnny
          is going to reach out to these victims of his family's
          past, that he cares in a way his grandfather never did... 
          there's a wide gap to be bridged between an old miner and
          the Smith Family and it cannot all happen in this moment. 
          But we sense this is the first step in a long process.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DESCENT - ACT FOUR - 10/11/02 PINK         50.

          For now, there's too much going on, primarily --

                                        EMT
                        Let's go, blood pressure's
                          dropping, he's crashing.

          In the background Purdy addresses reporters...

                                        PURDY
                        We intend to permanently seal
                        this mine after our work here is
                        done.  This will never happen
                        again.

          He stops as he sees the ambulance backing up to the
          backboard.  The EMT is bagging him with an oxygen bag as
          they move him to the vehicle.

                                        EMT
                        Get him inside.

          The Paramedics load Walt in the ambulance.  Sarah running
            alongside the backboard...

                                        SARAH
                        I want to come with him.

                                        EMT
                        I'm sorry.  We need the room to
                        work.

                                        SARAH
                        But I'm his wife.

                                        EMT
                        Ma'am, we'll meet you at the
                          hospital...

          The paramedics close the door and the ambulance ROARS
          off.


          CLOSE ON SARAH

          She's helpless to do anything but watch the ambulance
            disappear in the distance.


          CLOSE ON JOHNNY

          He's helpless to do anything but watch Sarah as her heart
          breaks.  And on this, we...
