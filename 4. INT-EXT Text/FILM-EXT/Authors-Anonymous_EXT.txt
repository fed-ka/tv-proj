North Hayworth Avenue, off Sunset Boulevard. A quiet, tree-
lined residential street. Note the small apartment complex
set back from the curb.

Our narrator is HENRY OBERT (O-BURT)(30).
HENRY (V.O.)
This is where where F. Scott
Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940.
INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.
His work.
His life.
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Fitzgerald was one of the truly great
American writers of the 20th century.
Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon.
This Side of Paradise. And, of course,
my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But
Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing
movies that never got made. Drinking
too much. Alienating people. Losing
his way.

FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAY
Henry stands on the sidewalk. Full of promise and hope.
Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment,
more with reverence than curiosity.
CAPTION: HENRY OBERT
HENRY (V.O.)
I stop by here sometimes--out of
respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing
gift.
3
Henry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda.
He
unlocks the car. Swings open the back door.
HENRY (V.O.)
But he wasted it. He wasted his
talent.
Henry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps
it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ. One
last glance at the fabled apartment complex.
2.
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
When I sell my novel, I won't make
his mistakes.

As Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with
pizza in hand at the front door of a house. Rings doorbell.
HENRY (V.O.)
I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas
and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for
a writer.

22
Colette opens the sliding glass door and steps out into a
beautiful garden area. Quiet and private. Camera follows
her over to a solitary BENCH.
13.
COLETTE
This is where I come for inspiration.
I believe a writer must have quiet
and solitude. I'll meditate. Write
in my journal. Set out my creative
path for the day. This is my Walden
Pond.
Colette sits down on the bench. Takes in the environment.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
Favorite author? I'd have to say
Joan Didion. Her writing sends
shivers down my spine. Though Joyce
Carol Oates has been known to bring
me to actual orgasm.
23
23
Colette sits on her bench, reading a BOOK. C.U. reveals
that it is a novel by Joyce Carol Oates. Colette appears to
be getting into the story just a bit too much.
24
COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY
24
POOL GUY and GARDENER hear Colette's sensual cries drifting
over the hedge. What the hell? They exchange puzzled looks.
25
25
Back to the present. Camera picks up a FRAMED PHOTO OF OPRAH
from a corner of the bench. Holds it up for camera.
COLETTE
Oh, this? I keep Oprah out here for
luck. She's done so much to help
writers. I know I'm going to be on
her television show one day. I just
know it.
Colette can already see the moment in her mind. Short beat.
Then she looks off-camera--listening to someone.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
What? Oprah doesn't have a TV show
anymore? Really? Since when?
Short beat as she hears the answer.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
Oh...
Short beat as she tries to cover.
14.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
I knew that. I did. I-I knew.

32
The front door to the restaurant swings open and the writing
group members tumble out into the evening. Alan carries his
WRITERS AT WORK sign.
William makes a move towards Hannah, but the the ever-
protective Henry grabs her gently by her elbow, cutting
William off. They start walking in one direction. William
and John head out in the other. Meanwhile, Alan and Colette
wave enthusiastically to Hannah.
ALAN
Congratulations again, Hannah!
COLETTE
Yes, yes.
Way to go, Hannah!
20.
HANNAH
(Calling back)
Thank you! 'Night.
Alan and Colette continue to smile and wave until Hannah is
out of ear shot.
ALAN
Well, Hannah's got an agent.
Short beat.
COLETTE
She must have slept with him.
ALAN
Of course she did.
33
33
Henry and Hannah arrive at her car. She unlocks the front
door of her clunker-of-a-Ford as Henry waits.
HENRY
I'm so proud of you, Hannah.
HANNAH
Your turn will come, Henry. You're a
better writer than I am. So much
better. You went to college.
Hannah looks directly into the camera, pointing to Henry.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
He's a great writer. Henry Obert. I
knew him when.
Henry, clearly embarrassed, puts his hand up to block the
camera. Tries to change the subject.
HENRY
Listen. Maybe some afternoon we
could go for a drive. There are
some special places I'd like to show
you.
HANNAH
Sure. I can't believe I've lived out
here four years and haven't seen --
She stops in mid-sentence.
A light goes on in her head.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
Oh, my.
21.
HENRY
What?
HANNAH
Four years. It's been four years
since I moved here. And now I have
an agent. It's the number four again.
My lucky number. I should have known
this was going to happen.
HENRY
There is no one more deserving.
Hannah rewards Henry's praise with a peck on the lips.
And
a warm hug.
Hannah steps in her car, starts it up and rolls down the
window.
HANNAH
I'm going to dedicate my novel to
you.
A final wave and Henry watches as she disappears into the
night. He sighs.
34
41
John grins for the camera. The reason why sits next to him
in the matching LAWN CHAIRS.
The WOMAN is clearly younger than John. Plainly dressed in a
faded sweat shirt. Little makeup. Nervous in front of the
camera, but she looks more at us than she does at John. He
can't keep his eyes off her.
CAPTION: SIGRID HAGENGUTH
JOHN
Meet someone very s-p-e-c-i-e-l.
Here with us today all the way from...
Coaxing Sigrid to finish the thought.
SIGRID
Germany.
JOHN
Oh! That accent! Found her
working
at the hardware store. Went
in for a
drill bit. Came out with a
prime
candidate for Mrs. John K.
Butzin.

COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY
44
Colette sits. Focused on the WHITE ENVELOPE in one hand.
Alan sits next to her, squeezing her other hand. Photo of
Oprah on the other side.
COLETTE
I know this is a rejection letter.
I can't open this. I can't be
rejected today. I take rejection so
personally.
ALAN
I bet it's good news.
She opens the envelope. Peeks inside. No letter. Just the
SMALLEST POST-IT NOTE flutters out on to the ground. Colette
picks it up.
COLETTE
"Sorry. Not interested." I knew it.
How can such a big rejection come
from such a small piece of paper?
31.
Colette folds the Post-It Note in half--and then in quarters.
Holding it in her hand, she begins to chant. Alan holds on
to her hand and pats her on the back. Good husband.
45
49
Colette is back on her bench. Standing behind her is a
mysterious MAN (Over 40) who favors black clothes and dark
shades.
CAPTION: DR. XIROMAN
COLETTE
I want you to meet someone special.
This is my spiritual adviser. Doctor
Xiroman has taken a vow of silence
for one full year to protest climate
change. What an amazing man. Dr.
Xiroman is going to cleanse the air
of all this rejection.
Camera goes to Dr. Xiroman. Somber, expressionless. Does he
even have a pulse?
Dr. Xiroman walks over to small fire pit and meditates as he
places his hands over the rising flames. Colette begins a
New Age chant for added support.
50
56
DAVID takes Colette's pages and tosses them in city TRASH
CAN, muttering to himself as he walks away.
COLETTE (V.O.)
(Overlapping Alan)
I did it.
ALAN (V.O.)
(Overlapping Colette)
We did it.
57
58
The imposing house screams success.
Henry and Hannah sit in
Henry's parked car, taking it in.
HANNAH
Who lives here?
HENRY
Richard Benedict.
HANNAH
Oh.
That writer you like?
HENRY
Like? No. It's much more than that.
Wow. He...He...
Henry struggles to put it into words.
HENRY (CONT'D)
...Reading Richard Benedict...made
me want to be a better writer. He's
that good, Hannah.
HANNAH
Can't say I've read his stuff.
Nice
house, though.
59
59
Henry and Hannah stand on the sidewalk in front of the North
Hayworth home. Henry seems barely able to contain his
excitement.
46.
HENRY
Here we are.
Hannah stares blankly at the house.
HENRY (CONT'D)
North Hayworth Avenue. Hollywood,
California.
Hannah smiles politely, but it's clear she doesn't recognize
the house.
HENRY (CONT'D)
Big clue time. Sheila Graham.
Still nothing registers with Hannah.
HENRY (CONT'D)
OK. Give up? Writer Sheila Graham
lived here. Fitzgerald was her lover.
This is where he died on December
21, 1940.
Hannah lets it all sink in.
HANNAH
Fitzgerald? He's the one who shot
himself, right?
HENRY
No. Fitzgerald. F. Scott Fitzgerald.
He wrote The Great Gatsby.
The name doesn't register with Hannah.
HENRY (CONT'D)
(Reciting from heart)
Gatsby believed in the green light,
the orgiastic future that year by
year recedes before us. It eluded us
then, but that's--
HANNAH
(Interjecting)
I've never read it.
Henry can't hide his surprise.
HENRY
What?
Hannah stops, cognizant of the ever-present camera.
47.
HANNAH
(To camera)
Could you turn that off for a few
minutes, please?
HENRY
You know they can't. What's wrong?
Hannah hesitates.
Counts to three. Lowers her voice.
HANNAH
I've never read The Great Gatsby.
HENRY
You're kidding.
HANNAH
Henry. I never went to college.
I've heard of Hemingway. A little.
Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't
have your education. Your smarts. I
haven't read all these great novels.
My stories come from my heart.
Henry lets it all sink in.
Hannah looks at the house.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
Tell me about the book.
HENRY
Gatsby is about social position and
the American Dream and . . .
Henry stops. Rethinks his explanation.
HENRY (CONT'D)
Actually, it's quite simple. Boy
meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy
moves heaven and earth to win the
girl back.
HANNAH
And it's your favorite?
Henry nods with his heart.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
So how does it end? Does boy get the
girl?
Long beat. Then Henry reaches into the back seat of his car
for his KNAPSACK. Puts it on his lap, unzips it. Pulls out
his personal copy of Gatsby.
48.
HENRY
Here. Take my copy.
He hands the well-read book to Hannah.
HENRY (CONT'D)
Now you can find out for yourself.
60
62
Parked on the street in front of Hannah's apartment. Henry
and Hannah, this mutual admiration society, stand by the
car. Hannah still has her copy of Gatsby. Short beat.
HANNAH
What a dear, sweet friend you are.
Hannah graces Henry with another hug. Another quick peck on
the lips. But wait--Henry wants more. He kisses her back.
More than a peck. Too much more. Hannah, surprised, pulls
back--her hand on his chest: Stop.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
(Gently)
No distractions. The writing comes
first, 'kay?
Henry nods reluctantly: Understood. One last hug from Hannah
before she heads for her front door, smiling back over her
shoulder at Henry. Henry watches her leave, knowing that
this was absolutely, positively, the best day of his life.
63
67
WRITERS AT WORK poster taped to the front door.

70
Alan arrives home. Steps out of his Lexus. Whistling. Happy-
go-lucky. Pauses in the driveway to record another idea.
ALAN
Idea for novel. Perhaps screenplay.
The Amazing Doctor Eckleburg. An eye
doctor turned crime fighter. Ladies
man.
71
72
Alan steps outside. Somber. Focused. Acts like the
Terminator in his scanning of the area. Man on a mission.
What is he looking for? He finds it almost immediately,
zeroing in on Colette's bench. Alan marches over and grabs
Colette's prized framed photo of Oprah. Clutching it in his
hand, Alan looks at Oprah's smiling face, then back towards
the house. Then he takes the frame and smashes it down on
the ground as hard as he can. Next he jumps up and down on
the smashed frame multiple times. Not satisfied, Alan bends
down, picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands.
There. That felt good.
Pool Guy and Gardener have witnessed the whole scene.
What
the hell? They exchange puzzled looks.
73
76
Colette sits on her private bench. Note the NEW PHOTO OF
OPRAH in a new frame. Colette talks to the camera.
COLETTE
Yes. You noticed. I replaced the
photo. I may be replacing other
things around here soon...I was just
using William...for research.
She holds up THREE MORE LETTERS.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
Speaking of rejection...three more
letters saying Nyet, including one
from David Keller. I should have
offered him a massage. How much
more rejection can I take?
Colette stares at the letters, focusing on remaining strong.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
(Reciting)
"We keep going back, stronger, not
weaker, because we will not allow--
Her voice cracks.
She stops.
Fighting for composure
COLETTE (CONT'D)
--Rejection to beat us down--
Colette's frustration is boiling into anger as she struggles
to keep it under control.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
--It will only strengthen our resolve.
To be successful there is no other
way." Mr. Henry D. Thoreau.
Short beat.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
Rejection sucks.
77
77
Smoke rises from the fire pit, burning what's left of the
letters. Colette sits cross-legged, devoting her full energy
to chanting and beating her hands on a small DRUM.
It isn't enough today. Watch as Colette's solemn chant
dissolves into tears of frustration.
60.
Dr. Xiroman places a comforting hand on her shoulder, trying
to calm Colette down.
78
78
Sitting outside in the cheap lawn chairs with Sigrid, John
addresses the camera. He cleans up pretty good.
JOHN
This is going to be a great day for
John K. Butzin. Yes, sir. First
official book signing.
Sigrid holds up a copy of Roaring Lion. The dog on the cover
has had an image of a lion slapped over it. Sigrid beams
with pride.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Ready and raring to go. Of course,
it would have been better to do this
in an actual bookstore, but, hell,
they're dropping faster than Charlie
at Dak To. Not to worry. Since Sigrid
works at the hardware store, they're
going to let her favorite author
sign a few books there.
SIGRID
More than a few books. Many, many
books, Ja?
JOHN
Ja, my Strudel. Many books.
79
79
SIGNS in front window announcing hammers, ladders, paint on
sale. Also a handwritten PIECE OF PAPER taped to the window
with masking tape, announcing AUTHOR SIGNING.
80
89
Outside bookstore. After the signing. Alan and Colette walk
ahead. Henry and Hannah follow. Colette, Henry and Hannah
each carry book bags.
HENRY
So what did he say?
HANNAH
Who?
HENRY
Who!?!? Richard Benedict. You know,
the guy who just held up the line
for five minutes talking to you?
ALAN
(Over his shoulder)
Ten. It was closer to ten minutes.
HANNAH
I don't know. We just talked.
HENRY
He sure liked you.
HANNAH
We just talked, Henry. I mentioned
my book. He started asking about it.
Writer to writer. No big deal.
HENRY
No big deal? Talking to Richard
Benedict. No big deal!
Colette keeps walking. Biting her lip. Very quiet.
ALAN
You gave him your phone number.
HANNAH
Look, a guy like that reads more
books in a week than I ever have.
Why would he bother call--
Just then, Hannah's iPhone goes off. She answers. The other
three stop in their tracks.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
(On telephone)
Hello? Who? Richard? Oh. Richard.
Hi.
71.
COLETTE
Unbelievable.
Henry inches closer to Hannah, forcing Hannah to move back,
creating an uneasy dance between the two. She turns her
back on Henry.
HANNAH
(On telephone)
Coffee? Oh, God. I don't know,
Richard. I really appreciate the
invitation, but--
She listens. Her face is anguished. Finally --
HANNAH (CONT'D)
This isn't a good time. Call me later.
Yes. I'll think about it. Yes. Bye.
Hannah turns off her phone. Alan, Colette, Henry stand there,
gaping jaws wide open.
ALAN
Amazing.
COLETTE
This isn't fair. This just isn't
fair.
HANNAH
What?
COLETTE
First, you get an agent. Then you
sell your book. Then the big movie
deal.
ALAN
Please don't.
COLETTE
No. This isn't fair. And now Richard
Benedict wants to have coffee with
you? All this is happening to you.
And only you. Isn't there anything --
I don't know--some kind of cosmic
creative crumb for the rest of us to
nibble on?
HANNAH
I don't like what you're suggesting,
Colette. You know how hard I work.
How devoted I am. And I have been
totally supportive of your writing.
I've encouraged you all along.
72.
COLETTE
You wouldn't introduce me to your
agent.
HANNAH
Brian didn't want to meet you. I
asked.
ALAN
Hannah has earned her success.
COLETTE
Butt out Mr. Idea Man.
ALAN
Hannah is a writer. She devotes
herself one hundred percent to
writing. Not one hundred percent to
sleeping with writers.
Henry steps in.
Finally.
HENRY
Why don't you two just go on ahead?
COLETTE
It's not fair that she be the only
one.
HENRY
Go.
ALAN
C'mon.
Let's go.
Colette marches off in a huff; Alan in pursuit. She looks
over her shoulder, shouting back at Hannah.
COLETTE
13! 13!
13!
13!
90
90
Henry and Hannah sit on opposite ends of the bench. Hannah
looks distraught, lost in thought, simmering.
Henry knows to keep his distance. Waits.
91
91
Colette looks frazzled. Pondering. Plotting. She finally
notices the camera.
73.
COLETTE
I know. I'm a shit for exploding at
Hannah, aren't I?
Runs her hands through her hair.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
Poor, sweet, superstitious, everybody-
loves-Hannah.
Starts massaging forehead--trying to reduce stress.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
If she can succeed, so can I. "We
were born to succeed, not to fail."
Hears a question O.S.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
Who said that? I don't know.
Somebody famous. Somebody with an
agent.
Now come the deep breaths.
More stress control.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
I can't accomplish anything without
an agent. They won't come to me.
Fine. I'll go to them. I'll make it
happen.
92
92
Hannah and Henry remain on the bench.
Hannah takes a breath
and finally breaks her silence.
HANNAH
Your writer's block?
HENRY
Yeah.
HANNAH
It's because your focus is always on
everything else. Gatsby. Fitzgerald.
Me.
Whoa. Henry isn't about to argue.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
Listen to me, Henry Obert. Your
writing must come first. Take this
passion you have. Put it on the page.
Forget everything else. All you're
doing is wasting...
74.
Hannah continues the lecture, speaking from the heart.
HENRY (V.O.)
She's right. But I know what's really
happening here. Hannah's telling me
she has every intention of talking
to Richard Benedict. She has every
intention of seeing him.
93
99
Henry delivers another pizza. Pockets the money as he walks
back to his car, whistling. Checks his delivery list. Stares
at the next address in sudden disbelief.
HENRY
Shit!
100
100
Henry stands in the doorway, glumly clutching the PIZZA BOX.
Hesitates. Finally rings doorbell. Pause. Followed by LOUD
LAUGHTER. Door swings open. Richard stands there, wearing
only his jeans. His hair is a mess.
RICHARD
You're late, Pizza Boy.
Richard finally notices the camera.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
What the --
HENRY
(Overlapping)
They're with me. Your total comes to
nineteen dollars and sixty-five cents.
Richard pulls a crumpled twenty from his jean pocket. He
hands it to Henry. Then reconsiders, calling inside.
RICHARD
Babe, I need a single.
No response.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
C'mon, babe. Got a dollar for Pizza
Boy?
WOMAN'S VOICE
Coming!
Richard gives a last glance to the camera. He's got better
things to do. Off he goes.
Short beat. Hannah comes to the door wearing Richard's shirt
and little else, carrying a single dollar bill.
HANNAH
Here you--
Her words freeze up as she recognizes Henry. Henry and Hannah
lock eyes for a long beat. Poor kid. This is the moment.
80.
Reality smacks him in the face. Hard.
Hannah starts to hand Henry the money. He puts his hands up:
No thanks. Hannah doesn't press. Henry can't hold back any
longer.
HENRY
No distractions. The writing comes
first.
HANNAH
He's making me a better writer.
HENRY
Yeah.
I bet he is.
Quietly seething, Henry nods towards the camera.
HENRY (CONT'D)
How much better are you, Hannah?
Show us. Who wrote Slaughterhouse
Five? D'ya know?
HANNAH
Henry.
Don't.
HENRY
No, No. This could be quite
educational. How about Native Son?
Catch-22?
HANNAH
Why isn't it enough that I'm your
friend?
HENRY
Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's
Complaint? Do you know any author?
Harry Potter--You must know Harry
Potter.
HANNAH
Why isn't it enough that I believe
in your writing?
HENRY
--Sophie's Choice? Anything published
in the English language.
HANNAH
--That I believe in you?
HENRY
You didn't read Gatsby, did you?
Never even opened it, I bet.
81.
Enough.
HANNAH
I'm not--
She hesitates.
Not for long.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
I'm not the one delivering pizzas
for a living.
Score one for Hannah.
HANNAH (CONT'D)
I'm not the one wasting my talent.
You've read all those books, sure,
but my book is being published. Is
yours?
Henry has no comeback. Hannah stares him down. The dollar
bill drops from her hand on to the ground. She retreats
back inside the house, firmly closing the front door, leaving
Henry alone.
Only then do we notice the number of the house: 4441.
101
103
Back to the two lawn chairs--with one prime difference.
Sigrid's chair is empty. John sits by himself. This is a
softer, more reflective, John talking to the camera.
JOHN
Well, Strudel shipped out.
A side glance to the empty chair.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Oh, she wanted to stay, but... I
didn't have time for a relationship.
Not with my book selling like it is.
She, well, she became collateral
damage. Hated to end it. What a
dame. I mean...Sigrid. She had the
smarts of my first wife. The body
of my second wife. Thank god she
wasn't anything like my third wife.
I did the right thing. Yes, sir.
Good acting, John. He looks back to the empty chair. Can't
avoid reaching over and giving the arm rest a little love
tap.
104
108
Outside the bookstore, Henry stands on the sidewalk, talking
to the camera as he clutches Hannah's book.
HENRY
Well, I did it. I showed up to
Hannah's signing. I congratulated
her. I supported her, writer to
writer. And I finally got introduced
to Richard Benedict--formally. Sort
of.
Henry opens up his copy of Hannah's novel. He turns quiet,
obviously moved. He holds the book up for the camera to
see.
HENRY (CONT'D)
Look. Hannah dedicated her novel to
me. Just like she promised.
Right beneath the printed dedication For Henry Obert, Hannah
has written, For Henry, My Forever Friend xoxoxo Hannah.
Henry studies the book for a second. Snaps it shut.

John opens the front door.
CHILDREN
Trick or Treat!
John responds by dropping a BOOK in the first bag.
JOHN
Look at this treat you get. A copy

Happy Halloween.
The children are dumbfounded. John moves on to the next child.

Colette engages in intense meditation on her bench. The garden
around her is now dead.
COLETTE (V.O.)
Dr. Xiroman and I wrote our book. It
actually did fairly well.
INSERT BOOK. Title in large letters: Getting from Xiro to
One by Dr. Xiroman in equally large letters. At the bottom
of the book, in very tiny letters, reads With Colette Mooney.
COLETTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Dr. Phil turned us down. But we had
a lovely time on Anderson.
INSERT PHOTO of smiling Anderson Cooper.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
Anderson actually wanted us back,
but Dr. Xiroman and Lois Piper started
dating. They eloped to Vegas last
month. Off on a world cruise.
INSERT PHOTO of Dr. Xiroman and Lois being married in Vegas

COLETTE (CONT'D)
So in less than a year, I've lost my
husband, my co-author, and my agent.
But I still have Nyet, Not Yet. And
I will find an agent to sell my novel.
Look. I bought an ad in the trades.
Colette reaches for her reading glasses and shares the ad
copy with us, reading aloud:
COLETTE (CONT'D)
"The magic fingers that just typed
the publishing world's next best
selling novel are now waiting to
provide free massage to interested
literary agents. Experienced.
Sensitive. Discreet. Memorable. No
Junior Agents, please."
Looking quite pleased with herself, Colette lets the copy
fall away.
COLETTE (CONT'D)
It's how I met my last husband. I
think it can work again. No worries.
After all, I am a graduate of --
Her iPhone starts playing music, signaling a phone call.
Colette smiles in knowing satisfaction--publication is just
a touch away

The MOVIE CREW, on location, scurries about, trying to line
up their next shot.
HANNAH (V.O.)
Welcome to Sleeping on the Moon: The
Movie! It's so exciting!
120

Hannah, looking good, sits in a chair, a BOOK on her lap.
She is talking to the camera. CREW in the background.
HANNAH
Let's see. My book ended up on the
best sellers list. Stopping at Number
