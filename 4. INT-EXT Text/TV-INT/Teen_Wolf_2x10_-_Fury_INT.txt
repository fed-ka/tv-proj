      Slipping inside his father s car, Matt keeps an eye on the 
      Whittemore home while pulling out a Samsung Note phone. With 
      a few taps on the oversized screen a command appears--

      CONNECT TO CAMERA.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/122.

        CONTINUED:22

      A window pops up on the screen with the words: CONNECTED and 
      is quickly replaced with the exact image being recorded on 
      the camera inside Jackson s room.

      The streaming video on Matt s phone shows Jackson in his 
      boxers positioning the camera toward his bed.

                                  MATT
                      Sonofabitch. I knew you were lying.

      Still alone, Jackson eases onto the bed. Curious, Matt waits 
      for something to happen. But it appears Jackson is simply 
      recording himself falling asleep.

      As the time code on the screen races forward, as Jackson 
      turns over and drifts off to sleep, Matt s own eyelids close.

      With a blink, he snaps awake.

      ON THE SCREEN - Jackson sits up in bed. With a robotic 
      stiffness, he turns to face the camera, eyes beginning to 
      GLOW.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    What the hell...

      Lurching off the bed, Jackson s head whips back, mouth 
      falling open to reveal a set of double-rowed teeth. His hands 
      hit the floor, body twisting, limbs wrenching. 

      Matt sits up, gripping the phone while his gaze remains fixed 
      on the screen. But Jackson disappears from view. Breath held, 
      Matt brings the phone closer, searching the frame when-- 

      A SNARLING JACKSON whips in front of the screen, half 
        transformed. Launching up, he charges right past it.

      SOMETHING HITS THE PAVEMENT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.

      Matt turns to the driver s side window just quick enough to 
      see a SHADOW hurtle past. Hand darting to the door console, 
      he locks himself in.


      A pair of GLOWING EYES approach. Mesmerized, Matt s breathing 
      slows to normal, as if he s no longer afraid.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/123.

        CONTINUED:44

      He eases toward the driver s side, approaching the window as 
      the Kanima comes nearer. Almost by instinct, Matt slowly 
      raises his hand, fingers splayed.

      The Kanima reaches up as well, claws landing on the window 
      just as Matt s fingers connect with the glass.

      LAHEY S FACE flashes before Matt. Dripping wet, he SHOUTS 
      something urgently, furiously, but there s no sound.

      Matt blinks and another silent vision hits him.


      Matt tears his hand from the window. Breathless, he looks 
      about to find he s alone, the creature gone. 

      Resting back in the driver s seat, Matt begins to smile. A 
      smile like that of a child who s found a new toy.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A CLASS PHOTO of Matt comes into focus within the pages of a 
      yearbook. Gathered around the desk where the book lies, 
      Stiles and Scott wait for Stilinski s reaction.

                    Dad, everyone knows the police look 
                    for ways to connect victims in a 
                    murder. All he had to do was go 
                    through their transcripts and find 
                    out which class they all attended.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Except for the rave promoter, Kara. 
                    She wasn t in Harris s class.

                                  STILES
                    Oh yeah, that s right. So I guess 
                    they re dropping the charges 
                    against him?

      Father and son glare at each other. Stilinski gives in.

                                  STILINSKI
                    No, they re not dropping the 
                    charges. Which doesn t prove 
                    anything. Scott, you believe this?

                    It s not easy to explain how we 
                    know, but if you can just trust us. 
                    We know it s Matt.

                                  STILES
                    He took Harris s car. He knew if 
                    the cops found tire tracks at one 
                    of the murders and that if enough 
                    of the victims were in Harris s 
                    class, he d be arrested.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Fine. I ll allow the remote 
                      possibility. But give me a motive. 
                    Why would this kid want most of the 
                    2006 swim team and its coach dead?

                                  STILES
                    Isn t it obvious? Our swim team 
                    sucks! They haven t won in years.

                    Harris?

      Scott and Stiles watch Stilinski wrestle with the question, 
      eyes fixed on the picture of Matt in front of him.

                                  STILINSKI
                    What do you want me to do?

                    That s all back at the station.

      The Night Officer raises a wary eye when the door clicks 
      open. With Stiles and Scott behind him, Stilinski approaches 
      the desk.

                    Since Matt had to kill her himself, 
                    someone at the hospital could have

      Stilinski waves them over as the Night Officer buzzes the 
      door open.


      With Stiles and Scott peering over his shoulder, Stilinski 
      clicks through SECURITY FOOTAGE on his screen.

      Stilinski moves the footage back and then pauses on the image 
      of a YOUNG MAN walking down the corridor.

      Stepping into the lobby, Stiles discovers the front desk 
      deserted, Night Officer gone. He glances about, but the

      get behind it where--

      The Night Officer lies on the floor dead, BLOODY SLASHES 
      ripped across the front of her uniform. Stiles s eyes move to 
      the empty holster at her side, seeing her GUN is missing. But 
      a moment later, he finds it--

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      A HIGH PITCHED SOUND drifts in through a bright, almost 
      blinding white haze. Derek looks about with glazed eyes, 
      everything around him glowing a pristine white.

                                  DEATON (V.O.)
                    Derek... Derek, can you hear me?

      He doesn t respond, barely lucid under the ethereal glow. The 
      HIGH PITCHED SOUND hits again.

      Derek blinks, head snapping to the side as if he d been 
      slapped. The SOUND becomes louder and louder. A single ear-
      splitting NOTE, sending his hands to his ears as--


      Derek jolts awake with a sharp breath. He blinks up at Dr. 
      Deaton in front of him. 

                                  DEATON
                    Can you hear me? I need you to 
                    answer, Derek. We don t have much 
                    time. Derek.

                                  DEREK
                          (barely able to speak)
                    That sound. What was...

      With a sly smile, Deaton holds up a common DOG WHISTLE. 

      Annoyed, Derek attempts to stand. But he wobbles, nearly 
      toppling back to the floor as Deaton grabs him.

                                  DEATON
                    You re going to be weak for several 
                    hours. You have aconite poisoning 
                    and you also had a good bit of the 
                    power drawn out of you.

      Clutching to Deaton s arm, Derek s gaze moves to the broken 
      FLOORBOARDS and the hole in the floor of the house.

                                  DEREK
                    It actually happened.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1211.

                                  DEATON
                    Don t worry. You re still an Alpha. 
                    But, as usual, not a particularly 
                    competent one.

      Derek shrugs free of his grip.

                                  DEREK
                    Where is he?

                                  DEATON
                    I wish I could tell you.

                                  DEREK
                    Then how about you tell me what 
                    you re doing here and why you re 
                    helping me?

                                  DEATON
                    Helping your family actually used 
                    to be a pretty important part of my 
                    life. Helping you was a promise I 
                    made to your mother.

      Derek looks back at him with surprise. Dropping the arrogant 
      veneer, he reaches for the wall to steady himself.

                                  DEREK
                    You re the one my sister talked 
                    about.

                                  DEATON
                    So you do know a little bit.

                                  DEREK
                    She said you re a kind of advisor.

                                  DEATON
                    She was right. And I have some 
                    advice you need to listen to very 
                    closely right now.

      Deaton crosses to the broken floorboards to peer into the 
      underground grave.

                    What Peter managed to do doesn t 
                    come without a price. He ll be

                    I don t trust anyone.

                                  DEATON
                    I know. If you did, you might be 
                    the Alpha you like to think you 
                    are. And, unfortunately, the one

                    He s with Stilinski right now. You 
                    need to find him. Find him as fast 
                    as you can. I ve known Gerard for a 
                    long time. He always has a plan. 
                    And something tells me...

      Deaton looks Derek in the eyes to be perfectly clear.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    It s going exactly the way he wants 
                    it to.


      Scott pockets his phone and turns to Stilinski.

                    She s on her way here. Sheriff?

      Noticing Stilinski isn t paying attention, Scott follows his 
      stare to the open door where Matt presses the Night Officer s 
      gun into Stiles s back.

      A surreal moment of quiet occurs. Until Stilinski breaks it 
      by speaking as calmly as he can.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Matt, whatever s going on, I 
                    guarantee there s a solution that 
                    doesn t involve a gun.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1213.

                    Funny you say that. Because I don t 
                    think you re aware of just how 
                    right you are.

      Scott s hand eases inside his coat pocket.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I know you don t want to hurt 
                    people.

                                  MATT
                    Actually, I want to hurt a lot of 
                    people. You three weren t on my 
                    list but I could be persuaded. One 
                    way is to try calling someone with 
                    your phone in your pocket like 
                    McCall s doing. That could 
                      definitely get someone hurt.

      Matt stares at Scott until he pulls his phone out and sets it 
      down on the desk.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Everyone.

      Stilinski and Stiles take out their cell phones as well.


      A HANDCUFF LOCKS around Stilinski s wrist, one of the cuff s 
      attached to the wall outside the holding cells.

                                  MATT
                    Tighter.

      Stiles glares at Matt who keeps the gun pointed at him while 
      Scott looks on.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Do what he says.

      Stiles reluctantly tightens the handcuff. 

      Matt motions for them to move toward the corridor. But as 
      Stiles steps back, he can t seem to turn from his father s 
      fearful eyes. Until Matt shoves him forward.


      Scott and Stiles walk back to the front of the station, Matt *

      Scott glances down the adjacent hall in time to see a 
      PARALYZED DEPUTY dragged back into a room by a human but 
      clawed hand. Matt jams the gun into Scott s back, pushing him 
      onward.

                                  SCOTT
                    You going to kill everyone in here?

                    I have to do is think about killing *
                    them. He does the rest.*


      The door to Allison s room eases open. Gerard gives a soft 
      knock. When no response comes, he enters to find Allison 
      lying in bed on her side. She stares out blankly, looking 
      utterly lost.

                                  GERARD
                      I understand. I m not sure there s 
                    anything I can say. I won t pretend

                    Of course. I just wanted to give 
                    you something from your mother. 
                    Partly because I couldn t help

      Gerard gives a reluctant nod.

                                  GERARD
                    As you know, your mother wrote a 
                    suicide note to explain away our 
                    difficult situation to the police.

      A PAPER SHREDDER ROARS under a heavy workload. With the gun 
      leveled on them, Matt watches Scott and Stiles destroy all of

      Stiles taps out a command on the computer and looks up when

                    the people you brutally murdered 
                    deserved it because they killed you

      The roar of a CAR ENGINE interrupts them. Matt holds still, 
      listening to the sound of a car pulling up to the curb.

      Pressing the gun to Stiles s back, Matt glares at Scott.*

                                  MATT
                    Open the door.

      Scott puts his hand on the knob and turns it. The door slowly *
      clicks open allowing the boys to peer out to the front desk. 
      It s not Melissa standing in the lobby, however-- *

      It s Derek.

                                  SCOTT
                    Oh, thank God.

      But Derek sinks to his knees and drops forward, SLAMMING down 
      on the linoleum floor. Paralyzed yet again by--

      Jackson. Standing right behind him.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      A FLAME FLICKERS up from the edge of Victoria s note. Allison 
      sets it down on a ceramic candle base and watches the paper 
      smolder to ash. Behind it she notices a FRAMED PHOTO.

      It s a picture of her and Lydia, laughing at something off 
      camera. Two ordinary teenage girls having fun.

      As the flames die down, Allison takes the photo and drops it 
      right into the garbage can by her desk. Then she grabs 
      another picture and throws that out as well. 

      She begins moving quickly. Grabbing books, CD s, magazines, 
      jewelry, florescent bracelets. Anything that somehow spells 
      teenage girl.

      With the garbage full, she begins tossing items on her bed s 
      comforter. Brightly colored clothes. High heels. She gathers 
      up the full comforter and drags it off the bed.

      Tearing through her room, she empties it of anything and 
      everything that doesn't fit her newfound purpose. 

      Finally, with the room stripped to bare essentials--a bed, 
      clothes, only the most necessary furniture--Allison places a 
      STEEL BOX on her empty desk.

      She opens the lid, revealing ARROW TIPS inside. Flash bolts 
      and variously shaped points. Allison pulls a TIP out and 
      begins screwing it onto the black shaft of a crossbow bolt. 
      She grabs another and another. Arming herself. 

      Like she's preparing to go to war.


      Derek falls back onto the floor of the office with a painful 
      smack. Seething, he stares up at Jackson who looks down on 
      him, head cocked like a curious animal. Past him, Scott and 
      Stiles watch helplessly while Matt keeps the gun on them.

                                  DEREK
                    This is the one in control? This 
                    kid?

                                  MATT
                    Well, Derek, not everyone s lucky 
                    enough to be a big bad werewolf.

                          (to the others)
                    Yeah, that s right. I ve learned a 
                    few things lately. Werewolves, 
                    hunters, Kanimas. It s like a 
                    frickin  Halloween party every full 
                    moon. Except for you Stiles. What 
                    the hell do you turn into? 

                                  STILES
                      Abominable Snowman. But it s mostly 
                    a winter time thing. Seasonal.

      Not amused, Matt nods to Jackson. Before Stiles can utter a 
      word of protest, Jackson LASHES out with a claw at the nape 
      of his neck. 

      Scott moves to protect him, but Jackson raises the same *
      clawed hand to his face. Eyes on the sharp tips dripping with 
      paralytic toxin, Scott stands down while--

      Hand on his neck, Stiles staggers back, limbs going rigid.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Bitch.

      He goes down, falling directly onto Derek with his head 
      landing right on his chest.

                                  DEREK
                    Get him off me.

      Matt kneels down so that he can look Derek in the eyes.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Get him off me.

                                  MATT
                    I don t know, Derek. I think you 
                    two make a pretty good pair. It 
                    must kind of suck, though, to have 
                    all that power taken away with one 
                    little cut to the back of the neck? 
                    I bet you re not used to feeling 
                    this helpless.

                                  DEREK
                    I ve still got teeth. Why don t you 
                    come a little closer and we find 
                    out how helpless I am.

      Before Matt can respond, HEADLIGHTS FLASH over the office 
      windows. Another car pulling up to the curb.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1220.

                          (to Scott)
                    Is that her?

      Scott turns to the window. His look of despair confirms it.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Do what I say and I won t hurt her. 
                    I won t even let Jackson near her.

                                  STILES
                    Scott, don t trust him.

      With a sudden brutality, Matt kicks Stiles off Derek and then 
      sets the sole of his shoe on Stiles s throat.

                                  MATT
                    This work better for you?*

      Stiles chokes as Matt presses down on his windpipe.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stop, just stop.

                                  MATT
                    Then do what I tell you to.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, all right.

      Matt pulls his foot off Stiles s throat, tears rolling down 
      the boy s cheeks as he coughs and sputters for air. 

      Turning to Jackson, Matt motions to Stilinski s office.

                                  MATT
                    Put them in there.
                          (to Scott)
                    You. With me.


      The front door opens allowing moonlight to spill into the 
      lobby. Melissa steps inside the quiet, darkened station.

                                  SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Mom?

      She whirls at his voice, spotting him in the dimly lit 
      corridor to the left of the front desk.

                                    MELISSA
                    You scared me. Where is everyone?        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1221.

      She starts forward but pauses when Matt steps out from the 
      adjacent hall with a gun pointed directly at Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom, just do what he says. He 
                    promised he wouldn t hurt you.

                                  MATT
                    He s right.

      Then, almost casually, Matt FIRES the gun at Scott. Melissa 
      SHRIEKS in horror as her son collapses back. Shocked, Scott 
      peers up at Matt who gives a simple shrug.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    I didn t say I wouldn t hurt you.

      Rushing for her son, Melissa doesn t even notice Matt aiming 
      the gun at her.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Get back. Get back!

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom, stop--Mom.

      Melissa pulls back as Scott sags against the wall with his *
      hand clutching his BLOODY stomach.


      A mere few yards away, Stilinski shouts from the cell block, 
      pulling desperately at the handcuff around his wrist. 

                                  STILINSKI
                    Scott! Stiles? What happened?


      Matt aims the gun at Melissa while desperate shouts come from 
      all sides.

                                  MATT
                    I said get back.

                    Oh God, Scott--

      Melissa retreats back from him.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1222.

                    Now get up or I shoot her next.

      Hand on his bloody stomach, Scott struggles to his feet.


      Melissa backs into the empty holding cell, tears slipping 
      down her cheeks. The cell door CLANGS SHUT and Matt locks it. 
      On his feet, Stilinski stretches the wall handcuff taut.

                    to let me look at the wound and

      Matt actually laughs, turning an amused look on Scott.

      wounded Scott out of the cell block.


      With Jackson standing guard over Derek and Stiles inside 
      Stilinski s office, Matt shoves Scott ahead of him.

      In the weapon-filled basement, Allison hands her phone to 
      Argent to read a text message.

                                  ARGENT
                    He wants the Bestiary?

                    But it s not from Scott. He 
                    wouldn t text me. And he definitely 
                    wouldn t mention Derek.

      Argent shows Gerard the message.

                    You think Jackson s there too?

                    Maybe. Maybe him and the one

      Argent pulls a BLUEPRINT of the station from a drawer and

      Offices, Jackson abandons his position at the door to 
      Stilinksi s Office and--

      SCOTT BURSTS OUT OF A WALL OF SMOKE, grabbing Jackson by the *
      shirt. He spins, SLAMMING him through the door and crashing 
      back out to the lobby.

      With a triumphant breath, Scott turns back to Stilinski s 
      Office where Derek struggles to pull himself up with one hand 
      while pushing Stiles forward with the other. *

                                  DEREK
                    Take him. Go!

      In the FLASH and FLARE of emergency lights, Scott pulls 
      Stiles to his feet, turning just as--

      Jackson rises back up, fangs bared, eyes BURNING BRIGHT and 
      worst of all--CLAWS DRIPPING WITH VENOM.

      He comes SLASHING FORWARD as Scott drags Stiles back--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1234.



      Into the next office where Scott SLAMS the door shut, locking *
      it, only to see Jackson SMASH through a moment later as--*


      Scott drags Stiles into the next room, another door WHIPPING 
      SHUT and locking. But a snarling Jackson BARRELS through this *
      one as well until finally--


      Scott and a barely mobile Stiles tumble into the 
      interrogation room, steel door closing just as Jackson SLAMS 
      INTO IT. Scott flips the dead bolt and--

      Nothing. Both of them gasping, they listen. But all they hear *
      are PANICKED SHOUTS from Melissa and Stilinski in the cell *
      block just nearby.

                                  STILES
                    What s happening?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know.


      At the rear of the station, a door quietly clicks open. THREE 
      DARK SILHOUETTES enter, guns held at the ready.

      Gripping her crossbow, Allison follows behind Argent. With a 
      quick glance back, he motions for her and the Hunter behind 
      her to continue following around the corner.


      Clawed hand pushing up on the desk, Derek drags himself to 
      his feet. Each breath a struggle, he begins to rise, fighting *
      the paralysis with every ounce of strength and will he s got, 
      until finally--

      Derek snaps his head up with a SNARL. Transformed into a 
      werewolf, his eyes BLAZE a furious RED. 


      Hands wrapped around the bars, a terrified Melissa tries to 
      peer out to the corridor.

                                    MELISSA
                    Scott? Scott!        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1235.

      CONTINUED:5050

      At the same time, BLOOD on his wrist, Stilinski desperately 
      tries to pull free of the handcuff.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    What the hell s going on out there?

      With a CRY of frustration, Stilinski puts a foot up on the 
      wall, trying now to pull the handcuff from its bolt.


      Under a shroud of a darkness, Jackson slowly peers up as a 
      sickening yellow GLOW fills his eyes. Head wrenching from 
      side-to-side, he begins to complete his transformation into 
      the Kanima.


      With Stiles resting against a wall, Scott begins to stand.

                                  SCOTT
                          (a whisper)
                    Don t move.

      The paralyzed Stiles looks at him, incredulous.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    You know what I mean.

      As quietly as possible, he slips out the other door of the 
      interrogation room.


      Dark-clad bodies move stealthily down the corridor. Argent 
      pauses, raising a hand to stop their approach. He cocks his 
      head, listening to what sounds like CLAWS clicking across the *
      cement floor. 

      Argent spins and FIRES, lighting the corridor with MUZZLE 
      FLASHES as the Kanima hurtles toward them.

      With a SHRIEK of pain, it CRASHES into a wall. But almost *
      instantly, the creature is back on its feet.

                                  ARGENT
                    Move, move!

      The Hunter is not fast enough. The Kanima s claws LACERATE 
      his throat with two quick swipes. Blood falls to the floor as 
      the man crumbles.

      Allison retreats back into another corridor where--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1236.



      Scott whirls around to find Allison turning the crossbow on 
      him. She almost pulls the trigger before recognizing his 
      face. He gazes at her, shocked both to find her in the 
      station and to see her armed for battle.

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison?

                                    ALLISON
                    Where s Derek?

                                  SCOTT
                      What--What are you doing?

                                    ALLISON
                    If you re not going to tell me, 
                    then get out of the way.

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison--

                                    ALLISON
                    Where is he?

      Scott flinches back, stunned by the flash of anger.

                                  SCOTT
                    What happened?

      He moves to touch her, as if to comfort her, but she pulls 
      the crossbow up, using the weapon to maintain their distance.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott, you need to stay away from 
                    me right now. You need to go. You 
                    need to just... just stay out of my 
                    way.

      Frightened by the look in her eyes, Scott watches her retreat 
      back into the shadows. When her face turns from the light, 
      the darkness seems to literally swallow her up.


      With quick, tactical movements, Argent navigates the dark 
      corners of the file room and spots Allison at the other end. 
      He signals to her to move to the open rows of shelves.

      Argent turns into the first row, swinging his gun in to fire. 
      But the row is empty.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1237.

      CONTINUED:5555

      Allison turns into the row closest to her, swinging the 
      crossbow to aim between the shelves. Empty as well. 

      Argent moves to the next to find it empty. But then pauses, 
      as if feeling eyes on him.

      BEHIND HIM - the Kanima sits perched on the ledge of a shelf. 
      Argent turns, but not fast enough.

      The creature launches off the shelf, SLAMMING him forward. As 
      Argent s gun clatters to the floor--

      Allison FIRES the crossbow. 

      The Kanima s head ROCKS violently back. It s a direct hit. 
      The BOLT sticks right out of the middle of the creature s 
      head. But then its clawed hand rises up to grasp the BLACK 
      SHAFT of the bolt.

      Slowly and methodically, the Kanima pulls the crossbow bolt 
      right out of its head.

      Allison watches in horror as the wound closes on the 
      creature s forehead. As the bolt drops to the floor and the *
      Kanima begins to approach--*

      Allison runs for it.


      Struggling to load a new bolt into the crossbow, Allison 
      drops it, abandoning it for a TACTICAL KNIFE instead. As she 
      rolls to the floor--

      The Kanima leaps out of the darkness and lands on one of the 
      desks. It peers about the bullpen, searching for its prey.

      UNDERNEATH A DESK - Allison expertly flips the knife around 
      in her hand to defend herself.

      Trying to control her fearful breathing, she focuses on the 
      quiet sounds around her. Then spots an approaching shadow.*

      The Kanima slams down onto the desk under which Allison 
      hides. But she s prepared for it. Knees to her chest, she 
      pushes up on the desk with the soles of her feet.

      THE DESK FLIPS UP, sending the creature tumbling. Allison 
      comes at it with the tactical knife, slashing at the creature 
      as it dodges the blade in near misses until--

      THE KNIFE sinks right into its body.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1238.

      CONTINUED:5656

      But at the same time, the Kanima wraps a hand around 
      Allison s throat. She digs the knife in, but the creature 
      barely seems fazed, cocking its head to the side to peer on 
      her with a kind of curiosity.*

      And then it whips its hand away.

      Allison reaches for the back of her neck where its claw *
      slashed into her skin.*

      She staggers back, pulling the knife out of the creature with 
      her. The weapon falls first. Then, finally, Allison sinks to 
      the floor as well, paralyzed.

      While her peripheral vision begins to blur, she remains able 
      to focus on Matt s face as he lowers to meet her eyes. He 
      pushes the hair from her cheek with a delicate touch.

                                  MATT
                    You should have given me a chance. 
                    Because you know how I told you I 
                    wasn't the guy who would say 
                    something like If I can't have her, 
                    no one can? Well, it wasn t totally 
                    true. Because, Allison, if I can't 
                    have you... NO ONE CAN.

                                                                          FADE OUT:


                                  END OF ACT FIVE        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1239.


                                        ACT SIX

      FADE IN:


      Allison glares back up at Matt, almost daring him with her 
      eyes. Until a CLATTERING grabs his attention. Night Officer s 
      gun gripped in his hand, he stands. With the Kanima following 
      at his side, he leaves her lying paralyzed in the dark.

      Breathing hard, Allison almost screams when a hand reaches 
      for her. But it s only her father, Argent. He puts a finger 
      to his mouth warning her to be silent as he begins to lift 
      her up.


      With Melissa watching from behind the bars of her cell, 
      Stilinski gives one last herculean effort and yanks up on the 
      bolt attaching the handcuff to the wall.

      It breaks free. Stunned, he actually smiles in triumph.

                                    MELISSA
                    Sheriff--

      He turns around just in time to see Matt swinging the butt of 
      the gun down on his head.


      Clawing his way into the corridor, a still paralyzed Stiles 
      looks up in shock as his father tumbles to the floor.*

      Legs desperately kicking out, Stiles tries to get his muscles 
      to move, tries to find a way to stand and protect his father. *
      But all he can do is watch the man s eyes flutter closed.


      Matt turns from the unconscious Stilinski to face Melissa at 
      the bars of her cell.

                                    MELISSA
                    Matt, listen to me, please. My son 
                    is shot. There s been gunfire. I 
                    don t know what s happening but you 
                    have to let me see Scott.

      To her utter astonishment, Matt laughs.

                                  MATT
                    How totally clueless are you 
                    people? You have no idea what s 
                    really going on, do you?

      But then Melissa s eyes widen. And it looks like she s 
      beginning to get a clue. Matt turns to see who s grabbed her 
      attention--

      Derek. Standing at the right side entrance to the cell block. *
      Fangs bared, claws out, he looks ready to tear someone apart.

      But a HISS draws his eyes. The Kanima stands in the opposite 
      doorway, fully prepared to protect its master.

      SHRIEKING in defiance, the Kanima charges. Derek moves fast, *
      clawed hands reaching up to grab the creature and SLAM it *
      down to the floor.*

      But the Kanima flips back up, moving with uncanny agility, 
      bouncing from wall-to-wall, grabbing onto the bars of the 
      cell and swinging up to move with lightning speed while--


      A furious Matt retreats back into the shadowy corridor. Hands 
      feeling along the walls, he finds a door and pushes it open 
      as--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1241.



      The Kanima grabs Derek and sends him CRASHING back. It spins, 
      baring its fangs at Melissa as it LEAPS RIGHT ONTO THE BARS 
      OF THE CELL.

      Melissa screams in terror as the creature leans in, mouth *
      opening to--*

      GASP. It SHRIEKS in pain as it suddenly yanks back off the 
      bars and brutally SLAMS down into the floor underneath--

      Scott. Transformed into a werewolf, he gazes up to his mother 
      as she sees his face. The eyes, the creased brow, the fangs. 
      His secret, his true nature. And the look on Melissa s own *
      face is pure horror.

      A SNARL comes from beneath Scott, the Kanima scrambling up. *
      It moves defensively as Derek flips back onto his own feet. *
      The three of them locked in an acrobatic fight until the *
      Kanima slips free, charging into the darkness to escape.*

      Scott gives a last look at his mother who backs into the *
      shadows of the cell. Finally, he turns to pursue Derek and *
      the Kanima.


      Hurtling into a dark corridor, a now human Scott STUMBLES 
      right into Gerard.

                                  SCOTT*
                    What are you doing here? It wasn t 
                    supposed to happen like this.

                                  GERARD
                    Trust me, I m aware of that.

                                  SCOTT
                    I did everything you asked me to. 
                    I m part of Derek s pack. I ve 
                    given you all the information you 
                    wanted. I told you it was Matt 
                      controlling Jackson--

                                  GERARD
                    And leave him to us. Go back. Help 
                    your friends. Leave Matt and 
                    Jackson to me. Deal with your *
                    mother. Go.

      Scott nods. Gerard releases him. But then Scott lifts up his 
      pill box.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 210" GOLDENROD  3/20/1242.

                    You dropped this.

      Trying to suppress a tight, wheezing COUGH, Gerard nods and 
      takes the pill box.

                                  GERARD
                    Go.

      Finally, Scott turns, rushing around a corner too fast to see 
      someone in the darkness who has heard and felt every word of 
      betrayal... 

      Derek.
