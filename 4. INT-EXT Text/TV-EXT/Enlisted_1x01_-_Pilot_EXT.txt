        All excitement has disappeared and we re in the sleepy       "Enlisted" Pilot3.


          opposite of a war zone: palm trees, cinder blocks.  Florida. 
          A  Welcome, Brother!  signis held by the BROTHERS from 
        Pete s phone:  CORPORAL DERRICK WAITS (20s), middle child, 
        smart but cynical, likes to prove he s cooler/smarter than 
          people, not thrilled about the military or... well, anything.  
          PRIVATE RANDY WAITS (20s) is his opposite: a big, happy, 
          eager-to-please kid brother.

                                      DERRICK
                        Man, we look like chicks excited 
                        about our boos.  Thank God I talked 
                      you out of the flowers.    

                                      RANDY
                      You didn t, I put a bouquet on his 
                        bunk.
                              (off his look)
                        Just some carnations. They re man 
                        flowers.  Here he comes!

        Pete steps off the bus and they take each other in.

                         Sup, less handsome brother.  How s 
                        Uncle Sam s favorite nephew?

        Randy puts hands on their heads.  It s a loving gesture. 

                                      DERRICK (CONT D)
                        Stop, Randy!  You know I hate that.

                                      RANDY
                      No.  Hand-head is how we ve said  I 
                        love you  since we were kids so 
                        give me this because we haven t 
                        been together in a year and I m 
                        happy Pete didn t get blown up.

                        Derrick, give him his hand head.

                              (begrudgingly does it)
                        Ugh, fine.  I can t believe you 
                        punched an officer.  That s dumber 
                        than the time I tricked Randy into 
                        licking a popsicle made of Windex.      "Enlisted" Pilot4.


                                      RANDY
                        I got so sick.  Plus side, I 
                        cleaned up my puke with my puke.

                                      PETE
                        That s not a  plus side,  buddy.  I 
                        really did miss you guys. 

                                      DERRICK
                        Yeah yeah, let s not get all 
                        Nicholas Sparks about it. 

                                      RANDY
                        Less talk, more hand-head.
                              (Derrick struggles to get away)

        Randy is training on the mortar range with Derrick.

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY (V.O.)
                        Then Randy showed up.  He actually 
                        lovesbeing a soldier.  Problem is, 
                        he s too gung ho for his own good. 

                                      RANDY
                        I can aim by sight!  Boo-ya, bitch!  

        He drops the mortar in the tube.  Ca-THUNK!  It fires!  They 
        watch it go up... then fall on a nearby FUEL TANKER.  BOOM!!

                                      RANDY (CONT D)
                      Do I have to pay for that?

                                                                        POP BACK TO:


          Derrick, Randy and Pete walk as WE TAKE IN THE BASE.  We see 
          soldiers marching, training, etc.  Young women and men of 
        every race and ethnicity.  The Youtube generation in camo.  

                                      RANDY
                      So, everybody thinks all Rear D 
                        does is wash tanks and get high.

                                      PETE
                        Come on, nobody thinks that.      "Enlisted" Pilot8.


                                      RANDY
                      We totally have a mission.  We take 
                        care of families of deployed troops, 
                      and this sweet-ass base.  So we mow 
                        lawns, sort mail...

                                      DERRICK
                      ... andwash tanks and get high.  
                      And our mission sucks balls.  Any 
                        boring ass job you can think of 
                        falls on us because we re the ones 
                      not good enough to be deployed. 

                                      RANDY
                        That s why the base seems empty.  
                        There s usually a battalion here. 
                              (sighs, like a little kid)
                      It does suck that we wash the tanks 
                      but never get to drive them...

        They pass the Motor Pool, a car dealership-like facility with 
          military vehicles.  A BLACK SOLDIER IN GLASSES washes a tank.

                                      DERRICK
                        What up, Private Black Elton John?

                                      PRIVATE BLACK ELTON JOHN
                      Not much, Corporal Alcoholic.

                                      DERRICK
                        Mine was playful, yours was just 
                        mean.

                                      RANDY
                            (to Pete)
                      How great is this camaraderie???

        Elton John grumbles as Pete wraps his head around all this.  
        SGT. JILL POP (opposite of neurotic: confident, funny and 
          ballsy) exits the garage.  Pete notices: wow.  Near a HUMVEE 
          a PRIVATE listens to Reggaeton.  She clicks off his radio.

                                      JILL
                        Private Sanchez, were you too busy 
                        listening to awful music to fix the 
                        armor on your Humvee like I asked?
                            (he hesitantly nods  yes )
                      How many push ups should he do?  

          Soldiers laugh, shout numbers: they loveher.  Playing along:

                      How about a thousand?      "Enlisted" Pilot9.


                                      JILL
                        Good number!  Do one for the armor, 
                      999 for getting the lyric  me gusta
                        datbooty  stuck in my head. 
                        Private Maurer, you count them. 

          Push-ups / counting commences (will continue in the bgthe 
        rest of the scene).   Jill comes over to Pete.

                                      JILL (CONT D)
                      Hi, you must be the new Waits 
                        brother.  I m Sgt. Pop.  

                                      RANDY
                        I know it seems like she s being 
                        nice, but she hates us and she s 
                        about to say something mean. 

                                      JILL
                        I head up the other Rear D platoon 
                        here, the one not full of rejects 
                      and mental patients. 

                                      RANDY / DERRICK
                      So mean.  / Good one, Sergeant. 

                                      PETE
                      But I shouted a number and you were 
                        like,  Good number!  And I was all, 
                         Wow I think there s a thing here. 

                                      JILL
                        Look, if Cody wants you here that s 
                        fine.  Just keep your unit out of 
                      my unit s way.  
                              (Randy giggles)
                        Unlike your screw ups my platoon is 
                        full of bright, dedicated soldiers.

                                      PETE
                        Excuse me, but I m the most 
                        dedicated soldier you ve ever seen.

                                      RANDY
                        That s right, Jill!

                                      PETE
                      And my troops will be too once I 
                      get through with them.

                                      JILL
                      Got a chip on your shoulder, huh?      "Enlisted" Pilot10.


                                      PETE
                        Actually I have a chip inmy 
                        shoulder.  About yay big.  Part of 
                        a bomb.  It hurts when it rains.  
                      And when it doesn t rain.    

                                      JILL
                        I like a man who likes a challenge.
                              (Pete smiles)
                      I m just kidding, I don t like you 
                      or the GI Bros.

        Jill walks off.  Derrick, amused, turns to Pete.

                                      DERRICK
                      Is that why they sent you here?  
                        Army poster boy gonna whip us 
                        grunts into shape?

                                      PETE
                        What s wrong with that?
                              (Derrick starts laughing)
                        What?


        Pete s Rear D Platoon (10 in total) AKA the Island of Misfit 
          Toystrains on a bayonet range.  Men and women who are out of 
        shape, small, some too big.  An old guy.  Randy s with them.  
        ANGLE ON: Derrick and Pete watching from afar.  

                                      PETE
                        Those are soldiers?They look like 
                        people waiting for free cheese. 

                                      DERRICK
                        Look, Randy s showing off for you.

                        Cooper, it s just a rhythm thing.

          Everybody starts imitating Randy s stabbing method.

                                      ENTIRE PLATOON

                                      PETE
                      How am I supposed to win war games 
                        with these idiots?  Hell, I 
                        wouldn t even trust any of them to 
                        find a dog.

        Just then Randy RIPS the dummy off its perch as he trains.  
        He stabs then humps it on the ground.  It s in TATTERS.  

                                      DERRICK
                        He s actually much improved.

                                      RANDY
                      Do I have to pay for that?

                                          END OF ACT ONE      "Enlisted" Pilot12.


                                              ACT TWO


           Reveille  plays on speakers as all salute the rising flag. 
        Pete stands before his platoon: Randy, Derrick, PRIVATE NAILS 
        (she has big nails), PRIVATE HIPSTER (hipster), Private Black 
        Elton John, PRIVATE GRANDPA (old), a Korean WOMAN, PRIVATE 
          CHUBOWSKI (big) and PRIVATE SICK (it ll make sense later). 

                                      PETE
                      At ease.  I m Platoon Sergeant Pete 
                        Waits.  It s good to be here. 

                                      RANDY
                      Aw yeah, says it s good to be here!

                                      DERRICK
                        Randy, stop being his hype man.

                                      RANDY
                        You re not the boss of me.

                                      PETE
                      We need to get ready for war games!  
                      And find a dog!  The second one I 
                        still do not get, but okay!  Now,  
                        working together starts with a 
                        sense of trust, but we don t know 
                        each other yet.  We have no 
                        tradition.  This platoon doesn t 
                        even have a motto.  

                                      RANDY
                        Yeah yeah, a motto embodies the 
                        spirit of the unit!

                      How about,  Got your back, nigga? 

                                      PETE
                        Love the meaning behind it, but 
                        there s one pesky little word.

                                      PRIVATE NAILS
                      How about,  Got your back, n-word?  

                                      PETE
                        That s somehow worse.

                      To piss off white people.

                                      PETE
                        Please don t start a race war.  
                        Let s start with your appearances.
                              (re: each soldier in line)
                        Mustache is too big, hair too long. 
                        There s a weight issue in this 
                        general area.  What s your name?

                                      PRIVATE CHUBOWSKI
                        Private George Chubowski, Sergeant.

                                      PETE
                        Chubowski?  Okay, you can t change.  
                        It d be weird if you weren tbig.

                                      RANDY
                      No one likes an ironic name! 

                                      DERRICK
                      So what if they don t lookperfect?  

                                      PETE
                        Fair point.  Maybe there s a great 
                        soldier insideeach of you. 

        We begin a SERIES OF SHOTS of the platoon.  They do push ups, 
          flutter kicks, etc.  Everyone but Randy, Chubowski and Korean 
        Woman struggles.  In fact, the Woman TEARS through exercises. 


        Muddy sun-beat awfulness.  Derrick takes off his helmet. 

                                      PETE
                        Keep it on!  Danger is everywhere!

                                      DERRICK
                      But it s hot as nuts out here! 


        Randy runs with Derrick and Chubowski (he s tough).  The 
        Korean Woman BURNS by, just flying, knocking Randy down. 

                                      RANDY
                      Why you throwing elbows, Denise?!


          Derrick stops and takes off his helmet. 

                                      DERRICK
                        Screw this.  There s no  danger.   

        Pete pops up and chucks a rock at Derrick s head.

                                      PETE
                        Danger is everywhere!


        The platoon is beat up, tired, miserable.   Private Grandpa 
        is splayed on the ground. 

                                      PETE
                        Turns out there was not a great 
                        soldier inside each of you.  Plus
                        I think Private Grandpa s dead.  

          Suddenly, in SLO-MO, a Jeep of ITALIAN SOLDIERSdrives up.  
        In contrast to Pete s miserable bunch, they are sexy, noble- 
          a poster for awesome.  Pete s platoon gazes, open-mouthed.

                                      RANDY
                              (whispering, awestruck)
                      The Italians...

        The jeep screeches to a halt as SLO-MO ends. 

                                      MAIN ITALIAN SOLDIER
                          Voisoldatisonotesticoli!  Haha!

        The Italians drive away, laughing.

                                      DERRICK
                      I m very fluent in Italian so I can 
                      say with a lot of certainty that he 
                        just called us  testicle soldiers. 

                                      RANDY
                        That hurts.      "Enlisted" Pilot15.


                                      PETE
                        This lljust make it sweeter when 
                      we crush them at war games.

                                      DERRICK
                              (snickering)
                        Yeah, okay.

                                      PETE
                        Corporal Waits, for that lack of 
                        spirit you are now in charge of 
                        finding the dog.  Take an hour and 
                        look around before you hit chow. 

        Pete throws him the squeaky toy.

                                      DERRICK
                        Seriously?  Come on, Pete.

                                      PETE
                        Excuse me?

                                      DERRICK
                              (fake enthusiasm)
                        I mean,  Yes, Sergeant Brother! 

                                      PETE
                        Everyone else is dismissed.  And 
                        stop poking Grandpa with a stick.

        Reveal DENISE poking him.  Grandpa  ughs  from the ground as 
          A CANNON goes off as  Retreat  plays on speakers.  All stop 
        what they re doing and salute the lowering flag.  THE LOST 
        DOG runs by unseen.  It will do this the rest of the script.   


        Pete, Derrick and Randy (back seat) drive down main street. 

                                      RANDY
                        Woo, boys night out!  Going out for 
                      our first beer together in a year, 
                        I love it.  Man, don t we have the 
                        best job?  We re serving our 
                        country, and now we do it together!

                                      DERRICK
                              (Randy tries hand-heading him)
                      Not while I m driving, Sling Blade! 

                                      RANDY
                      Let me love you!  Pete, check out 
                        this great town we re stationed in.      "Enlisted" Pilot16.

                        Strip club, strip club, store, gas 
                        station, strip club, bar and bar. 

                                      RANDY
                        Pretty sweet town, right?


            A PorscheBoxster, vanity plate RICH YOpulls up.  WALLACE 
          (handsome, cocky, slick) exits, in suit, with a red leather 
        case.  AN EIGHT YEAR OLD KID ON A BIKE is here. 

                                      WALLACE
                        Pretty dope car, right? 
                              (the kid shrugs)
                        Ugh, enjoy being poor forever.       "Enlisted" Pilot19.



        Start of the day.  Pete stands before his platoon, perturbed.

                                      PETE
                        Some of you look terrible.  How 
                        long did you stay there last night?

          Derrick turns away and PUKES (off camera).

                                      RANDY
                      He stayed the longest.

                                      PETE
                        Great.  Got a progress report on 
                      the dog, Corporal Waits?

          Derrick pulls the dog toy out, squeaks it.  Sarcastically:

                                      DERRICK
                      The canine is not in our vector.

                                      PETE
                        Wait, did you even lookyesterday?  
                              (Derrick shakes  nope )
                        Dammit, I know it s stupid but I 
                        gave you an order.      "Enlisted" Pilot22.


                                      DERRICK
                        Yes, Sergeant Awesome Brother!

                                      PETE
                      We gotta get serious around here! 
                        Better!  Faster!  Tougher!  If 
                        you re gonna be a bear be a what?

                        A panda bear?

                                      PETE
                      No, you re supposed to say grizzly. 

                                      PRIVATE CHUBOWSKI
                        Pandas are powerful.  They can rip 
                        apart bamboo with their teeth.

                                      PETE
                      My point is, be the strongest bear.

                                      PRIVATE GRANDPA 
                        Panda s still a pretty strong bear.

          Derrick just starts walking away.

                                      PETE
                        Where the hell are you going?

                                      DERRICK
                      To bed.  I m hungover.

                                      PETE
                      Get back in line, soldier!

                        Knock it off, Braveheart, your rah 
                        rahcrap doesn t apply to Rear D.

                                      PRIVATE BLACK ELTON JOHN
                        Yeah, you seem cool, but we re all 
                        here for a reason.  Hell, I failed 
                      my dental exam.  We know we suck.

                                      DERRICK
                        Well there s our motto.   We suck.

                        Maybe we do but knock off the 
                        negativity, you guys!  And support 
                        your brother, Derrick!      "Enlisted" Pilot23.


                                      DERRICK
                        Why?  He s only here to look good, 
                      get his stripe back and get out.

                                      PETE
                      Oh, maybe I should hang around so I 
                      can turn into a drunk with no 
                        future?

                                      RANDY
                      Now youknock off the negativity, 
                        Pete.  Damn, this is getting so 
                        negative!

                                      DERRICK
                        Pete just cares about Pete.  Why do 
                      you think we never heard from him?

                                      PETE
                      Oh sorry, I was a little busy 
                        getting shot at every day to worry 
                        about Randy s stupid birthday! 

                                      DERRICK
                      And I m sorry that I turned into a 
                        giant screw up and Randy turned 
                        into the worst soldier in the 
                        history of the Army! 

        Randy looks at him, shocked and hurt, then DECKS him.  

                                      PRIVATE SICK
                      Aw, sick!

          Derrick and Randy fight.  Pete goes to stop them but Derrick 
          punches him - Pete punches him back!  As all three fight:

                                      RANDY
                      One large Guillotine coming up!

                                      PETE
                        Stop using your stupid MMA terms!

                                      DERRICK
                        I can t breath, I can t breath...

        The CANNON goes off and  Retreat  starts playing.  The 
          brothers stand to salute the flag.  And see Sgt. Cody, Jill 
        and HER PLATOON saluting but watching from not too far away.  
        As Pete locks eyes with the flag, knowing they fucked up, and 
        maybe in the background we see the LOST DOG run by again...

                                          END OF ACT TWO      "Enlisted" Pilot24.


                                                ACT 3


          A Florida Cracker-style home (tin roof, porch).  Cody and 
        Pete sit out front, drinking beers.  Cody has a BAT.

                                      PETE
                      You gonna hit me with that? 

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                      The bat s for my sixteen year-old 
                        daughter s boyfriend, Da'Quan.  I 
                        don t like Da'Quan.  He s gonna 
                        pull up in the driveway, and he s 
                        gonna turn his ass around. 

        Pete massages an ache in his shoulder.  Cody notices. 

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY (CONT D)
                      You got banged up over there, huh?       "Enlisted" Pilot25.


                                      PETE
                        Let s see.  Concussion from an RPG, 
                        shrapnel in my shoulder, busted 
                        wrist, two herniated discs.  I got 
                        those carrying a buddy.  I took a 
                        digger when I slipped in his blood. 

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                        Yeah, well my foot got blown off. 

        They both laugh.  They have to.  A beat, then:

                                      PETE
                        I feel guilty I m not there.

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                        I know, son.  And I know jobs like 
                        finding dogs seem crazy.  But this 
                        work is important.  If something 
                        happens overseas, you have to tell 
                      the family.  Soldiers who did this, 
                        they showed up at your house once.   

        This strikes a chord with Pete.  Thinking back:

                                      PETE
                        This one lady played Monopoly with 
                      me all night...  I liked that.

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                        Your father was a good man.  

                                      PETE
                        Yeah, he was.

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                      So start acting like him.
                              (this lands on Pete)
                        Thinking you re too good for all 
                        this ain t gonna cut it. Your 
                        troops need to know you re one of 
                        them.  Your brothers, too.
                              (headlights FLOOD driveway)
                      Oh, hell no!  Get your ass back to 
                        Kinkos you twenty year old bastard!

          BRITNAY(16), Cody s daughter, leans out the front door.

                                      BRITNAY
                        Leave Da'Quanalone, he s sweet.

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                      He ain t gonna be so sweet with 
                        this bat upside his head!       "Enlisted" Pilot26.


        The car quickly backs out of the driveway.  Britnay harumps
        and SLAMS the front door shut.  Gleefully to Pete:

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY (CONT D)
                        I love being a Dad.


        Pete is before the platoon, who stand stiffly at attention.  

                                      PETE
                        Everyone just relax, okay?  
                              (Grandpa sits on ground)
                        That s too much.  Now look, I owe 
                      you guys an apology.  I ve been 
                        acting like I m the only winner in 
                      the middle of a bunch of losers.  
                              (dramatic pause)
                        Well guess what?  I m a loser too.

                                      RANDY
                        Really thought that was going the 
                        other way.

                                      PETE
                      I m just like you guys.  A beat up, 
                        suckylet down.

                                      PRIVATE BLACK ELTON JOHN
                        This is a terrible apology.

                                      PETE
                      But we don t have to be losers!  Do 
                      you really want to lose to them?

        He motions to SHIRTLESS Italians a ways off.  They re smoking 
          cigarettes, and a RIPPED one is showering with a hose.

                                      PETE (CONT D)
                        That s pornographic!  Now come on 
                        Private, when you look in the 
                        mirror who do you see?       "Enlisted" Pilot29.


                                      PRIVATE DENISE
                        Daffy Duck.  I have a picture of 
                      him taped to my mirror.

                                      PETE
                      Who do you see next to Daffy Duck?

                                      PRIVATE DENISE
                        Ryan Gosling.  And next to him it s 
                        another picture of Ryan Gosling but 
                      in this one he s got two kittens--

                                      PETE
                      You see you!  You, Chubowski, big 
                        moustache guy, all of us, we are 
                        soldiers in the Army of the United 
                        States.   Guardians of freedom and 
                        liberty.  We re here because on 
                        some level we believe that.  So 
                        what if we re the ones no one else 
                        wants?  We don t need them.  We 
                        have each other now - we re here
                        together now.  We will train 
                        together, we will fight together.  
                      And we will have each other s backs 
                        because we are all we ve got.  We 
                      are brothers.    
                            (to Derrick and Randy)
                      We are all we need.  

        He locks eyes with them, telling them he s there.  For them.

                                      RANDY
                        I wish we had a motto to shout. 

                                      DERRICK
                      We do have one.  We are brothers! 

        It happens instantly, the platoon picking it up in chorus:

                                      PLATOON
                      We are brothers!  

                                      PETE
                      We are brothers!  

                                      PLATOON
                              (even louder)
                      We are brothers!  

        A HAND rests on Derrick s head.  Randy s hand.  Derrick rests 
        a hand on Pete then Private Nail s head.  The entire platoon 
        follow suit, until every soldier has a hand on another.  All 
        there for each other, having the other s back.  Then:      "Enlisted" Pilot30.


                                      PETE
                        Let s go kick some Italian ass.


          Italian soldiers talk lazily amongst themselves.  They wear 
        MILES gear (it s basically military laser tag, the sensors 
        BEEP if you get hit).  Then a RUMBLE LIKE THUNDER.

                                      ITALIAN
                        Preggo?

        MUSIC CUE: The chorus of  Thunderstruck  BLARES AS A TANK 
          CRASHES THROUGH PALMETTO SCRUB TOWARD THE ITALIANS.  Randy 
        sticks his head out, more excited than he s ever been.  

                                      RANDY
                      I m finally driving a tannnnnk!!

        The platoon runs behind it and fires their weapons (no 
          gunfire; MILES works on infra-red bursts).  Italian sensors 
        beep.  They voice frustration and fight back.  We COVER the 
          battle.  Pete takes cover behind a bush.  From his radio:

                                      PRIVATE NAILS (ON RADIO)
                        Gyllenhaal Squad is down, sir.

                                      PETE
                      The call sign for  G  is Golf not-- 
                        actually, Gyllenhaal s way better. 

                                      JILL (ON RADIO)
                        Relax, we ll clean up your mess.

        Pete whirls to find Jill s platoon storming out of the woods.

                                      PETE
                        Sgt. Pop?  What are you doing?

                                      JILL 
                        Having your back. 

        They fight alongside Pete s platoon.  We highlight people s 
        moves, like Denise throwing an elbow and knocking down an 
          Italian.  It finally comes down to the Main Italian (the one 
        we ve heard speak) and Randy.  Randy executes a perfect Army 
        roll, pops up, and takes the guy out!  Pete, proudly: 

                                      PETE
                        Nice Army roll, Randy!  You did it!  
                      We won!  USA!  USA!  USA!      

        All celebrate as Jill smiles to Pete.  TIME CUT: the platoons 
        walk past the Italians, slapping hands a la Little League.      "Enlisted" Pilot31.


                                      PETE / DERRICK / RANDY / JILL
                        Good game, good game, good game.

                                      PETE
                        Okay, beers on me.

                                      DERRICK
                        Wait, we have to do one more thing.


        Pete, Derrick, Randy and Jill trudge through palmetto scrub 
        in the awful, beating midday sunas Derrick squeaks the toy.

                                      DERRICK
                        Keep looking!  Bogie could be anywhere!

                                      PETE
                      It really is hot as nuts out here.

        And just then a CUTE DOG bounds out of some nearby scrub.  
          Derrick scoops him up as the dog grabs the toy playfully.

                                      PETE (CONT D)
                        Good work, soldiers.  Let s make 
                        sure he gets back safe.


        The TANK rolls down the street.  The DOG S HEAD sticking out 
        the top as if it was the window of a car.


          Derrick is at a front door with the dog.  The door swings 
        open revealing CASSY (the bartender).  Derrick s jaw drops.

                                      CASSY
                        Bogie!

        She takes the dog, happy and teary.

                                      DERRICK
                        I didn t know this guy was yours.

                                      CASSY
                        It s not, it s my brother s.  He s 
                        overseas.  Bogey is what reminds me 
                      of him.  I ve been so depressed every 
                      day without this guy.  So thank you.

        She gives Derrick a hug.  He tries to be casual.      "Enlisted" Pilot32.

                        This is what we do.

                              (proudly)
                        Hooah!  We are brothers!

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                      And you found that dog, which may 
                      be even more important.  Great job.

                                      PLATOON
                              (proudly, again)
                        Hooah!  We are brothers!

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                      But what the hell are you doing 
                        taking out a tank?!  You re not 
                        supposed to take out a damn tank!

                                      RANDY
                        Hooah!  We are brothers!

                                      DERRICK
                      Not the time for the motto, buddy.

                      The tank was a diversionary tactic.  

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                        Diversionary my ass.  Sgt. Pop, you 
                        helping him out technically isn t 
                        fair but it was a cool move, so 
                        you re all right.

        Pete and Jill share a look as her soldiers cheer her.  

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY (CONT D)
                      As for you crazy ass idiots--


        Pete stands before the platoon.         "Enlisted" Pilot33.


                                      PETE
                        Well, Sergeant Major Cody says our 
                        punishment is washing all the 
                        vehicles in the motor pool. 

        They take in the motor pool.  The tank is parked here.  

                                      DERRICK
                        I will say that the tank doesn t 
                        quite seem dirty enough yet.  

                                      RANDY
                      To maximize the cleanliness of the 
                        tank, we should see it at its 
                        dirtiest, Sergeant!  

                                      PETE
                      Son of a gun, this plan makes 
                        sense.  So, how do we get it dirty?


        As credits roll the brothers: use the tank to tow a couch 
        with the platoon sitting on it, see how high they can jump 
        the tank, waterski behind it as it drives through mud (maybe 
        Jill even tries this) and do whatever else we can get away 
        with.  As every man (and a lot of women) in America decides 
        they love this show, Wallace pulls up in his Porsche.   

                                      WALLACE
                      You guys are in trouble!  You re 
                      not supposed to change the rules of 
                      war games!  The government makes a 
                      ton of money off this stuff, 
                        they re going to be very mad!   

                                      PETE
                        I like your squeaky angry voice.

        Just then the tank DRIVES INTO FRAME AND ROLLS TOTALLY OVER 
        THE PORSCHE.  All are silent a beat, then:

                                      PRIVATE SICK  
                      Aw, sick!

        The hatch pops open and Randy and Derrick pop out.

                                      RANDY
                        Heh, Derrick was totally covering 
                      my eyes as I drove.  What dI hit?
                              (sees the Porsche)
                      Do I have to pay for that?

                                            END OF SHOW*
