  FADE IN:


  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  BATIATUS, bruises not yet completely healed, stands on the 
  balcony addressing the assembled GLADIATORS below. Flanking 
  him are OENOMAUS (in Doctore s newly mended chestplate) and 
  GANNICUS, both weighed by heavy thoughts of recent events.

  LUCRETIA

  stands with GAIA, who eyes Gannicus with hungry 
    appreciation. MELITTA attends in the background, weighed by 
  the guilt of what she was commanded to do with Gannicus in 
  HB2. NAEVIA and DIONA also attend, regarding Gannicus with 
  schoolgirl wonder.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We have won many victories in the 
                        arena. Sent many an unworthy 
                        opponent to the afterlife. Yet self 
                        important men have held us to 
                        lesser matches of the morning, 
                        absent both eyes and prominence. 
                        Such time has found its end! Two 
                        days hence, our champion shall take 
                      to the sands to face another of 
                        Vettius  shit-eating dogs. Not in 
                        the streets, but in the fucking 
                        primus!

  The men ROAR their approval.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Behold the man whose recent 
                        performance inspired good Varus to 
                        return the House of Batiatus to 
                        proper position! Behold, Gannicus!

  Batiatus indicates Gannicus, who hesitantly steps forward as 
  Gladiators CHEER below.

                                        GAIA
                                (whispered, to 
                                  Lucretia)
                      An inspired performance, indeed.

  Melitta stiffens, having caught the comment. Lucretia clocks 
  the reaction, whispers disapprovingly to Gaia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        One not to be repeated.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Gladiators)(
                        A true god of the arena! A man to 
                      be emulated and admired!

  Gannicus  eyes find Oenomaus regarding him with brotherly 
  pride. He adjusts his view, finds Melitta within it. She 
  averts her gaze, riddled with shame.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Gladiators loudly incant praise. BARCA, AUCTUS, GNAEUS, and 
  RHASKOS are in the forefront, leading the charge.

                                          GLADIATORS
                        Gannicus! Gannicus!

  FIND ASHUR and DAGAN in the back, brands still fresh. CRIXUS 
  stands with them, eyeing Gannicus with admiration and 
  regret.

                                        CRIXUS
                        There was a moment... I nearly had 
                        the man.

  Ashur chuckles at Crixus  assessment of the fight.

                                        ASHUR
                        Perhaps one day you will find 
                        chance again, and stand a champion 
                      as Gannicus.
                                  re: brand)(
                        Yet first I suggest you earn the 
                        mark, as we have.

  Crixus frowns at the smug comment.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This is but glorious beginning! 
                        Soon you will litter the sands with 
                        blood and bone of all who present 
                        challenge! Instructed in the ways 
                      of death and glory by a former 
                        champion! One of our very own! I 
                        give you Oenomaus! No longer to 
                        hold that name! No longer a 
                        gladiator! Now and forever, to be 
                        revered as your Doctore!

  The men explode with shouts of approval. Batiatus hands 
  Oenomaus the old Doctore s battered WHIP.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                        This has been wielded with pride by 
                        each before you, since the time of 
                      my grandfather. Bestowed only to 
                        the most loyal and honorable of 
                        men.

  Oenomaus regards it solemnly. An honor tainted by blood.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Your will. My hands.

  Batiatus grabs Oenomaus and Gannicus  arms, thrusts them 
  high in the air. The men ROAR. OFF OENOMAUS AND GANNICUS, 
  uneasy about their newfound positions and how they were 
  obtained...


  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  FOLLOW Melitta as she escorts Oenomaus and Gannicus through 
  the villa. A tense silence hangs between the three, all 
  weighing thoughts of how their lives have forever changed.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                (finally; to 
                                  Gannicus)
                        The primus. To gain such position, 
                        Varus must truly have been 
                        impressed by your prowess. As am I.

  Gannicus awkwardly dismisses the praise.

                                        GANNICUS
                      It was nothing.

  An unintentional slight, but it stings Melitta nonetheless.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      It is a great honor. For yourself, 
                        and this ludus.

  They arrive at the door leading down into the ludus.

                                          MELITTA
                        Both of you bring honor to this 
                        ludus. Each in his own way.

  Melitta signals to the GUARD to open the door. She turns to 
  Gannicus, quiets her nerves best she can.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

                        I would have private word with my 
                        husband.

  Gannicus glances at Melitta, barely manages a nod to 
  Oenomaus before exiting. Oenomaus frowns, picking up on his 
  discomfort.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Did you note how he could scarce 
                        meet my eye?

  Melitta tenses, heart in her throat.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                      He must now heed my commands, and 
                        does not embrace it. Will the other 
                        men share sentiment towards my 
                         honored  position?

  Melitta sees that he doesn t suspect Gannicus  true reason. 
  Covers to ensure it remains that way.

                                          MELITTA
                      It is his position that stirs 
                        troubled thoughts. He sets mind to 
                        the primus. As you must to training 
                        the men.

  She sees the pain in his eyes.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        I know this is not what you wished 
                        for.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Yet here I stand. Elevated.

                                          MELITTA
                      As you deserve.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        For taking a life? For betraying 
                        hand that forged the man before 
                        you?

                                          MELITTA
                        There was no betrayal in what you 
                        did. Some acts cannot be avoided, 
                        when stripped of choice.

  She bites back her own guilt, barely concealing it.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                        Now turn thoughts from unfortunate 
                        past. We must look towards days to 
                        come, and embrace them.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        A task made less difficult, with 
                        you among them.

  He kisses her deeply, heads down to the ludus. OFF Melitta, 
  eyes welling with hot tears of shame...


  EXT. MESS HALL/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  WOODEN SWORDS CLACK as a GUARD opens the gate for Oenomaus. 
  He steps out to find the men sparring. He regards the WHIP 
  in his hand with uncertainty.Clenches it tight, the leather 
  CRUNCHING beneath his powerful grip.

  THE MEN PAUSE

  as Oenomaus steps out onto the sand. He glances at Gannicus 
  who looks away, unable to hold the gaze. Oenomaus struggles 
  to find commanding words to begin his life as Doctore. 
  Fails.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Barca. Pair with Crixus. The rest 
                      of you... Continue training.

  The men comply. OFF Oenomaus, far from the formidable 
  Doctore we will come to know him as in season 1...


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Batiatus shouts to the heavens, a cup of wine in hand.

                                        BATIATUS
                      At last, the gods remove cock from 
                        ass!

  POP WIDE to find he s with Lucretia and Gaia in the 
    curtained-off area. Naevia and Diona fill their cups. 
  Melitta stands a fair distance behind, nods for Naevia and 
  Diona to join her.

                        I offered naught but introduction. 
                        And a few selective words of 
                          suggestion...

                        gratitude.

                        The kind I favor most...

  She slides a hand across Lucretia s lap with a wry, 
  salacious smile. Batiatus laughs.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Has a man ever been so blessed?

  He kisses Lucretia passionately, fueled by wine and triumph. 
  She responds, hungry for his touch. His hand finds its way 
  to Gaia as he kisses Lucretia. Gaia responds with a laugh, 
  undoing her dress.

  MELITTA

  escorts Naevia and Diona out, closing the curtains behind 
  her. Passions rise, clothes fall. Gaia pours wine over her 
  breasts with a smile. Batiatus and Lucretia attend to it 
  with willing tongue.

                        Quintus.

  Batiatus whirls in shock and horror.

  REVERSE to find TITUS LENTULUS BATIATUS looming. A stricken 
  Melitta stands by the curtain. Titus is a stern, elderly man 
  in his 60s. The anti-Batiatus: honest, accepts his station, 
  and has gained respect from those above it.

                                        TITUS
                        Gather yourself. I would have 
                        words.

  Titus sweeps out. OFF Batiatus, the gods fucking him once 
  again...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  ON Titus, seated at the desk, reviewing the ledgers. 
  Batiatus enters, hastily adjusting his robes. A long beat as 
  Titus ignores him. Batiatus stands silent, stripped of his 
  sure-footed demeanor in the presence of his father.

                        I leave this house in your care, 
                        and this is what greets me upon 
                        return?

                                        BATIATUS
                        I was not expecting your arrival.

  Titus finally looks at him.

                                        TITUS
                      Am I to announce myself to the 
                        walls that I own?

                                        BATIATUS
                      Of course not. Yet if I had known 
                      of your return from Sicilia --

                                        TITUS
                        The knowledge would have produced 
                        what result? Flowers and scented 
                        oils laid to meet me, masking sight 
                      of a son gone to shit?

                        I but celebrate.

                        Upon what cause? Angering Tullius 
                        with refusal of reasonable offer? 
                        Your exclusion from the games?

                                        BATIATUS
                        How did you come by that?

                        I am old, Quintus. Not dead. There 
                        are still those in Capua that hold 
                      my name in regard, and would see me 
                        well informed. Good Solonius 
                        counted among them.

                      He sent word of his concerns

                        Tullius.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The man is seized by unnecessary 
                        worry.

                                        TITUS

                        Your face suggests otherwise.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A minor disagreement.

                                        TITUS
                        Nothing with a man such as Tullius 
                      is ever minor. A fact obvious to 
                        the simplest of minds.

  Batiatus simmers, barely holding his tongue.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Then it is a blessing a greater one 
                        than mine has arrived.

  Titus sighs, softening.

                                        TITUS
                        I bluster, when soft breeze would 
                      be more welcome.

                        You cannot ask the wind to change 
                        its nature.

                                        TITUS
                      My frustration is more with myself. 
                        You never wished for this. The 
                        ludus, gladiators, the blood, the 
                        sand. Your eyes were always towards 
                        the horizon, to glories and 
                        triumphs forever out of reach of a 
                        common lanista.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And yet here I stand. A lanista. 
                        Like my father.

                                        TITUS
                                  a beat, sadly)(
                        No. Not like him at all. You have 
                        never been able to look into the 
                        eyes of a man, and gauge his true 
                        heart.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Only days past, I looked into the 
                        eyes of Quintilius Varus. And 
                         gauged  way to secure the primus 
                      in his games.

  Titus eyes him, more suspicious than surprised.

                                        TITUS
                        Varus has never employed a lanista 
                        not blessed by Tullius. Why now 
                        break tradition?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Because I possess what Tullius does 
                        not. Gannicus.

                                        TITUS
                        Gannicus?
                                  snorts)(
                        The man is a jest, inciting more 
                        laughter than awe. Now I find him 
                        desired by half of Rome?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Much has changed in your absence.

  Titus considers that, a sadness creeping into his eyes over 
  the state of his son.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        And much has remained the same. I 
                        would review my men, and see how 
                        they have fared, denied proper 
                        guidance.

  He exits, not waiting for a reply. Batiatus seethes as he 
  follows, WIPING US TO --


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  A BLURRED IMAGE OBSCURES FRAME. It RIPS away, revealing 
  Naevia and Diona tearing down the curtains. SLAVES scuttle 
  in the background. Gaia lounges on a sofa, sipping wine as 
  Lucretia barks to Melitta.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Have feast prepared as instructed.
                                an afterthought)(
                        And send to market for an amphora 
                      of mulsum. The highest quality, not 
                        that shit from Flavus.

                                          MELITTA
                        Yes, Domina.

  Melitta moves off.

                                        GAIA
                        Again with the honeyed wine. Does 
                        the corpse drink nothing else?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Lower fucking voice.

  She glances nervously about. Gaia stifles a laugh.

                                        GAIA
                        The man has severed you from 
                        moorings.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He is the paterfamilias! A word 
                        dropped from his mouth would see us 
                        both to the streets. We must be 
                        above reproach, or fall to ruin.

                                        GAIA
                        Very well. I will be a vision of 
                        demure obedience and propriety.
                                  playful)(
                      On the outside, at least.

  Lucretia shoots her a look as Titus enters. Batiatus trails 
  in his wake. Lucretia quickly goes to them.

                        Capua, father.

                        I am certain your heart swells.

  Lucretia forces a smile. Gaia swoops in.

                                        GAIA
                        The clime of Sicilia has most 
                        certainly restored health.

  Titus stares at her. Gaia laughs uncomfortably, reintroduces 
  herself.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                        Perhaps you do not recall me. Gaia, 
                        a dear friend of your --

                        The memory of you has not yet 
                        faded. Quintus.

  Titus heads off for the ludus. Batiatus hisses to Lucretia 
  and Gaia.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We must prove this fucking house in 
                        order. And prompt decision for his 
                        quick return to Sicilia.

  Batiatus heads after his father. Gaia sips her wine, fumes.

                                        GAIA
                        Withered old fuck.

  OFF Lucretia, deeply disturbed by the turn of events...

  CLOSE ON CRIXUS, face straining and beaded with sweat. PULL 
  BACK to REVEAL he s circling the square, alone, carrying a 
  log on his shoulders. The dreaded march, thrust upon all

  MESS HALL

  where Barca stands behind the serving table. He slops gruel 
  into the bowls of Ashur and Dagan with a broad grin.

                                        BARCA
                        Eat, brothers! You bear the mark 
                        now. Savor the taste of victory!

  Ashur beams, basking in the moment of having earned the 
  respect of the men as they cross the hall to find a seat. 
  The men smile and nod at them.

                                        ASHUR

                        us. As one of their own.]

  They pass Auctus, feeding crumbs to one of his pigeons. 
  Ashur and Dagan sit, dig into their gruel -- and immediately 
  spit it out in disgust. The men HOWL with laughter.

                                        BARCA

  The men ROAR in delight. Ashur jumps to his feet.

  Dagan glowers, starts for Auctus. Ashur stops him.

                        soon enough.]

  Gannicus passes by, shoots daggers at Ashur. He sits and 
  begins to eat. Oenomaus joins him.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  doesn t look up)(
                        You should not eat with lower men. 
                        You are the Doctore now.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        A title I did not seek. I would not 
                        have events absent my control come 
                        between us.

  Gannicus takes that in, the meaning resonating deeper than 
  Oenomaus knows.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  soft, guilt ridden)(
                        Nor would I.

  CHEERS erupt. Oenomaus turns, shocked to see Titus entering 
  the hall. He s quickly encircled by the men as they 
    enthusiastically greet their old dominus. Batiatus stands at 
  the periphery, observing the admiration and love the men 
  feel towards his father. A feeling never bestowed upon son.

  OENOMAUS

  approaches. Titus lights up at the sight of him, greeting 
  him with a familiar forearm clasp. It s apparent there s a 
  special bond between these two.

                                        TITUS
                        Oenomaus!

                        predecessor. I chose Oenomaus as 
                        replacement, knowing that he --

  Titus waves lengthy discourse away.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

  Oenomaus heads out with Titus. OFF Batiatus, feeling the 
  sting of exclusion...


  INT. OENOMAUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Titus pours a cup of water.

                                        TITUS
                        Many regrets haunt a man, as life 
                        draws nearer its end.

  He offers the cup to Oenomaus, who s clearly in awe of the 
  mentor seated before him. Titus smiles sadly, filling his 
  own cup.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Being too ill to witness your 
                        battle with Theokoles in Pompeii 
                        counted deeply among them. A fight 
                      of legend, I have been told.

  Oenomaus frowns, not holding the match in the same regard.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        A defeat of equal proportion.

                                        TITUS
                        Defeat? You did not lose.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Nor was I victor.

                                        TITUS
                        You are the only man to ever face 
                        the Shadow of Death and live. That 
                        alone is a great victory. One that 
                        has brought honor to this house. As 
                        you have always done.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I would continue so.

                      In the arena.

  Titus eyes him in surprise.

                                        TITUS
                        Are you not pleased with elevation 
                      to Doctore?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Give command, and I would gladly 
                        release title in favor of sword and 
                        shield.

  Titus regards Oenomaus, sees the longing in his eyes.

                                        TITUS
                        Words I am reluctant to speak. The 
                        Doctore is second in importance 
                        only to the lanista himself. I 
                        chose Ulpius many years ago. This 
                        ludus was his beating heart. The 
                        stilling of it is unfortunate news 
                      -- tempered by you assuming his 
                        place. The sole decision my son has 
                        made that I find agreeable.

  Oenomaus fills with regret, knowing how the promotion was 
  obtained.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      It is a position I am not worthy to 
                        hold.

                                        TITUS
                        There are none more so. From the 
                        moment I laid eyes in that awful 
                        place, I knew. That wild boy, so 
                        filled with rage and hate, would 
                        grow into the man I see before me. 
                      We have traveled a great distance 
                        together, Oenomaus. I would finish 
                      my journey comforted by thought of 
                        you maintaining honor within these 
                        walls. A comfort I am certain your 
                        wife will share, knowing you will 
                        not die beyond them.

  Oenomaus nods, disappointed yet deeply affected by Titus  
  belief in him. OFF Oenomaus, struggling to accept his 
  fate...                                                                                    16.


  INT. GUEST BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Melitta removes Lucretia s robes, readying her for bed. 
  Naevia attends an agitated Batiatus.

                        The way they fawn over him! Falling 
                      to knee to lick his fucking ass! He 
                        takes over my house. My gladiators. 
                      My fucking bed!

                        considerable faults of unworthy 
                        son.

                        Out.

  Naevia quickly exits. Lucretia nods for Melitta to follow.

                        I secure the primus, and he acts as 
                      if I shit upon the name Batiatus.

                        You raise it, beyond anything he 
                        could imagine. He will see this, 
                        and bitter tongue will turn to 
                        praise.

                      He would sooner bite it off, than 
                        have it betray him so.

  His anger gives way to the hurt of his father s 
    disappointment in him.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I had forgotten the feeling. That 
                        sudden abyss, when he would set 
                        disapproving eye upon me.

  She kisses him, stroking his cheek.

                        set him upon fucking way.

  Batiatus burns with the thought, his face consumed in the 
  brilliant fire of the SUN as we TRANSITION TO --


  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The blazing SUN stabs down. ADJUST TO FIND Titus on the 
  balcony with his Attending Slave, observing the men as they 
  gather for training. Melitta sets out BREAD and DATES.

                                          MELITTA
                        Your return lifts the heart, 
                        Dominus.

  Titus replies with a warm smile.

                        Only for those who yet possess one.

                        Gratitude.

  Melitta nods, exits back inside. Titus takes a date, chews 
    reflectively as he returns his attention to

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Oenomaus paces, nervously fingering his whip as the men 
  linger about, engaged in jocular conversation.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Attend!

  The men barely pay attention. Oenomaus steels himself, 
  continues with more authority.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)

                        Auctus... work the palus until 
                        Gannicus joins us.

  The men casually fall to order, begin to spar with one 
  another. Oenomaus glances to Titus on the balcony, who nods 
  back encouragingly.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

  ON BARCA,

  training as a Hoplomachus (practice spear, shield, small 
  sword in belt). He chuckles as the much smaller Crixus 
  squares off with wooden sword and shield.

                        would have something the size of a 
                        man!

  The other men laugh. Crixus burns with humiliation.

  Oenomaus bites back his own humiliation. Barca grins at 
  Crixus.

                        your legs.

  Barca attacks with his spear. Crixus counters. Barca spins, 
  cracking him across the back. Crixus grunts, an angry WELT 
  appearing. Crixus retaliates. Barca deflects. He lands a 
  crushing blow to the stomach, sending Crixus to the sand.

                                        AUCTUS

  Barca and the men laugh. Oenomaus glares. Crixus vomits.

                      Is my long, hard weapon too much 
                        for you, little man?

                        But your instruction is well 
                        received.

  Crixus rises, readying himself for more pain. Barca attacks, 
  giving it to him. Auctus howls with laughter.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        Batiatus hurriedly rushes out, 
                        clearly having just woken.

                                        BATIATUS

                        expected.

  Titus indicates Gannicus, as he emerges from his cell. 
  Batiatus tightens, embarrassed.

                                        BATIATUS

                        promote Auctus or half a dozen men

  Batiatus seethes, anger and fear swirling as he revisits the

  TULLIUS

  stands at a small table. VETTIUS glares by his side, bruised

                        Come, sit.

  Titus and Batiatus take seats. Tullius and Vettius sit their 
  opposite. Batiatus keeps half a worried eye on the ever 
  looming Theron.

                        and her friend Gaia came upon good

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  A wooden shield smacks Crixus across the face, blood 
  SPURTING from his mouth. WIDEN to REVEAL Barca, doling out 
  more  instruction  to the bloodied and bruised Gaul. 
  Oenomaus watches the sparring session closely as the other 
  men train.

  CRIXUS

  attacks, but Barca deflects and SWEEPS him off his feet with 
  his practice spear. Crixus scrambles to recover, but the 
  spear is instantly at his throat. Barca laughs.

                                        BARCA
                        You are better matched against 
                        wooden men. Work the palus, Gaul.

  Barca turns away, joining a laughing Auctus. Crixus looks to 
  Oenomaus. Oenomaus frowns, motions him to comply with 
  Barca s order. Gannicus approaches, sweat dripping.

                      He shares my thoughts. The Gaul 
                        falters against spear. Perhaps 
                        advice from the champion would aid 
                        his cause...

  ON CRIXUS

  Crixus frowns, returns to attacking the palus. Gannicus 
  shakes his head with a chuckle, starts to move off. Pauses. 
  There s something about his thick-headed countryman that he 
  can t help but like.

                        You fought well against my two 
                        swords. Rid a Hoplomachus of his 
                        spear, and he is left with only 
                        one.

  Crixus nods his thanks. Gannicus grins, calls to Barca.

                        tiny man to fuck.

  Barca grins, welcoming the challenge. He hoists his spear 
  and attacks. Gannicus counters with his swords, moving with 
  devastating grace.

  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  VARUS waits with COSSUTIUS, a wealthy, handsome Roman in his 
  30s. ATTENDING SLAVES accompany. Diona waits with them. 
  Lucretia and Gaia enter, Melitta and Naevia trailing.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Varus. Apologies, we were not 
                        expecting --

                                        VARUS
                        The fault is mine, for failing to 
                        announce. Good Cossutius is on stay 
                        from Rome to celebrate the Vinalia. 
                        After I extolled the virtues of the 
                        house of Batiatus --

                                          COSSUTIUS
                                  chuckling)(
                        I demanded introduction 
                        immediately.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You honor us, but my husband tends 
                      to final preparations for 
                        tomorrow s games in town.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

                        Oh. How disappointing.

                                        GAIA
                        Yet we could remove ourselves to 
                        the balcony for proper viewing of 
                        his gladiators until his return.

  Varus and Cossutius share a look, laugh uncomfortably.

                                        VARUS
                        I fear you mistake intent. I was 
                        not regaling Cossutius with tales 
                      of your men. But of your house s 
                        more... intimate delights.

  Varus  gaze falls on Melitta. Lucretia laughs nervously.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I fear that was a... special 
                          consideration.

  Varus  smile fades.

                                        VARUS
                        Was it? Perhaps Vettius will be 
                        more accommodating then. Concerning 
                        this and my primus.

  Lucretia squirms. Gaia intercedes.

                                        GAIA
                      It would be unfortunate to come so 
                        far, and find hands empty.
                                (pointedly, to 
                                  Lucretia)
                        Would it not?

  Lucretia shifts, realizing they will lose the primus if she 
  doesn t relent.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would not have it so.

  Melitta s heart sinks.

                        Excellent! Let us prepare Gannicus

                        No. What joy is there in exploring 
                        ground already discovered?

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        None at all. I would best all 
                        presented this old goat.

  Cossutius grins at Varus. Varus laughs.

                                        VARUS
                        What do you offer?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        A gladiator of your choosing, 
                        paired with a slave yet 
                          untouched...?

  Lucretia indicates Naevia and Diona. They glance at each 
  other nervously, but with an air of excitement that they 
  have caught the eye of a rich, handsome Roman.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        Untouched?

  Cossutius  eyes crawl over them. Melitta tenses, concern 
  shifting from herself to her young charges.

                                          COSSUTIUS(cont'd)
                        A delicacy no longer present at the 
                        moment in my house.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Then it is fortunate you find 
                        yourself in ours.

  OFF Lucretia s forced smile...


  EXT. STREETS - CAPUA - DAY

  Batiatus stands outside Nestor s meat shop, seething. His 
  mood darkens as he spots SOLONIUS passing by in the crowd.

  Solonius crosses to him, his own displeasure obvious.

  Solonius nods, shooting Batiatus a worried look as he moves 
  off with Tullius, Vettius, and Theron. Batiatus turns his 
  attentions to his father, tightening with barely contained 
  anger.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Am I allowed voice now?

                                        TITUS
                        Could the gods halt the sound?

  Titus moves off. Batiatus follows him through the crowd.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                        Whatever Tullius and the boy may 
                        think, I gained the primus on merit 
                      of Gannicus  prowess.

                                        TITUS
                        Even if true, it is of no matter 
                        now. Gannicus will not appear in 
                        the games.

                                        BATIATUS
                        But Varus made personal request!

                                        TITUS
                        A necessary sacrifice, towards 
                        leveling uneven ground with 
                        Tullius. You will make apology to 
                        Varus, relaying Gannicus found 
                        injury in training. And that 
                        Vettius is amply capable of seeing 
                        the primus attended.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You give away the primus, and now 
                        ask that I tongue the fucking boy s 
                        ass?

                                        TITUS
                                  snapping)(
                        I ask nothing. This is how it will 
                        be. In return a few of our men will 
                      be paired against each other after 
                        mid-day sun.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Our men fight themselves?

                                        TITUS
                        The only plank salvaged from such 
                        wreckage.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Then we must choose the men with 
                        care, and yet give Varus proper 
                        show.

                                        TITUS
                        They have been chosen for us.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Tullius now selects my fucking men 
                      as well?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                      An unavoidable concession. Barca 
                        and Gnaeus, Auctus to face your 
                        Gaul, Crixus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus? He is yet a recruit, not a 
                        gladiator!

                        Who you failed to mention was 
                        purchased from Tullius.

                      To gain his favor.

                        And what fruits did your scheme 
                        bear? This is price due for 
                        attempting to maneuver men above 
                        your station. Be thankful it was 
                        not more costly.

  Titus moves off. Batiatus absorbs the sting of his father s 
  words. He heads after him, WIPING US TO --


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  A sweaty, dirt-caked Gnaeus stands for inspection. Cossutius 
  eyes him with Varus. Lucretia, standing with Gaia and 
  Melitta, barely conceals her distaste for the choice.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Are you certain you would not 
                        prefer the man bathed and scented?

                                          COSSUTIUS
                      He stands perfect towards his 
                        cause.

  His attention shifts to Naevia and Diona. Their excitement 
  has been considerably dimmed by the introduction of Gnaeus.

                                          COSSUTIUS(cont'd)
                        I would, however, gauge the 
                        freshness of your offerings.

  Lucretia forces a smile, nods to Naevia and Diona.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Remove your robes.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.
  CONTINUED:

  Naevia and Diona shyly comply. Gaia grins, titillated by the 
  whole unseemly affair. Varus laughs in appreciation at their 
  young bodies.

                                        VARUS
                        Did I not tell you?

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        They are of a form. But a woman s 
                        worth is not always revealed to the 
                        eyes. A man must probe deeper for 
                        true value...

  His hands drift below FRAME. Naevia and Diona wince as he 
  fingers them. Sympathetic tears well in Melitta s eyes. 
  Lucretia whispers to her, worrying over the time.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Remove yourself to the vestibule. 
                        Return if dominus and his father 
                        are seen upon the road.

                                          MELITTA
                        Yes, Domina.

  Melitta casts a worried look to Naevia and Diona as she 
  goes. Cossutius smiles, steps away to address Lucretia.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                                  re: Diona)(
                        I will have this one. She is 
                        considerably tighter.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        She is yours. To command as you 
                        please

  Cossutius  smile widens, his eyes dancing. OFF DIONA, her 
  own eyes filling with fear...

  PRE-LAP: Stifled CRIES coupled with animalistic GRUNTS...


  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  A filthy Gnaeus is on top of Diona, grinding into her. She 
  fixes her eyes on the CEILING, attempting to block the pain. 
  ADJUST to find Cossutius watching them.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        Move on top of him.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.
  CONTINUED:

  Diona obeys, straddles Gnaeus. Winces as he roughly 
  penetrates her. Cossutius circles them, his eyes studying 
  Diona s face. Absorbing her pain and revulsion. He whispers 
  to her, soft and gentle.

                                          COSSUTIUS(cont'd)
                      Do you know why I chose this man? 
                      So crudely etched? The smell of 
                        shit hot upon his breath?

  Diona shakes her head, biting back the tears. Cossutius 
  disrobes as he answers...

                                          COSSUTIUS(cont'd)
                        Because this world is filled with 
                        the grotesque. And the divine. They 
                        exist together, two sides of a 
                        coin. You cannot have one... absent 
                        threat of the other. Yet words do 
                        not convey the true nature of this. 
                      It must be experienced. It must be 
                        felt...

  He climbs up on the bed behind her while Gnaeus continues 
  fucking her.

                                          COSSUTIUS(cont'd)
                        And never forgotten.

  He enters her anally. She cries out, caught between Gnaeus 
  and Cossutius. OFF Diona s anguish...


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Gaia lounges beside Varus, flirting. Lucretia sits nearby, 
  anxiously awaiting an end to Cossutius  visit before Titus 
  returns. Naevia pours wine, barely hiding her own growing 
  anxiety for Diona.

                                        VARUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Your absence has been missed in 
                        Rome since your husband s passing. 
                        Your charms could brighten darkest 
                        night.

                                        GAIA
                        I long to return. And crest dawn 
                        upon a husband yet of this world.

  Varus considers that with a noncommittal smile.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

                        How does your dowry stand? I was 
                        under impression you were absent 
                        family of means.

  That catches Gaia by surprise. She sputters to answer. 
  Lucretia intercedes.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia is a treasure within herself.

                                        VARUS
                        One to be coveted. By a man 
                        untethered to the burden of 
                        position and appearance.

  Gaia forces a smile to hide the sting of that. Cossutius 
  appears, bringing welcome distraction.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Cossutius. You were well satisfied?

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        Praise laid upon your house has not 
                        been exaggerated.

                                        VARUS
                      It is a wonder. Such base diversion 
                        would be impossible to conceal in 
                        Rome.

  Lucretia s smile tightens.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Capua is city of many pleasures.

                                        VARUS
                        Often obscured by pressing 
                        business, which we sadly must 
                        attend.

                                        GAIA
                        You take leave? So soon?

                          A regrettable necessity. Gratitude 
                        for your hospitality. I look 
                        forward to seeing you at the games. 
                        And your man Gannicus upon the 
                        primus.

  Lucretia presents a genuine smile. Mission accomplished.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

  Lucretia and Gaia escort them out. Diona returns, absently 
  adjusting her robe. She locks eyes with Naevia. She looks 
  away, the hot flush of shame staining her cheeks. OFF 
  Naevia, her heart constricting for her friend...


  INT. BARRACKS - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNSET

  Barca and Auctus move through the barracks. A small clutch 
  of men play bones and dice in the background.

                        Crixus begins to show promise.

  Auctus smacks Barca in the face. Barca reacts with a laugh, 
  exchanges mock blows. Auctus grabs Barca roughly and kisses 
  him. Barca returns it, hands exploring, passions rising. 
  They half tumble into their cell. But Auctus pulls away, 
  eyes widening as he sees

  SEVERAL PIGEONS

  loose. And more missing from smashed open cages. OFF Auctus, 
  shock turning to rage...                                                                                    37.


  EXT. MESS HALL/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNSET

  TIGHT ON a hunk of half-cooked PIGEON as teeth strip meat 
  from bone. WIDEN TO REVEAL Ashur and Dagan savoring the meal 
  on the edge of the mess hall.

                                        AUCTUS (O.S.)
                        You fucking cunts!

  Auctus and Barca are heading for them from the ludus. Dagan 
  and Ashur rise to meet them.

                                        ASHUR
                        You soil our food! Why should we 
                        not make meal of your fucking pets 
                      --

  Auctus roars, tackling Ashur into the

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Dagan turns to help, but is set upon by Barca. Fists and 
  blood fly. Gladiators spill out into the square, SHOUTING 
    encouragement, loving the violence. Ashur spits bloods, 
  calls to Crixus for help.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Crixus --

  WHAM! Auctus is on him, raining blows. Gannicus glances at 
  Crixus standing next to him.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You do not help your friend?

                                        CRIXUS
                        This is a fight between brothers. I 
                      do not yet bear the mark, as Ashur 
                      is fond of reminding.

  Oenomaus rushes past, bellows for order.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Have you lost fucking sense?! Stand 
                        down!

  But no one s listening. Oenomaus unfurls his WHIP, rears 
  back and attempts to crack it. Fails. He growls, tossing it 
  aside and wading in to quell the tumult the old fashioned 
  way. He grabs Dagan from behind.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

  DAGAN THROWS AN ELBOW

  without looking, sending Oenomaus crashing to the sand. 
  Gannicus rushes to assist, clocking Dagan. The Gladiators 
  ROAR their approval, laughing and hooting.

                        CALM YOURSELVES!

  Gannicus halts in mid-punch as Titus appears through the 
  gates with Batiatus. The men quiet and part under Titus  
  withering glare. Lucretia, Gaia, and Melitta appear on the 
  balcony, drawn by the commotion.

                                        TITUS
                      Is this what my house has fallen 
                        to? Brother setting upon brother so 
                        far removed from the honor of the 
                        arena, where such contest holds 
                        meaning? This points to reason the 
                        gods have turned from us, stripping 
                        the primus from our hands.

  The men react, stunned and confused.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I do not fight in the games?

                        You do not.

  Gannicus  heart sinks. He glances to Melitta, guilt welling 
  in his eyes. Everything they were forced to do has been for 
  nothing. Batiatus catches the look.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  quickly)(
                        But our sacrifices do not stand 
                        unrewarded. A few of you will yet 
                        take the sand after mid-day sun.

                                        TITUS
                        And I expect those chosen to bring 
                        more honor to the House of Batiatus 
                        than you bring now to yourselves.

  OFF the proclamation...


  INT. BATHS - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Gnaeus snatches a PARCHMENT from a disappointed Rhaskos. The 
  other men crowd and jockey to get their hands on the list.

  Auctus grabs the list, growls at what he sees.

  Crixus approaches, having overheard.

                        I am to face you?

                        spear.

  Auctus slams the list into Crixus  chest as he exits with 
  Barca. Gannicus eyes him with a frown.

                                        GANNICUS
                      So you take to the arena and I do

                        I long to be of the brotherhood. To

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Oenomaus stands near the cliff, looking out across Capua as 
  he practices with his whip. Attempting to crack it. To prove 
  himself worthy. Each attempt ending in failure.

  GANNICUS

  appears behind him, heading for his cell. Oenomaus doesn t 
  notice him. Gannicus pauses. Starts to head for his friend, 
  to offer words of support. But guilt overrides. He turns 
  away and disappears into his cell, the closing door

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - MORNING

  SLAVES load a wagon with equipment. Gnaeus, Auctus, Barca 
  forearm clasp their brothers in farewell -- a ritualistic 
  send-off before the games. Ashur and Dagan, bruised from 
  yesterday s altercation, glare from the sidelines. Ashur 
  eyes Auctus and Barca, spits.

  They move off, passing a nervous Crixus as he readies 
  himself for his first fight. Crixus is in even worse shape, 
  the result of Barca s brutal training.

  Crixus glances at Auctus and Barca, his worry of facing the 
  spear deepening. Gannicus approaches Barca.

                        Fight with honor. And if the gods 
                        will it... die the same.

  Batiatus appears at the entrance.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus. A word.

  Crixus rises, crosses over.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Dominus.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  hushed)(
                        You have shown great promise. In 
                        practice. In exhibition against 
                        Gannicus. Yet this is the arena. 
                        This is where men become gods. 
                        Legions with far greater training 
                        and skill than you have fallen upon 
                        this sacred ground. Many beneath 
                        Auctus  spear.

  Crixus glances over to Auctus, who roars encouragement to 
  Barca in his fight against Gnaeus.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                        I do not believe you will be one of 
                        them. You have the blood of a 
                        champion. To rival any my father 
                        has ever heralded.

  Batiatus looks deep into his eyes.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      Do you wish to behold such miracle 
                        come to pass?

                        Then seize fucking glory. And see 
                      us both proven worthy.

  Batiatus exits. PUSH IN on Crixus as he steels himself, the 
  ROAR OF THE CROWD thrusting us back to --


  EXT. OLD ARENA - CAPUA - DAY

  Barca assaults Gnaeus with a series of bone-jarring blows. 
  Gnaeus counters, thrashing wildly with his sword.

  THE STANDS

  Batiatus returns from the chutes, joining Lucretia and Gaia. 
  Melitta and a few other SLAVES attend.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You have set Crixus to purpose?

                                        BATIATUS
                        I stoke the flame as best I can. It 
                      is now up to the man to ignite. Or 
                      be forever extinguished.

                                        GAIA
                        A pity it is not Gannicus, nor the 
                        primus. It was well earned.

  Melitta s guilt deepens. Batiatus glances up to

  THE PULVINUS,

  where Titus sits with Varus, Cossutius, Tullius, Vettius, 
  and the other elite.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                        Yet he is the one honored. While 
                        his only fucking son is left to 
                        languish.

                      Or decay into the afterlife. Either 
                        way, we will be free of him.

  Gaia smiles brightly. The crowd ROARS, drawing their 
  attention to

  THE ARENA,

  where Barca attacks Gnaeus, brutally pummeling him. He 
  blasts Gnaeus across the face with his shield, then sweeps 
  his legs with his spear.

  GNAEUS

  crashes to the ground, spitting blood. Barca rears back with 
  his spear to finish him off. Gnaeus quickly throws up the 
  MISSIO in surrender. Barca laughs, halting the deadly blow 
  to look up to the

  PULVINUS

  for instruction. Varus stands, addressing the crowd.

                                        VARUS
                      An epic showing from the House of 
                        Batiatus, certain to please the 
                        gods! In gratitude, we will be 
                        merciful, and grant life!

  The crowd EXPLODES with cheers. Vettius seethes. Titus nods 
  in deference to Varus as he sits.

                                        TITUS
                        You are overly kind.

                                        VARUS
                        Your house has been most 
                          accommodating, and should be 
                        rewarded.

  Varus shares a veiled smile with Cossutius. Titus smiles 
  politely, not sure what to make of that.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  Titus is seized by a fit of coughing.

                                        VARUS
                        Are you unwell?

                                          VETTIUS
                        Perhaps the excitement is too much 
                        for him.

                                        TITUS

                        Water.

  A Slave delivers a cup of water. Titus drinks.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        I would not have torrid throat 
                        announce your final offering.

  Titus reacts, surprised by the gesture.

                                        TITUS
                        Address the crowd? The honor is 
                        unfit a lanista. My presence in the 
                        pulvinus alone --

                                        VARUS

                      We decide what befits a lanista, 
                        Batiatus. Give introduction and let 
                      us move on.

  Titus nods, rises to address the crowd. He is obviously 
  deeply humbled and a bit uncomfortable in the spotlight. The 
  complete opposite of his son, who longs for it.

                                        TITUS
                        I stand humbled before the great 
                        people of Capua. My home and my 
                        heart, too long parted from chest. 
                      In gratitude, I present the final 
                        offering from the House of

                        its sands... I give you Crixus! 
                        Murmillo!

  Crixus steps out of the chutes. Squints against the glare. 
  Disoriented by the noise of the crowd. His eyes find 
  Batiatus in the stands. Batiatus nods. Fucking do it.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        His opponent, a warrior unmatched 
                      in skill and honor. I give you 
                        Auctus! Hoplomachus!

  The crowd ERUPTS as Auctus trots out. Crixus can t help but 
  shrink a bit under the weight of their enthusiasm for his 
  opponent. Auctus looks to Titus, raises his spear and shield 
  in respect. Titus brings his fist down.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Begin!

  Auctus attacks. Crixus defends, narrowly avoiding the deadly 
  spear. Auctus is oiled poetry with the weapon, spinning and 
  thrusting with lethal purpose. Crixus stumbles back, the 
  spear s gleaming tip opening a gash across his chest.

  BATIATUS

  grits his teeth as the crowd ROARS. He shoots a tense glance 
  to Titus up in the pulvinus, who smiles at the performance.

                                        VARUS
                        Auctus wields spear to rival Mars

                      He has been well trained.

                                          TULLIUS
                        The same cannot be said of Crixus. 
                        Perhaps he should have remained a 
                        hauler of stones.

  THE ARENA

  BLOOD RIBBONS through the air as Crixus takes another hit. 
  The crowd CHEERS -- then gasps in surprise as Crixus 
  counters, finally drawing blood. Lucretia clutches Batiatus  
  arm in excitement. Auctus grins at Crixus, then HOWLS to the 
  crowd.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  AUCTUS CHARGES,

  unleashing lightning blows, driving Crixus back. He whips 
  his spear around and slams Crixus  helmet off. Crixus 
  staggers. Auctus lunges, lands a thunderous combination. 
  Crixus crashes to the ground, his shield flying from his 
  hands.

  CRIXUS

  scrambles to retrieve it. Auctus seizes the moment and hurls 
  his spear. Crixus dives for his shield and rolls up with it 
  just as the spear hits. It drives through the wood, halting 
    a millimeter from Crixus  eye.

  AUCTUS  FACE DROPS

  as he realizes he just lost his primary weapon. Crixus 
  tosses his ruined shield aside and attacks. Auctus absorbs 
  the blows with his shield, struggling to counter with his 
  much smaller sword.

  THE CROWD ROARS

  as the men exchange bone-crushing blows. They finally SLAM 
  TOGETHER -- and freeze in a deadly embrace. The crowd GOES 
  QUIET, all eyes straining to see what has happened.

                                        AUCTUS
                                  soft)(
                        Barca has taught you well...

  Auctus grins. Blood trickles from his mouth as the CAMERA 
  CIRCLES around, REVEALING Crixus  sword protruding from 
  Auctus  back. Crixus has run him through. CAMERA COMPLETES 
  ITS CIRCLE as Crixus removes his sword. Auctus falls to his 
  knees, his eyes finding

  BARCA

  at the bars of the chute. Face twisted in anguish. Auctus  
  eyes fill with tears. Not for fear of death, but in regret 
  of parting this life absent his love. He smiles sadly as the 
  life fades from his eyes. He crumples to the sand, dead.

  THE CROWD ERUPTS

  Batiatus surges to his feet, overjoyed. Varus laughs up in 
  the pulvinus, delighted.

                                        VARUS
                        A fine showing, Batiatus! With

  His eyes find his son in the crowd. Batiatus grins up at 
  him, vindicated.

  CRIXUS

  stands over Auctus  body. He absorbs the CHEERING crowd. 
  Tears fill his eyes as he raises his arms to the heavens, 
  having achieved his own vindication.

                                        CRIXUS (V.O.)
                        ... I swear to be burned, chained, 
                        beaten, or die by the sword. In 
                        pursuit of honor in the arena.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON Crixus  FOREARM as a red-hot iron sears the Mark of 
  the Brotherhood into his flesh. REVEAL Batiatus as he 
  removes the iron, Oenomaus at his side. Gannicus, Ashur, 
  Dagan, Gnaeus, Rhaskos, and other Gladiators watch from the 
  periphery.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Welcome to the brotherhood.

  Crixus beams with pride. Batiatus looks up to

  TITUS,

  standing on the balcony outside of the office. Titus holds 
  his son s gaze for a moment then disappears inside the 
  office, giving nothing away. Batiatus frowns in 
  disappointment.

  GAIA

  eyes Crixus like a fine cut of meat further down the 
  balcony, Lucretia beside her.

                                        GAIA
                        Crixus proves himself. Perhaps even 
                      as match for Gannicus one day. In 
                        and out of the arena.

  Lucretia takes Crixus in with dawning appreciation as he is 
  loudly greeted by his new brothers. Crixus  mirth falters as 
  Barca approaches, his face unreadable. The Gladiators go 
  quiet. A tense beat.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

                        You fought well. Brother.

  Barca walks away, heartbroken. OFF Crixus, knowing his 
  victory came at a great cost to the man...


  INT. OFFICE - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Batiatus enters to find Titus at the desk, jotting notes in 
  the house ledger. Titus does not look up.

                                        TITUS
                        Your Gaul, still yet a recruit, 
                        defeated a gladiator I considered 
                        among the best of my men. It would 
                        appear I underestimated Crixus.
                                  looking up)(
                      As I did my son.

  A rare moment of praise. Batiatus beams.

                                        TITUS
                        You honor yourself. When cleared of 
                        plots and schemes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Thoughts well removed, never to 
                        return.

                                        TITUS
                        Nothing pleases more than to see 
                        reason take hold of senses.

  Titus grasps his son warmly.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        And a house righting its path.

  Just the words Batiatus wanted to hear from his father.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I will see it continued in your 
                        absence.

                                        TITUS
                        Absence?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I assume you return to Sicilia. 
                        Your health...

                                        TITUS
                        Seeing Crixus  victory stirred 
                        passions I have not felt in many 
                        years. For the blood and the sand, 
                        the roar of the crowd. It lifts 
                        spirits more than change of clime 
                        could hope to offer. No, I will 
                        stay at your side, and together we 
                        shall see the House of Batiatus 
                        rise to former glories.

  Batiatus covers his disappointment.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You remain here?

                                        TITUS
                        Until breath flees wearied flesh, 
                        calling me to the afterlife.

  Titus exits with a warm smile. OFF Batiatus, his own smile 
  fading as he realizes he is once again condemned to live in 
  the overpowering shadow of his father...

                                                                          FADE OUT.
