Black and white. Street scene. People toing and froing.
A
man rattles by.
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
WARSAW 1939
WLADYSLAV SZPILMAN plays Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor,
Posthumous. He's twenty-eight years old, elegant and
handsome.
In the booth, separated from the studio by a glass screen,
an engineer, wearing collar and tie, monitors the broadcast.
Behind him, a window to the street with strips of paper
taped on it as protection against blast.
Without warning, a bomb drops nearby, then another and
another. The whole building shudders alarmingly and the
window in the booth shatters.
The engineer and Szpilman exchange a look as a man enters
the booth and talks urgently to the Engineer, then goes.
The engineer makes a 'cut-throat' gesture, but Szpilman
shakes his head, determined to play on.
He plays, then glances at the booth. The engineer has gone,
but through the shattered window he sees fires raging.
Very near, a loud, terrifying explosion. The reverberations
cause plaster to flake and dust to trickle down over his
face.
And then a bomb explodes even closer. The glass screen
separating booth from studio implodes, showering Szpilman
with glass. He stops, frozen.
Pandemonium. Chaos. People rushing in all directions, many
carrying files, boxes, papers, shouting, calling. Some of
the men in military uniform. The bombing continuous.
Szpilman fights his way down the stairs. He has a small
cut on his forehead and is dabbing it with his handkerchief.
He has a dazed look. Halfway down the stairs, A young woman,
DOROTA, tugs at his sleeve:
DOROTA
Mr. Szpilman.
He turns, to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing
adoringly at him while they're jostled and shoved. His
eyes light up.
SZPILMAN
Hello.
DOROTA
I came specially to meet you today.
I love your playing, but what a
day to choose.
SZPILMAN
Who are you?
DOROTA
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's
sister. oh! You're bleeding.
SZPILMAN
It's nothing.
JUREK pushes in beside them and takes her arm.
JUREK
C'mon, Dorota, you can write him a
fan letter later, this isn't the
best time, c'mon.
Jurek, pulling Dorota, fights his way down the stairs.
SZPILMAN
(calling)
Jurek, why have you been hiding
her?
And he, too, is carried with the flow into the lobby. Debris
everywhere. Szpilman fights to get to the main door, when
another bomb explodes, filling the air with dust and debris,
obscuring him and everyone else.
The Szpilman family in panic: coming and going out of rooms,
packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a
trunk in a comfortable, tastefully furnished bourgeois
apartment, the living room lined with books, paintings and
boasting a boudoir grand, silver platters and candlesticks.
The family consist of MOTHER, in a state of great anxiety,
FATHER, REGINA, twenty-six, HALINA, twenty-two, and HENRYK,
twenty-four, the only one not in movement. He sits by the
radio set, ear to the speaker, trying to tune to a station.
No bombs now, just the distant sound of artillery fire.
Father, holding a silver-framed photograph, crosses to
Mother.
FATHER
What you think, should I take Uncle
Szymon's photograph?
MOTHER
Take it, don't take it, take what
you like. Can't you see I'm worried
sick?
FATHER
He'll come home, he'll be all right.
He goes into his room. She can barely control her tears
and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens
and Szpilman enters, looks round bemused by the activity.
REGINA
Mama, Wladek's home.
Mother dashes out of the kitchen.
MOTHER
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
SZPILMAN
It's a little cut, nothing.
MOTHER
I've been worried sick.
HENRYK
I told her not to worry. You had
your papers on you. If you'd been
hit by a bomb, they'd have known
where to take you.
The girls suppress smiles.
MOTHER
Henryk, don't say things like that,
God forbid, God forbid.
HALINA
(calling through a
door)
Papa, Wladek's home.
Father appears in the doorway, beaming, clutching a violin
case.
FATHER
What did I tell you?
SZPILMAN
(looking around the
room, bemused)
What are you doing?
REGINA
What's it look like we're doing?
The toing and froing continues non-stop.
SZPILMAN
(to Henryk)
They bombed us, we're off the air.
HENRYK
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
MOTHER
Pack, darling, get your things,
pack.
SZPILMAN
Where are we going?
MOTHER
Out of Warsaw.
SZPILMAN
Out of Warsaw. Where?
REGINA
You haven't heard?
SZPILMAN
Heard what?
REGINA
Haven't you seen the paper? Where's
the paper?
She starts to look. The others continue to bustle and pack.
HALINA
I used it for packing.
REGINA
(exasperated)
She used it for packing.
FATHER
The government's moved to Lublin.
HALINA
All able-bodied men must leave the
city, go across the river and set
up a new line of defence, that's
what it said.
FATHER
There's hardly anybody left in
this building, only women, the men
have gone.
SZPILMAN
And what do you think you'll do
while you're setting up a new line
of defence? Wander round lugging
your suitcases?
MOTHER
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
SZPILMAN
I'm not going anywhere.
HALINA
Good! I'm not going anywhere either!
MOTHER
Don't be ridiculous, we've got to
keep together.
SZPILMAN
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If
I'm going to die, I prefer to die
at home.
MOTHER
God forbid!
HENRYK
Sssh!
Crackles, whistles and static from the radio.
HENRYK
Ssh! I've got something, listen...
They gather round.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
... an important announcement.
News has just been received through
the BBC that Great Britain, having
had no reply...
(static)
...and therefore has declared war
on Nazi Germany...
(a collective gasp)
... next few hours... awaiting
latest news...
Henryk hits the set.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
... but France is expected to make
a similar announcement...
(static)
... Poland is no longer alone.
The Polish national anthem plays. All are still.
Father pours liqueur into glasses.
The family are seated around the dining table, having just
finished a meal. The table groans with the remains of the
dinner. Szpilman has a plaster over his cut.
HENRYK
(lighting up a
cigarette)
Mama, that was a great dinner.
SZPILMAN
It certainly was.
MOTHER
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.
The glasses are handed round.
FATHER
Here's to Great Britain and France.
They all clink glasses and drink.
FATHER
I told you. Didn't I tell you? All
will be well.
Regina is opening and closing the window, examining the
frame with her fingers. Halina is on a box, removing and
replacing books. Mother sits at one end of the table,
polishing a man's watch and chain. At the other end, Father
sits counting a small stack of notes and coins. Henryk is
deep in thought and Szpilman is fiddling with his father's
violin. The apartment has less furniture now and the silver
has gone.
FATHER
(finishing the
counting)
Five thousand and three.
MOTHER
Is that all?
FATHER
Yes, five thousand and three zlotys,
that's all we've got left.
REGINA
It's three thousand and three zlotys
too much,
(reading from
newspaper)
'Re: Further restrictions regarding
liquid assets: Jews will be allowed
to keep a maximum of two thousand
zlotys in their homes.'
MOTHER
What are we supposed to do with
the rest?
HALINA
Deposit it in a bank. Blocked
account.
HENRYK
Banks? Who'd be stupid enough to
deposit money in a German bank?
REGINA
We could hide the money here in
the window frame.
FATHER
No, no, no. I'll tell you what
we'll do. We'll use tried and tested
methods. You know what we did in
the last war? We made a hole in
the table leg and we hid the money
in there.
HENRYK
And suppose they take the table
away?
MOTHER
What d'you mean, take the table
away?
HENRYK
The Germans go into Jewish homes
and they just take what they want,
furniture, valuables, anything.
MOTHER
Do they?
FATHER
Idiot! What would they want with a
table?
All look at the table: it's covered in stains and the veneer
is coming away at one end. A table like this?
He pokes his finger under the veneer. It snaps, revealing
bare wood beneath.
MOTHER
What on earth are you doing?
HALINA
There's a good place under the
cupboard.
HENRYK
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
SZPILMAN
That makes a change.
HENRYK
You know what we do? We use
psychology.
SZPILMAN
We use what?
HENRYK
We leave the money and the watch
on the table. And we cover it like
this.
(covers it with the
newspaper)
In full view. The Germans will
search high and low, I promise
you, they'll never notice it.
SZPILMAN
Of course they'll notice it. But
look--
(lifts the violin
fingerboard.)
This is a good place for something.
HENRYK
A good place for what?
(to the others')
He's insane!
SZPILMAN
Just shut up.
FATHER
(overlapping)
My violin?
They all talk at once.
REGINA
Quiet! Quiet! Order, please, order!
HALINA
She's a lawyer, she likes order.
REGINA
Listen, just listen. Let's come to
an agreement. We jam the money in
the window frame. The watch we
hide under the cupboard. And the
chain we put in the violin.
A brief silence.
FATHER
Will I still be able to play?
SZPILMAN
Let's find out.
They start to hide the things.
Szpilman is on the public telephone, waiting for someone
to answer his call. Then:
SZPILMAN
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
JUREK
(filtered)
Wladek! How are you?
SZPILMAN
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and
you?
JUREK
(filtered)
Fine, we're fine in the
circumstances. But I can guess
what you've called about. There's
nothing we can do; they won't reopen
the station--
SZPILMAN
(trying to interrupt)
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
JUREK
(filtered)
...not even music, nothing, no
radios for the Poles. But I'm sure
you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist
like you.
SZPILMAN
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't
be offended, I didn't call to
discuss my future career.
The family are gathered around the table, listening to
Father reading from the newspaper.
The apartment has even less furniture now. The paintings
are gone.
FATHER
(reading)
'Re: emblems for Jews in the Warsaw
District. I hereby order that all
Jews in the Warsaw District will
wear visible emblems when out of
doors. This decree will come into
force on the 1st December 1939 and
applies to all Jews over twelve
years of age. The emblem will
be worn on the right sleeve and
will represent a blue Star of David
on a white background. The
background must be sufficiently
large for the Star to measure eight
centimetres from point to point.
The width of the arms of the Star
(reading)
must be one centimetre. Jews who
do not respect this decree will be
severely punished. Governor of
Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer.'
Silence. Then:
HENRYK
I won't wear it.
REGINA
won't wear it. I'm not going to be
branded.
SZPILMAN
(grabbing the
newspaper)
Let me see this.
FATHER
Doesn't it say we have to provide
these armbands ourselves? Where
will we get them?
HENRYK
We're not going to get them. We're
not going to wear them!
Silence, each locked in their own thoughts.
Szpilman composing at the piano. He plays, makes adjustments
with a pencil to the manuscript, plays again. The flat is
almost bare. Halina, enters with a newspaper.
HALINA
Have you seen this?
SZPILMAN
(irritated)
What, I'm working, what?
She hands him the paper. He looks at it. His expression
darkens.
INSERT:
the newspaper. A map of the proposed Jewish area: two
distinct districts, one large, one smaller.
SZPILMAN'S VOICE
What is it?
HALINA'S VOICE
That's where they're going to put
us.
SZPILMAN'S VOICE
What d'you mean, put us?
THE APARTMENT:
She looks over his shoulder and reads. As she does so, the
door of Henryk's room opens and he stands leaning in the
doorway, watching, as if amused.
HALINA
'By order of the Governor of the
Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer,
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish District in Warsaw.
There will be created a Jewish
District in which all Jews living
in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will
have to reside."
And look here:
'Jews living outside of the
prescribed area will have to move
to the Jewish district by 31st of
October 1940.'
Szpilman gazes at the map, horrified.
SZPILMAN
But...they won't get all of us...
we'll...it's too small...there's
four hundred thousand of us in
Warsaw!
HENRYK
No. Three hundred and sixty
thousand, so it'll be easy.
He laughs but they're disturbed by a sound from another
room, the sound of crying. They look at each other puzzled,
then Halina opens a door and looks in. Szpilman and Henryk
join her.
BEDROOM:
Father is asleep but Mother is sitting on the bed, holding
a purse, crying. Halina sits beside her, puts an arm round
her.
HALINA
Mama, what is it?
Mother opens the purse to reveal a crumpled note.
MOTHER
Twenty zlotys. That's all we've
got left. What can I buy with twenty
zlotys?
(breaking down)
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.
She weeps. Halina tries to comfort her. Szpilman and Henryk
watch.
Hands on the piano keyboard. Podgy, hairy hands with dirty
nails. They play an octave, harsh, toneless, with straight
fingers.
The hands belong to Mr Lipa, a dealer, early fifties. He
sits at the piano, now examining the lacquer. Regina stands
in the bow, watching him. Henryk is at the table, also
watching intently.
Szpilman sits apart, aloof, his back to the piano and to
Mr Lipa.
MR LIPA
That's the price. That's what I'm
offering. And my advice is to
accept. You won't get more from
anyone else.
REGINA
But...but it's a Steinway, Mr
Lipa...
MR LIPA
Two thousand. My advice is to take
it. What you going to do when you're
hungry? Eat the piano?
Henryk suddenly makes a lunge for him, grabs hold of him,
a rough struggle takes place and during it Mother and Father
appear at their bedroom door to watch, appalled.
HENRYK
Get out! You're a thieving bastard,
we don't want your money, get out!
We'd rather give it away! Get out!
Regina tries physically to restrain him.
MR LIPA
(overlapping, warding
off Henryk)
Hey! Hey! What's the matter with
you? Haven't you eaten today, what
you suffering from? Hey!
REGINA
(overlapping)
Henryk, stop it, leave him alone.
MR LIPA
(recovering, catching
his breath,
overlapping)
You people are crazy! I'm doing
you a favour, two thousand, and
I'm paying for the removal, I'm
not even charging for the removal.
Henryk subsides, glowering at him.
MR LIPA
You haven't eaten today, you're
crazy...
Suddenly:
SZPILMAN
(turning to them,
severe)
Take it.
Two rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen.
The Szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence.
Father pauses for a moment to take stock.
FATHER
To tell you the truth, I thought
it would be worse.
SZPILMAN
How will we sleep?
MOTHER
I'll sleep with the girls in the
kitchen. You, Henrykc and Papa in
here.
HALINA
(at a window)
Look! Come and look!
They all go to the window and look out.
Their POV - the street.
Further along, men are building a wall across the street.
Szpilman and Henryk enter and stop. Uneasy.
MOTHER
Good, they're here. Yitzchak
Heller's been waiting for you,
Henryk.
Seated at the table with Mother and Father is a uniformed
young man, YITZCHAK HELLER, unusual appearance, a man with
red hair and a Hitler moustache.
Heller remains seated, just nods at the brothers.
HENRYK
What's this about?
MOTHER
Sit down, have tea, I'll start
lunch when the girls get back.
Henryk and Szpilman sit. They eye Heller suspiciously.
HENRYK
So, what are you doing here?
FATHER
He brought cakes.
Awkward silence.
FATHER
His father's back in the jewellery
business and doing well, isn't
that so, Yitzchak? Amazing.
Jewellery.
He runs dry. Another awkward silence. Then:
HELLER
We're recruiting.
HENRYK
Who's recruiting?
HELLER
Don't be clever with me, Henryk.
I've come here as a friend. They're
bringing Jews in from all over the
country. Soon there'll be half a
million people in the ghetto. We
need more Jewish police...
HENRYK
(sarcastic)
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean
you want me to wear a cap like
yours, beat up Jews with my
truncheon and catch the Gestapo
spirit. I see!
HELLER
(eyes narrowed,
dangerous)
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
HENRYK
But why me? I thought you only
recruited boys with rich fathers.
Look at my father, look at us, I
mean...
HELLER
(interrupting,
flaring)
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's
why I'm here. Your whole family
can have a better life. You want
to go on struggling for survival,
selling books on the street?
HENRYK
(a smile)
Yes, please.
HELLER
(to Szpilman)
I'm doing you people a favour. And
what about you, Wladek? You're a
great pianist. And we've got an
excellent police jazz band. They'd
welcome you with open arms. Join
us. You've got no work...
SZPILMAN
Thank you. But I've got work.
Silence. Heller rises angrily.
On a platform, Szpilman plays at a piano, but he can hardly
be heard above the noise of chatter and laughter.
The large cafe is crowded, hot and smoke-filled. Well-heeled
customers, pimps, whores, businessmen sit at little tables,
eating, talking, laughing, almost drowning the piano music.
Some dance.
A couple of tables back from the piano, a customer is doing
business with a friend. The customer has a small stack of
coins, some of them twenty-dollar gold pieces. He folds
back the tablecloth to reveal a marble surface beneath. He
drops a coin on the marble and listens but the noise is
too loud. He sees the cafe owner, BENEK, fiftyish, and
makes gestures, pointing at Szpilman. Benek pushes his way
through to Szpilman.
BENEK
(whispering into
Szpilman's ear)
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you
to stop.
SZPILMAN
(continuing to play)
Who wants me to stop?
Benek points to the customer, who makes an imploring gesture
to Szpilman. Szpilman stops playing.
The friend watches the customer intently as he drops the
coins one by one onto the marble. He drops them, puts his
ear close and listens.
Two or three he discards, but he
smiles when coins make a pure tone, and he keeps them.
Szpilman exchanges looks with a pretty whore, who makes
eyes at him.
Satisfied, the customer beams, nods his thanks to Szpilman,
who resumes his piano playing.
The noise of a mimeograph machine. A huge, CHEERFUL MAN
with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth.
JEHUDA
I always say look on the bright
side. You're in the small ghetto,
intellectuals, professional people,
you're better off than us. Here,
in the large ghetto, it's a
cesspool. But you, you're living
in Monte Carlo. You could say you're
privileged and that, of course,
goes against my principles.
Nevertheless...
He laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers. His
room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and
stuff. Dark, shabby, run-down.
One of his sons, SYMCHE, is operating the mimeograph
machine. The other, DOLEK, is sorting the sheets as they
come off the roller.
MRS. ZYSKIND, holding a toddler, is
cooking at a small stove.
JEHUDA finds what he's been looking for, a newspaper made
up of a few sheets.
JEHUDA
Ah, here. Today's news from the
other side.
SZPILMAN
You're amazing, Jehuda.
JEHUDA
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers
everywhere. They bring me news and
food. We care about our fellow
human beings. Workers of the world
unite.
SZPILMAN
So, what's the news?
JEHUDA
(scanning the paper)
The Germans are advancing on
Kharkhov.
SZPILMAN
I don't know why I come here every
evening, it's always such bad news.
JEHUDA
Bad news, you crazy? You have no
world view, Wladek, that's your
trouble. The news couldn't be
better. The moment Hitler invaded
Russia, I knew we'd be all right.
Remember Napoleon. Same business.
The Germans will freeze to death,
please God.
He beams. Szpilman leans over, takes a sheet from the
mimeograph.
SZPILMAN
Jehuda, give me something to do.
JEHUDA
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep
people's spirits up. You do enough.
SZPILMAN
But I want to help, I want to.
JEHUDA
You're too well known, Wladek. And
you know what? You musicians don't
make good conspirators. You're
too...too musical.
He loves this, laughs, coughs.
SZPILMAN
There are notices going up. The
city's to be cleansed of
undesirables.
JEHUDA
There are always notices going up.
A distinctive knock on the door. Szpilman tenses but Jehuda
beams. To one of his boys: Symche - The boy opens the door
to admit a short, neat man, MAJOREK.
MAJOREK
Hello, Symche, Dolek, Mrs Zyskind,
Jehuda. Working hard?
He stops, seeing Szpilman.
JEHUDA
Majorek, this is the greatest
pianist in Poland, maybe in the
whole world. Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Meet Majorek.
MAJOREK
(shakes Szpilman's
hand)
I know your name. I've never heard
you play.
JEHUDA
Majorek used to be in the army.
Brilliant man. He's got a mind
like a searchlight. The only thing
I've got against him is he's not a
socialist.
(he looks out of
the window.)
You'd better go now, Wladek. It's
nearly curfew.
(he hands over
pamphlets to
Majorek.)
You see these, Wladek?
You know
how many copies we print of our
newspaper?
Szpilman shrugs.
JEHUDA
Five hundred. You know how many
people on average read one copy?
Twenty.
That makes ten thousand
readers. These will start the
uprising. Majorek hides them in
his underpants. And leaves them in
toilets.
SZPILMAN
Toilets?
MAJOREK
As many toilets as I can find.
Germans never go into Jewish
toilets. They're too clean for
them.
Jehuda loves this too, but his laugh makes him cough
appallingly.
Summer. The windows are open and the sounds of the ghetto
can be heard in the background. The family sit round the
small table as Mother comes with a saucepan of soup and
starts to serve.
MOTHER
And, please, tonight, for once, I
don't want anything bad talked
about. Let's enjoy our meal.
HENRYK
Okay, then I'll tell you something
funny. You know who I mean by Dr.
Raszeja.
REGINA
The surgeon?
HENRYK
The surgeon. Well, for some reason,
don't ask me why, the Germans
allowed him into the ghetto to
perform an operation...
HALINA
On a Jew? They allowed a Pole to
come in to operate on a Jew?
HENRYK
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, he puts the patient to
sleep and starts the operation.
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in, shoot the
patient lying on the table, and
then shoot Dr. Raszeja and everybody
else who was there. Isn't that a
laugh? The patient didn't feel a
thing, he was anaesthetised -
He laughs. No one else does.
MOTHER
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
HENRYK
What's the matter with you all?
Have you lost your sense of humour?
SZPILMAN
It's not funny.
HENRYK
Well, you know what's funny? You're
funny with that ridiculous tie.
SZPILMAN
What are you talking about, my
tie? What's my tie got to do with
anything? I need the tie for my
work.
MOTHER
Boys, boys...
HENRYK
Your work, yes, playing the piano
for all the parasites in the ghetto,
they don't give a damn about
people's sufferings, they don't
even notice what's going on around
them!
FATHER
I blame the Americans.
The others look at him.
SZPILMAN
For what? For my tie?
FATHER
American Jews, and there's lots of
them, what have they done for us?
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying, haven't got
a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers
over there should be persuading
America to declare war on Germany!
Suddenly, there's a roar of engines and a screech of brakes.
Slamming of doors.
The family rush to the windows.
A Gestapo vehicle has entered the street and screeched to
a halt.
Helmeted, jackbooted SS MEN, led by an NCO, pour
out of the vehicle.
The Szpilmans gather at their open window to watch. Regina
turns off the lights before joining them. They are all
terrified. Their half-eaten meal still on the table behind
them.
POV - from Szpilman apartment: the building opposite.
The SS men pouring into the building opposite. Sound of
the jackboots on stairs. Lights go on floor by floor.
In an apartment directly opposite, a businessman, his wife,
three young people and an old man in a wheelchair sit at
their dining table. The SS men burst in, machine pistols
at the ready. The family is frozen with horror, remain
seated.
The NCO scans their faces.
NCO
(in a towering rage)
Stand up!
The family rise to their feet fast, except for the old man
in the wheelchair. The NCO bears down on him.
NCO
Stand up!
The old man in the wheelchair grips the arms of the chair
and tries desperately to stand. But he can't. Without
warning, the SS men seize the chair with the old man in
it, carry him out on to the balcony.
THE SZPILMANS:
Mother SCREAMS, Father shrinks back, Halina comforts him
and Regina comforts Mother.
Szpilman's and Henryk 's POV - the apartment opposite:
The SS men throw the old man in his wheelchair over the
balcony. He seems to hang in the air for a second then
drops out of the chair and out of sight. But there's a
terrible thud as his body hits the pavement and a clatter
as the wheelchair follows him.
THE SZPILMANS:
Mother sobbing. The others, still horrified.
REGINA
(softly, to Mother)
Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake, be
quiet!
Then sound of shots, slamming doors, screams, shouts.
Szpilman and Henryk hurry to another window so that they
can see what's going on.
Their POV from second window building opposite and street:
SS Men herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building
opposite.
People watching from the windows but trying not to be seen.
The headlights of the SS vehicle are switched on and the
SS Men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam.
A GERMAN VOICE
Run!
Run!
The prisoners start to run.
The SS men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the
vehicle. People in the building opposite begin to SCREAM.
The prisoners are being shot down. They are lifted into
the air by the bullets, turn somersaults, fall dead.
One man escapes by running back in the opposite direction,
out of the beam of light and is lost to sight for a moment.
The escaping man, a silhouette, out of the light, runs
with all his strength, putting distance between himself
and the SS. He starts to scale a wall. He looks as though
he's getting away.
But there's a floodlight on the SS vehicle. It flares into
light, swivels and finds the man. A volley of shots.
The man drops from the wall, dead. The SS men get into the
vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies.
THE SZPILMANS:
Szpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent, shocked.
The only sounds, the weeping of the people opposite and,
nearer, Mother crying softly.
Szpilman, as if in another world, playing the piano. The
cafe is full of customers but the atmosphere is much more
subdued than previously, the mood is sombre.
Szpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing, across the heads
of the customers, Halina, in a state of great anxiety,
beckoning urgently.
Szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps
off the platform, threads his way through to Halina. She's
shivering, almost unable to speak.
SZPILMAN
What's happened?
HALINA
(almost incoherent)
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've
got to do something, oh my God!
SZPILMAN
(shaking her)
Calm down, what, what is it?
HALINA
They're hunting people on the
streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Henryk, finishing a bowl of soup and a piece of bread,
sits at a worktop with Szpilman and Benek. The kitchen is
small and busy with cooks, waiters, washers-up.
SZPILMAN
What's that mean, no employment
certificate?
HENRYK
You have to have an employment
certificate to work for one of the
German firms in the ghetto,
otherwise...
SZPILMAN
Otherwise what?
HENRYK
You'll be deported.
BENEK
So the rumours were true...
HENRYK
They're going to resettle us. Send
us to labour camps. In the east.
And they're closing the small
ghetto.
Silence.
The name 'Samuel Szpilman' being written on a certificate.
The clatter of sewing machines.
SCHULTZ, a fat, sweaty German is filling out the form at
his desk. Majorek beside him, standing, chatting to him
and having a quiet laugh. In the doorway, Szpilman and
Father.
The small office is on an upper level with a window looking
down on the factory floor where Jewish men and women are
hard at work on sewing machines making the terrible clatter.
Schultz stamps the certificate, hands it to Majorek, who
gives it to Father.
FATHER
(doffing his hat)
Thank you.
SCHULTZ
(beaming, German
accent)
My pleasure. It won't help you
anyway.
A truck backing up. The tail-gate is opened to reveal a
huge load of furniture, linen, clothing, mirrors, carpets,
bedclothes. Three Jews inside the van start to unload the
stuff, dumping it in the yard.
Other Jews stand ready to start sorting the load, among
them the Szpilman family. Shupos and Jewish policemen
supervise.
Each has their allotted task: Szpilman and Henryk sort out
carpets, Father mirrors, Regina linen, Halina and Mother,
clothing.
The sounds of trains not far off.
They carry the stuff into the warehouse.
Szpilman and the others bring their piles of things into
the warehouse, which is crammed with similar objects, an
Aladdin's cave.
The activity continuous.
semi-darkness. A large room with an improvised partition
of blankets to separate the men from the women. Three-tiered
bunks.
On the men's side, Father is on the upper bunk, Henryk on
the lower. Szpilman, stripping down to his underwear, is
preparing to climb into the middle bunk.
FATHER
At least we've got work in the
ghetto. At least we're still
together.
Szpilman nods, climbs into his bunk, settles down. Somewhere
near, the sound of a train.
Then a volley of shots, German voices shouting.
Szpilman slips off his bunk, hurries to the door, opens it
and comes face to face with a German NCO and soldiers.
NCO
Out! Assemble in the yard!
SZPILMAN
We're employed here, we've got
certificates -
The NCO cracks Szpilman across the face, turns and goes.
Szpilman retreats into the room, his nose bleeding. The
women are watching from behind the blankets, but Mother
hurries towards Szpilman. She wipes his nose.
Shots, shouts, a scream.
The partition has been pulled aside. People, including the
Szpilmans, are dressing or dressed, packing up their
belongings.
SZPILMAN
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought
the certificates would save us
all.
MOTHER
Stop it, Wladek.
REGINA
Let's just hope that Henryk and
Halina will be better off -
Sounds of shots, screams, shouts, a piercing whistle.
Chaos. Papers, pamphlets strewn all over the place. The
mimeograph smashed.
Szpilman enters, stands, surveying the devastation.
Distant sounds of shooting, shouts, cries.
He gathers up some papers in a pile, takes off his jacket
and covers the pile of papers, making a pillow. He lies
down on the floor.
He stares into the darkness, expressionless, empty.
A shambles. Szpilman wanders through the upturned tables,
broken chairs. Stops, looks about. Nothing.
Distant shots, automatic fire.
He turns and makes for the door. Then he hears an urgent
hiss. He turns sharply and tries to find the source of it.
He hears the hiss again.
Now he sees, hiding under the platform, Benek, beckoning
to him. Szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until
he's beside him. Benek replaces a plank and they are hidden
from view.
Thin slivers of light illuminate the two men on their backs
in the cramped space.
BENEK
(looking at him,
mystified)
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
SZPILMAN
It's like this... I...we...all of
them.
He can't continue. Benek nods.
BENEK
Perhaps they're lucky. The quicker
the better.
(Brief pause.)
It isn't over yet. We'll stay here
for a couple of days. Until things
die down.
(Another pause)
I've bribed a policeman. He'll
come when it's over.
Winter. Rain. Cold. The store, a wooden hut, contains wood,
nails, tools, paint, metal brackets.
Szpilman sits at a table, where a line of workers has
formed. Szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools
each worker takes out on the site.
A worker puts his head into the store.
WORKER
(hissing)
Trouble.
A GERMAN VOICE
Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews!
Poles go on working! Only the Jews!
Poles go on working!
The Jewish workers start to assemble on the site in
haphazard ranks as an SS Captain strides in.
The SS Captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on to
scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the
workers.
SS CAPTAIN
(in English)
I have important and good news for
you. There are rumours circulating
that resettlement measures are
again going to be taken.
A glance between Szpilman and Majorek.
SS CAPTAIN
(in English)
I want to assure you personally
that no such measures will be taken
now or in the future. Posters will
be going up also to this effect.
As proof of our good will, we want
you to select a delegate, who will
be permitted to go into town once
a day to buy, on each worker's
behalf, five kilos of potatoes and
one loaf of bread, which you will
be allowed to take back into the
ghetto. Now, why would we do that
j if we meant to resettle you?
He beams; no reaction from the workers.
SS CAPTAIN
(in English)
You can do good business on what
you don't eat. Isn't that what you
Jews are best at? Making 'geld'?
Rubs thumb and forefinger and leers; still no reaction;
his smile vanishes.
SS CAPTAIN
(in English)
Carry on.
STORES - DAY
Szpilman has unpacked the sacks and laid them in the corner.
He kneels before the smallest of the sacks and unties the
string around its neck.
He puts his hand inside the sack and potatoes tumble out.
He reaches to the bottom and is still as his hand finds
something. Carefully, he removes a pistol, then another,
both wrapped in oil cloths. He hides them under his jacket.
STORES AND BUILDING SITE - NIGHT
Szpilman and a Jewish worker distribute the potatoes to
the other Jewish workers lined up with empty containers of
various kinds. There are scales on the table, and they
weigh out five kilos of potatoes, pour them into the men's
containers and drop in a loaf of bread.
A small room with several three-tiered bunk beds. The sound
of men's heavy breathing and snoring.
Szpilman lies awake, staring at the ceiling. He reaches
inside his jacket, finds a scrap of paper and a pencil,
writes something.
He slips off his bunk and crosses to another set of bunks,
crouches down at the bottom one, where Majorek sleeps.
SZPILMAN
(whispered)
Majorek!
Majorek is instantly awake.
SZPILMAN
Have a favour to ask. I want to
get out of here.
MAJOREK
It's easy to get out, it's how you
survive on the other side that's
hard.
SZPILMAN
I know. But last summer, I worked
for a day in Zelazna Brama Square.
I saw someone I knew. A singer.
Her husband's an actor. They're
old friends. (
(He holds out the "
piece of paper.)
I've written their names down. And
their address. If they're still
there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you
go into the town every day. Would
you try and make contact? Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here?
Majorek takes the paper but says nothing. He turns over
and goes back to sleep. Szpilman returns to his bunk.
Szpilman has unloaded the sacks of potatoes into the corner
and is kneeling, about to untie the string on the smallest
sack. A sound alerts him. He looks round.
An SS Lieutenant has entered the stores, sucking his finger,
which is bleeding.
SS LIEUTENANT
Any fucking plaster?
Szpilman immediately hurries to a cupboard, finds a First
Aid tin, removes a plaster and gives it to the SS
Lieutenant.
SS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE
(while he applies
the plaster to his
finger)
What were you up to?
Nothing from Szpilman.
SS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE
What the fuck are those?
He indicates the sacks with his chin.
SZPILMAN
(in German)
We're allowed to take food into
the ghetto. Five kilos of potatoes
and a...
The SS Lieutenant walks over to the sacks and kicks the
smallest one.
SS LIEUTENANT
Open it.
SZPILMAN
It's only potatoes and bread.
SS LIEUTENANT
Fuck that, you're lying, I can
smell it. Open it.
Szpilman tries to untie the string, but he's too terrified
and can't manage it. The SS Lieutenant shoves him out of
the way, then takes from his belt a dagger and cuts the
string.
The SS Lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of
long yellow beans. He glowers at Szpilman, reaches in again,
produces a handful of oatmeal.
SS LIEUTENANT
You're all the same. Give a Jew a
little finger, he takes the whole
hand.
He throws the oatmeal in Szpilman's face.
SS LIEUTENANT
You lie to me again and I'll shoot
you personally.
He kicks Szpilman viciously and marches away. Szpilman
catches his breath, then quickly reaches into the bottom
of the sack and finds a pistol and ammunition. He hides
them under his clothes.
The Jewish workers lined up to get their potatoes and bread.
Szpilman and two others weigh the potatoes.
GERMAN VOICES
Get on with it and fall in! Fall
in!
Calmly, Szpilman leaves the table with the scales, walks
past Majorek and the others, who, having got their potatoes,
are assembling in a column, preparing to march back into
the ghetto. The Polish workers have packed up their tools
and are talking among themselves, also about to leave the
site but in a casual way.
The SS guards shout orders for the Jewish column to move
off. Szpilman seems as if he's going to join them, but at
the last moment turns and falls in with the Polish workers,
beside Barczak, who just glances at him then moves so that
Szpilman is in the middle of the group.
Szpilman slips off his armband, stuffs it into his pocket.
The group walk into the darkness.
Janina waits as Szpilman closes the front door, then starts
up the stairs. Szpilman follows. She stops, turns to him,
smiles, kisses him on the cheek, then continues up the
stairs.
ANDRZEJ BOGUCKI, a handsome man, fortyish, tries to conceal
his sense of shock at seeing Szpilman He holds out his
hand and Szpilman shakes it.
Szpilman looks around the nicely furnished, large apartment.
He looks at Bogucki and Janina. Tears well up in his eyes.
He fights it hard, not to cry. So does Janina.
BOGUCKI
We haven't much time.
Szpilman lies in a steaming bath, eyes closed, as though
he's in a trance.
A gentle knock on the door and Bogucki slips in with some
clothes. He gazes at Szpilman, whose eyes remain closed.
BOGUCKI
You must hurry.
Bogucki holds up a towel. Szpilman lifts himself out of
the bath and dries himself.
BOGUCKI
We're going to have to keep moving
you. The Germans are hunting down
indiscriminately now. Jews, non-
Jews, anybody, everybody.
(handing him the
clothes')
See if these fit. And, Wladek,
you'd better shave. Use my razor.
In the cabinet.
The ceramic stove. Szpilman's ghetto clothes, torn into
strips, are being stuffed into it and burned. Janina shoves
the strips of clothes into the stove. Szpilman, now wearing
Bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn
while he spoons hot soup into his mouth.
SZPILMAN
Thank you, I don't.
BOGUCKI
You'll be looked after by Mr
Gebczynski. He's on the other side
of town. You'll stay there tonight.
Then we'll find you somewhere else.
Janina adds the last strip of clothing.
JANINA
I'll bring you food.
BOGUCKI
Let's go.
GEBCZNYSKI shakes hands with Szpilman, ushers him in and
then pulls down the shutter.
Gebczynski's store is for sanitary furnishings and supplies:
lavatories, basins, baths, taps etc.
GEBCZYNSKI
I'll show you where you're going
to sleep.
He leads the way and as he goes he picks up a cushion from
a chair and a blanket. Szpilman follows.
STAIRS TO BASEMENT:
Gebczynski leads Szpilman down the stairs.
BASEMENT STORE ROOM:
Dark, shadowy. Shelves with taps, washers, pipes. Gebczynski
leads the may to a particular set of shelves. He puts aside
the cushion and blanket, then starts to push at the shelves.
Szpilman, although puzzled, helps. Slowly, the shelves
move to reveal a secret compartment.
GEBCZYNSKI
It's not going to be very
comfortable.
SZPILMAN
I'll be fine.
GEBCZYNSKI
You'll have to stay here until
tomorrow afternoon.
He helps Szpilman into the compartment.
GEBCZYNSKI
We've got a flat for you. Near the
ghetto wall. But it's safe.
He hands over the cushion and the blanket to Szpilman;
then, putting his back to the shelves and his feet against
the wall, he pushes the shelves back into place so that
Szpilman is now hidden.
In the cramped space, Szpilman is not quite able to stretch
full out. With difficulty, he puts the cushion behind his
head, starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops,
seeing something.
In niches, neatly stacked: rifles, pistols, grenades,
ammunition
Szpilman stares, expressionless.
Gebczynski and Szpilman apprehensive, push through the
rear section, packed with Poles, seated and standing, until
they reach a chain and a sign:
GERMANS ONLY
In the German section, only three or four passengers. Some
read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the
windows, but never looking at the Poles.
Szpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible. The
tram rumbles on its way.
Gebczynski and Szpilman come up the stairs to the landing
and to a door. Gebczynski unlocks the door and they go in.
A charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable
divan. Gebczynski leads the way in. Szpilman glances around,
goes to the window, looks out.
SZPILMAN'S POV:
He can see a section of ghetto wall below. Beyond it, inside
the ghetto, a narrow street leading to deserted buildings.
Gebczynski comes up behind him.
GEBCZYNSKI
Must feel better this side of the
wall.
SZPILMAN
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not
sure which side of the wall I'm
on.
GEBCZYNSKI
Here.
He leads Szpilman to the small kitchen.
Gebczynski opens a cupboard to reveal potatoes, bread.
GEBCZYNSKI
I'll come again. And Janina Bogucki
will visit twice a week. Bring
more food. See how you are.
He closes the cupboard.
THE MAIN ROOM.
Gebczynski makes for the front door, stops.
GEBCZYNSKI
Yes, now, this is very important.
In case of emergency, I mean
emergency, go to this address.
He hands over a scrap of paper, shakes Szpilman's hand and
goes quickly.
Alone, Szpilman stands, lost for a moment. Then, he takes
off his shoe and stuffs the scrap of paper into it. While
he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed.
He goes to it, slips off his other shoe and lies down,
testing the divan's springiness with his whole body.
He smiles beatifically. He shuts his eyes and is instantly
asleep.
Szpilman still fast asleep. Voices wake him. He opens his
eyes. He's not certain where he is for a moment.
He hears the voices again, coming from the adjoining flat.
Intrigued, he rises, goes closer to the watt, puts his ear
against it, listens. After a brief silence:
KITTEN'S VOICE
(angry)
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you
forgot?
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I
forgot, that's what I mean.
KITTEN'S VOICE
You know what? You treat me like
dirt!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
I treat you like dirt because you
are dirt.
KITTEN'S VOICE
Pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
Cow!
KITTEN'S VOICE
Pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
Bitch!
KITTEN'S VOICE
Dirty pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
You're a dirty pig!
KITTEN'S VOICE
Takes one to know one! Pig!
Silence.
Szpilman is enjoying himself.
Then the sound of a piano being played with great feeling
but a lot of wrong notes.
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
You play like an angel, Kitten.
The piano continues for a moment, but suddenly stops:
KITTEN'S VOICE
If I play like an angel, why don't
you listen?
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
I was listening, Kitten.
KITTEN'S VOICE
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
A door slams.
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
(wheedling)
Kitten, let me in.
Silence.
Szpilman smiles but then hears the sound of rifle
shots and a huge explosion.
He crosses quickly to the window, looks out.
SZPILMAN'S POV - THE GHETTO.
Deserted. Stillness. Silence. From the ghetto smoke drifting
slowly.
1ST APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
Szpilman asleep on the divan. The roar of motor car and
motorcycle engines. Sporadic firing.
He wakes, rushes to the window.
SZPILMAN'S POV:
A German personnel carrier, an open car carrying officers,
and a motorcycle and sidecar roar down the narrow street
below towards the buildings at the far end. German soldiers
follow behind on the trot, pulling a field gun.
Unseen marksmen fire down on the Germans from the buildings.
As the German soldiers dismount from their vehicles one of
them is hit and falls. The others rush for cover.
1ST APARTMENT - LATER - DAY
Szpilman at the window, watching, his mood downcast.
The noise of a key in the door.
He turns to see the door of the flat open. Janina enters
with a parcel of food. She kisses Szpilman on the cheek.
JANINA
wanted to come earlier but...
She hands him the parcel.
SZPILMAN
Thank you.
He goes into the small kitchen and unpacks the contents
while Janina gazes out of the window.
JANINA
No one thought they'd hold out so
long.
SZPILMAN
should never have come out. I
should've stayed there, fought
with them.
JANINA
(turning to him)
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.
Just be proud it happened. My God,
did they put up a fight.
SZPILMAN
Yes, so did the Germans.
JANINA
They're in shock. They didn't expect
it. Nobody expected it. Jews
fighting back? Who'd have thought?
SZPILMAN
Yes, but what good did it do?
JANINA
(passionate)
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised
at you. They died with
dignity,
that's what good it did. And you
know something else?
Now the Poles
will rise. We're ready. We'll fight,
too. You'll see.
she turns to look again out of the window.
1ST APARTMENT - DAY
Snow. Ice on the windows.
The sound of the key in the door.
Szpilman turns as the door opens and Gebczynski enters,
distraught. Whispered, at speed:
GEBCZYNSKI
Get your things together, you have
to leave!
SZPILMAN
What's happened?
Gebczynski takes out a cigarette and lights it. While he
does so:
GEBCZYNSKI
I'm on the run!
SZPILMAN
What's happened?
GEBCZYNSKI
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.
They're bound to find out about
this place, too - you must get
away at once.
SZPILMAN
Where do you want me to go?
Look
at me. No, no, I'm not leaving.
Can't I take my chances here?
GEBCZYNSKI
That's your decision.
(Stubs out cigarette.)
But when they storm the flat, throw
yourself out of die window - don't
let them get you alive. I have
poison on me, they won't get me
alive either!
And he goes. Szpilman listens to his footsteps clattering
down the stairs.
He sees the cigarette stub, takes it, lights it, coughs,
smokes awkwardly.
Later:
Szpilman hears a car engine and the screech of brakes. He
tenses. German voices shouting and their heavy footsteps
on the stairs.
He goes to the window, opens it. He gets a chair, places
it sideways in front of the window to make a step. He's
working out how best to throw himself out.
He leans against the wall near the door and waits..
Slamming of doors, German shouts, a scream.
Szpilman steels himself, ready to jump.
Again footsteps on the stairs, but this time descending. A
door slams.
He cautiously goes to the window and looks out.
SZPILMAN'S POV - THE STREET.
In the street below, he sees SS men escorting two prisoners
and shoving into a car. The car speeds off. The street is
empty.
1ST APARTMENT - DUSK
Snow. Howling wind.
Szpilman lies on the divan. He is cold, unshaven, hair
filthy and long. He manages to rise.
THE SMALL KITCHEN.
A mess. Szpilman goes into the kitchen. From a bread tin
he takes a small, flat greaseproof paper parcel and unwraps
it. A slice of bread, stale and mouldy. He tries to bite
it but can't. He finds a knife and tries to chop a piece
off the bread but knocks the bread tin, which falls to the
floor with a clatter.
He continues to try to cut the bread, when there's a loud
hammering on the front door.
Szpilman stiffens.
THE LIVING ROOM.
The hammering continues as Szpilman stumbles into the room,
looks around, confused, not knowing what to do.
From the other side of the door female voices, words
indistinct, and then:
KITTY'S VOICE
Open this door at once, or we'll
call the police!
He is galvanised into action, puts on a crumpled jacket,
grabs his tattered coat and scarf, collects up a few of
his things, stuffs them into a paper bag.
The hammering stops. Szpilman cautiously approaches the
door, listens, then opens it quietly and slips out.
1ST APARTMENT, LANDING AND DOOR - DUSK
He slips out of the flat, goes to the stairs and stops
dead. KITTY, young and fierce, stands on the stairs,
blocking his way.
KITTY
Are you from the flat in there?
You're not registered.
SZPILMAN
It belongs to a friend of mine. I
came to visit but I must have just
missed him.
KITTY
(shouting)
Have you got your identity card?
Let me see your identity card!
Szpilman hesitates; she shouts more loudly.
KITTY
I want to see your identity card!
On various floors, doors open, tenants put their heads out
to see what's going on.
Summoning all his strength, Szpilman makes a dash for it,
pushing past Kitty.
KITTY
(screeching)
He's a Jew! He's a Jew! Stop the
Jew! Don't let him out!
Szpilman clatters down the stairs, reaches the ground-floor
landing. Another woman tries to bar his way but he pushes
past her and out of the house.
He goes to the front door, rings the bell and waits.
WOMAN'S VOICE
(from behind the
door)
Yes?
SZPILMAN
Mr Gebczynski sent me.
The door opens and Dorota stands there. She is pregnant.
They stand for a moment staring at each other.
DOROTA
(a whisper)
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
SZPILMAN
Dorota.
DOROTA
Come in! come in!
Szpilman follows Dorota into the living room.
DOROTA
Sit.
SZPILMAN
I'm sorry - I was given this
address. I'm looking for a Mr--
(He checks the scrap
of paper.')
-- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
DOROTA
(nodding)
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
Szpilman sits down slowly.
SZPILMAN
I need help.
DOROTA
He'll be back before curfew.
SZPILMAN
I've been in hiding. I need
somewhere to stay.
DOROTA
He'll be here soon.
Awkward silence. He gazes at her. She looks away.
SZPILMAN
How long have you been married?
DOROTA
Just over a year.
He nods. Brief silence.
SZPILMAN
And how's Yurek?
DOROTA
Dead.
Again, the awkward silence.
SZPILMAN
When's your baby due?
DOROTA
Christmas.
(A pause.)
This is not a good time to have
children. But then...
The door opens and Michal Dzikiewicz enters. He sees
Szpilman and stops. Szpilman stands.
DOROTA
This is my husband. Wladyslaw
Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent
him.
MICHAL
Oh, yes. I remember.
He shakes hands with Szpilman.
SZPILMAN
Mr Gebczynski said to contact you
only in an emergency, but...
MICHAL
Don't worry now. We can't move you
tonight.
Szpilman, dizzy, leans on the table for support.
MICHAL
You'll sleep on the sofa.
He and Dorota look at him.
SZPILMAN
Excuse me, could I have a piece of
bread?
MICHAL
Yes, of course, we'll eat.
Szpilman asleep on the sofa. The sound of a cello. He opens
his eyes. Listens.
He swings his legs off the sofa, stands, and crosses to a
door. Quietly, he opens it a little.
Szpilman and his POV - another room.
Dorota, partially turned away from him, plays Bach on the
cello.
Szpilman watches her and listens.
A padlock being unlocked. Then, a key is inserted into the
Yale lock, turned, and the door opens.
Michal and Szpilman on the landing, enter the flat.
A large room, sparsely furnished but with an upright piano
and a bed.
Michal carries a bag of provisions and puts them on a table
while Szpilman goes immediately to the window and looks
out.
SZPILMAN'S POV:
There are views of the city, but in the street below,
opposite, is a hospital and, on the corner, a building
flying a Nazi flag and guarded by a sentry, standing at
his sentry-box.
Michal comes up behind Szpilman.
MICHAL
(in whisper)
You're in a very German area. The
building opposite is a hospital,
taking in wounded from the Russian
front. Next door is the
Schutzpolizei. It's the safest
place to be. Right in the centre
of the lion's den.
THE APARTMENT:
Michal makes for the door.
MICHAL
I'll be locking you in. No one
knows you're here. So keep as quiet
as possible.
He nods and goes. The sound of the padlock closing. Szpilman
takes in the room. He sees the piano, is still for a moment,
then goes to it.
He sits on the piano stool and adjusts its height. He opens
the lid. A cloth covers the keys. He removes the cloth. He
gazes lovingly at the keyboard. He flexes his fingers.
Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just
above them, he plays. Silently. Passionately.
Snow falling.
Szpilman alert, hearing the padlock being unlocked and
then iheYdle. The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied
by a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little
brash.
In whispers:
MICHAL
All well?
SZPILMAN
Thank you.
MICHAL
This is Antek Szalas.
Szalas and Szpilman shake hands.
MICHAL
He's going to look after you. I've
given him a second key. He'll bring
you food. See that you're all right.
He's with the underground, a good
man.
Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back
of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses
and pours. While he does all this:
SZALAS
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
SZPILMAN
No, I don't think so?
SZALAS
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.
I saw you almost every day.
SZPILMAN
Sorry, I don't remember.
SZALAS
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to
worry about. I'll visit often.
MICHAL
And you'll be pleased to hear the
Allies are bombing Germany night
after night - Cologne, Hamburg,
Berlin.
SZALAS
And the Russians are really giving
them hell. It's the beginning of
the end.
He gives the others their vodka.
MICHAL
Let's hope so. I don't know when
I'll see you again?
They clink glasses and drink.
very weak and his skin yellowish, drops four beans into
boiling water.
The Sound of the padlock being opened.
Szpilman hurries to see the door open and Szalas enter
with a small and grinning cheerfully.
In whispers:
SZALAS
Still alive then, are you? Here.
Sausage. Bread.
He hands over the package. You still got that vodka?
Szpilman stares at the package.
SZPILMAN
How long is this meant to last?
Szalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses
SZPILMAN
think I've got jaundice.
He unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread. He
takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly.
SZALAS
You don't want to worry about that.
My grandfather was jilted by his
girl friend when he got jaundice.
(chuckles.)
In my opinion, jaundice is not
very serious. Drink up.
SZPILMAN
Why didn't you come sooner? It's
been over two weeks.
Szalas goes to the window, looks out.
SZALAS
Problems. Money. I've got to raise
money to buy the food. I need things
to sell, it' s not easy.
Szpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch,
hands it to Szalas.
SZPILMAN
Sell this. Food's more important
than time.
Szalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops.
SZALAS
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you. The
Allies have landed in France. The
Russians'll be here soon. They'll
beat the shit out of the Germans.
Any day now.
He grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and
goes.
Hie padlock is locked on the other side. Szpilman
enjoys his sausage.
Sunshine floods in through the windows.
Szpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill.
The sound of the padlock. He doesn't stir.
Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the
bed.
In whispers:
DOROTA
Wladek? Wladek!
(to Michal)
I knew it, I knew this would happen!
Szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on
them. He mutters incoherently.
DOROTA
I'm going to get a doctor.
MICHAL
You can't, it's too dangerous.
DOROTA
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust
him.
MICHAL
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's
a pediatrician.
DOROTA
He's still a doctor.
She starts for the door.
MICHAL
No, you stay, I'll go.
He leaves. The padlock sound.
Dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to
the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's brow.
He focuses on her, smiles.
DOROTA
We came to say goodbye. We're going
to stay with my mother in Otwock.The
baby's already there. It's safer.
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.
Szpilman suddenly winces with pain.
DOROTA
That man Szalas should be shot.
He's been collecting money on your
behalf all over Warsaw. Apparently,
people gave generously. So he
collected a tidy sum. He told us
he was visiting you daily.
She looks at him; barely audible.
DOROTA
Oh God!
Later:
Szpilman looks up at Dr Luczak, who has a stethoscope in
his ears. Dorota and Michal stand behind him.
DOCTOR
Acute inflammation of the gall
bladder. Liver the size of a
football. But he'll live. I'll try
to get hold of some levulose, but
it's not easy.
DOROTA
Can you visit him again?
DOCTOR
Who knows?
SZPILMAN
Doctor, thank you.
DOCTOR
Don't speak. Rest.
The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision.
Dorota moves in beside him.
DOROTA
Michal brought food. I'll prepare
something now for you, then we
must go.
Szpilman tries again to say something, but he can't, just
lies there, distressed.
Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window.
Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere.
At the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram
rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging
passengers on the far side and so out of sight.
The tram continues on its way, now revealing the few
passengers who alighted '97 women, an old man with a stick.
Last, three young Poles, carrying long objects wrapped in
newspaper.
One of the men looks at his watch, glances around, then
suddenly kneels and puts the package he's carrying to his
shoulder. The sound of rapid firing, which makes the
newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel
of a machine gun.
His two companions have also put their packages to their
shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming their fire at the
Schutzpolizei building.
The sentry is hit and falls in front of his box.
As if these young men have given a signal, now from all
over the city comes the sound of gunfire.
The pedestrians have scattered except for the old man,
gasping for breath, hobbling on his walking stick, who
eventually manages to disappear inside a building.
Rifle and machine-gun fire from the Schutzpolizei building.
The firing intense. The three young Poles manoeuvre to the
corner opposite the Schutzpolizei and toss grenades into
the building.
Szpilman watching from his window, looks in the opposite
direction and sees smoke rising.
When he turns back to look towards the T-junction, he sees
a Panzerfaust anti-tank rocket firer poking out from a
window in the next-door building but on the floor below.
The Panzerfaust fires. The shell hits the hospital.
Szpilman, lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling.
Szpilman at the window, watching.
The horse-drawn cab clatters out of his sight. He is about
to draw back when he sees, directly beneath him, a man and
woman walking with their hands in the air. Then, a German
soldier, pointing his rifle at their backs, appears.
Suddenly, the man and woman begin to run.
The man turns and disappears. The woman also turns, but
the German soldier drops to one knee and fires.
The woman clutches her stomach, drops slowly to her knees
and collapses on the street in an awkward kneeling position,
and that's how she remains.
Szpilman watches, aghast. Then, he hears voices outside
his door, shouts, footsteps, panic.
THE APARTMENT:
He runs to his front door and listens.
VOICES
(confused)
Where? Where? Just get out!
Everywhere! Get out into the street!
More clatter of footsteps. Then:
A MAN'S VOICE
Get out now! The Germans have
surrounded the building! They're
going to blow us to pieces.
Footsteps descending stairs, more shouts, and:
THE MAN'S VOICE
(further off)
Everyone out, please! Leave your
flats at once, please!
Szpilman runs to the door, tries it but it's padlocked and
he can't open the door.
In panic, he runs back to the window.
His eyes grow wide with terror.
SZPILMAN'S POV: AGAIN THE STREET.
A German tank bringing its gun to bear on the building
next to his.
The gun jerks back and there's a great roaring noise.
The whole building shakes. Szpilman reek back, falls, gets
to his feet and crawls back to the window.
He sees the tank turret swivelling slowly, bringing the
gun to bear directly on a lower floor of his building. The
roaring noise again.
A terrific explosion. His windows are shattered. Glass
everywhere. He is thrown back across the room. Smoke begins
to billow and fill the room.
Smoke filling the room. Szpilman gets to his knees, peers
through the smoke and sees that the wall separating his
apartment from the one next door has been partially
destroyed, with a large hole blasted in it. He stumbles
into the next-door apartment and out of the front door.
Smoke everywhere. Szpilman staggers up to the fifth-floor
landing. There's a metal attic door.
Szpilman pushes open the door and steps into the attic.
The roof space with laundry drying on lines. Szpilman enters
the attic, closes the door, leans on it.
GERMAN VOICE
Fourth floor, Fischke!
He looks round, sees that the roof has been shattered,
leaving a large, jagged gap. He climbs through the gap, on
to the roof at the back of the building.
The attic door being kicked in by a German boot.
A German soldier, wearing his gas mask, bayonet fixed,
enters the attic, looks round, sees nothing, then:
GERMAN VOICE
At the double, Fischke!
The soldier turns and hurries out.
On the sloping roof, Szpilman clutches the skylight and
has his feet in the roof gutter.
He listens - all quiet in the house.
And then a bullet ricochets off the tiles beside him.
Szpilman, terrified, drops, involuntarily catching a lower
edge so that his feet dangle above a balcony below. More
shots. He drops on to the balcony and looks back.
Szpilman clambers back into the building through the smashed
balcony door. A couple of shots dangerously close.
Smoke. Szpilman staggers down the stairs, stumbles over a
corpse and almost falls headlong.
Dark.
Szpilman crawls into a corner, rests. He's exhausted.
He tries to take stock of his surroundings. He can make
out the operating table. He manages to drag himself on to
it.
He lies there, his eyes grow heavy. He sleeps.
From a shattered window on the first floor, he looks at
the burning bodies.
Two German soldiers wander into his eyeline. He draws back
a little but watches them warily.
They sit just beneath him, chatting, and take out their
food-tins, drink coffee and eat bread.
Szpilman wanders down the passage, sees into the wards,
the empty beds, the broken furniture and medical equipment.
Szpilman opens cupboards, drawers, searching, but trying
to be as quiet as possible.
He sees the refrigerator, quickly gets to it, pulls open
the door. Empty.
He looks around and notices a red fire bucket with a spade
and a box of sand next to it. The bucket is full of water,
covered with an iridescent film and full of dead flies.
He drinks as much water as he can without swallowing the
flies and, while he's doing so, he spots a couple of sacks.
He opens the first: potatoes. The second contains barley.
He tries to eat the uncooked barley but can't.
Later:
A fire on the floor. Szpilman holds a saucepan over it and
is cooking the barley and some potatoes. He manages to
scoop out a spoonful, blows to cool it, then eats.
Szpilman at a window sees autumn leaves thick on the ground.
And at the end of the street, a line of Poles, some with
their hands in the air, others with hands on heads, being
marched away by German soldiers.
Szpilman lies in bed under several layers of blankets. Ice
on the windows. He hears German voices shouting commands.
He sits up.
Szpilman gets to a window and looks out.
German soldiers with flame-throwers are burning the
buildings opposite.
One soldier, with a bucket of white paint and a brush,
numbers the building.
Szpilman cranes to see them reach the end of the street,
then cross over and start on the buildings on his side,
working their way towards the hospital.
He pulls away and makes for the back of the hospital.
Szpilman goes to a window, jumps out. He twists his ankle.
He's in pain. He crawls across the back garden and climbs
over the wall.
Szpilman enters the hall, still showing signs of its former
opulence. I Silent. Ominous.
He looks round anxiously, then sees the stairs leading
down to the basement. He hurries towards them and descends.
Dark, shadowy.
Szpilman comes down a flight of wooden stairs that had
directly into the kitchen.
Immediately, he begins to search fractically, opening
cupboards, drawers. He finds a can with a label illustrating
pickled cucumbers. Desperately, he searches for something
to open it with.
He discovers a pair of scales with a variety of weights.
He seizes one of the weights when, very close, he hears
the sound of a car coming to a halt, then the car door
slam, a German voice giving commands.
He drops the weight but, holding the tin, he scampers up
the stairs.
Szpilman, clutching the unopened tin, makes his way up the
narrow, wooden staircase.
Szpilman, panting heavily, reaches the top floor. He sees
a small door, tries it. It opens.
Szpilman enters, closing the small door behind him. He
leans back, resting, recovering.
And then he hears from down below a piano playing a
Beethoven piece.
After a few bars, the music stops. Szpilman listens
anxiously. Silence.
He looks around, finding himself in an attic space filled
with junk, a ladder, rotting material, travelling trunks.
Last light of day filtering through a dormer window.
There's a ladder leading up to a trapdoor. Szpilman climbs
the ladder.
He crawls into a small empty space. With enormous effort
he pulls up the ladder and closes the trapdoor.
Exhausted and trying to catch his breath, he gazes at the
unopened tin. He peers through the darkness but sees
nothing.
His eyes begin to droop.
Szpilman wakes suddenly. He listens. Silence but for the
distant gunfire. He sees the unopened tin of pickles, stares
at it. He opens the trapdoor.
Szpilman, a shadow, a spectre, creeps down the stairs.
Szpilman has placed the tin and the weight on a shelf and
is engrossed in searching again. He finds a pair of chicken
scissors. Using the weight, he starts to hammer the point
of the scissors into the tin making a perforation round
the rim.
The tin slips off the shelf and rolls across the floor
coming to rest at a pair of highly polished jackboots.
Szpilman stifles a gasp.
On the stairs, in silhouette, gazing down at him, the figure
of a GERMAN CAPTAIN, the thumb of one hand caught in his
belt above his pistol.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
(stern)
Who the hell are you?
Szpilman just stares at him.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Who are you?
No response.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
What the hell are you doing?
SZPILMAN
(barely audible, in
German)
I was... I was trying to open this
tin.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Where do you live?
No response.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
What's your work?
SZPILMAN
I am... I was a pianist.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
A pianist.
He studies Szpilman for a moment, then with a nod orders
him to follow. Szpilman picks up the tin and follows.
Szpilman follows the German Captain through a double door,
hanging off its hinges, into a room with a broken table in
the centre, what once was the dining room. And then through
another set of doors. The German Captain's boots echo.
They come into a spacious room. Faint moonlight filters
through the large windows. Fallen masonry and broken glass.
A couple of chairs. And a grand piano in the corner.
The German Captain points at the piano.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Play.
Szpilman hesitates, then limps to the piano, puts down the
tin, and opens the lid. He turns and drags one of the chairs
over and sits.
The German Captain stands and watches.
Szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, and then he
plays Chopin.
The German Captain listens, expressionless. The pale
moonlight shows him to be a handsome, elegant man.
Szpilman finishes playing.
Silence.
Somewhere, a cat mews. Distant burst of rifle fire.
The German Captain stares at Szpilman. After a moment:
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Are you hiding here?
Szpilman nods.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Jew?
Long pause. Szpilman just stares at him.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Where are you hiding?
SZPILMAN
(in German)
In the attic.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Show me.
Szpilman hesitates, takes the tin and then shuffles past
the German Captain towards the door.
Szpilman and the German Captain enter.
The German Captain takes out a flashlight, sees the ladder
in place, leading up to the loft.
Szpilman climbs the ladder, squeezes into the loft and
looks down at the German Captain, who shines his light on
him.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Have you anything to eat?
Szpilman shows him the tin.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
I'll bring you something.
He goes quickly, leaving Szpilman in darkness. Szpilman,
overcome by relief, can barely catch his breath.
Szpilman hears the car's engine growing fainter. He starts
to tremble and then begins to cry. He weeps uncontrollably.
Much activity: officers coming and going, orderlies typing.
Officers king on field telephones. Desks, filing cabinets.
The German Captain, carrying a bulging shoulder bag, marches
into a room just off the hall and goes to his desk just as
an orderly drops papers in his in-tray. On the desk, there's
a framed photograph of him nth a woman and two children.
German Captain glances at the papers, takes a pen, initials
one or two and then goes.
THE GRAND STAIRCASE:
The German Captain marches up the stairs purposefully, as
if he's on urgent business.
The German Captain enters. He puts two fingers in his mouth
and whistles.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Open up.
After a moment, the trapdoor shifts and Szpilman looks
down.
The German Captain takes a package from his shoulder bag
and throws it up into the loft. He turns to go.
SZPILMAN
Please.
The German Captain stops.
SZPILMAN
What's all that gunfire?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
The Russians. On the other side of
the river.
(Turns to leave,
stops; with a touch
of irony:)
All you have to do is hang on for
a few more weeks.
He goes quickly.
Szpilman opens the package, finds bread and marmalade.
Then he finds a tin-opener.
Szpilman, listening and shivering with cold. He hears the
whistle. He opens the trapdoor to see the German Captain
in the attic, carrying a package.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Come down.
Szpilman descends.
SZPILMAN
What's happening?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
We're getting out.
Szpilman faces the German Captain.
SZPILMAN
(in German)
Are the Russians here?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Not yet.
He hands Szpilman the package. Szpilman opens it to find
inside several loaves of bread.
SZPILMAN
I don't know how to thank you.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's
His will that we should survive.
Well. That's what we have to
believe.
Silence. Szpilman shivers with cold. The German Captain
takes off his coat and gives it to him.
SZPILMAN
What about you?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
I've got another one.
Warmer.
(brief pause)
What will you do when it's all
over?
SZPILMAN
I'll play the piano again. On Polish
radio.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Tell me your name. I'll listen out
for you.
SZPILMAN
Szpilman.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
Szpilman.
(a crooked smile)
Good name for a pianist.
Szpilman, wearing the German Captain's coat and under the
eiderdown, hears the strange sound of the music, which he
recognises.
He's astonished, puzzled. He comes to a decision and starts
to leave.
Cautiously, in his German military overcoat, Szpilman trots
down the staircase into the empty hall.
He goes to the front door, opens it a crack and cautiously
goes out.
Szpilman playing the piano. He looks something like his
former self, fairly well dressed and groomed.
He glances towards the glass booth and sees Lednicki with
the technicians. He smiles. Lednicki nods, smiles back.
Szpilman plays Chopin's Piano Concerto No 1 with full
orchestra and conductor. He plays superbly. The music is
glorious.
