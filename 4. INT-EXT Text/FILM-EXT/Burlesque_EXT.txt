A small, grime-streaked steel town, hanging on by the skin of
its teeth. Boarded-up storefronts, a run-down A&P.; CAMERA
MOVES past an old sign: WELCOME TO GRUNDY!!! and lands on
a broken neon sign that reads "DWIG 'S BAR" It flickers so
you can read the name: DWIGHT'S. Then goes back to DWIG.
Ali winds her way through the trailers, carrying a bag of
take-out, with a swing in her step -- moving to music playing
in her head. She reaches a double-wide, lets herself in.
ALI
Nanna? Got your pot roast here!
Loretta and Ali, at the grave with a MINISTER who looks to be
about 17. A CEMETERY WORKER is nearby, picking his teeth
with a toothpick.
YOUNG MINISTER
Dear Lord, we gather here today not
to mourn, but to celebrate the life
of Alison Rose.
ALI
Arlene.
YOUNG MINISTER
What?
ALI
She's Arlene. I'm Alison.
YOUNG MINISTER
Oh, shit.
(then, befuddled)
Can I start over?
Ali rolls her eyes.
LATER,
The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk away, leaving Ali
and Loretta alone.
LORETTA
You were real good to her, Ali.
ALI
No, she was good to me.
She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up.
ALI (CONT'D)
And she wasn't even my real Nanna.
LORETTA
What...?
ALI
Foster care. She took me in for the
checks. When I turned eighteen, the
money stopped coming. She could've
kicked me out, but she didn't.
(BEAT)
(MORE)
10.
ALI (CONT'D)
She had a lot of pain at the end.
Nothing she talked about, but I
could tell.
LORETTA
Well, then I guess this is a
blessing. Now she's free.
ON ALI, thinking realizing:
ALI
(talking about herself)
Yeah. I guess she is.
CLOSE ON ALI'S WHITE PLATFORMS, strutting down the street.
Ali takes off down the street. She passes TWO OLDER WOMEN
waiting for a bus. A beat as they watch her pass. Then:
OLDER WOMAN
She'll be back.
As Ali heads off, we HEAR:
BURLESQUE GIRLS
GO, HONEY, GO!..'
14.
Over which we HEAR someone channel surfing radio static--
The rush of tourists and traffic. Through a sea of people
moving down the crowded sidewalk we FIND ALI as she emerges
through the crowd, carrying her bags. Looking around at this
exciting city. She SPOTS a SHITTY HOTEL with a sign: "$49.00
a night." She looks up at it. Then heads across the street--
Ali cruises toward the address, dressed in her Iowa best,
full of confidence. She rounds a corner and sees:
A LONG LINE OF 165 GORGEOUS, IMPECCABLY GROOMED GIRLS.
Ali stops in her tracks. Tougher competition than she was
expecting. She heads for the back of the line, passing girls
doing vocal warm-ups. One girl is belting out a riveting
"SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW". Just as Ali gets in line, the
door opens and a SKINNY GUY sticks his head out.
SKINNY GUY
Sorry, ladies, that's all the
applications we're taking today.
CLOSE ON: an ad: "DANCERS WANTED. PRETTY GIRLS ONLY."
18.
Ali, dressed like the girls at the video audition: hootchie,
street -- opens the door to find 30 CLASSICAL BUN-TOPPED
BALLERINAS stretching, warming up. A Degas painting. They
turn in unison and eye her. Again, not her crowd.
Gleaming in the California sunshine. Ali stares up at the
glittering shrine to recording. Takes in the whole swirling,
crazy scene around her.
19.
Ali wanders down the sidewalk chugging an iced latte. The
Strip hums with SLICK NIGHT LIFE. Expensive cars pull up to
valets. Hipsters swish past velvet ropes. Ali moves through
the throngs, alone, anonymous, invisible.
She passes a CONSTRUCTION SITE for a 15-STORY-TALL BUILDING,
all lit up, guys working at night. A BUS pulls out, spewing
exhaust. As the smoke clears, Ali sees, across the street:
A BEAUTIFUL, STATUESQUE GIRL standing on the landing of a
fire escape under a street lamp beside a NONDESCRIPT CLUB.
Ali catches glimpses of her as the Sunset traffic whizzes by:
full make-up, spangled burlesque costume, impossibly high
heels, awesome. This is Coco. Coco makes the dirty
streetlight look like a movie-quality Kleig. Everything about
her shimmers.
Intrigued, Ali looks for a break in the traffic and crosses
the street. As she nears the club, she hears a MAN'S VOICE:
ALEXIS
Like I said, LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH!
ALEXIS, drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make-
up, TOSSES a GUY out the front door onto the street, then
heads back inside--
Ali smiles to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who
disappears inside a BACK DOOR as...NIKKI walks out. Lights a
ciggie. She has on full make-up. Lacquered lips. Lashes like
peacock feathers. She sees Ali staring.
NIKKI
Didn't your Mama tell you it's not
polite to stare?
ALI
Sorry, you're just -- so DAMN
beautiful.
NIKKI
(WARMING)
In that case, screw your Mama,
stare away.
Nikki strikes a pose, campy, showing Ali her best side. They
both laugh.
AL I
No one would ever guess.
20.
NIKKI
What?
ALI
That you're a dude.
Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali
sees the mistake she made. She's mortified.
ALI (CONT'D)
Oh, shit.
NIKKI
"Shit's" right, you little half-wit
TWAT--
Nikki is about to unleash when the stage door opens.
SEAN
Bitch! You're on!
Sean grabs her and drags her inside. As he does, a STRAND OF
CRYSTAL BEADS comes off her costume, falls to the ground.
ALI
I'm really sor--
The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads.
Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer.
She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A.
HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos
of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their
elaborate costumes and provocative poses.
She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black
curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool
music emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She
ventures inside...
FOLLOW a motorcycle up the street. The DRIVER has a KEYBOARD
on his back. He parks, gets off, takes off his helmet. It's
Jack. He heads for his apartment, but slows when he sees:
ALI, sitting on his steps, her bags at her feet. Head low.
JACK
Ali? What's wrong? You okay?
She tries to speak, but can't -- so she just nods.
JACK (CONT'D)
Really? Cause, in my experience--
when you're on someone's doorstep
surrounded by everything you own,
there's usually a not-so-good story
THAT--
ALI
I-- WAS--
And as she expected, as soon as she talks, she starts to cry.
ALI (CONT'D)
--RO-0-0-0-OBBED.
JACK
Shit. No way!
ALI
(halting, gaspy sobs)
Came in -- busted the lock-- and
stole all my MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!!
She sobs--trying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS only
heard by birds. Jack winces, trying to follow--
ALI (CONT'D)
(more gaspy sobs)
And there's no way I-- sleep there--
with-- like that-- the manager said-
- not till Monday-- and I don't--
anyone else-- but then-- so I
remembered I had...but it went
straight to...so I...
She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a card. It's Jack's that
he gave her in the club. It has his address on it.
39.
JACK
Okay. I have no idea what you just
said, but come on in here and we'll
get it sorted out.
She looks at him. Wiping her tears. He picks up the heaviest
of her bags and leads her to:
Ali looks at the rain. Then marches out into it, lugging her
stuff. Goes about 15 yards in one direction, then stops.
Ali peers down the street for the bus. Jack appears beside
her, getting soaked in the rain.
JACK
So, this plan of yours?
ALI
.was to sit here at the bus stop
and come up with a plan.
JACK
Come back inside.
ALI
No, Jack, I--
JACK
ALI--
ALI
I'll figure it out, this is not
YOUR PROBLEM--
JACK
It's pouring!
ALI
It's only water for chrissakes--
47.
JACK
GOD DAMN IT! GET YOUR ASS BACK IN
MY HOUSE! NOW!
ALI
Jack-- you've done enough and--
In ONE MOVE he SCOOPS HER up as she lets out a WHOOOOP!
ALI (CONT'D)
Jack-- No! Stop it!
He grabs her bags and carries her back across the street--
Jack's motorcycle pulls up to the club, with Jack driving,
and Ali riding on back.
Small crowd outside.
61.
TESS (O.S.)
So I said to the sailor, I may not
be as good as I once was...
motorcycle, puts her arms around his waist. Jack revs the
engine. Weaving through traffic on the Strip. The wind in
their hair. Her scarf tears away, lifting into the air...
Sprawling 60's modern. Walls of glass. Jetliner views.
Valets running around out front.
A sky full of stars, hovering over an expansive back yard.
Music from the party drifts out. Marcus looks around, up --
83.
MARCUS
Up there.
He starts up some steps to an outdoor gazebo. Ali follows.
They pass AN INCREDIBLY WELL-DRESSED COUPLE coming down.
GUY
Hey, Marcus --
MARCUS
Hey, Guys. Greg, Marla, this is
Ali.
They exchange hellos. Ali notices:
ALI
Ooh. Killer shoes.
MARLA
Aren't they? Louboutins.
GREG
(TO MARCUS)
Great party, as always.
MARCUS
Glad you could come.
Ali stares at Marcus. He smiles, takes her hand, keeps
leading her up the stairs.
AL I
You had to make an appearance at
your own party?
MARCUS
Would've been rude not to, right?
You'd like those guys. Greg's the
entertainment editor at the Times,
and Marla's a designer.
Ali glances back at Marla again, locks in on her shoes.
AL I
I'm gonna dream about those shoes.
MARCUS
Thousand dollars a pop.
AL I
Jesus. Who can afford that?
84.
MARCUS
I can.
ALI
Hey, I saw them first.
He laughs as they reach the top of the stairs and a
BREATHTAKING PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE CITY is revealed.
Ali pauses, taking in the glittering, massive view of L.A.
ALI (CONT'D)
Whoa. L.A. looks one hell of a lot
prettier from up here.
MARCUS
It should. That view cost me three
times what the house did.
(POINTING)
See that strip mall down there?
ALI
You own that too?
MARCUS
No. I own everything above it.
ALI
There is nothing above it.
MARCUS
Exactly.
ALI
You own...air?
MARCUS
Air rights. The guy who owns the
strip mall was having money issues
and almost had to sell. Whoever he
sold to would have put in a huge
tower. So I bought the air rights.
Now no one can ever build above one
story.
ALI
Aren't you the sly puss.
MARCUS
Mall guy gets to keep his property.
I get to keep the second best view
in L.A.
85.
ALI
What's the first?
He gazes at her. She rolls her eyes.
ALI (CONT'D)
How many girls have you used that
on?
MARCUS
None who ever called me on it.
He smiles. Looks at her. Then...
MARCUS (CONT'D)
What do you want, Ali? In life.
Girl like you, gives up everything,
gets on a bus heading for total
uncertainty-- she's got a dream. I
want to know what it is.
ALI
Why?
MARCUS
Because you're talented enough to
get whatever you want. And I'm
smart enough to help make it
happen. So? What do you want?
A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.
ALI
I want to be the best singer I can
be. I want to give as much joy as I
get when I perform. And I want to
die knowing I made the most of
every opportunity life gave me.
MARCUS
That's ...so beautiful.
AL I
There wasn't a dry eye in the house
when I said it at the Grundy County
Junior Miss Talent Show.
His eyes narrow.
MARCUS
Why do you women always take
advantage of nice boys?
86.
ALI
Oh, please. You are SO not a nice
boy.
He clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy.
Marcus drives Ali up the windy roads, into the hills.
They're talking animatedly.
ALI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
.THEY WON'T BE SATISFIED, 'TIL
THEY SEE TEARDROPS IN MY EYES ...
A PACKED LINE of chattering hipsters snakes down the block.
MUSIC UP: "JUNGLE FEVER" BY THE CHAKACHAS. (REVAMPED BERLIN
MUSIC)
Tess, pissed off, carries the damaged costumes out to her
car. Nikki is behind her, following her out.
NIKKI
Tess. We need to talk.
Tess rolls her eyes, doesn't slow.
TESS
Not now, Nikki.
NIKKI
Yes, now. I've been here since the
beginning. We built this club
together. And then some girl shows
up out of nowhere-- who hasn't even
paid her dues--
TESS
I'll get her to write a check
tomorrow.
NIKKI
And suddenly it's her show?
TESS
No, it's not her show. It's my
show. But people want to hear her
sing. She's bringing them in off
the streets. You better believe I'm
building a show around her!
NIKKI
I can sing too! And you know it.
But you don't give a shit. You
always say this is a dance troupe,
now suddenly it's not?
TESS
NIKKI--
96.
NIKKI
And you expect me to dance behind a
girl who struts in with a new pair
of shoes she got for sleeping with
Marcus Gerber?
TESS
(unlocking her car)
Nikki, you're wasted. Go home.
NIKKI
I won't be upstaged by some slut
with mutant lungs!
Tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car, furious.
TESS
So don't be! Leave! If you don't
want to be a part of what's
happening here, then I don't want
you around.
NIKKI
(AGHASST)
You'd destroy our friendship and
break up the group over some girl
you barely know?
TESS
Since when do you care about
friendship? Or this group? You're
a trainwreck, Nikki! You put
tequila on your breakfast cereal!
I'm struggling to survive here, and
you show up too drunk to dance!
You call that loyalty?
Nikki just looks at her--
NIKKI
Okay, then. I quit!
Nikki stomps off. Tess sighs --
TESS
NIKKI-- WAIT--
NIKKI
Marcus says you're losing the club
anyway!
(MOCKING HER)
"They don't come to hear us sing"
(MORE)
97.
NIKKI (CONT'D)
(SOTTO)
Stupid bitch.
Nikki flips her off and keeps walking. Then turns once more:
NIKKI (CONT'D)
By the way: I slept with Vince the
day after your honeymoon.
Tess's eyes narrow. She grabs a HIGH-HEELED PUMP and HURLS
it. It flies through the air and hits Nikki in the back of
the head. Nikki SCREAMS, whips around, incredulous, to see:
TESS, running right at her. Nikki bolts, heading for her
car. She jumps in, locks the door just as Tess SMASHES her
fist on the window and KICKS the door. Nikki starts the car.
NIKKI (CONT'D)
You crazy bitch!
Nikki screeches off, leaving Tess alone in the parking lot.
Tess stands there a moment, then HEADS back into the club.
THE SOUND OF A COFFEE GRINDER
CLOSE ON: A DIAMOND RING as it's placed on the hand of A
VERY PREGNANT GEORGIA. Wearing an adorable mini-skirt
maternity wedding dress. She looks at DAMON with devotion.
Ali, Tess, Coco, Sean and Jack, all watching the ceremony.
Ali looks over at Jack. He looks at her, then away.
The reception is underway. GUESTS are drinking, dancing with
the iconic backdrop of Hollywood behind them. Ali, Sean,
Coco and Tess stand together drinking, overlooking the city.
ACROSS THE TERRACE, Jack is talking on his cell phone.
JACK
What do you mean, you're still in
New York? ...So you just -- decided
not to come? You think you
might've wanted to, I don't know,
let me know??? We haven't seen each
other in six months.
ACROSS THE TERRACE, Ali sees Jack yelling into his phone.
Sean sees her watching.
BACK ON JACK
JACK (CONT'D)
.why does every conversation we
have end up being about YOUR
future...
Jack looks across the terrace at Ali. Moonlight on her
shoulders. A breeze in her hair.
JACK (CONT'D)
.you know what, you're right. We
both should be thinking about our
futures. And I might just be
looking at mine right now. Break a
leg baby.
Jack hangs up with finality and marches toward the bar-- His
cell phone immediately rings again.
101
He sees it's Natalie, sends it to voicemail, and shuts off
his phone. As he PASSES Sean and Coco--
JACK (CONT'D)
I guess Natalie's not coming after
all.
SEAN
Oh, please, that girl? Show up at
a party where she's not the center
of attention?
AT THE BAR - LATER - Jack drains one drink and orders
another, getting very drunk. Ali sidles up to the bar.
ALI
(TO BARTENDER)
Shot of Patron.
Jack raises his brow. Ali drinks the shot, and without
looking at him--
ALI (CONT'D)
Lookin' kinda lonely.
JACK
(BOOZEY)
No. Not lonely. Liberated, yes.
Libated, absolutely. But never
lonely. Cheers, baby--
He raises his glass-- she rolls her eyes, walks off-- he
follows her, playfully PUSHING her from behind.
ALI
Hey-- what're we, in junior high?
JACK
You still mad at me, Iowa? C'mon.
Bring it on.
She starts to say something as-- THE SHIRELLES start to sing
"BABY IT'S YOU"-- Jack turns to the DJ, points both fingers
at him and YELLS:
JACK (CONT'D)
I LOVE THIS SONG, MAN!!!
Everyone stares at the drunk guy. Ali rolls her eyes and
walks off-- Jack swings her around, PULLING her close-- she
just looks at him. Starts to laugh at how drunk he is-- Jack
wraps her in his arms and starts to sing quietly in her ear.
102.
JACK (CONT'D)
.Many many many nights go by, I
sit alone, at home and cry, over
you...
ALI
Well, you're quite the crooner.
He looks her in the eye.
JACK
I'm sorry for being a class A
prick.
Ali smiles, surprised at his candor. He breathes a sigh of
relief.
JACK (CONT'D)
And as of about...
(bleary look at his watch,
CAN'T FOCUS)
.some time ago, I am officially a
single man.
ALI
You and Natalie split up?
JACK
That we did. So. That explains what
I'm doing here all alone. What are
you doing here all alone?
ALI
Do I look alone to you?
They share a look. Then he spins her around in his arms. She
laughs.
AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is
watching the DJ spin. The DJ glances down at them.
COCO
That DJ's hot.
SEAN
You think?
COCO
He keeps looking at me.
Coco smiles up at him, flirty. The DJ smiles back.
103.
COCO (CONT'D)
Hmmm...I think he's cuckoo for Coco-
puffs.
They look at each other, then crack up like giggling
schoolgirls.
CLOSE ON: A KEY TRYING TO GO INTO A LOCK. Then it disappears
from view. We hear it CLANK to the ground. Then giggles.
ALI (O.C.)
Whoopsie daisy --
PULL BACK to find Jack and Ali, drunk, staring at the keys on
the ground.
JACK
Whoopsie daisy?
ALI
My Nanna used to say that all the
time. That and upsie jumpsie.
JACK
Upsie jumpsie?
(running it together)
Upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy,
upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy,
upsie jumpsie --
(ABRUPTLY STOPS)
When would she say that?
ALI
When she wanted her dog to get on
the bed with her. That is --
(DRUNKEN WHISPER)
when she was alive.
Their eyes meet. A connection. Then, staring into her eyes:
JACK
(trying to be serious)
The dog, or Nanna?
Ali bursts out laughing. So does Jack, as he pushes the door
open, and they fall into the apartment.
104.
CLOSE ON THE LOCK as a key is inserted. The door opens.
109.
Ali knocks on a door, suitcase in hand. A beat. Then a good-
looking guy, who's obviously just woken up, answers with a
blanket wrapped around him. He is the DJ from the wedding.
ALI
Oh. I'm sorry. I think I have the
wrong apartment. I'm looking for
Sean?
(off his blank look)
Brown hair? 5'10n? Early 30's?
DJ
Oh, Sean! I thought he said John.
He's asleep. Come in.
112.
The DJ shuffles inside. Ali follows as he leads her to the
bedroom. He points to Sean in the bed.
DJ (CONT'D)
That him?
Ali nods. Sean's eyes pop open, confused to see her.
SEAN
What are you doing here?
ALI
Long story.
Sean notices the guy in the blanket.
SEAN
Ali, this is Mike.
DJ
Mark.
SEAN
Mark???
(THEN)
Oh. Anyone want coffee?
ALI
I'll make it. You two get
acquainted.
ANOTHER SLAMMING DOOR.
NATALIE'S HEELS storm away from the apartment. Carrying her
bags, really PISSED, she kicks a big, fat rose blossom off a
bush, and continues on.
INTERCUT WITH THE SPOTLIT STAGE
114.
The girls continue the number. Post modern Gaultier bondage
cages on top, bowler hats and black shorts. A HUMONGOUS moon
hangs at the back of the theatre, the black stage awash in
golden light.
ALI
PLEASURE I'M SURE, I ' VE MET YOU
BEFORE, BUT MAYBE NOT HERE, MAYBE
IT WAS, SOME OTHER TIME. THIS AIN'T
NO KIND OF PLACE FOR YOU, YOU
BETTER MOVE ALONG...I MET A GOOD
OLE' BOY WHO CAN. 00000, DON'T
FOLLOW ME DOWN. IT'S A RUSE...
Marcus is waiting in his Bentley. Ali gets in. Marcus looks
at her. She forces a smile. The Bentley rounds the corner as
we HOLD and see JACK'S MOTORCYCLE thunder up. He gets off,
runs to the building.
Sean and Mark exchange awkward good-byes.
SEAN
Well. Bye.
MARK
You... Take care. Sean.
Mark turns, heads down the stairs as Jack rushes up, calling:
JACK
Is Ali here?
MARK
Just left.
Mark continues down. Jack whips around, looks at him, then up
at Sean, who nods.
JACK
Where'd she go?
SEAN
With Marcus.
JACK
What?
115.
SEAN
I told you, opportunity doesn't
knock forever.
Jack burns, frustrated, then heads slowly down the stairs.
Sean shakes his head and turns to go back inside. Then
pauses, noticing:
Mark, looking up at Sean's apartment, hesitating. Then he
opens his car to get in. Sean stands there, realizing he's
doing the same thing. He steps onto the stairwell. Calls out:
SEAN (CONT'D)
Hey! You!
MARK
(LOOKS UP)
It's Mark.
SEAN
Mark. You wanna have breakfast?
Off Mark's smile:
Ali lies on a chaise overlooking the panoramic view of L.A.
against a fiery red sky. Marcus comes out of the house, with
a bottle of wine. Crosses and sits next to her on the chaise.
Marcus refills their wine glasses. An empty bottle already
there. She sips as she leans back and relaxes.
MARCUS
Better?
ALI
(SMILES)
Better.
She looks out at a giant billboard at eye level.
MARCUS
You're gonna be on one of those
someday.
117.
ALI
Yeah, right.
MARCUS
Sooner than you think, too. Harold
Saint called me today. You made
quite an impression on him.
ALI
Really? What'd he say?
MARCUS
He wants to make a demo with you.
ALI
Are you serious? When??
MARCUS
He found a little studio time on
Tuesday.
ALI
This Tuesday?
MARCUS
Too soon?
ALI
No! Oh my god, no, that's amazing.
You're amazing.
MARCUS
I like making you happy. Your whole
face lights up.
Their eyes meet. He pushes some hair out of her face.
ALI
I think you're way too nice to me.
MARCUS
And that's a problem because...
ALI
I've had a lot to drink. And my
judgment is off.
He touches her face, their chemistry palpable.
MARCUS
Hey, I'm a gentleman. Which means
I'd never kiss a lady when she's...
vulnerable.
118.
She looks at him.
ALI
Liar.
She leans in and impulsively pulls him into a kiss.
Tess pulls into the lot-- gets out of her car dressed to the
nines in a tailored business suit, hair up, professional. She
HEADS into the club--
the lot, weaving through traffic as she lifts her cell.
cars.
Sean's car whips into the parking lot. Ali jumps out and
heads for the front entrance. The CONSTRUCTION WORKERS from
the towering building across the street HOOT and CAT-CALL at
her. She waves to them and nods: that's right, boys.
TWO SETS OF FIERCE HEELS and LEGS stride in unison down a
sidewalk. PAN UP as Tess and Ali enter:
129.
