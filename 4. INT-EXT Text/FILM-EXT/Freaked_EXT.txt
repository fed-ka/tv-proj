A large haystack sits in the middle of a field. We hear
Stuey's approaching scream.
STUEY (O.S.)
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...
THUD! Stuey misses the haystack by a few feet. He hops to
his feet and dusts himself off.
STUEY
Hey, I'm okay!
BONK! His scrapbook falls into frame and beans him.
STUEY
OW!
CUT TO:
We see the airliner lowering its landing gear as it makes its
final approach to the runway.
RICK (VO)
Here we are Ernie, Santa Spam.
World famous for loud music and hot
sex!
ERNIE (VO)
It is?
RICK (VO)
Give me a few hours.
KA-BLOOEY! The plane explodes in a fireball. Swish-pan to
reveal...
RICK AND ERNIE
10.
Standing just outside the airport. A porter follows with
their bags.
RICK
Sure glad that wasn't our plane.
Ernie nods. They're distracted by the sound of chanting.
They squint into the distance, where they see a group of
chanting PROTESTERS--young "Save the Earth" types, latter-day
hippies, kids, seniors, etc.
PROTESTERS
EES mustn't stay! Take your toxic
crap away! EES mustn't stay!
(etc.)
Some of their signs read--"Say No to Noxon!", "Coogan Go
Home", "EES is killing our Earth!", "Ricky Coogan Sucks Shit"
(this one held by a nice LITTLE GIRL), "I Like Ike" (held by
a confused OLD MAN, shuffling around aimlessly), "Drink
Pepsi" and finally...
"Free Nelson Mandela"--we WIDEN to reveal the subheading:
"Inside specially marked boxes." We keep WIDENING to reveal
that this is not on a protest placard, but a box of cereal
some GUY is eating as he watches the protest.
ERNIE
Jesus! We better find the limo
before these whale kissers chop us
up and sell us for parts.
(he spots the limo)
There it is.
Off to the side, away from the protesters, an unmarked limo
with tinted windows (and plates that say NOT EES) awaits.
KEVIN, an EES exec, leans out the window and waves discreetly
at Ricky. The stewardesses, looking tipsy, wave their bras
out the back window invitingly.
Ernie tries to grab Ricky by the arm, but he resists. He's
looking at the protesters.
RICK
Wait a second...
His POV...
A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
standing in the center of the crowd of protesters, holding a
MEGAPHONE to her mouth and chanting. She puts down the
megaphone to rest, and we can see that she's powerfully
beautiful, in a no-nonsense feminist kind of way. This is
JULIE. Rick is smitten.
11.
ERNIE
Let's go, Rick. They're waitin'.
RICK
Forget them. I got a better idea.
If I can just find the right
disguise...
ERNIE
Coog, those hippies'll tear us
apart.
Rick spots a HEAVILY BANDAGED MAN limping out of the airport
on crutches. Rick approaches him, waving a roll of bills.
RICK
Hey, how'd you like to make a quick
hundred bucks?
The man mutters something weakly. Ernie puts his ear up
close to hear him better.
ERNIE
He says the pants don't usually
come off for less than two-fifty,
but since you're so cute, he'll
make an exception.
FLIP TO:
RICK
buried beneath rolls and rolls of bandages, making his way
through the protesters on crutches. Ernie helps him along,
nervously. As Rick spots Julie from behind, he hands the
crutches over to Ernie.
RICK
Here.
Ernie takes the crutches. Rick waves his arms dramatically,
clutches his bandaged legs, and winces in pain.
RICK
Help! Ow! Give me back my
crutches! You monster! Oh, the
pain! The agony!
He falls theatrically at Julie's feet.
JULIE
Are you okay? Let me help you!
12.
RICK
Thanks. Don't worry about me.
What's one man's pain weighed
against the global injustice of
corporate tyrants like EES? Go.
The fight must continue.
Julie's buying it big time. She gazes deep into Rick's eyes.
JULIE
Wow... My name's Julie.
RICK
Josh. Josh Tavner.
Ernie sticks a hand out, grinning sarcastically.
ERNIE
Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you.
Julie turns on Ernie viciously. She slaps him hard, and
grabs the crutches from him.
ERNIE
Ow! Hey!
JULIE
Give me those, ape. Help him up.
Rick rises to his feet "painfully."
JULIE
Hey Josh, a busload of us are
headed over to Maracas to protest
Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with
cow shit.
RICK
Same here! You could ride with us.
JULIE
Us? You're with him?
She looks at Ernie, who grins stupidly.
RICK
Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard
of an idiot savant?
JULIE
Sure.
RICK
That's Ernie. Except for the
savant part.
13.
Ernie glares at Rick. Rick smiles at Julie hopefully. Julie
looks at them both, and can't help smiling herself.
CUT TO:
High wide shot: The car is descending deeper into the wild
jungle, towards a huge eerie sunset.
IN THE CAR
Julie's been lecturing Rick for some time now.
JULIE
You don't even want to hear the
truth about Noxon, do you, Coogan?
(MORE)
15.
JULIE(CONT'D)
I mean, look, I'm not saying this
stuff is going to turn anyone into
a... a...
RICK'S POV
on the road behind Julie he sees a crude carnival billboard
featuring a painting of a huge worm with a man's head. It
reads "See the Incredabel Humin Werm! Only at Elijah C.
Skuggs Famus Freek Land." Julie can't see it.
RICK
(DISTRACTED)
Human worm...
JULIE
Right. A human worm. I mean,
that's just stupid. The point is--
Rick sees another billboard for the freak show. This one
features a half-man/half-dog creature and says "See the
Aztownding Dawg Boy!"
RICK
Dog boy...
JULIE
Yeah, or a dog boy. That's absurd.
BUT--
Another billboard. This one features the "Hidyous Frawg
Man."
RICK
Hideous frog man.
JULIE
Okay, okay. Now you're just being
silly. Human suffering's just a
big joke to you, huh? You are
sick, Coogan!
She turns away from him in a huff and looks out her window.
She sees a billboard that reads "See The Hole Amazing Famly
of Freekz at Elijah C. Skuggs Famus Freek Land and Mutent
Emporeum!"
JULIE
Cool! A freak show! Let's check
it out!
RICK
Kind of like a family reunion for
you, huh?
16.
ERNIE
Lighten up, Coog, could be a goof.
The car turns into a driveway near a crude, hand painted sign
that says "FreekzTM--Thiss waey" with a messy arrow...
We ZOOM IN to the hand painted "small print" on the bottom of
the sign, which reads--"Freekz is a registered trademark of
Elijah C. Skuggs Enterprises. Any unauthorized reproduction
is strictly prohibited without prior written consent."
CUT TO:
The car stops at the end of the long, spooky driveway, just
past a sizzling electric fence. Rick, Julie, and Ernie get
out and look around. It's eerily quiet.
There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted
ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with
an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy
broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant
molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly
rotates on a creaky base.
Ernie looks hard at the big eyes. He turns away for a
second, then spins around again. The EYES are looking in a
different direction. Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a
chocolate bar.
JULIE
Isn't it great? It's so "real"...
RICK
Real stupid.
(TO ERNIE)
Let's go. This place is dead.
ERNIE
Yeah. Where are all the weirdos?
VOICE (O.S.)
There are no weirdos here.
Startled, they turn to see ELIJAH C. SKUGGS, a twisted,
haggard old man. He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone
which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino
cherry on top. Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary
eyes. We now realize the giant head is molded in his image.
17.
ELIJAH
Mutants, yes. Genetic nightmares,
definitely. Children of Hell and
twisted masses of living, breathing
tormented flesh, certainly. But as
for weirdos... not a one. Unless
of course you count me! Ha ha ha!
RICK
Nah, you seem like a regular
dumbshit old redneck to me.
Elijah ignores him. Julie shoots him a look and smiles at
Elijah.
JULIE
I'm Julie. And you are...
ELIJAH
Elijah C. Skuggs, proud proprietor
of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and
Mutant Emporium. But you knew
that. After all, you've ventured
miles away from civilization,
hospitals, telephones,
(TO RICK)
police... How may I help-you?
RICK
Drop dead.
Elijah smiles, unfazed. Julie glares at Rick. She smiles
apologetically at Elijah.
JULIE
We'd like to see your freak show.
You see, only by appreciating the
variety and innovation of nature
can we come to respect the fragile
complexity of our global eco-
system.
Elijah nudges Ernie.
ELIJAH
And you come to me looking for
weirdos?
Ernie shrugs. He goes to take a bite out of his chocolate
bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand.
ERNIE
Hey! What the--
He looks behind him, and there--about ten feet away--is...
18.
A HULKING BALD MAN
warts all over, squatting on the ground and chewing happily.
This is TOAD.
Julie and Rick turn and see him.
JULIE
(REPULSED)
Eeuuuwww...
(composes herself and
WAVES)
Ahem. Hello.
Toad doesn't respond to her waves.
ELIJAH
Mr. Toad is my... assistant. As
for the show, I'm afraid the next
parade of deformity isn't until
tomorrow night...
Rick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed. They turn to
leave. Julie's sincerely upset.
JULIE
Oh, just our luck...
Elijah grabs Rick's shoulder and turns him around.
ELIJAH
However! I do have a private
exhibit in my shed you might enjoy.
I don't usually share it with the
general public...
RICK
We're deeply honored. But no
thanks.
ERNIE
Yeah. We really must be--
He raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone! He turns
to see Toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily.
Hmmm. Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed.
JULIE
The sideshow tradition has been
misrepresented by the media. You
don't traffic in human misery. You
show society the part of itself it
doesn't want to look at.
19.
ELIJAH
Yes... Yesm I see...
He looks over to Rick and Ernie with a grin that says
"Where'd you find this nutty chick?"
Rick shrugs and follows, taking Ernie with him.
ERNIE
What the heck. We'll see some
pickled dog brains, maybe some
pictures of women with, you know,
added equipment.
RICK
And to think we could be in the
limo with those stewardesses.
Elijah holds the shed door open for them. It's pitch black
inside. Julie enters. Rick and Ernie follow.
ERNIE
What the hell, Coog, these people
are weird, but they seem nice
enough.
A CUTE BUNNY
sits outside the shed. THWAP! Toad lashes out with his ten
foot tongue, and sucks the bunny into his mouth. He shuffles
into the shed, crunching contentedly.
Elijah closes the shed doors in our face, grinning. we hear
a lonq peal of EVIL LAUGHTER from inside.
ELIJAH
AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! HE-HE-HE! HA-
HAHA! HE-HO-HE-HE-HA-HA! AH-HA-HA-
HEHA! YAH-HA-HA-HA-HEE-HEE-HO-HA-
HE-HE!
The barn looks especially sinister silhouetted against a big
green moon. A huge ball of flame belches out of the smoke
stack.
RICK (O.S.)
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGGG!
DISSOLVE TO:
It's eerily quiet in the dawn light.
BANG! The doors fly open. Elijah drags Rick out.
Horrified, Rick clutches the monster side of his face.
27.
RICK
Oh God! This was my good side!
ELIJAH
Still is if you ask me! Hell, even
half-done, you'll be the star of
the show tonight.
Elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse.
ELIJAH (CONT'D)
Welcome to your spacious
accommodations.
He unlocks the door and drags Rick in.
Elijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse.
ELIJAH
One of these days I gotta put a
shitter in there.
Bob Vila steps out of nowhere again, holding a Time-Life
book.
28.
BOB
No problem. It's all here in my
Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah.
And you pay nothing for thirt--
BONK! Elijah knocks him out cold with a ball-peen hammer
from his tool belt.
The Worm, as an OXFORD PROFESSOR, is wandering around the
grounds, taking notes and puffing on his pipe.
WORM (V.O.)
I was a professor of lacrophylogy--
er, the study of worms, of course.
I came in search of the
Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman
terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr.
Skuggs said he had just such a worm
in his shed. How could I have
surmised that the specimen and I
would ultimately prove to be one
and the same?
We see professor Worm meet Elijah, and follow him into the
lab. The smoke stack belches a plume of flames as we hear
his off-camera screams. DISSOLVE back to..
THE FREAK HOUSE--NOW
The Worm finishes his tale.
35.
WORM
At first, the transformation was
fabulous. I truly understood the
worm's ethos like never before.
But those early days of fascination
are over. Now, in retrospect, I
think the whole thing is a fucking
headache. I'd sell my soul just to
be able to wipe my own ass...
He sniffles a little, but manages to hold back the tears. We
pan to Sockhead.
SOCKHEAD
I first came here as a tourist,
looking for some fun...
FLASHBACK
DISSOLVE TO:
A lanky TOURIST, obviously Sockhead in better days. He
approaches Elijah.
SOCKHEAD (V.O.)
Anyway, then Elijah turned me into
a sock. That's it.
The bearded lady (as a man) steps out of the cab of his
eighteen-wheeler. He looks very much like he does now,
except he has no lipstick or earrings.
36.
BEARDED LADY (V.O.)
I was confused--a walking
contradiction, so full of
questions.
The bag opens, Elijah reaches in and takes out the hammer.
The music turns to Psycho-like string stabs as Elijah uses
the hammer to smash in a nail.
Stuey proudly reads the weekly world News. The front page
features Stuey's story and his sketch of Rick.
STUEY
(READING ALOUD)
"Freaky Deaky! Ricky Coogan's a
mutant in South America! By Stuart
S. Gluck."
(to NEWSSTAND GUY)
That's me!
Suddenly two GOONS in dark suits snatch the paper away from
Stuey. They grab him and force him into a limousine.
Elijah, looking natty in his Ringmaster suit, stands at the
entrance, barking to various people who are drifting in.
ELIJAH
It's grisly! It's revolting! It'll
make you wish you were dead! And
at just twelve bucks a head, you
can bring all the kids!
We follow a KINDLY FATHER through the curtained entrance.
OOF! He collapses, a knife embedded in his chest, revealing
the total mayhem...
INSIDE THE TENT
The motley crowd (LOCALS, sleazy looking MOBSTERS, rogue
BIKERS, wayward HIPPIES, and JAPANESE TOURISTS, etc.) is
brawling and drinking and having a heck of a time.
Some small displays and a few carnival booths are set up
around the sides of the tent. There's a "PETTING ZOO" where
a KID is petting a two-tailed-no-headed dog. And there's a
"HEAVY PETTING ZOO" where a GUY is french kissing a six-
legged goat.
A CLOWN sits in a dunk tank, heckling the customers. The
sign says "DUNK ME IN ACID!"
CLOWN
C'mon, my granny could throw better
than you!
He's talking to an OLD LADY, who throws a baseball, hits the
target, and dunks the clown into the foaming bath of carbolic
acid. We hear his gurgling screams, then his bony hand
reaches up out of the bath.
Elijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience.
It's total mayhem.
ELIJAH
(CALMLY)
Quiet, please.
Everyone instantly sits down, shuts up, and looks up
obediently at Elijah.
43.
ELIJAH
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to witness a
cavalcade of atrocities so
horrific, I advise the more
sensitive members of our audience
to leave the premises.
Two SENSITIVE LOOKING MEN wearing sweaters draped over their
shoulders politely get up and leave.
ELIJAH
Tonight I'm proud to announce the
addition of several new
monstrosities to the show,
including our star attraction, the
Beast Boy--an untamed and highly
dangerous ghoul who's liable to go
nuts and kill us all at the drop of
a hat.
(impressed "oohs", "ahhs",
and "cools" from the
AUDIENCE)
But first up, prepare to behold an
unspeakably repulsive yet
heartwarming atrocity, Three Men
and a Baby!
THREE MEN AND A BABY, all fused into a single multi-limbed
freak, walks out onstage. One of its arms holds up a dirty
diaper, and all the three men hold their noses and grimace.
The audience breaks into warm-hearted laughter and applause.
BACKSTAGE
The freaks mill around in the caged-in green room, guarded by
Toad. Frogman, dressed in a magician's outfit over his
wetsuit, holds an empty dove cage and searches the room,
whistling for his missing dove. Nosey sneezes up a cloud of
feathers. JulieErnie walk determinedly towards the adjacent
Men's and Women's restrooms... BONK! They hit the wall
between the two doors.
Rick is reading his "script", rehearsing his lines. He's
wearing a cheesy "jungle" costume.
RICK
Arrrggg. I am Beast Boy. I will
eat you. Arrrghh.
(he throws down the
SCRIPT)
I can't do this shit!
He peers through the bars, scanning the audience for signs.of
a rescue party.
44.
RICK
Damn it! What's keeping those
guys?
The Worm creeps up behind Rick.
WORM
Something's troubling you, my boy.
what is it?
RICK
Well, let's see. I've been
kidnapped, hideously disfigured,
imprisoned with a bunch of mutant
freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A.,
and this dialogue makes "Hey Dude
Three" read like "Dr. Zhivago."
WORM
I think I know what you're going
through. I too had an eating
disorder. You see, I've always had
a feverish obsession with pudding.
And when I was a young lad...
Rick groans and looks out at the audience.
ELIJAH
onstage.
ELIJAH
And now a perennial favorite here
at Freakland, ladies and gentlemen.
I know you'll all enjoy the musical
stylings of Rosie the Pinhead.
Rosie the Pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding
a microphone. After the applause dies down, she whips off
her sunglasses with a flourish, revealing her extremely goofy-
looking crossed eyes. She wails incomprehensibly and bonks
her head with the mic.
ROSIE
(DROOLING)
EEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIEEEEEE...
A series of WIPES show bits of various acts as the evening
WEARS ON:
ERNIE/JULIE
are doing a Vaudeville style stand-up routine while tap
dancing.
45.
ERNIE
Hey Julie, how many feminists does
it take to screw in a light bulb?
JULIE
How many?
ERNIE
Two. One to screw it in and one to
ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha!
JULIE
Oaf!
She bonks him with their cane. He bonks her back. She
knocks him cold. They both fall down.
THE BEARDED LADY
is doing a make-over demonstration. He's got a local GIRL
from the audience sitting at a makeup table onstage.
BEARDED LADY
If your coloring is in the autumn
range, like Maria's, try an earth
tone eye makeup. Now I've done a
lovely French braid on Maria, but I
encourage everyone to experiment
and use your imagination. The main
thing is to just have fun with it.
The audience is engrossed. Some take notes.
SOCKHEAD
is ringing those "tuned bells" and singing along.
SOCKHEAD
Edelweiss, Edelweiss.
He takes a bow but his sock is snagged on the mic stand. It
pulls off and reveals a normal-sized hand where the sockhead
was--he's actually a hand-head! The audience gasps. A MAN
gets up and points accusingly.
MAN
He's got a hand under there!
SOMEONE ELSE
It's a hoax!
Sockhead realizes he's unveiled and tries to hide his hand-
head with his other hands. The crowd starts jeering and
pelting Sockhead with rotten vegetables. He gives them the
finger with all three hands. Elijah tries to calm them.
46.
ELIJAH
Puppetteering is an admirable skill
in its own right! Give him his
due!
THE CROWD
Where's the beast boy you promised
us!? Bring on the beast boy! We
want the beast boy! (etc.)
BACKSTAGE
The Worm is still talking to Rick. We can hear the crowd
screaming for him in the background.
WORM
And when I won first prize, they
never called me pudding-head again.
RICK
So?
WORM
Don't you see? You must turn your
hardship into inspiration! You're
an actor, Rick! Your body is your
instrument, and with it you must
play your tragic symphony for all
the world!
Rick is really moved. Elijah pokes his head backstage.
ELIJAH
(TO RICK)
They're going nuts for you, Beast
Boy! You better go out there now!
He starts to take off his jungle costume.
RICK
(determined, inspired)
I'll be right there.
(TO WORM)
Thank you Worm. I don't really
know how I can repay you for this.
WORM
(SINCERE)
You could wipe my ass.
RICK
(thinks Worm is joking)
Ha-ha! Always the wit, eh Worm?
47.
Rick claps him on the back and walks off. Worm is
disappointed.
WORM
(TO HIMSELF)
Damn.
(he turns to Nosey)
Nosey, have I ever told you what a
gifted artist you are?
Nosey gives him a worried look.
ONSTAGE
The spotlight reveals Rick, centerstage, poised in
Shakespearean garb. The crowd quiets down and focuses on
Rick with great respect and awe. A truly dramatic silence.
Rick pauses for effect and then launches into a soliloquy
with bravura.
RICK
Now is the winter of our
discontent,
Made glorious summer by this son of
York,
But I that am not shaped for
sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous
looking glass,
I, that am curtailed of this fair
proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling
nature,
The audience is riveted. Even Spanish-speaking peasants are
mouthing the words. Elijah, however, thumbs through his
script, totally confused. The freaks watch through the bars
from the wings--completely engrossed, especially Julie. Juan
notices this and pulls her closer to him, but she pushes him
away.
We move in on an erudite British gentlemen in the crowd. By
God! It's ALISTAIR COOKE! He turns to camera. Subtitle:
ALISTAIR COOKE.
ALISTAIR COOKE
(SOTTO VOCE)
If you're having trouble
understanding Mr. Coogan's
brilliant reading of this soliloquy
from Richard the Third, please take
advantage of the handy subtitles
for the culturally illiterate.
48.
A FILTHY PEASANT sitting next to Cooke is trying to listen to
Rick. He turns angrily to Cooke.
FILTHY PEASANT
SHHH!
Cooke turns back to the stage. The words in brackets appear
as SUBTITLES.
RICK
Deformed, unfinished, sent before
my time,
{I'M UGLY}
Into this breathing world, scarse
half made up,
{I'M REALLY UGLY}
And that so lamely and
unfashionable, That dogs bark at me
as I halt by them.
{I'M F KIN' BUTT-UGLY, ALRIGHT!?}
Why I, in this weak piping time of
peace,
{BLAH, BLAH, BLAH}
Have no delight to pass away the
time,
{I NEVER GET LAID...}
Unless to see my shadow in the sun,
And descant on mine own deformity!
{BECAUSE I'M UGLY}
Rick bows. The crowd bursts into applause. They yell
"Bravo" and throw bouquets. Rick takes several curtain
calls. The freaks cheer for him. Julie is particularly
moved--she and Rick exchange a heavy look, laden with
romantic potential. NOTE: We will insert an almost
subliminal one-frame shot of the Pepsi logo at this
triumphant moment.
Kevin, the EES executive from the airport scene, walks into
the tent. Rick sees him and gasps with joy. He leaps off
the stage, runs up to Kevin and hugs him. Kevin is shocked,
of course. Overcome by the moment, Rick regresses to his old
self.
RICK
I'm saved! Haha! You sorry
mutants are gonna rot in this hole
while I'm sipping mint juleps by
the pool!
{AS FORTUNE SMILES O'ER MY FATE, SO
DESTINY SPURNS YOUR ACCURSE'D PATE}
The freaks and the audience gasp at Rick's cruelty. Julie is
shocked--Juan gives her an "I told you so" look. Rick sees
Julie and catches himself.
49.
RICK
(TO KEVIN)
I mean, um, I hope you have room
for all my friends, heh-heh.
KEVIN
Rick, Rick, listen, I really love
this new look you've come up with.
But just between you and me, I
don't think the guys upstairs would
really get it.
RICK
What are you saying!?
KEVIN
(CHUCKLES SNIDELY)
I'm saying you're ugly enough to
burn the nosehairs off a dead nun.
The crowd bursts into cruel hysterics, pointing mockingly at
Rick. Even Alistair Cooke is practically choking with
laughter.
ALISTAIR COOKE
AH-HA-HA-HA! WHAT A PUTZ!
Rick looks around, horrified at the sea of evil, jeering
faces. He begins to tremble. Then...
RICK'S MONSTER EYE
springs to life for the first time and glows red with rage.
His whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body
with violent intensity. He grabs Kevin's head and screams in
a new, monstrous voice.
RICK
EAT SHIT!
POP! He plucks Kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft.
The head stares down at Rick in disbelief.
KEVIN'S HEAD
Now you're just being childish.
Rick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits.
The crowd panics and charges for the exits.
CROWD
AHHHHHH! HELP! LET US OUT OF
HERE!
People are trampling over each other in the mayhem. Alistair
Cooke is crushed under the stampede.
50.
The freaks are horrified. Monster Rick growls triumphantly.
Elijah looks on, intrigued.
ELIJAH
Now that's entertainment.
Elijah shows Rick out the door. The Eyes scurry out and leap
back into the sockets in the giant head.
ELIJAH
Bye-bye. And remember, try another
escape, and I'll feed your balls to
Toad.
As he walks towards the Freak House, Rick pulls out the note
he pocketed. A gust of wind blows it away from him. He
chases it behind the carnival tent where...
KKCCLIINNK! He runs into ELEVEN PHONY MILKMEN, backing their
way around the corner, each carrying their own six-pack of
milkbottles. Startled, they turn around. Why, it's the
freaks! And they're all dressed as milkmen! Cowboy carries
the hammer, who's dressed in a little milkman suit as well.
BEARDED LADY
Hey Rick, I thought you were gonna
come up with your own escape plan?
RICK
(TO JUAN)
This is your big plan? A dozen
milkmen? Isn't that a little
unusual?
Juan hadn't thought of this. He pushes himself forward and
confronts Rick viciously.
JUAN
Twelve milkmen is theoretically
possible. Thirteen is silly.
Looks like one milkman too many,
Coogan.
He pushes Rick aside. The freaks continue past him.
RICK
Fine then. Go ahead. Hope you
like reggae, ya flea bitten
bastard.
Rick watches as the Freaks approach the open courtyard, where
he knows the Eyeballs will spot them.
59.
Julie glances at him a second, then looks away. His mind
made up, Rick takes a deep breath.
RICK
Ah, shit.
He runs over to the Freaks. He stands in Juan's way.
RICK
Look, you'll all be killed. You
don't know about Elijah's giant
Rasta eyeballs with machine guns...
(they think he's nuts)
It's suicide! I can't let you do
it.
JUAN
And I can't let you stop us.
This is it. Rick and Juan square off. Juan growls and bares
his teeth. Rick's MONSTER EYE starts to glow and pulse
dimly. They circle each other. The others are transfixed.
ELIJAH'S POV
He peers through a side window, and sees the pack of milkmen
cheering two of their coworkers, locked in mortal combat.
ELIJAH
That's a lot of milkmen on the same
route. No wonder they fight.
Juan rears back, about to lunge, when suddenly he freezes and
looks off into the distance.
A SQUIRREL
is sitting innocently a few yards off.
JUAN
Squirrel!
He zooms off after the squirrel. The Eyes pop out of the
giant head and follow after him, Uzis FIRING. Juan dodges
their bullets and disappears after his prey.
The freaks watch their best chance of freedom run off after a
pesky rodent. They turn to Rick.
NOSEY
Wow, giant Rasta eyeballs, just
like Rick said.
SOCKHEAD
Gosh, if it wasn't for Rick, we'd
all be dead!
60.
OTHER FREAKS
Yeah! Way to go Rick! Alright!
ERNIE
(TO JULIE)
God, I can't believe he left you
for a squirrel. What a dick.
Julie's hurt. She doesn't even smack Ernie.
RICK
You know how men are. Besides, it
was a pretty good looking squirrel.
Julie looks at Rick. She sees he's trying to be helpful, not
sarcastic.
JULIE
(to the others)
Come on. You heard the Beast Boy.
Back to the Freak House, now.
Her eyes meet Rick's. She manages a smile, and Rick smiles
back. Ernie sizes up the situation and groans as they all
head back to the Freak House.
ERNIE
Not again.
(TO RICK)
Oh well, at least we'll get to try
a new position.
CUT TO:
It's an "Antfarm View" of the yard, where the freaks are
visible tunneling underground, and Toad is visible on the
yard above them. We see a bat fly overhead... ZAP! Toad
shoots out his tongue, snags it out of mid air, and chews it
happily, oblivious to the freaks burrowing right underneath
him.
Elijah comes out of the house and walks towards the lab.
The "antfarm view" again. We see the freaks running back
through the tunnel as it caves in behind them. Toad sits on
the ground above, oblivious to them. We hear a low flying
aircraft... ZAP! Toad shoots his tongue up out of frame and
sucks the twin engine Cessna into his mouth. Beat. He BURPS
and spits up a propeller.
78.
An EES corporate helicopter touches down. A few gun-toting
SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out. They
check that the coast is clear, then give the signal. Out
steps Richard Hertz. He mutters something to one of the
security guys, and walks towards the Freak House.
IN THE FREAK HOUSE
RICK
(under his breath)
I don't believe it. What's Hertz
doin' here?
The door to the Freak House opens. Hertz enters, unzips his
fly. Finding no toilet, he shrugs and relieves himself on
the floor. Rick steps out of the shadows towards him.
RICK
So EES is in bed with Elijah C.
Skuggs, eh? Figures.
Hertz is momentarily startled by Rick. He collects himself.
HERTZ
Rick! Thank God I got to you in
time!
80.
RICK
Cut the crap, Hertz.
Hertz relieves himself as he talks.
HERTZ
Ricky, you have no idea how your
misfortune has touched our hearts.
When you disappeared we almost gave
up hope. But we'd heard reports of
Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon,
and when the story broke in the
tabloids, I decided to personally
come down and get to the bottom of
things.
He zips up and heads to the door.
RICK
(SKEPTICAL)
Really?
HERTZ
No.
(BEAT)
AHA HA HEE HEE HO HO HA HA HEE HEE
HO HO HO HA HA HA HA!
The cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as
he realizes... Hertz is THE LAUGHING MAN! Hertz ducks out
the door. Rick looks after him, stunned.
We hear a nearby SNORE cut off, and the Human Torch stands up
from the spot where Hertz relieved himself. He's dripping
wet and no longer on fire. He sniffs his soaked, smoldering
clothing.
TORCH
Peuw! Hey! Of all the... That
really pisses me off!
POOF! He catches fire again and walks off. Rick is doing a
slow burn, still looking after Hertz. He erupts and his
monster eye glows briefly. He screams in anguish.
RICK
AAARRGGGGHH!
Dejected, Rick leans against the wall. JulieErnie walk up
behind him. Julie puts a hand on Rick's shoulder to comfort
him. As they look into each other's eyes, a loud CRASH
distracts them. Rick peers through the crack.
81.
RICK'S POV
A caravan of EES trucks crash through the front gate and
drive up to the lab. There's a few cargo trucks and a huge
NOXON-24 tanker.
RICK
Holy shit.
A forklift drives out of the back of one of the large trucks,
carrying the old corporate farts on a wooden palette.
One of them falls off, and a bunch of WORKMEN scramble out to
prop him up and push him back into place.
Stuey is outside the lab. Inexplicably, (actually it's just
because he's so stupid) he's still moving inch by inch. He
calls to Rick through the tape on his mouth.
STUEY
Mmm! Mmmmm!
A huge banner reads "NEW IMPROVED BEAST BOY SLAUGHTERS HIS
LOVED ONES! SPECIAL GUEST: FUNNYMAN DOM IRERRA! TONIGHT
ONLY!". We can hear the sound of the crowd inside.
INSIDE THE TENT
There's a typically smallish crowd in addition to the EES
executives who occupy the front seats. The security goons
are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of
them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row. Elijah
is onstage.
ELIJAH
And now the moment you've all been
waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen,
meet the lucky young man who's
about to be become the monster with
the mostest! Here he is, the Beast
Boy!
Toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens, revealing Rick
strapped to an operating table. On stage left there's a
large cage containing all the other freaks. Including the
unconscious, half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the
freak house. The Milk Man domes to, looks around in a panic,
grabs the bars of the cage, and screams--
MILK MAN
AAHHHH! WE'RE IN A ZOO!
Rick searches the cheering audience for Stuey, who waves the
Pepsi cup full of glop in the air. Rick hears Stuey's voice
echo in his head telepathically.
STUEY (V.0.)
Rick! Over here!
Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed
BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds
up a beaker of ointment.
90.
ELIJAH
With this remarkable ointment of my
own design, I will now turn this
half-finished ghoul into the
ultimate super freak, dedicated to
evil!
Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick,
who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey.
He calls out telepathically.
RICK (V.0.)
Stuey! Where are you?!
Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally
blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies.
STUEY (V.0.)
Here I am, Rick!
BIKER
(TO STUEY)
Goddammit, kid! Would you sit
down!?
The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head. The
"good ointment" runs down all over Stuey's body.
STUEY
AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
All eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto
the floor screaming.
RICK
Oh no!
BIKER
What the hell!?
Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to
its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a
switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade
crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He
drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He
leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah.
STUEY MONSTER
YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS!
Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on.
ELIJAH
Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE
AND EYE! KILL HIM!
91.
Eye and Eye rush the stage, Uzis firing.
EYE AND EYE
RASTAFARI!
The bullets bounce off Stuey's hide. He doinks them with his
big monster fingers and sends them flying through...
THE TENT ROOF
across the compound, and THWOPP! Into the Giant Head's eye
sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed.
CRASH! The head's foundation crumbles and it keels over
backwards.
