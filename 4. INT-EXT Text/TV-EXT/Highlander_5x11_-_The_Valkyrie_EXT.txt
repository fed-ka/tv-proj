      OVER we HEAR snippets of a political speech:

                                      STEFANOVICH (O.S.)
                          (with passion)
                    Listen to your hearts, Comrades. 
                    Ask it why your children go to sleep
                    hungry.  Why you have no decent work.
                          (beat)
                    The President knows who our enemies
                    are and like a gutless fool, does
                    nothing but choke on the bile of
                      compromise.


      Methos and MacLeod come out of a bookstore.

                    Nope.

                                      METHOS
                    Did she mention why the police were
                    after her?

                                      MACLEOD
                    They were just trying to tie up some
                    loose ends.

                                      METHOS
                    Really.  Five patrol cars and ten
                    uniforms -- that's a helluva lot of
                    manpower for a loose end.

      Methos stops at a coin-operated newspaper box.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You old cynic.

                                      METHOS
                    I try.

      Puts in a quarter, pulls out a paper, starts leafing through
      it.  MacLeod peeks over his shoulder.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    There's an exhibit of Grecian
                      antiquities opening at the museum
                    today...

                                      MACLEOD
                      A twenty-five hundred year old garage
                    sale.  My heart's already racing.

                                      METHOS
                    Hey, some of that stuff could be
                    mine.

      MacLeod abruptly grabs the paper out of Methos' hands.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    I believe the phrase is, "Mind if I
                    borrow your newspaper? 

      MacLeod's not listening.  His attention is riveted to
      something in the paper.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Damn it.

      He throws the paper down and hurries off.

                    Something I said?

      He picks up the paper, opens it up to a full page ad.  It
      reads: "NEW FREEDOM PARTY.  A NEW WORLD ORDER!  ALAN WILKINSON
      SPEAKS OUT TONIGHT AT COMMUNITY CENTER."


      It is late.  There are only a few cars and a few people
      walking.  Something is troubling Ingrid as she and MacLeod
      walk.

                    For two hundred years the most I've

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's normal to be a little afraid,
                    Ingrid.

                    I'm not afraid, Duncan.  The worst
                    they can do is shoot me.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then what is it?

                    It is.

      MacLeod's two simple words carry great weight.

                    Hitler will be dead.

      NIGHT

      On a secluded forest road, an S.S. checkpoint sits at the
      entrance to Wolf's Lair - Hitler's compound.  A SENTRY signals
      an approaching STAFF CAR to stop.  A brief exchange and the
      car is waved on through.


      The staff car pulls off the main road behind a quonset hut. 
      Ingrid, Stauffenberg and MacLeod get out.  Stauffenberg paces
      nervously.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    This is not good news.

                                      INGRID
                    I can't believe they moved the
                    briefing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's up to you, Colonel.

                    The conference room is above ground.

                    The briefcase must be placed as close
                    to Hitler as possible.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                          (beat)
                    Leave that to me.  And this time I
                    will stay to make sure it goes off.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I can't let you sacrifice yourself.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    It s not up to you.

      MacLeod speaks with genuine concern.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Colonel, can you imagine the chaos
                    after today?  Germany will need you
                    to restore order and negotiate a
                    peaceful surrender with the Allies.

                                      INGRID
                    He's right.  Today is just the
                      beginning.  The real work comes later.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll stay in the room after you've
                    placed the briefcase.

                                      INGRID
                    Listen to him.  It's the only way.

        Stauffenberg considers, then, obviously moved by MacLeod's
      apparent willingness to sacrifice himself, agrees.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    The German people will not forget
                    the British soldier who gave his
                    life for them today.

      He shakes MacLeod's hand.

                                      STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
                    I will see to that.

      MacLeod smiles humbly in return.

                    If you don't mind, Colonel, I'd rather
                    stay anonymous.


      The staff car approaches a small clearing, pulls up in front
      of the Conference Building.  Typical of temporary wartime
      construction, it is a low cinder block structure, metal roof,
      one door.

      As MacLeod and Stauffenberg get out, they're met by CHIEF OF
      STAFF KARL BRANDT crossing the compound.  They salute Brandt,
        Stauffenberg introduces MacLeod.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    Staff Chief Brandt, Colonel Frick. 
                    Newly returned from the Russian Front.

      Brandt looks MacLeod up and down.

                                      BRANDT
                    No doubt, Frick, you are here to
                    explain why British convoys are still
                    getting through, supplying the Red
                    Army.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You'll have my full report.  I'm
                    sure you will be satisfied.

      From across the darkened compound walks a SHORT MAN flanked
      by two OFFICERS.  Brandt glances in their direction.

                                      BRANDT
                    It is not I who must be satisfied.

      He moves off, enters the Conference Building.

      As the Short Man walks under a floodlight we see who it is. 
      ADOLF HITLER.  He passes by Stauffenberg and MacLeod, who
      salute.  Without acknowledging them Hitler enters the
      Conference building with his Officers.

        Stauffenberg reaches into his briefcase, breaks the acid
      vial activating the fuse.

      INSERT

      We see the wire and the acid slowly eating away at it.  Below
      it, the charge of explosives.

      BACK TO SCENE

        Stauffenberg nods to MacLeod.  It s done.  They move toward
      the conference building.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                          (quiet)
                    God be with you, Duncan MacLeod.


      A general ALARM shrieks to be heard over the screams and
      confusion.  Bits of flaming wood rain down from the night
      sky.

      Ingrid stands in the center of the compound, transfixed by
      the sight of the flames leaping up out of the Conference
      Building.  She whispers a prayer of thanks.

                                      INGRID
                    Thank God.  It is finally over --

      But the words die on her lips.  Staggering out of the flames,
      supported on each side by a bruised and bloodied Officer...
      Hitler.  He's still alive!  Bleeding, obviously in severe
      shock, but still alive.

      Ingrid's jaw drops.  Numbly, she reaches into her pocket,
      pulls out a GUN.  She points it at him as he moves toward
      her.

      HITLER

      blinks in the glare of the floodlights, stops, raises one
      burned bloody arm high...

                                      HITLER
                      Providence has spared me again.  I
                    am invincible!

      INGRID

      goes pale.  Her heart stops, her throat seizes.  She freezes
      as

      HITLER'S EYES

      bore into hers.  He screams like a man possessed --

                                      HITLER (CONT'D)
                    The hand of God himself protects the
                    Fuhrer!

      INGRID

      swallows, about to pull the trigger --

      BLAM!

      She waited too long, an Officer shoots her from behind.

      BLAM!  BLAM!

      Two more bullets rip through her.

      Hitler is led off by the Officers.  MacLeod, battered by the
      explosion but revived, comes limping out of the building. 
      He sees Ingrid lying dead in the dirt.  Fires blazing, sirens
      blaring, he runs for her, takes her up in his arms, carries
      her off into the woods.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

                    funny about all this.


      MacLeod walks out, followed by a laughing Methos.

                                      METHOS
                    It worked, didn't it?

                                      METHOS
                    What else you need?  Doctor, lawyer,
                    Indian chief?  I've got paperwork
                    for any occasion.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Of course you do.

      The T-Bird waits at the curb.


      Ingrid walks down the sidewalk.  Hanging several car lengths
      back, an UNMARKED POLICE CAR follows.  Inside the car, DET.
      FRAYNE checks the police sketch of Ingrid.

                                    DET. FRAYNE
                    Gotcha.

      Ingrid turns a corner, out of sight.  The Cop picks up speed,
      makes the corner -- but the sidewalk is empty.

                                    DET. FRAYNE (CONT'D)

                    the Inspector.

      The words choke in his throat.

      A GUN BARREL jams hard up against his jaw bone.  His eyes
      slide slowly over to see Ingrid holding an AUTOMATIC.  He
      drops the radio, it falls into his lap.

                    I'm sorry.

      Frayne's eyes widen just a fraction before she pulls the
      trigger.

      BLAM!

      He jerks once, falls over dead.

      FADE IN:


      A BAG LADY loiters outside the hotel.  Hunchbacked, bundled
      in rags, dragging her life behind her in a garbage bag, she
      makes a pitiful sight.

      A MINIVAN pulls up to the curb.  In red, white and blue
      letters, a sign on the van reads "ALAN WILKINSON -- NEW
      FREEDOM PARTY."

      The passenger door opens, a DECOY who looks like Wilkinson --
      dressed in a stylish suit, wearing a hat, jacket collar turned
      up -- gets out, followed by the driver, Breslaw.

      They make their way toward the hotel entrance.  The Bag Lady
      scuttles over to them, reaches into her shopping bag.

      Suddenly, the Wilkinson Decoy pulls a gun, levels it at the
      bag lady.

                                      BRESLAW (O.S.)
                    Freeze!

      The Bag Lady looks up, and we see it's actually Ingrid --
      she's walked right into a trap.  Breslaw comes up behind
      her.

                    Do it, or you're dead.

      She hesitates for a moment, then one look in her eyes tells
      you she won't.  She pulls out her gun and --

      BRESLAW

      shoots her twice.

      BLAM!  BLAM!

      The bullets twist her body around.  She drops to the pavement,
      rolls face up, dead.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    What a waste.

      Breslaw reaches down and closes her eyes.


      Banners drape across the stage, "NEW FREEDOM PARTY.  A NEW
      WORLD ORDER FOR A NEW WORLD!"

      A small but zealous crowd listens as Wilkinson struts and
      fumes behind the podium on stage.  His eyes burn with
      righteous fire.

                                      WILKINSON
                    They call me a racist.  Why?  Because
                    I have the balls to speak the truth. 
                    And that's not my truth or your truth. 
                    That is the truth and the truth is
                    that I can no longer support a
                      government that is weak, corrupt,
                    and taxes us to death.

      The audience reacts like well-trained animals.

                                      WILKINSON (CONT'D)
                    The truth is that if they can't
                    protect us and our children from
                    these hoodlums and crackheads, then
                    we'll do it ourselves!

      The crowd CHEERS dementedly, anger rising up like a foul
      stench.

      ANGLE ON

      MacLeod and Methos, seated at the back of the auditorium.

                                      METHOS
                    She's not here.

      MacLeod studies the audience, keeping a vigilant eye out for
      Ingrid.

                                      MACLEOD
                    She will be.  She has to be.

      He double checks the emergency exits.  All secure.

      Back up on the podium, Wilkinson goes for the throat.

                                      WILKINSON
                    The truth is that every true American --
                    and we know who we are -- has to
                    stand up and say I won't take it
                    anymore.

                    That schmuck gives me a headache. 
                    Let's pack it in?

      But MacLeod shakes his head.  Methos sighs...

                    I'm telling you, she's a no-show.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No, no.  There's something...

      His eyes drift up to Wilkinson on stage.

      MACLEOD S POV

      Wilkinson looks possessed.  Gesticulating madly, his eyes
      bulge, the veins on his neck threaten to burst.  The image
      shimmers, shifts... Wilkinson MORPHS into Hitler, spouting
      obscenities in German.

      BACK TO SCENE

      MacLeod's eyes go to the airport metal detectors at the door
      and the guard checking all packages.

      MacLeod's mouth goes dry, he blinks, flashes back to Berlin
      1944... he sees Ingrid's face floating in front of him, as
      if through several layers of gauze he hears her saying --

                                      INGRID
                    You're certain there's no other way
                    than a bomb?

      A FLASH CAMERA goes off in MacLeod's eyes.  He snaps back to
      the present, galvanized.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's it!

      Methos is bored, rubs his throbbing temples.

                                      METHOS
                    Don't suppose you have any aspirin?

      MACLEOD'S POV

      On stage beside the podium sits a small briefcase.

      He grabs Methos roughly by the shoulders.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Whatever you do don't let anyone
                    touch that briefcase.

      He turns and dashes for the exit.96510     "The Valkyrie"      49.     Final Shooting Script 9/19/96




      MacLeod rounds a corner.  The night streets are quiet.  The
      only sound, the muffled booming bass of Wilkinson's
      screechings in the background.

      He crosses the street, scans up and down... gets the BUZZ. 
      Still no one in sight.  He stops, says simply --

                                      MACLEOD
                    Dozens of innocent people are going
                    to die.

      Ingrid emerges from the shadows.  She holds a detonator in
      her hand.

                                      INGRID
                    Innocence is relative.  You've lived
                    long enough to know that.

      MacLeod looks into her eyes, sees the same rabid fire he
      just saw in Wilkinson's... he shivers involuntarily.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That cop you killed, what was his
                    crime?  He was just doing his job. 
                    He didn't care about Wilkinson, about
                    politics.

                                      INGRID
                    Just like the German officers we
                    killed with that bomb.  They were
                    just soldiers.
                          (beat)
                    The price of killing Hitler.  Except
                    we didn't.

      Ingrid doesn't blink.  MacLeod lets his gaze drift down to
      the detonator in her hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Please.  Put it down.

                                      INGRID
                    I can't.

      MacLeod reaches behind, draws his sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't want to do this.

      Ingrid looks at him.  Is it sadness in her eyes, or pity?

      MacLeod strikes the death blow.  Ingrid falls.  The detonator
      rolls safely off to one side.

      The Quickening begins, sends out showers of electrical SPARKS

      Across the way as Wilkinson's speech concludes, a bedlam of
      fanatical APPLAUSE and hysterical CHEERS gushes into the

      old friend.

      FADE IN:


      Two police cars and a Bomb Squad van are parked out in front
      of the Community Center.  The defused briefcase is safely
      stowed in the van.

      MacLeod and Methos stand off to one side, watch as Wilkinson
      gets into his car, is driven off.

                    Ingrid said something just before

                                      MACLEOD
                    She asked me what the difference was
                    between her killing them and my
                    killing her.

                                      METHOS
                    Good question.  Right up there with
                    the "chicken and the egg" one.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So you're saying there is no answer.

      A sly smirk plays across Methos' lips.

                                      METHOS
                    Oh, there's an answer.  But the real
                    question is, are you ready to hear
