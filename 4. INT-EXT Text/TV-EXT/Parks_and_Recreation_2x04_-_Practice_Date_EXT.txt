                kids that their daddy was going to be 
                okay.

                      (not listening)
                Yeah.  Hey -- I m kind of nervous about 
                this date tonight.  Can I borrow a good 
                 first date  outfit?  Like maybe some 
                cargo pants?

                              ANN
                I don t know if I d go with cargo pants. 

                                LESLIE
                What about a sexy hat?

                              ANN
                I m not sure what that even is.

                Sure.  Tonight.  Several hours from now.

  Leslie stares at Ann intensely.  

                              ANN
                Or... you could come over now?

                Sure okay that sounds good that will give 
                us more time.  Let s go!

  She runs off.  Ann glances to camera and walks after her.

                                LESLIE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                Hurry!

                Coming!


  Leslie bangs on the door to a house.  She s all riled up with 
  liquid courage.  DAVE answers.

                              DAVE
                ...Hey.

                                LESLIE
                      (super cocky)
                Yeah -- I m here.

                              DAVE
                I see that.

                                LESLIE
                I know that right now, it s today, and 
                not tomorrow, but I felt like you should 
                know that you re lucky to have me, and 
                that our first date tomorrow is gonna be 
                  off-the-charts amazing.  Up top!

  Dave gives Leslie a tentative high five.

                                LESLIE (CONT D)
                Let s do this, bitch!  I m not scared.    
                I ll go on the date right now.  

                              DAVE
                I don t think that s the best idea.  

                                LESLIE
                You know what?  Lemme in.  Move.  You 
                make a better door than a... guy. 

  Leslie pushes past him into his house.

  Beat.

                Can I help you?  At 11:48 P.M.?

                I was on my way home, and I had to pass 
                your house.  So I dropped by, instead of 
                calling.  And that pretty much brings us 
                up to date.

                      (deep breath)
                When I was sixteen I had sex with a 
                married woman.  When I was in college, I 
                smoked a decent amount of pot, nothing 
                  insane... and I cheated on a test, but in 
                my defense--

                What the hell are you doing?

                I ve done some stuff in my life that I m

                No.  I get what this is, and why you did 
                it.  

  She smiles.

                Anything you want to tell me about your

                Yeah.  One time this guy rang my doorbell 
                at midnight to brag about getting laid 
                when he was sixteen, so I murdered him.

                              MARK
                Good night.

  He heads off.
