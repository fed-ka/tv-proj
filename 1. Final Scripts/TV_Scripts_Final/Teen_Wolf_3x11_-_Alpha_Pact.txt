                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. HOSPITAL/ER RECEPTION/ELEVATOR - NIGHT11

      Darkness. Then--in a brief FLASH OF LIGHT--Stiles appears 
      with a loud CRACK. A sound like the crack of thunder. 

      Darkness again. Pitch black. Stiles calls out, but his voice 
      sounds muffled, distant.

                                  STILES (V.O)
                    Derek.

      Stiles appears again, body swinging about with another 
      CRACKING BOOM and then--darkness.

                                  STILES (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Derek, come on!

      More quick flashes as Derek blinks back to conscious. Stiles 
      SLAPS him harder, the CRACK of palm to cheek filling the 
      elevator. He pulls back, this time closing his fist when--

      Derek catches him by the wrist. Blinking, he glances about 
      the elevator and out its open doors to the deserted corridor.

                                  DEREK
                    Where is she?

                                  STILES
                    Jennifer? Gone. With Scott s mom.

                                  DEREK
                    She took her?

                                  STILES
                    Yeah. And if that wasn t enough of 
                    a kick to the balls, Scott also 
                    left with Deucalion. So get up. The 
                    police are coming and we need to 
                    get you the hell out of here.

      With Stiles s help, Derek begins to rise. But he pauses as 
      another alarming realization hits him.

                                  DEREK
                    What about Cora?      TEEN WOLF EP#311 "ALPHA PACT"GREEN4/17/132.


      INT. ARGENT S RAV4 - NIGHT22

      Foot to the brake pedal, Isaac SLAMS the RAV4 to a halt in 
      the rear parking lot of the hospital. In the back, with a 
      still unconscious Cora, Peter glances up. 

                                  ISAAC
                    You see the twins?

                                  PETER
                    No. But I see the Argents.

      Through the windshield, they spot Allison and Argent slipping 
      out of the shadows, hurrying from the building just as--

      EXT. HOSPITAL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT33

      A HOWL pierces the night, halting both Argent and Allison.

                                    ALLISON
                    What is it?

                                  ARGENT
                      A retreat.

                                    ALLISON
                    That s good, right?

                                  ARGENT
                    Maybe.

      MOVEMENT catches Allison s eye. A SILHOUETTE against the 
      building. She raises her bow, aiming at a face stepping into 
      the light--Morrell. Then, just as suddenly, she s gone. 
      Argent notices Allison lowering the bow.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    You see something?

      She searches the shadows, but finally, shakes her head.

                                    ALLISON
                    Nothing.

      INT. ARGENT S RAV4 - NIGHT44

      Isaac watches Argent and Allison hurrying toward them.

                                  ISAAC
                    Not to bring up uncomfortable 
                    memories, but wasn t the last time 
                    you saw them the night you killed 
                    Kate and they all burned you alive?      TEEN WOLF EP#311 "ALPHA PACT"GREEN4/17/133.

        CONTINUED:44

      Isaac looks back. The side door lies open. Peter is gone.

      EXT. HOSPITAL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT55

      Isaac gets out to meet Allison and Argent, all of them 
      noticing the sound of SIRENS approaching from a distance.

                                    ALLISON
                    Where are the others?

                                  ISAAC
                    I don t know. Stiles and Scott went 
                    back for Derek and Jennifer. I had 
                    to get Cora out.

      HEADLIGHTS blaze toward them, Derek s FJ CRUISER racing out 
      of the darkness. It skids to a halt next to the RAV. Derek 
      jumps out with barely a glance to them.

                                  DEREK
                    Where is she?

      Isaac opens the back door where Cora lies. Derek carefully 
      lifts her up to transfer her to his car.

                                    ALLISON
                    Where s Scott and Stiles--

                                  DEREK
                    Stiles is back at the hospital. 
                    He s going to hold off the cops for 
                    us. We need to go--

                                  ARGENT
                    What about Scott and Melissa?

                                  DEREK
                    Jennifer took Melissa.

      Now he looks at them. At their shocked expressions. The 
      hopelessness.

                                  ISAAC
                    But does that--does it mean 
                    Stiles s Dad is dead?

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know.

                                    ALLISON
                    What about Scott?

      The volume of the SIRENS rises, getting closer.      TEEN WOLF EP#311 "ALPHA PACT"GREEN4/17/134.

        CONTINUED:55

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Derek, where s Scott?

      He looks her in the eyes. A look that tells her everything. 
      As the SIRENS wail louder and louder--

      INT. HOSPITAL/ER RECEPTION - NIGHT66

      The ER doors CLATTER open. DEPUTIES and PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS 
      take over the hospital in the aftermath of the Alphas  siege.

      Seated in a waiting area chair, Stiles spots SOMEONE hurrying 
      toward him. He sees the badge first. Blue letters in a white 
      laminate around his neck - FBI. Then he sees the face, one he 
      clearly recognizes and clearly doesn t like.

                                  STILES
                    Oh, just perfect.

      The FBI AGENT approaches with a weary shake of his head.

                                  FBI AGENT
                      A Stilinski at the center of all 
                    this mess. What a shocker. Think 
                    you can give me some answers 
                    without the usual level of sarcasm?

                                  STILES
                    If you can ask them without the 
                    usual level of stupid.

                                  FBI AGENT
                    Where s your Dad and why s no one 
                    been able to contact him?

                                  STILES
                    I don t know. Haven t seen him in 
                    hours.

                                  FBI AGENT
                    Is he drinking again?

                                  STILES
                    What do you mean again? He never 
                    had to stop.

                                  FBI AGENT
                    But he did have to slow down. Is he 
                    drinking like he used to?

                                  STILES
                    How about next time I see him I 
                    give him a field sobriety test?

                    How about you just tell me what the 
                    hell happened here?

      He gestures to the wreck of the hospital.

                                  STILES
                    I don t know. I was stuck in the 
                    elevator the whole time.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT77

      At the end of an empty corridor, the elevator stands open. 
      The BELL RINGS and the doors slowly close, forming a name 
      written on the steel surface with red tape... ARGENT.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - NIGHT88

      Lips stained from BLACK BLOOD and breathing with difficulty, 
      Cora lies unconscious on Derek s bed. He sits beside her, 
      watching with worry.

                                  ISAAC
                    She s dying, isn t she?

      Derek nods.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    So what are you going to do?

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know.

        CONTINUED:88

      From a dark corner, Peter looks out, watching Isaac s growing 
      fury with interest.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Because while Scott and Stiles were 
                    out there actually trying to do 
                    something about people getting 
                    killed, you were in here rolling 
                    around the sheets with the actual 
                    killer. A serial killer, by the 
                    way. A human sacrificing, 
                      psychotic, messed-up face Druid. 
                    What the hell even is that? I mean 
                    what kind of total lack of judgment 
                    is missing from your head? Do you 
                    get how many people she s killed? 
                    Erica and Boyd are dead, Cora s 
                    dying and you re doing nothing.

      Derek takes it all with a solemn nod.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Why d you do this to us? Was it all 
                    about power? Were you bored?
                          (coming closer)
                    Were you lonely?

                                  DEREK
                    Maybe.

      The admission surprises Isaac, diminishing some of his anger. 
      But not all of it. Grabbing his jacket, he turns to leave.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    I told Cora I wouldn t leave her. 
                    I ll help the others as soon as I 
                    figure how to help her.

                                  ISAAC
                    There s no time. The full moon s 
                    coming. Melissa and the Sheriff are 
                    going to be dead. So I m going to 
                    try to help. You stay here and keep 
                      perfecting the art of doing 
                    nothing.

      He SLAMS the steel door shut behind him.

                                  PETER
                      I wouldn t take it personally.

                    He s using it to excuse shifting 
                      allegiances from one Alpha to 
                    another.

                    Scott s not an Alpha yet.

                    Maybe that s a good thing.

                                  PETER
                    I d say it depends on whether 
                    Scott s stay with the Alphas is 
                    only temporary. And not permanent.

      The ELEVATOR DOORS clang open. Stiles and Allison quickly 
      follow Argent into the apartment.

                    But she took Scott s mom and 
                    Stiles s father. That s not a 
                      coincidence.

      They pause at the desk to look down on the FIVE FOLD SYMBOL 
      etched onto its surface.

                    kind of felt like a pretty big

                    I don t think so. There s something 
                    about Jennifer s tactics. It s like

      BLACK LIGHT in one hand, Argent taps a finger to the marks on 
      the map.

                    The place where the sacrifices have 
                    been committed have usually been 
                    different from where the bodies 
                    have been found. I think the 
                    placement has to do with the 
                    strength of the Current. So there s 
                    the School, the Animal Clinic, the

                    This still looks like too much

      ragged, strained. A gasp of pain slipping from her lips.

      Derek takes her hand, intertwining his fingers with hers. 
      Then, he takes her pain. The VEINS in his hand turn BLACK, 
      rippling up his forearm. Cora breathes in deeply, body

      Lydia sits at her vanity table with her mother, Natalie 
      Martin, both of them examining the bruise on Lydia s neck 
      from the wire of the garrote.

                    Okay, sweetheart. This is not a 
                    problem. Having gotten more than my 
                    share of hickey s in high school, 
                    I ve developed some patented cover-
                    up methods.

      Rifling through the makeup drawers, Natalie pulls out 
      brushes, powder and cover-up. Lydia, however, puts a hand 
      over hers to stop her.

      She looks at herself in the mirror, holding her chin up to 
      view the bruise in the light.

      Lydia glances to her phone on the desk which VIBRATES with an

      Light spills across the Celtic knot on the floor as the vault 
      door slowly opens. Allison and Isaac cautiously follow Argent 
      into the darkened room.

                    Be careful anyway.

      He pulls out his STUN BATON. With a flick of his wrist, he 
      extends it to its full length.

                                  ISAAC

                    I do.

      He swings the baton up, pressing it to Isaac s chest. BOLTS 
      OF ELECTRICITY arcing over his body, Isaac tumbles to the 
      floor.    TEEN WOLF EP#311 "ALPHA PACT"GREEN4/17/1316.

      Before Allison can even comprehend what s happening, Argent 
      opens his hand to reveal a PAIR OF HANDCUFFS. He swiftly 
      locks one end to her wrist and another to the steel rail just 
      behind her.

                    have to trust me on this.

      He tosses his gun to the floor. It clatters harmlessly near 
      Isaac who struggles to push himself up.

                    them.

      A SHADOW falls over the Celtic symbol on the concrete floor. 
      All eyes turn to see Jennifer almost casually entering 
      through the open vault door.

      himself tied to a post in the root cellar. Amid bright shafts 
      of sunlight, he discovers he s not alone.

      Bound to another post, Stilinski watches him return to

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAY2222

      Pushing through the door, Lydia helps a still gasping Stiles 
      into the empty locker room.

                                  LYDIA
                    Just think about something else.

                    family--I mean--not family. Oh God. 
                    Okay. Just try to slow your

                    one hundred. I ll start. One 
                      hundred... ninety-nine...

      Sweat at his brow, Stiles doubles over in pain. His hand 
      clutches at his chest.

      Watching him struggle through each agonized breath, Lydia s 
      panic slips away. She calms, her voice steadying.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Stiles, look at me. Stiles.

      He looks up. And she kisses him. Pressing her lips to his as 
      she places her hands on his neck to pull him closer. His eyes 
      blink in shock, but then close as he gently kisses her back.

      Their lips part and Stiles finally lets out a long 
      exhalation, body relaxing.

                                  STILES
                    How did you do that?

                    breath can stop a panic attack.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY2323

      The door into the Guidance Office bangs open. Stiles and 
      Lydia hurry inside to find Morrell s desk empty. A familiar 
      girl named Danielle waits in a chair.

                    Well, I am. And I ve got some 
                    serious issues to work on.

                                  STILES
                    You re Danielle. You re Heather s

                                  DANIELLE

                          (nodding)
                    And I don t know why either. She s

                    I was seeing her at the beginning 
                    of the semester. She was never 
                    late. Not even a minute.

                                  STILES
                    Then she s not late. She s missing.

      He looks over the desk and begins rifling through papers. 
      Then moves to her file cabinet, yanking open drawers.

      She snatches it out of his hands. As she opens it, he peers 
      over her shoulder. So does Danielle. Among the pages they 
      find a drawing of a tree.

                                  STILES
                    Wait. That s your drawing.

                    No, it s the same exact one. Give 
                    me your bag.

      He takes her bag, unzips it, and pulls out her NOTEBOOK. 
      Flipping pages, he finds a drawing of the tree and shows her.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    See?

      Lydia stares at it in confusion. Then compares the two 
      drawings. They re exactly the same down to each branch. 
      Stiles flips the page to a third drawing. Then to another. He 
      keeps flipping pages to reveal Lydia has been drawing the 
      same tree over and over.    TEEN WOLF EP#311 "ALPHA PACT"GREEN4/17/1326.

      Stiles doesn t respond, gaze fixed on the drawing. Slowly and 
      carefully, he rotates the notebook upside down. From this 
      view, the branches of the tree don't look like branches at 
      all.

      They look like roots.

                      Stilinski.

      Two Deputies with him, the FBI Agent appears at the end of 
      the corridor. Stiles turns to Lydia, speaking fast.

                                  STILES
                    Get to Derek. He and Peter know

      With a quick nod, Lydia turns for the stairs as the FBI Agent 
      reaches Stiles, a dire expression on his face.

      A FINGER presses the button for P, lighting it. Allison pulls 
      her hand back and looks to Isaac as the elevator rises.

      The ELEVATOR BELL chimes and--

      INT. ARGENT APARTMENT/PENTHOUSE FLOOR - DAY2626

      Allison and Isaac step out of the elevator to face a door 
      marked PENTHOUSE. They stare at it, both of them nervous.

      Allison approaches, raising her hand to knock. With a breath 
      to gather her nerve, she raps her knuckles against the door.

      They wait. Allison knocks again. Silence. She raises her hand 
      to knock again, but a series of CLICKS stops her. The sound 
      of locks unlocking.

      Breath held, she and Isaac watch the knob slowly turn. The 
      door yanks open and-- 

      A PAINTER looks at them curiously. Behind him, the room lies 
      empty except for paint cans and supplies.

                    We were--um--we were looking for

                    They moved. Two days ago. Had 
                      everything out in a night. Sorry.

      Allison and Isaac glance to each other as the Painter slowly 
      closes the door on their bewildered faces.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY2727

      The setting sun bleeds in through the windows of the 
      classroom, empty except for the FBI Agent and Stiles.

                    activity in this county in the last 
                    few months. Several murders tied to

      As night falls, BLACK BOOTS trample dead leaves underfoot. A 
      woman tears through the woods, running as fast as she can. 
      Pausing for a breath, she glances back to reveal her face--

      Morrell.

      Distant but frightening HOWLS rise from the dark of the 
      woods. Turning, Morrell takes off again while--

      NOT FAR AWAY - Ethan and Aiden burst out the shadows. They 
      flip forward, landing perfectly. Aiden lifts his head to 
      catch a scent from the air as Ethan moves closer to the 
      ground, hand on the dirt.

      EXT. WOODS/TRAILS - NIGHT3030

      The searing RED of WOLF VISION. Moving through the woods. 
      Moving fast. Until a small WHITE GLOW appears, floating 
      through the field of RED.

      With the blink of an eye, the world returns to normal and the 
      white glow is revealed to be a FIREFLY. 

      Deucalion pauses on the trail, head tilted to the glowing 
      insect which flutters through the air in front of him.

                    It s because of Jennifer, isn t it? 
                    Right before all this started, a 
                    deer ran into Lydia s car. All of 
                    the cats at the Animal Clinic went 
                    crazy. Birds flew into the high 
                    school. That was all her.

                    Why did you send them after Lydia

                                  DEUCALION
                    Morrell said they were the most

                                  SCOTT
                    What does that mean?

                                  DEUCALION
                    Lydia s talents make her a perfect 
                    candidate to be an Emissary. Danny 
                    has the strength of intellect and 
                    body to make a superior wolf. So I 
                    had Ethan and Aiden keep them

                      Talia--Derek s mother and my older 
                      sister--decided she didn t want us 
                    ever going back. She knew how 
                    dangerous it was. So she took the

      The Twins close in on Morrell. She looks back--and 
          surprisingly--stops. Her hand comes up, something grasped in 
      her palm. She whirls about and sends MOUNTAIN ASH scattering 
      into the air.

      The ash whirls up in a cloud, but somehow lands in a perfect 
      circle around her. Just as the last dusting of ash falls--

      Ethan and Aiden SLAM into an invisible wall and tumble to the 
      ground.

      Kali flips out of the darkness, landing on her bare feet. She 
      rises to face Morrell. The three werewolves circle their

      But Morrell remains protected. In one very small circle of 
      mountain ash.

                    Bodies that include Ennis, by the 
                    way. My brother saved him. He was 
                    alive when Deucalion went in to see 
                    him. He wants you to go after 
                    Derek, Kali. To force his decision. 
                    If Derek joins the pack, it paves

      Kali, however, peers at him with a noticeable level of 
      mistrust.

                    Ennis if it meant getting to Scott. 
                    Getting his True Alpha in the pack.

      Deucalion s cane SOARS out of his hand into Morrell's 
      shoulder, piercing it. She stumbles, knocked out of the 
      circle.

      The Alphas start toward her, but Scott is the first to move, 
      rushing to get in between them.

                    left out.

                    You knew. I remember meeting you 
                    once, before you were Sheriff. You *
                      questioned me about a body. You 
                    knew something was up. You just 
                    weren t ready to believe it.

      Melissa watches Stilinski s reaction. Watching as he slowly 
      nods in admission.

                    You re right. There was a night. *
                    Eight years ago. The night my wife *
                    died.

      Stilinski s eyes drift, focusing on the memory.*

                    I was at the end of a shift when a

                    Just a teenager, actually. Trapped 
                    under an overturned car. We had to 
                    wait for paramedics. We were never 
                    going to get her out. But I was 
                    able to hold her hand. I tried to 
                    keep her calm. She knew she was 
                    going to die. I kept telling her 
                    the paramedics were on the way and 
                    to just hold on. Then I remember 
                    her hand suddenly gripped mine, so 
                    tight I thought she could literally 
                    break the bones. She looked me 
                    right in the eye and said  If you 
                    want to be with her, go now.  I 
                    knew right away she was talking 
                    about my wife. But that other part 
                    of my brain--the part that looks 
                    for clues, for fingerprints, 
                    logical connections--that part said 
                    she couldn t possibly know about 
                    Claudia. So I stayed until the 
                      paramedics had pulled her out. 
                    Until her heart stopped beating and 
                    they declared her dead. When I 
                    finally made it to the hospital, I 
                    saw Stiles sitting in the waiting 
                    room. Head in his hands. He was 
                    there when Claudia died. But I 
                    wasn t. Because I didn t believe. I 
                    just didn t believe.

      EXT. WOODS/ROAD - NIGHT3636

      By the Jeep's headlights, Stiles and Deaton wait in the 
      darkness. Hearing the crunch of leaves underfoot, they turn 
      to see Scott step into the light.

                    How about we concentrate on finding

                    to see it, but you ll feel it every 
                    day for the rest of your lives. 
                    It ll be a kind of darkness over

      While Peter watches, Derek grips Cora s hand. BLACK VEINS 
      ripple up his arm, into his neck, pushing his chin up, head 
      back as he struggles against the pain. 

      Until finally, Derek s mouth opens, FANGS appearing as he 
      lets loose an agonized SCREAM.    TEEN WOLF EP#311 "ALPHA PACT"GREEN4/17/1344.


      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT4242

      Seated in the water, Allison, Scott and Stiles share a look. 
      A silent moment between them, Allison and Stiles both waiting  
      for Scott s lead. He takes a breath and gives them a nod.

      One-by-one, they submerge beneath the ice and mistletoe. Eyes 
      closed, an almost peaceful look on their faces.

      Holding them down, Lydia, Isaac and Deaton throw worried 
      glances to each other.

      Underneath the water, Scott stirs. His eyes SNAP OPEN, 
      burning with a FIERCE YELLOW GLOW. A glow that just as

      overtaking his world, sending him hurtling into--

      Pitch black.
