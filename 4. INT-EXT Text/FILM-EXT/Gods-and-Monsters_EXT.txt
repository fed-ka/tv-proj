Lightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single
shattered oak in a desolate landscape.
Below, a HUMAN
SILHOUETTE stumbles through the darkness, the top of his
head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with
mud.
Suddenly the storm fades.
Light creeps into the scene, and
color, as we DISSOLVE TO:
THE PACIFIC OCEAN
melting into a hazy morning sky.
In a box canyon off the
coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a
makeshift village for beach bums.
Clay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag
that's set up behind his trailer.
Clay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in
dungarees, a T-shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped
into one sleeve.
He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto
the bed of his rusty pick-up.
Clay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the
ignition.
It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns
over.
Clay's truck sails down the road, "Hound Dog" blaring on the
radio.
MAIN TITLES END.
Sprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling
clapboard house.
Below, a swimming pool forms a perfect
rectangle of still water.
A title reads: SANTA MONICA
CANYON.
1957.
The pick-up drives past.
Clay parks in the back, hops out.
ANGLE - HOUSE
A SHADOWY FIGURE stands at a window, watching Clay unload
his red power mower.
A bean-pole child with flaming red hair (WHALE at age 12)
stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless
row of chimneys.
We're in Dudley, a factory town in the
English Midlands region known as the Black Country.
SARAH WHALE (O.S.)
Stop lagging behind, Jimmy.
We'll
be late for church.
YOUNG WHALE
Yes, Mum.
Whale runs to catch up to his six brothers and sisters.
His
father, WILLIAM WHALE, frowns at the boy's prissy trot.
WILLIAM WHALE
Straighten up, son.
Young Whale's movements thicken into a dim imitation of
manly reserve.
The Whale family marches up a steeply
mounting street to Dixon's Green Methodist Church.
Whale moves jauntily onto the front lawn, singing to
himself:
WHALE
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling
For you but not for me.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?
Grave where thy victory?
Whale steps up next to Clay.
WHALE
Good morning.
CLAY
(not looking up)
Mornin'.
WHALE
My name is Whale.
This is my
house.
CLAY
Nice place.
WHALE
And your name is --?
CLAY
Boone.
Clayton Boone.
WHALE
I couldn't help but notice your
tattoo.
That phrase?
Death Before
Dishonor.
What does it mean?
CLAY
Just that I was in the Marines.
WHALE
The Marines.
Good for you.
You
must have served in Korea.
Clay shrugs nonchalantly.
WHALE
Getting to be a warm day.
A
scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
CLAY
Yeah.
I better get on with my
work.
Whale clears his throat behind the back of his hand.
WHALE
When you're through, Mr. Boone,
feel free to make use of the pool.
We're quite informal here.
You
don't have to worry about a suit.
Clay glances warily at Whale.
CLAY
No thanks.
I got another job to
get to this afternoon.
Whale holds Clay's look.
WHALE
Some other time, perhaps?
Keep up
the fine work.
Whale heads off, smiling to himself.
Pleased to be naughty
again.
Kay's hands flap animatedly as Whale leads him down to the
pool.
KAY
I love the great horror films.
And
yours are the best.
"The Old Dark
House."
"The Invisible Man."
They
look great and have style.
And
funny!
Whale points to a small shingled house near the pool.
WHALE
This is the studio where I paint.
KAY
Nice.
(refusing to be
sidetracked)
And your lighting and camera
angles.
You're got to go back to
German silent movies to find
anything like it.
Clay Boone gulps some water from the garden hose.
He
glances down at the pool, where Kay and Whale sit in
cast-iron chairs.
HANNA
Time for you to leave.
Clay turns to Hanna, who holds a tray loaded with finger
sandwiches and a pitcher of iced tea.
CLAY
I'm on my way.
She doesn't move until Clay starts off.
Kay flips open his steno pad.
WHALE
So, Mr. Kay?
What do you want to
know?
KAY
Everything.
Start at the
beginning.
WHALE
I was born outside London, the only
son of a minister who was a master
at Harrow.
Grandfather was a
bishop.
Church of...Church of
Eng...
Whale's tongue trips on the word, his voice suddenly drowned
out by the blast of a factory whistle.
We CUT TO:
Kay clears his throat softly.
KAY
Mr. Whale?
Whale smiles politely to cover his momentary disorientation.
WHALE
Yes?
KAY
Your father was a schoolmaster?
WHALE
Of course.
I attended Eton -- it
wouldn't do for a master's son to
attend where his father taught.
I
was to go up to Oxford but the war
broke out and I never made it.
The
Great War, you know.
You had a
Good War, but we had a great one.
He glances to see if the boy smiles at the quip.
WHALE
You can't imagine what life was
like after the Armistice.
The
twenties in London were one long
bank holiday, a break from
everything dour and respectable.
I
had a knack with pencil and paper,
so I was hired to design sets for
stage productions.
Hanna comes down the path with the tray.
She places it on
the table.
WHALE
Thank you, Hanna.
Very nice.
Hanna remains planted next to the table.
WHALE
You can go now.
She makes an audible sigh and starts back up the hill.
WHALE
There was one play in particular, a
beautiful, grim study of war called
"Journey's End".
Every experienced
director turned it down, so I
offered myself, bullying and
begging for the job.
"Journey's
End" made the careers of everyone
associated with it.
It was only a
matter of time until Hollywood
beckoned.
KAY
How much longer before we get to
"Frankenstein"?
WHALE
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay,
that it's not me you're interested
in, only my horror pictures?
KAY
Oh no, I want to hear everything.
You made twenty pictures in all --
WHALE
Twenty-one.
The romantic comedies
and dramas were much more to my
liking.
The horror pictures were
trifles.
Grand guignol for the
masses.
KAY
But it's the horror movies you'll
be remembered for.
An abrupt look of anger flashes across Whale's face.
WHALE
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
KAY
No.
I never said you were.
Or
will be soon.
Kay leans over the steno pad, determined to be more worthy.
KAY
So.
"Journey's End" brought you to
Hollywood --
Whale takes in the boy's blank, bored expression.
He sighs.
WHALE
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.
This
mode of questioning is getting old,
don't you think?
KAY
I don't mind.
WHALE
Let's make it more interesting.
I
will answer any question you ask.
But, for each answer, you must
remove one article of clothing.
Kay's mouth pops open.
KAY
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
WHALE
It is, isn't it?
My life as a game
of strip poker.
Shall we play?
KAY
You're serious.
WHALE
Quite.
KAY
Then the rumors are true?
WHALE
What rumors might those be?
KAY
That you were forced to retire
because, uh -- a sex scandal.
WHALE
A homosexual scandal, you mean?
For me to answer a question of that
magnitude, you'll have to remove
both your shoes and your socks.
Kay just sits there, squinting and grinning.
KAY
You're a dirty old man.
Whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment.
Kay
kicks off his penny loafers, bends over to remove his socks.
WHALE
You are kind to indulge your elders
in their vices.
As I indulge the
young in theirs.
Two pale feet emerge.
Whale leans forward to examine them.
He leans back again.
WHALE
No.
There was no scandal.
And he reaches into his coat for a cigar.
Whale's hand
trembles as he slices a hole at the base, then lights the
cigar with a wooden match, sucking and rotating until the
tip is roundly lit.
WHALE
My only other vice.
I suppose
you'd like a fuller answer to your
question.
Kay nods.
WHALE
It will cost you your sweater.
Kay hesitates a moment, then sets his pen aside to pull the
sweater over his head, revealing a sleeveless T-shirt.
KAY
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
WHALE
You must understand how Hollywood
was twenty years ago.
Nobody cared
a tinker's cuss who slept with
whom, so long as you kept it out of
the papers.
Outside of Hollywood,
who knows who George Cukor is, much
less what he does with those boys
from the malt shops along Santa
Monica?
Kay stares at him in disbelief.
KAY
George Cukor?
Who made "A Star Is
Born"?
I never guessed.
WHALE
Take off your vest and I'll tell
you a story.
Kay plucks at his T-shirt, glancing toward the house.
WHALE
Don't be shy.
There's time to stop
before you go too far.
KAY
I guess.
Kay peels off the shirt and tosses it on his shoes and
sweater.
WHALE
George is famous for his Saturday
dinner parties.
Great artists,
writers, society folk, all rubbing
elbows with Hollywood royalty.
But
how many of those oh-so-proper
people know about the Sunday
brunches that follow?
Gatherings
of trade eating leftovers, followed
by some strenuous fun and frolic in
the pool.
(flicks an ash)
If a goat like that can continue
about his business, my more
domestic arrangements could've
raised very few eyebrows.
The revelation seems to have left Kay a little shaken.
he
flips to a blank page.
KAY
Can we talk about the horror movies
now?
WHALE
Certainly, Mr. Kay.
Is there
anything in particular you want to
know?
KAY
Will you tell me everything you
remember about making
"Frankenstein"?
He glances down at his few remaining articles of clothing.
KAY
Can that count as one question?
WHALE
Of course.
KAY
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Kay stands to unbuckle his belt, glancing around the yard
again.
He unzips and steps out of his sharply creased
flannel legs.
His thighs are thin and pale.
KAY
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
WHALE
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're
through.
I never swim myself, so
the pool tends to go to waste.
KAY
Okay.
"Frankenstein."
Tell me
everything.
WHALE
Righto.
Let me see.
Whale swallows a wince, trying to block the pain pushing
against his skull.
WHALE
Universal wanted me for another
story, and wanted me so baldly -- I
mean badly, not baldly.
I was
given the pick of stories being
developed, and I picked that one.
KAY
Who came up with the Monster's
makeup and look?
WHALE
My idea.
Muchly.
My sketches.
Big heavy brow.
Head flat on top
so they could take out the old
brain and put in the new, like
tinned beef.
KAY
He's one of the great images of the
twentieth century.
As important as
the Mona Lisa.
WHALE
You think so?
That's very kind --
Whale clutches at the air, suddenly notices that his hand is
empty.
He looks down and sees the cigar on the flagstones.
KAY
Boris Karloff.
Where did you find
him?
Whale bends down to retrieve his cigar -- and the change of
gravity drives a spike through his skull.
KAY
Karloff, Mr. Whale.
How did you
cast him?
Whale turns toward the froggy voice.
WHALE
Please.
Excuse me.
I must go
lie --
He forces himself up with one hand.
Kay finally looks up,
notices Whale's colorless lips and desperate eyes.
KAY
Mr. Whale?
Are you all right?
WHALE
I just need to -- lie down.
Studio.
Daybed in studio.
Whale lurches from the table.
Kay jumps forward, catching
him under an arm.
KAY
Oh my God.
What's wrong, Mr.
Whale?
Is it your heart?
WHALE
Head.
Not heart.
He leans against Kay, who leads him toward the studio.
WHALE
Forgive me.
Hanna runs down the path, clutching the front of her apron
in two tight fists.
Clay stops, turns around, feeling someone's eyes watching
him.
WHALE (O.S.)
(singing)
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling...
The mower slips out of Clay's hands momentarily.
he looks
around, spots Whale inside the studio.
WHALE
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
CLAY
Just got away from me.
Sorry to
disturb you.
The screen door squeaks open, clatters shut.
A leather
slipper and rubber-tipped cane appear.
Whale strolls into
view, smiling.
WHALE
I was just about to ask Hanna to
bring down iced tea.
I'd like it
very much if you'd join me.
CLAY
I stink to high heaven right now.
WHALE
The honest sweat of one's brow.
I
assure you I won't be offended.
Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for
two.
Whale's cane trembles in his skeletal hand.
His frailty
chips away at Clay's resolve.
WHALE
Or would you prefer a beer?
CLAY
No.
Iced tea's fine.
WHALE
Splendid.
Clay hoses the crumbs of grass off his arms.
He dries his
hands and arms with his hat, then wads it up and stuffs it
into his shirt to wipe out his armpits.
Clay fetches a pair of hedge clippers from his truck.
He
can't help stopping by the side-view mirror to look at his
face.
Betty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it.
Clay
catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail.
CLAY
Let's go for a walk at least.
Walk
and talk.
I really feel like
talking tonight.
Betty's eyes blink in mock surprise.
CLAY
This old guy -- he's the kind of
person I expected to meet when I
moved out here.
Someone who's done
things with his life.
BETTY
Do you realize you're more
interested in this old goober than
you ever were in me?
CLAY
It's different.
He's a man.
And
by the way you have no business
calling him a homo.
BETTY
It never crossed your mind?
CLAY
He's an artist.
Anyway, he's too
old to think about sex.
BETTY
All the old men I know think about
nothing but sex.
She opens the door of her Chevy.
Clay grabs it with both
hands to keep her from getting in.
CLAY
C'mon.
What's eating you tonight?
Betty hesitates, then looks him sharply in the eye.
BETTY
You picked up that girl right in
front of me.
CLAY
Hey, no strings, right?
That's
what you always said.
Just good
pals who have the hots for each
other.
BETTY
It still hurt.
A lot.
CLAY
I didn't mean to...
BETTY
No, I'm actually kind of glad it
happened.
It made me wonder what
the hell I was doing with my life.
Letting you pull me into bed
whenever the spirit moved you.
CLAY
You liked it too.
BETTY
Sure.
I loved it.
CLAY
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
BETTY
You know, I just can't do that
anymore.
I still have time to get
things right.
Get married again --
CLAY
You mean us?
Betty bursts out laughing.
BETTY
The look on your face!
You're not
marriage material.
You're not even
boyfriend material.
You're a kid.
A big, fun, slightly irresponsible
kid.
CLAY
I'm not a kid.
BETTY
What are you then?
What will you
be ten years from now?
Still
cutting lawns?
Still banging horny
divorcees in your trailer?
Clay glares at her, his jaw working forward in anger.
CLAY
I like my life.
I'm a free man.
BETTY
Sure you're free, for now at least.
But how long before you're just
alone?
Pathetic and alone.
Clay's anger jumps from his jaw into his shoulders and arms.
He grabs the door handle.
CLAY
So you don't want to fuck.
That's
what you're telling me?
BETTY
Is that all this conversation means
to you?
Am I going to put out or
not?
CLAY
Damn straight.
I'm sick of playing
games.
Betty quickly gets into the car.
before she can pull the
door shut, Clay slams it on her, hard.
Her hands leap in
front of her face, as if he'd hit her.
The look of fear in
her eyes startles Clay out of his rage.
CLAY
Betty, look.
This is coming out
all wrong --
She frantically turns the key in the ignition and the Chevy
pulls out.
BETTY
From here on out, Boone, you're
just another tired old face on the
other side of the bar.
The car screeches away.
Clay stumbles across the highway.
Clay comes to the dump at the end of the canyon.
He climbs
into it, kicking at loose cans.
CLAY
It's all shit!
Shit on by women!
Shit on by the Marines.
Shit on by
the world!
Fuck!
He shouts the word at the cliff, for the raw, sudden
violence of shouting.
CLAY
Fuuuck!
A dog in the carport starts to bark.
The sound of Clay's
pain echoes off the canyon as we CUT TO:
Clay carries Whale past a painted backdrop of a stormy
English countryside.
Clay prunes the roses on the front lawn.
Hanna appears,
frowning.
CLAY
Something I can do for you?
HANNA
The Master wants to know if you are
free for lunch.
I tell him you
will be having other plans, but he
insists I ask.
CLAY
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm
free until then.
HANNA
Expect nothing fancy.
Hanna goes inside.
Clay rolls the mower down the path.
Whale sits in a director's chair, a martini in one hand, a
cigar in the other, a harmless old uncle watching young men
swagger and splash in the pool.
WHALE
I think we're ready to go.
He glances over, sees Clay in plaid bathing trunks, sitting
apart from the others.
He is puffing on a Camel.
WHALE
You're up, Mr. Boone.
Clay ignores him.
Whale puts down his martini and cigar,
picks up a Polaroid camera.
He moves over to clay.
WHALE
The extras are in their places.
Now we need the star.
Wouldn't
you like to get in the pool?
CLAY
You first.
WHALE
Oh no.
I never swim.
Whale removes Clay's cigarette, crushes it with his shoe.
Behind him, the pool is now a pit full of naked shadows.
WHALE
You'll have to remove that shirt.
Whale touches Clay's bare chest.
Clay grabs hold of his
wrist, causing the old man to yelp in pain.
In the pool,
the extras shriek in alarm.
Clay's hands close tightly around Whale's throat.
The sun goes down.
Clay wearily pushes his lawnmower,
struggling to concentrate on the darkened lawn.
The smug PROPERTY OWNER peers out at Clay from behind a
screen door.
CLAY
Do you mind turning on a light?
It's getting pretty soupy out here.
OWNER
Should have been here when you said
you would.
You whack off a tow,
don't think about taking me to
court.
CLAY
You're lucky I even squeezed you in
today.
OWNER
Don't take that tone with me, bub.
There's Japs in this town that work
cheaper and do flowers too.
Clay takes a deep breath.
He can't afford to get angry.
CLAY
Will you just turn on the porch
light?
Sir?
The owner flicks on the light.
Clay and the woman go at it, their shadows visible through
the glass louvers.
Clay parks outside the local branch of the public library.
LEONARD BARNETT, 19, boyish and handsome, peers into a
periscope.
Whale stands beside him, pointing out landmarks
on the bleak landscape.
WHALE (V.O.)
Odd, how even there one could have
days when the weather was enough to
make one happy.
He and I were
standing on the fire step and I
showed him the sights of no-man's
land, through the periscope.
It
was beautiful.
The barbed wire was
reddish gold, the water in the
shell holes green with algae, the
sky a clear quattrocento blue.
And
I stood shoulder to shoulder with a
tall apple-cheeked boy who loved
and trusted me.
Whale reaches over and lays his arm across Barnett's
shoulder.
Barnett smiles timidly at him.
We CUT TO:
The sun is setting over the Pacific.
Clay stands in a phone
booth on the strand.
Hanna stands at the front door, hands tangled in her apron.
Whale tugs his hat brim at her as the car swings around the
driveway.
Whale smiles at the wide open sky overhead.
Clay steps on
the gas and the Chrysler takes off.
The party is clearly audible from the road, where Clay has
squeezed the Chrysler into a long row of shiny cars nuzzling
the high brick wall.
Whale puts his dark glasses on.
WHALE
Stars, you know.
The suns of other
galaxies.
They walk up the steep road to the gatehouse.
WHALE
Good old George.
He loves to put
on the dog.
Only his dogs tend to
have a bit of mutt.
A WOMAN at the gate inspects the invitation, waves them
through.
A sunny patio with hedges and statues.
Wickets and stakes
have been set up for a game of croquet, but only a handful
of very tanned children strut around with mallets.
WHALE
What did I tell you?
Listen.
CLAY
I don't hear anything.
WHALE
Exactly.
Cukor was too cheap to
hire music.
There's nothing but
chin-wag.
The cold dreary custard
of English chin-wag.
Whale scans the crowd.
WHALE
Slim pickings.
Well, it's early
yet.
Perhaps this is a good time
to pay our respects.
Clay follows Whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy.
A handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand
in the shade: a homely older man in glasses and a pretty
woman in a white dress with polka dots.
GEORGE CUKOR and
PRINCESS MARGARET.
WHALE
Let's get this over with quickly.
Whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward.
Before he can give Cukor their names Princess Margaret's
polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth.
PRINCESS MARGARET
I had no idea you'd be here.
She seizes Whale's hand in her little white gloves.
PRINCESS MARGARET
How are you?
WHALE
(taken aback)
Fine.
Quite fine.
And Your Royal
Highness?
PRINCESS MARGARET
Splendid.
Now that I know you're
around.
Standing beside him, Clay is clearly impressed that Whale
knows a princess.
PRINCESS MARGARET
Can we get together while I'm in
town?
I so badly want to sit for
you again.
WHALE
Sit?
PRINCESS MARGARET
I've changed my hair, you see.
Since our last session.
Those old
snaps look rather dowdy now.
Whale realizes she's mistaken him for someone else.
He tugs
his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes.
PRINCESS MARGARET
Oh dear.
Have I made a blunder?
WHALE
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.
James
Whale.
PRINCESS MARGARET
(laughs)
I am such a goose.
I mistook you
for Cecil Beaton.
It's the hat.
You're wearing one of Cecil's hats,
you know.
Whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of
humiliation.
He turns to Cukor for help.
WHALE
Hello, George.
James Whale.
David
Lewis's friend.
I once made
pictures myself, Ma'am.
GEORGE CUKOR
Yes.
Of course.
One can't throw a
rock in this town without hitting
one of us old movie directors.
Whale feels the sting.
He turns to Clay.
WHALE
Ma'am, may I present Mr. Clayton
Boone?
Clay steps forward to shake hands.
WHALE
My gardener, who insisted I bring
him today.
He so wanted to meet
royalty.
Cukor's face goes blank with indignation.
CLAY
Pleased to meet you.
PRINCESS MARGARET
Quite.
I adore gardens.
Whale narrows his eyes at Cukor and sharpens his smile.
WHALE
He's never met a princess.
Only
queens.
Cukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at
Whale.
WHALE
George, Ma'am, this has been an
honor.
An occasion to remember for
the rest of my days.
He leads Clay away and an American couple promptly crowd in
to take their place.
Striding through the garden, Whale is
obviously pleased with himself.
CLAY
What was that about?
WHALE
Nothing of importance.
Just two
old men slapping each other with
lilies.
Shall we have a drink?
Whale leads Clay to a tented bar.
Across the way, David
Lewis has come through the gate with a WOMAN on his arm.
People look discreetly, not at David but at the woman,
lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses.
CLAY
Who's that?
WHALE
David.
The friend I thought was in
New York.
CLAY
No.
The girl.
WHALE
Girl?
Oh.
Elizabeth Taylor.
Clay watches in amazement as ELIZABETH TAYLOR waves to
someone and pipes out a happy hello.
She hurriedly unties
her scarf, thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to
embrace a woman.
CLAY
Is that really her?
WHALE
David produced her last picture.
David glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat
pocket.
He sees Whale looking at him.
He puts on a tight
smile and strolls across the patio.
DAVID
What are you doing here?
WHALE
Just what I was about to ask you.
I thought you were in New York.
DAVID
I was, until last night.
Publicity
asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for
today's reception.
The waiter arrives with their drinks.
Only when Clay takes
his glass of beer does David see that Whale is not alone.
DAVID
David Lewis.
CLAY
Clay Boone.
WHALE
Our yardman.
Who was kind enough
to serve as my escort to George's
little do.
David freezes.
Whale lifts his martini glass at Clay and
takes a sip.
DAVID
Should you be drinking in your
condition?
WHALE
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
Clay clears his throat, eager to escape this domestic
squabble.
CLAY
I think I'll go look at Elizabeth
Taylor.
He hurries off.
WHALE
You should have seen Georgie's face
when he met Clayton.
DAVID
You didn't, Jimmy.
WHALE
I did.
But Princess Margaret was a
doll.
We're all equals in her
eyes.
As commoners, I presume.
DAVID
You only embarrass yourself.
WHALE
Oh dear.
I'll never work in this
town again?
DAVID
You know what I mean.
Your
reputation.
WHALE
But I have no reputation.
I'm as
free as the air.
DAVID
Well the rest of us aren't.
Can't
you remember that?
WHALE
No.
I never could.
You must
regret having had the invitation
sent.
David is looking over Whale's shoulder.
DAVID
I didn't ask George to invite you.
WHALE
Then who did?
DAVID
Jimmy, there are people here I need
to speak to.
You'll be fine on
your own?
WHALE
Yes.
Perfectly.
DAVID
All right, then.
I'll come by tomorrow
for breakfast.
Whale nods, watches David stroll over to the pool and greet
a gaggle of executives.
Whale drifts toward some deck
chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn.
He sits, takes a
sip of his drink.
Suddenly a high-pitched giggle pierces
the air.
KAY
Mr. Whale!
Whale looks out to see Edmund Kay, his interviewer from
several weeks ago, marching across the lawn.
WHALE
Mr....Kay?
KAY
Bet you thought you'd never see me
again.
I didn't know if you'd be
well enough to come to this party.
WHALE
You didn't?
KAY
I'm the one who got you on Mr.
Cukor's guest list.
WHALE
You, Mr. Kay?
How do you know
George Cukor?
KAY
I interviewed him after I met you.
I'm his social secretary now.
Well, assistant to his secretary.
WHALE
I commend you.
If you're going to
pursue poofs, go after those who
can do favors for you.
You waste
everybody's time when you court
dinosaurs.
KAY
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.
I
love your movies.
That's why I
wanted you to come to this.
So I
could see you with your monsters.
WHALE
My monsters?
KAY
Don't go away.
Whale tries to do just that, but finds himself caught in the
chair.
He is stumbling to his feet when Kay returns with
Elsa Lanchester, 55, at his side.
ELSA LANCHESTER
Jimmy.
How are you?
WHALE
Elsa?
She takes Whale's hand, with a look of deep concern and
sympathy.
Kay races off again.
ELSA LANCHESTER
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago.
She said you'd been under the
weather.
WHALE
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary.
Growing old.
ELSA LANCHESTER
We're all getting a bit long in the
tooth.
WHALE
But you appear quite fresh, my
dear.
She swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair.
ELSA LANCHESTER
Please.
You shouldn't stand on my
account.
WHALE
Perfectly all right.
But if you'd
like to sit --
ELSA LANCHESTER
I'm fine, Jimmy.
I can only stay a
few minutes.
WHALE
Of course.
ELSA LANCHESTER
What's our pesky friend up to now?
Kay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray-haired man with
a long rectangular face and wary, heavy-lidded eyes.
ELSA LANCHESTER
Is that Boris?
Our little chum
appears to be arranging a reunion.
WHALE
Oh dear.
Karloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece
ALICE, a bashful young woman who carried a blanket-wrapped
bundle.
ELSA LANCHESTER
Boris, darling.
I didn't know you
were here.
These public revels are
hardly up your alley.
BORIS KARLOFF
I came for the sake of my visiting
niece.
Alice.
And Miranda, my
great-niece.
His huge hand lifts the blanket in Alice's arms, revealing a
bald infant with enormous blue eyes.
Karloff gurgles and
coos at the child.
ELSA LANCHESTER
And what do you make of our royal
visitant?
BORIS KARLOFF
Perfectly charming.
A real lady.
ELSA LANCHESTER
Of course she's a lady.
What did
you expect?
A hussy in tennis
shoes?
Whale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind
Karloff.
He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are
listening intently to the monocled British consul.
Whale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his
once and future monsters.
Kay shouts to a passing
photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic.
KAY
Hey, you!
With the camera!
We got
a historical moment here.
Come get
a picture of it.
The man scans the scene for a famous face.
KAY
This is Mr. James Whale, who made
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of
Frankenstein."
and this is the
Monster and his Bride.
Clay looks up when he hears Kay identify Karloff.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Oh, Karloff.
Right.
Karloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale.
The
flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light.
Whale cringes
in pain.
ELSA LANCHESTER
(through clenched teeth)
Don't you just love being famous?
Another flash.
From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles
nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical
current from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.
Whale
concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his
brain.
He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand.
ELSA LANCHESTER
Are you all right, Jimmy?
A sharp nod from Whale.
The photographer motions to
Karloff's niece.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Let me get one with Frankenstein
holding the kid.
Alice hands over the baby.
Karloff gently cradles the
child.
Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right.
They
all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up.
Whale
follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks
and strains in a furious electrical storm.
The camera flashes once, then again.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Got it!
Whale glances up -- the kite is gone.
Thunder rumbles as
the group starts to disperse.
Whale nods to the faces
exchanging good-byes.
BORIS KARLOFF
So good to see you again, James.
He strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby.
KAY
Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale.
I'll make sure everybody gets sent
a print.
He goes off with the photographer.
Elsa kisses Whale on the
cheek.
ELSA LANCHESTER
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
WHALE
Good-bye.
So nice to see you...
Finally Whale is alone.
He staggers to the deck chair and
lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair.
CLAY
You okay?
Whale gazes up at Clay.
WHALE
Tired.
A bit tired.
Clay nods.
Whale smiles at him.
WHALE
Are you enjoying yourself?
CLAY
Actually, no.
I feel a little out
of place.
WHALE
Neither of us really belongs here.
CLAY
Must have been funny for you.
Seeing your monsters again.
WHALE
Monsters?
The only monsters...
(closes his eyes)
...are here.
Across the lawn, conversation has stopped.
Birdlike shrieks
come from all directions.
CLAY
Oh fuck.
And we left the top down.
You want to run for it?
WHALE
Run for what?
CLAY
Can't you see?
It's raining!
The rain is only a flickering of air, but people are jumping
and shrieking, throwing coats over their heads as they dash
toward the house.
CLAY
Here.
He takes Whale under the arm, helps him up and escorts him
to a small tent.
On the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes
to get through the one open door.
Whale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge.
From his POV,
we see a young man step into the rain.
Whale squints, is
finally able to identify the man as Leonard Barnett.
Whale's eyes follow Barnett as he emerges onto a new
landscape, a scarred and barren battlefield.
As the storm
continues to rage:
CLAY (O.S.)
Mr. Whale?
Whale shifts his gaze to Clay.
He takes a moment to orient
himself.
WHALE
Let's get out of this funk hole
CLAY
You don't want to wait it out?
Rain should let up soon.
WHALE
We're not sugar.
We won't melt.
Whale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the
downpour.
Clay has no choice except to follow.
They walk
briskly, the minute splashes on Whale's hat forming a
ghostly aura of spray.
We race along the open trench with Whale, the darkened sky
intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire.
He reaches
the periscope, pulls an enlisted man off it.
From his POV,
we see Barnett and McGill dodging bullets as they attempt to
make their way back.
WHALE
(through clenched teeth)
Come on.
Come on.
McGill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench.
Barnett follows.
Just as his feet leave the ground his
chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire.
Whale's eyes
snap closed, trying to obliterate what they've just seen.
WHALE (V.O.)
Barnett's body fell in wire as
thick as briers.
It was hanging
there the next morning, a hundred
yards from the line, too far out
for anyone to fetch it.
We're back to the scene that opened the movie, a flat-topped
creature stumbling through the mud.
A flash of lightning
reveals Clay's face.
He turns, signals for Whale to follow
him.
Whale joins Clay on a slight rise of ground, the rim
of a crater.
Clay points down into it.
The crater is full of bodies gathered around a pool of
water.
Whale stumbles down, reaches the bottom and bends
over the nearest corpse in khaki.
It is Leonard Barnett.
There are no wounds on his body, no rips or gaping holes.
His eyes are closed in dreamless sleep.
Whale looks up and sees that Clay is gone.
The only other
living creature is an owl, which blinks wearily at him.
Whale lies down, finding a spot next to Barnett.
He takes a
last breath and closes his eyes.
We CUT TO:
Clay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope.
Clay leaps headfirst into the water.
Whale rests lightly on
his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair.
Clay
hauls the body toward the side.
CLAY
Almost there.
Almost there.
He gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over
the curb.
he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in
the grass.
He grabs the wrist.
Nothing.
CLAY
Son of a bitch.
You crazy son of a
bitch.
Clay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his
rib cage.
But it's no use.
Clay sits up and takes a deep
breath.
HANNA
Ohhh!
Hanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk.
She
stares at Clay.
CLAY
I didn't do it.
This wasn't me.
HANNA
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
CLAY
He wanted me to kill him, but I
didn't.
He did it himself.
HANNA
He says here good-bye.
I find it
in his room.
He is sorry, he says.
He has had a wonderful life.
She waves a folded piece of paper.
HANNA
You poor, foolish man.
You
couldn't wait for God to take you
in his time?
Clay slowly stands up.
Hanna looks around in panic.
HANNA
You must leave.
You were not here
this morning.
CLAY
But I didn't do this!
HANNA
The police will not know that.
They will want to investigate.
CLAY
We have his note.
HANNA
Do you want to be questioned about
you and Mr. Jimmy?
Please,
Clayton.
It will be better if I
find the body alone.
CLAY
But how're you going to explain
this?
(points at the body)
How did you get him out of the
pool?
HANNA
You are right.
Yes.
We must put
him back.
They both hesitate, looking down at Whale.
Then Clay drags
the body parallel with the pool.
Hanna stoops over to
adjust the collar of Whale's shirt.
HANNA
Poor Mr. Jimmy.
We do not mean
disrespect.
You will keep better
in water.
She nods to Clay.
He rolls the body over and it splashes on
its belly.
It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash,
then begins to sink.
As it drops, the air in the chest
slowly flips the body around.
Looking up at them with open eyes, Whale sinks backward into
the thickening light.
His arms trail upward and the hands
lightly flutter as if waving good-bye.
The melancholy sound
of a solo violin pierces the silence as we CUT TO:
A black-and-white scene from "Bride of Frankenstein."
The
old BLIND MAN plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while
the MONSTER listens outside, moved by the music.
He smashes
open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the
soul-soothing sound.
The blind man stops playing, looks up.
BLIND MAN
Who is it?
You're welcome, my
friend, whoever you are.
The Monster attempts to communicate, manages only a
plaintive moan.
The blind man stands.
BLIND MAN
I cannot see you.
I cannot see
anything.
You must please excuse
me.
But I am blind.
The Monster holds out his burned hands.
BLIND MAN
Come in, my poor friend.
No one
will hurt you here.
If you're in
trouble, perhaps I can help you.
The old man touches the Monster, who recoils with a
defensive growl.
BLIND MAN
Can you not speak?
It's strange.
Perhaps you're afflicted too.
I
cannot see and you cannot speak.
Clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn.
The sky
momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning.
Clay gazes up at the electrical storm.
He glances back at
his house, sees Dana cradling the baby in an upstairs
window.
The skies open with a shattering crash of thunder.
Clay
tilts up his face, drinks in the cool rain.
Then he extends
his arms and staggers along the sidewalk, imitating the
Monster's famous lurch.
We PULL BACK, revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small
houses and neat lawns, until Clay is only a small dot in the
landscape.
FADE OUT.
