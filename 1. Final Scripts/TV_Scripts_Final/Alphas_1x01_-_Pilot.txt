                              ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      INT.  HALLWAY - FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

      A drab strip of corridor that connects an underground parking 

      lot to the FEDERAL COURTHOUSE in Manhattan.  

      A man whom we will know as THE WITNESS - a Vietnamese man in 
      an inexpensive suit and tie - is being led by his lawyer and 
      two of NYPD s finest to a service elevator.

      The Witness is sweating bullets, nervously glancing at every 

      open door or passing sound. A loud CLANG makes him flinch.

      It s just the service elevator, coming to a stop.  


      The COPS look at each other, roll their eyes.  Talk about 
      paranoid.  


      INT.  COURTHOUSE - ELEVATOR BANK - MAIN LEVEL


      Elevator doors slide open.  The Witness and his escorts exit, 
      walk past a glass divider and a bank of metal detectors 
      manned by NYPD.  Clearly a very secure area.  As they exit 

      the elevator, we hear pre-lapped dialogue, the mannered lingo 
      of a depositional hearing --

                                  PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                    ...in previous testimony you... excuse 

                    me... you told police investigators 
                    Frankel and Pierce that from March 
                    2005 to...uh...

      The Witness heads towards a set of double doors, warily 
      eyeing his destination.  

      NOW WE REVEAL 

      A man in a suit, watching this procession with a keen eye.  
      His name is MOREZ, and we will remember him because of his 
      distinctive METAL BRIEFCASE, with an enigmatic symbol etched 

      into its side.  

      Morez watches as the Witness disappears through the doors of 
      the deposition room. He pulls out a cell phone and dials.  We 
      hear the phone connect, and Morez presses a button.   

      The sound we hear is muffled, through a phone speaker, but it 
      is still instantly recognizable as one of those ubiquitous, 
      annoying RINGTONES.  


























































          SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              2.



                                  PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                    ... from March 05 to November 07, you 
                    received more than 12.5 tons of nearly 
                      pure-grade heroin from the defendant, 
                    Juan Carlos Sanchez.  


      INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

      A simple, box-like space, with a large conference table in 
      the center, chairs all around.  No windows, no contact with 
      the outside world except a single, small vent in the wall 
      blowing air back into the room.  THIS ROOM IS SEALED TO THE 
      OUTSIDE WORLD.

      A sweaty PROSECUTOR looks up from his notes as another lawyer 
      adjusts the DEPOSITION MICROPHONE, bolted into the table in 
      front of the witness. The witness stares at the Prosecutor, 
      terrified and mute.    

                                  PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                    Will you please confirm that the 
                    testimony you gave these officers was 
                    both truthful and accurate? 

      The witness swallows hard, then whispers something to his 
      LAWYER, seated next to him.  They briefly confer. 

      The Prosecutor exchanges a look with his Assistant US 
      Attorney.  Is this guy gonna roll on them or not?  The 
      Assistant shrugs.  

                                  PROSECUTOR (CONT D)
                            (forcefully)
                    Mr. Duong, your plea agreement with 
                    the prosecution is predicated on your 
                    testimony against Mr. Sanchez. Should 
                    you decline a response, there will be 
                      consequences and you will have to live 
                    with them.  

      The witness nods.  He leans forward to speak, clearing his 
      throat...

      And at that moment, at the precise instant that he opens his 
      mouth...

      We HEAR SOMETHING.  

      Not loud, but distinctive and sharp, the "plock" of a pebble 
      bouncing off your windshield when you're doing seventy on the 
      highway.

      The lawyers flinch, everyone looks around, trying to find the 
      source...

      Except the Witness.

      He does nothing.  His eyes go glassy, rolling back a bit.  
      And then a trickle of blood snakes its way down from a dark, 
      red spot, dead center between his eyes.  

                                  PROSECUTOR (CONT D)
                    Mr. Duong?

      The Witness falls forward, head thumping against the 
      microphone.  And that's it.


      He's dead. The screen goes black.  And over it, we hear a 
      voice. 

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    The most magnificent creation the 
                    universe has ever known is the human 
                    brain.  

      MONTAGE BEGINS

      The line between what is possible and what is real will be 
      razor thin on this show, as evidenced in the following 
      montage.  The images that come up are a combination of ACTUAL 
      VIDEOS CULLED FROM YOUTUBE and stuff that we create to look 
      like the same.

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And yet, the brain remains a mystery 
                    to us.  Most of us live our lives in 
                    ignorance of its potential.

      - We see through the window of a 24 Hour gym in a strip mall, 
      where people are marching like automatons on a row of 
      stairmasters.  

      - We see face-masked workers on an assembly line repeating 
      the same task over and over.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But not everyone.  A few have 
                    dedicated themselves to exploring the 
                    outer limits of their most miraculous 
                      possession.  

      And now we see the real eye-grabbing stuff.  

      - A YOUNG BOY, age 7, plays Rachmaninoff to perfection. 












































































































































































          SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              4.



      - A YOGI, sitting in the lotus position, lowers his heart 
      rate to thirty.

      - KASPAROV defeats Deep Blue in a game of Chess. 

      - TIGER WOODS bounces a golf ball on his club in an amazing 
      display of dexterity.

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Musical skill, computation, heightened 
                      concentration, control of the 
                    autonomic nervous system, uncanny 
                    recall of vast information -- the 
                    potential of the human brain seems 
                    infinite.

      - A man in his twenties named GARY BELL paints a perfect, 
        photo-realistic portrait of Manhattan from memory. 

      - A HYPNOTIST gets a NEWLYWED COUPLE to act like chickens in 
      front of a packed audience.

      - MICHEL GONDRY solves a Rubik s cube with his feet in ten 
      seconds. 

      - Some KID performs an amazing quarters shot, bouncing ten 
      coins into ten separate cups with a single toss.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Such gifts come at a price, however.  
                    More often than not, these increased 
                      capabilities carry with them a 
                    crippling deficiency in other areas. 



      INT.  SUBURBAN HOME - MORNING

      On the face of it, there is nothing unusual about the BELL 
      household.   But as we follow SANDRA BELL (early fifties, 
      single mom) carrying a load of laundry, we begin to notice 
      something strange; THE NOISE. 

      Every electronic appliance in the house is on; the stereo, 
      the TV, even a white noise machine in a hallway.  In the 
      center of this cacophony is the painter with the photographic 
      memory, Sandra's only son, GARY, a 25-year-old, highly-
      functioning autistic.   

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    ...the ability to memorize and 
                    reproduce enormous amounts of 
                      information, flawlessly...






































































































































































































































          SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              5.



      Gary sits in the living room, playing his PSP and watching 
      the weather channel at the same time.   The sound doesn't 
      seem to faze him in the slightest.  As Sandra gets him ready 
      to go to work, we sense just how difficult it can be, caring 
      for a grown man who is still in many ways a child. 

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...is coupled with a reduction in 
                    emotional understanding, a condition 
                    often described under the rubric of 
                    autism. 


      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

      BILL HARKEN, a cup of coffee in his hand, emerges from his 
      apartment building on Third Avenue (one of those dorm-like hi-
      rises in the so-called  Jello Shot District. ) He s a burly, 
      imposing, former frat-boy with a temper that he struggles to 
      control.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    Others can tap into our brain s most 
                    ancient structures, drawing on primal 
                    instincts and responses, turning them 
                    on and off at will...

      He arrives at his car, an American-made sedan, the kind a cop 
      would drive. In a typical, New York City move, drivers in 
      front and behind him have wedged him in, inches of clearance 
      at each bumper.  Harken grimaces.   


                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    ... but this too comes at a price.  
                    Some of our neural responses are out 
                    of our control for good reason. 

      Harken throws the car in reverse and mashes fenders with the 
      guy behind him.  He steams for a moment, curses.  Then gets 
      out of his sedan and marches over to the offending car and...  

      JAMS HIS THUMB INTO THE FRONT TIRE, AMAZINGLY PUNCTURING IT.  

      Air hisses out of the tire, leaving us to wonder where a man 
      like Bill Harken might have developed the strength to do such 
      a thing.  He gets back in his car and drives away.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    Still others have developed skills 
                    that give them control over the minds 
                    of others.

      INT. NINA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

      NINA THEROUX opens her eyes and rolls over in bed to discover 
      her latest conquest is already up and getting dressed.  

      Nina s in her early thirties, sexy, and powerful in ways that 
      most women can only imagine.  She has a confidence that comes 
      from getting exactly what she wants, all the time-- 

      Like this guy.  He s a decade younger with model good looks.   
      He glances over at Nina who is naked beneath the sheets.  He 
      seems confused, almost like he doesn't remember how he got 
      here.  Before he can finish throwing on his outfit, a parking 
      attendant uniform, Nina motions for him to come back to bed.  
      He is hesitant.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    Through processes we are only 
                    beginning to understand, they can 
                    affect the states of another s brain, 
                    forcing whatever response they desire. 

      Nina places her hand on his arm, says a few words.  He leans 
      in and kisses her, starts pulling off his clothes again.   

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    These abilities are the most powerful, 
                    and accordingly the most frightening 
                    to contemplate. 


      EXT. OFFICE PARK - MORNING

      An anonymous office complex in Rockland County, thirty miles 
      north of New York City, on the Jersey side.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    My name is Dr. Leigh Rosen, and it is 
                    my mandate to find these people, to 
                    help them and train them.  We work for 
                    the United States Government, under 
                    the auspices of the National Security 
                    Agency. Our existence is classified... 
                    or should I say, was.   

      Across the street is a Starbucks, a Chinese Restaurant and a 
      24 Hour gym.  Whatever visions you had of hi-tech 
        headquarters or secret lairs beneath the subway system - 
      forget it.  Section 8 rents office space like the rest of 
      America.

      INT. ROSEN S OFFICE - DAY

      We find Rosen at his desk, typing the opening chapter of a 
      book on an old Smith Corona daisy wheel, clearly an 
      affectation given the fancy desktop sitting idle a few feet 
      away.    


                                  ROSEN 
                          (reading to himself)
                    For while this book is intended to be 
                    a work of science, recounting case 
                    studies and my conclusions, the 
                    secrets that will be revealed might 
                    change the very nature of what it 
                    means to be human.   
                          (backing up, reading it 
                            again, making changes)
                      ...inherently make it.. Change the 
                    very... change the fabric of...

      He suddenly stops, yanks the piece of paper out of the 
      typewriter.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Ugh.  So maudlin, Leigh.  

      He crumples up that page and tosses it.  He takes the rest of 
      a stack he has written and straightens them into a neat pile, 
      the top page marked  INTRODUCTION.   He opens a locked 
      drawer, then drops the new pages down on about seven hundred 
      others he will never show anyone. 

      He locks the drawer, then picks up an unrelated FOLDER  
      sitting on his desk.  He gets up to leave, the file under his 
      arm. 


      INT. SECTION 8 HALLWAY - MORNING

      Rosen crosses through a mundane-looking office space -- grey 
      carpeting, utilitarian furniture and a bank of fluorescents 
      that flicker and buzz.  The space could have been a dentist s 
      office in a former life. 

      Along the way, he peeks his head into an open office.

      Inside, NINA is taking off designer sunglasses and shaking 
      out her hair as she faces another work week.  Rosen holds up 
      the folder.

                                  ROSEN
                    Good morning.  Conference room, ten 
                    minutes. 

      Nina grimaces, and Rosen continues to...


      INT. SECTION 8 - BREAK ROOM - MORNING

      Plastic table and chairs, candy and soda vending machines 
      against one wall.  

      Gary Bell is putting his lunch in the refrigerator, clearly 
      marked  Gary s Lunch Please DON T TOUCH  in his Mom s 
        handwriting.  

      Rosen puts a kettle on the range and grabs a mug and tea bag.

                                  ROSEN
                    How was your weekend, Gary?

                                  GARY
                    I have ascended to the rank of Master 
                    Sergeant by unlocking achievements on 
                    the arid sand dunes of Arochim.  

                                  ROSEN
                      Wonderful.  Ten minutes, okay?  

      Gary nods and Rosen exits.    


      INT. SECTION 8 BULLPEN - MORNING

      Harken enters, now on his second cup of coffee.  As he 
      hurries towards his desk, he almost collides with the one 
      member of our team that we still haven t met-- 

      RACHEL MYERS.  

      You can understand why someone might walk right into her.  
      She s a classic wallflower, shy and quiet.  She s in the 
        purposefully modest dress and head scarf of a woman from an 
      orthodox Jewish home.

                                  HARKEN
                    Jesus.  You scared the piss outta me.    

      Rachel steps out of his way, her eyes on the floor.  She 
      doesn t say a word.  On her neck we notice a discrete 
      ELECTRONIC DEVICE resting against her larynx.  












































































































































































































































































































































































































































































          SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              9.


      It s a strange little bit of technology, more advanced 
      looking that one might expect.  This is something that will 
      be commonplace in the world of Section 8.

                                  HARKEN
                    You never showed up Saturday.  We 
                    coulda used you.  

      Rachel still doesn t respond.  

                                  HARKEN
                    You got an explanation for that?


                                  NINA (O.S.)
                    Sabbath.  

      Nina walks by.  Harken looks at her, quizzically. 

                                  NINA
                      Saturday s the Sabbath, you idiot.  
                    She can t work.  

      Rachel gives Harken a look, then scurries away to her office.  
      Harken shakes his head.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Like I m supposed to know that.  Girl 
                    doesn t say a word.   


      INT. RACHEL S OFFICE - DAY

      Rachel sits in her office, marking up a copy of the New Dehli 
      Post with a hi-liter.  Her office is cluttered with 
      computers, magazines, newspapers and non-fiction books.   She 
      spends her days looking for  chatter  that might signify 
      alpha activity, a job she attacks with focused precision.  

      Rosen appears at the door and waves the folder. 

                                  ROSEN
                    Great find, my dear.  Looks like we 
                    may have something.  

      Rachel allows herself a satisfied smile.

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    We have a witness, a small-time drug 
                    dealer turning state s evidence 
                    against an international ring of 
                    heroin smugglers...

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY -- LATER

      Nina, Harken, Rachel and Gary sit around the conference 
      table, Rosen paces, presenting the case Rachel found.  

                                  ROSEN 
                    Murdered during a deposition, the 
                    cause of death a bullet to the brain. 


      The tone at this meeting is as informal as you can imagine.  
      People talking over each other, getting up to get coffee and 
      returning. They talk about the things that people who work 
      together talk about;  the parking, the kitchen and who 
        does/doesn t clean it up, gossip.   

      Gary is particularly bad at waiting his turn, randomly 
        interrupting to announce some pertinent piece of information, 
      like, for example, that he detests any type of cheese that is 
      white and that cat dander is corrosive to leather.  


      Nina reads a magazine while sipping from a glass of water 
      fizzling with two alka-seltzer.  

      The world of the office should feel improvisational in tone, 
      hyper-real, even mundane at points; a sharp contrast with 
      some of the extraordinary things we will see.   

                                  ROSEN
                    No one in the room saw a shot fired.  
                      Ballistics are inconclusive.  A 
                    classic, locked-room mystery.

      Harken notices Nina sipping her alka seltzer cocktail.  

                                  HARKEN
                    You re a little old to be out drinking 
                    like a sorority sister, dontcha think?  

                                  NINA
                    Bite me.

                                  ROSEN
                          (nodding to Rachel)
                    The reportage in today s paper leaves 
                    key details out, but Rachel s source 
                    inside the DOJ confirm her suspicions. 
                    She believes there is something here.  
                    And so do I.

                                  HARKEN
                    You sure this is an alpha, and not 
                    something else?  

                                  ROSEN
                    I m sure of nothing in this green 
                    world, Bill, but we get nowhere 
                    without striving forward, am I right?  
                          (beat)
                    You know the drill.  Let s get to it 
                    people.  

      Nina yawns.  


      EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

      Nina and Gary make for an unlikely pair as they arrive at the 
      Federal Courthouse.  Gary is taking note of everything around 
      them, collating it all in that magnificent brain and spitting 
      it back out.  They talk over each other...
                        GARYNINA
      Less than thirty percent of Fascinating, Gary.  I never 
      the building still contains knew that.  Please don t 
        metal-sheath wiring.  More stop. 
      than sixty eight percent 
      contains mineral-insulated 
      cable allowing the maximum 
      current flow according to the 
      electrical safety code...    


      They go inside the building.


      INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

      The Courthouse is swarming with police officers, but many of 
      them stop what they re doing to check Nina out.  She knows 
      how to work it, she likes the attention.  She responds with a 
      flirty smile, a wink to the cuter guys in their blues.

                                  GARY
                      Construction on the Foley Square 
                      courthouse was completed April 
                    seventh, 1935 with additional 
                      renovations made in 1971 and 1993.

      On Gary s IPHONE, his fingers flip through page after page of 
      blueprints.  He doesn t blink.  He is literally memorizing 
      the plans of the building as they walk.

                                  NINA
                    That s even more interesting than the 
                    stuff about mineral insulated wiring.  
                    How about you tell me where the 
                      Deposition Room is?  

      Gary leads Nina to a door marked STAIRWELL at the back of the 
      lobby.  They slip through it.  


      INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE -- MANHATTAN BRANCH - DAY

      At the FBI Building in Manhattan, we pan through the bustle 
      of one of the nation s busiest field offices: phones ringing,  
      people working, Agents heading in and out on important cases, 
      TO FIND...

      BILL HARKEN making his way through the rows of cubicles.  
      He s uncomfortable, avoiding eye contact, particularly when 
      he is recognized by a former coworker.  He can feel the 
      conspiratorial whispers behind his back. The occasional nod 
      hello is always awkward. 


      Whatever made him leave, it s not something he s proud of.  

                                  QUINN (O.S.)
                    Nobody s asking who did this, we all 
                    know who did it.  


      INT. AGENT QUINN S OFFICE - DAY

      Harken sits behind the desk that bears the nameplate of  
      AGENT GERALD QUINN, sifting through a box of files marked 
      Sanchez.  We hear Quinn s voice, although he is out of view.  

                                  QUINN (O.S.)
                    Sanchez is the biggest narcotics 
                      trafficker in the world, two of his 
                    top guys in South East Asia flipped, 
                    so he s taking em out before they 
                    testify.  

      Reveal Agent QUINN, a fit guy in his late fifties, rolling 
      his back on one of those big red playground balls, trying to 
      loosen up. 

                                  QUINN
                    Only question is who he paid to pull 
                    the guy s ticket.   

                                  HARKEN
                    How it got done is another question.   














































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              13.



                                  QUINN
                    Inside job.  Someone in the room. 

      Harken, glancing the CSI report, seems skeptical.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Slug was from a thirty-aught-six.  You 
                    telling me someone in the room had a 
                    rifle?

                                  QUINN
                    I m saying an inside job.  Only thing 
                    that makes sense. 
                          (switching subjects)
                    How s Nancy, by the way?

                                  HARKEN
                    Dead to me. 

                                  QUINN
                    Nice, mother of your child. Very nice. 

      Quinn gets to his feet and continues his stretching, touching 
      his toes, extending his arms above his head.

                                  QUINN
                    She letting you see Anna?  

                                  HARKEN
                    She doesn t make it easy. Could you 
                    please stop with that?   

      Quinn has now moved onto legs, doing some pretty silly 
      looking knee lifts.  

                                  QUINN
                    This is why I can sit in a chair all 
                    day.  You ll see, when you get to be 
                    my age.  You ll wish you did this. 

                                  HARKEN
                          (re: the files)
                    There s nothing in here. Not one lead.  
                    You guys punting this case? 

                                  QUINN
                    You kidding?  DOJ s going nuts. The 
                    other witness, the dead guy s partner.  
                    A Mr. Non Duc Minh.  They got him in 
                      protective custody, secret service, 
                    the works.  Believe me, nobody s 
                    punting.

      Harken packs up a few files.  After a beat...

                                  QUINN
                    What do you do, Bill?  

                                  HARKEN
                    Huh?  

                                  QUINN

                    I mean, seriously. One week you come 
                    in here, asking for a file on some 100 
                    year old Soviet chess master, then its 
                    info on an enemy combatant at 
                      Guantanamo.  Now this thing.  

                                  HARKEN
                    It s a job.    

                                  QUINN
                    You get booted from here, one step 
                    from ending up behind bars, and next 
                    thing you re working for the NSA?  
                    What exactly are you doing for these 
                    people, Bill?    

      Harken gives him a look. A look between two old friends that 
      says  Don t ask.   Quinn shrugs.  

                                  QUINN
                    Fine, I m tired of grilling you.  Get 
                    out of here.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Thanks for this, Gerry.  
                          (holding up the CSI 
                            report)
                    I m gonna take this with...

      Quinn nods, watches as Harken goes.  He s concerned.  


      INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

      The same room we began our story in, preserved in a frozen 
      state of chaos.  Chairs overturned from the panic following 
      the witness s death. The microphone has been unscrewed from 
      the table. And a taped chalk outline where he slumped over.   

                                  NINA (O.S.)
                    I think I know which seat he was in.

      Reveal Nina, in the middle of the room, poking around. Gary 
      is just standing there, staring at the wall.  Her gallows 
      humor is lost on him.  

                                  NINA
                    You got something for me?  

                                  GARY
                    Yes. I m thinking.

                                  NINA
                    Cause I got no clue what you re

                                  GARY
                    Be quiet, I m thinking.  

                                  POLICE DETECTIVE (O.S.)
                    Hey!

      They both turn to look, a young, handsome POLICE DETECTIVE 
      pulls the tape aside and enters the room.  

                                  POLICE DETECTIVE
                    You can t be in here.  This area s 
                      restricted.  

                                  NINA
                    It s not a problem.  

      The detective cuts her off.  Repeats his question more 
      emphatically.

                                  POLICE DETECTIVE
                    Whattya mean not a problem?  It s a 
                    big problem, who are you people?   

      When Gary answers, it s a stream of information delivered in 
      the mechanical cadence of someone with no internal filter.   
      It's both disconcerting and funny.

                                  GARY
                    We are part of a secret organization, 
                    and we cant tell you about it.  If you 
                    don t let us do stuff then we can t 
                    stop the bad guys and everybody will 
                    die, so stop bugging us.

                          (cutting Gary off)
                    Gary, that s enough.

                      Detective, walk with me a second.

      She puts a firm hand on his shoulder.  But this isn't a 
      friendly or suggestive move, it has a purpose.  

      CLOSE ON HER FINGERTIPS

      As they press against the skin on his neck.  Something is 
      happening here.  Nina is doing something to him.  

                                  NINA
                    Who WE are isn t important.  You don t 
                    care who we are.  What you wanna do is 
                    go downstairs and tell everyone to 
                    stay out of this room.  Then you ll 
                    forget we ever spoke. 
                          (beat)
                    Now, tell me what you're gonna do.

      We notice, now, that the detective's pupils are dilated, his 
      body relaxed, his whole demeanor having shifted from a moment 
      before.  

      His response is strangely muted, almost like he s talking to 
      himself.  


                                  POLICE DETECTIVE
                    I don t care who you are.  I m gonna 
                    tell everyone to stay out.  Gonna 
                    forget we spoke.  

                                  NINA
                    Okay, go.

      The detective heads for the door, but then... 

                                  NINA
                    Wait! 
                          (he stops)
                    Are you single?

      The detective holds up his hand, showing his wedding ring.  
      He tries to talk again, the words barely coming, but Nina 
      just cuts him off.

                                  NINA
                    Never mind.  Take off.

      And the detective leaves, just like that.  Nina shuts the 
      door after him.  

                                  GARY
                    You did it to him?  
                          (no answer from Nina)

        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              17.

                                  GARY(cont'd)

                    Dr. Rosen says we re not supposed to 
                    use our skills unless it s an 
                      emergency.

                                  NINA
                    You got ten minutes before that cop 
                    gets it together and comes back.  So 
                    hurry up.   

      Gary resumes his silent vigil, and now we realize that he is 
      staring at the VENT up near the ceiling.  There s a small 
      DENT in one of the louvers. He raises his hands in front of 
      his face and begins gesticulating.  It looks like the 
      stereotyped behavior seen in many autistics...

                                  NINA
                    What is it, Gary?  What cha got? 

      ...but in Gary s case, it has a very specific purpose.  

      We SUDDENLY SHIFT INTO GARY S POV --

      Gary s view of the world is like a hyper-detailed, all 
      knowing Google Maps with the 3D rendering software built in. 
      He uses his hands to explore and manipulate the OVERLAID 
      BLUEPRINT of the Courthouse, revealing that the VENT actually 
      extends away from the room and all the way across the 
      building.   

      BACK IN REALITY, something has clicked for Gary.  

                                  GARY
                    We need to go to the bank.  

      Off Nina's confused look...


      EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

      An aerial shot closes in on the rooftop of a century-old 
      Savings and Loan.  A lone figure stands near the ledge.  It s 
      Rosen.  He s gazing out across the city, mentally working 
      through the details of some conundrum. 

      The door to a nearby stairwell opens.  Nina and Gary walk out 
      onto the roof, followed a moment later by Rachel and Harken. 

                                  HARKEN
                    We re meeting on top of buildings now? 

                                  NINA
                    Nice view.  





















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              18.



                                  HARKEN
                    Thirty dollars for parking. I m in a 
                    red zone.  I m probably getting towed.  

      Rosen squints off into the hazy distance.  Several blocks 
      away is the Courthouse.

                                  ROSEN
                    So he would have been standing right 
                    about here.  Is that right, Gary?

      Gary moves next to Rosen, then points to a spot several feet 
      to the left.  

                                  GARY
                    No, here. 

                                  ROSEN
                    Very well, the shooter was standing 
                    here when he took the shot.  

                                  HARKEN
                    That killed the witness in the Sanchez 
                    case?  He would have to put that slug 
                    through three feet of masonry and five 
                    interior walls.   

                                  ROSEN
                    Not if the bullet entered the 
                      courthouse through an air vent as Gary 
                    has suggested.  

      Rosen nods to Gary.  

                                  GARY
                    I saw an abrasion.  In the air vent  
                    And I followed it.    

      The rest of the team is confused.  

      And now we go into-- A VISUAL RECREATION OF THE SHOT.


      THE CAMERA FLIES off the building following the trajectory of 
      the imaginary bullet as it hurtles towards a vent in the side 
      of the courthouse...

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    The shooter fired a single round which 
                    travelled in through an exterior 
                    manifold.

      The bullet POV enters the intake housing where it makes its 
      way through the ventilation system.

                                  ROSEN
                    ...along the ventilation shaft, and 
                    into the deposition room, where it 
                    caromed off the baffle of the vent, 
                    striking the victim in the head.

      It hits the vent, scraping it, then caroms off and...

      PLOCK!  Hits the Witness  right between the eyes.

      BACK ON SCENE

      Gary is seeing the whole thing in his mind s eye. 

                                  GARY
                    The shot is possible with a margin of 
                    error less than .0007797 millimeters.

                                  HARKEN
                    And he factors in a bird farting a 
                    mile away.  It s crazy.  

      Rachel has been studying the ground near where they are 
      standing.  Wearing surgical gloves, she searches through the 
      gravel until she finds something...

                                  RACHEL
                            (whispering)
                    Maybe not so crazy.

      She holds up her discovery a dented brass object about two 
      inches long.  It s THE CASING. 

      From a SNIPER BULLET.  

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:

      FADE IN:


      INT. SECTION 8 OFFICE - DAY

      Rosen and Harken are walking through the office.  Harken is 
      examining a photo taken from a miliary ID card.  It shows a 
      guy in his late twenties, handsome, enigmatic, if not a 
      little troubled.  His name appears in bold letters...

                                  HARKEN
                    Christian Hicks.  This is him?

                                  ROSEN
                    It was his fingerprint.  
                          (to himself)
                    Where did I leave them?  

                                  HARKEN
                    You sure you want to go after this 
                    guy?  

                                  ROSEN
                    Very much so.  If I can ever find the 
                    keys to the truck.  


      Rosen glances around the room, then it hits him.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Who drove it last?


      INT. SECTION 8 OFFICES - HALLWAY - DAY

      Harken leafs through the file on Hicks as he follows Rosen 
      down the hall.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Have you read the jacket?  I mean 
                    we re not just dealing with some kid 
                    who can bend spoons or add a bunch of 
                    numbers in his head.  The guy was a 
                    sniper in the Marine Corps.... before 
                    he went AWOL.

      As they pass the conference room, Rosen pokes his head in.

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      On the conference table are a number of high-tech 
        surveillance cameras and microphones.  Rachel is packing them 
      carefully into a case.

                                  ROSEN
                    Rachel dear, you wouldn t have 
                    happened to see the keys to the truck?

      Rachel shakes her head.  Mimics Gary s gesticulations.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Of course.


      INT. SECTION 8 OFFICES - HALLWAY - DAY

      Rosen and Harken head for the break room.

                                  HARKEN
                    The guy is dangerous, Doc.  More than 
                    these people can handle.

                                  ROSEN 
                    It s our job, Bill.  Identification 
                    and analysis of Alphas.  Like everyone 
                    else, we have to sing for our supper.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Well, can I talk to those people?  I d 
                    like to know who I m singing for.  

      Rosen stiffens a bit, this is something he doesn t want to 
      talk about. 

                                  ROSEN
                    We should talk about why you feel the 
                    need to ask me that when you know I 
                    can t answer, Bill.  It s important 
                    for you to come to grips with your 
                      anxieties.  

      And Rosen walks away, the discussion over.  


      INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY

      Gary pumps some change into a vending machine with a MASSIVE 
      DENT in the side (someday we ll hear why Harken did it.) 
      Rosen enters.

                          (firmly)
                    Keys, Gary.  

      Gary pulls a candy bar from the machine.

                                  GARY
                    I got a Kit Kat.

                                  ROSEN
                    Now...

      Rosen holds out his hand.

                                  GARY
                    I wanna drive.

                                  ROSEN
                    I know you do.  And I know you you ve 
                    committed to memory every last street 
                    in Manhattan and the outer boroughs.  
                    It s a terrific asset.  But you are 
                      absolutely not driving.  

                                  GARY
                    My Mom said I could.

                                  ROSEN
                    She most assuredly did not.  But I 
                    will call her and see if you can come 
                    along.  

      Gary reluctantly pulls out the keys.  Rosen takes them.


      INT. NINA S OFFICE - DAY

      Nina is behind her desk, her hands engaged in some busywork 
      we can t see.  Harken enters, steaming.   

                                  HARKEN 
                    I hate it when he pulls that.

                          (mimicking Rosen)
                     Why would you ask me that, Nina?  Did 
                    Daddy spank you when you were bad?   

      Nina lifts her hands up and aims the semi-automatic pistol 
      she has been loading. Harken is startled. 

                                  HARKEN
                    Jesus!

                    Chill out, Grandma.  I passed my level 
                    threes.  I m ready.

      Nina pushes past him, leaving Harken angry and frustrated.  
      He balls a fist to punch the wall... 

      Then pulls out his pill case and pops three yellows instead. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

      A STOCKBOY, wearing an apron, carefully stacks a new shipment 
      of oranges.  He places each of them just so, forming a 
      perfect, symmetrical pyramid.  

      The stockboy is the man we saw in the military ID, CHRISTIAN 
      HICKS, and he couldn t look more harmless.  He s clean cut 
      and handsome, relatively stable looking, and seems content 
      with the work-a-day banality of his job.  Still, it is 
      instantly clear that he does not belong here, he was meant 
      for more than this.  

      A MOTHER with three rambunctious kids approaches with her 
      grocery cart and accidentally bumps Hicks  perfect pyramid of 
      oranges. 

      One of the oranges rolls off of the top.  Before it hits the 
      floor...

      Hicks backhands it.    

      With a flick of his wrist, he tosses the orange back on the 
      pile.  He puts so much  English  on it that it spins back up 
      to the top of the pyramid, where it rotates for a moment then 
      comes to a gentle stop.  

      One of the children -- a wide-eyed five-year-old GIRL, looks 
      up at Hicks in amazement. 

                                  GIRL
                    Pull the trigger.




































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              24.



      Hicks stares back at her... what?

                                  GIRL
                    Do it again.  

      Hicks is confused.  Did he mishear her the first time? 

      Before he can ask her, the girl's mother pulls her away.  

      A little shaken, Hicks turns back to his produce section,   
      only now the sign that should read  Oranges .99 lb.  reads 
       Pull the trigger.   Hicks double takes...

      Something is not right here&

                                  MR. MARTINEZ (O.S.)
                    Hicks....

      Hicks looks up.  His manager, MR. MARTINEZ approaches.  He s 
        mid-fifties, friendly.

      Hicks glances back at the sign.  It's back to normal:  
       Oranges .99 lb. 


                                  MARTINEZ
                    What are you doing here?  

                                  HICKS
                    Just the... fruits and vegetables.  

                                  MARTINEZ
                    You had a shift yesterday.

                                  HICKS
                    Yeah.  So?  

                                  MARTINEZ
                    You missed it, Chris.  You never 
                    showed up.  

                                  HICKS
                    What are you talking about?  

      Martinez shakes his head, feels bad for the guy.  

                                  MARTINEZ
                    I don t know what s going on with you 
                    buddy, but we talked about this.  It s 
                    the third time.  I told you if it 
                    happened again, that s it. 

      Hicks is baffled.

                                  HICKS
                    I was here.  I know I was.

      He just stands there, racking his brain to remember, WHERE 
      WAS I?  But the memories clearly aren't there.  

                                  HARKEN  (O.S.)
                    This can t be right.


      EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - DAY

      Reveal Nina and Harken sitting in the SUV.  They watch Hicks 
      and the Manager talking through the storefront window.   
      Sitting behind them in the back seat is Gary.  He s scrolling 
      through the map application on his iPhone, studying the 
      surrounding streets in detail.

                                  HARKEN
                    What kind of deadly assassin works in 
                    a grocery store?  And why would he 
                    leave a bullet casing with his 
                      fingerprints at the scene of the 
                    crime? 

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                          (referring to Hicks)
                    He s kinda hot.

                                  HARKEN
                    Wow, no shame at all, huh? 

                                  NINA 
                    I like the blue collar thing.  It 
                    works for me.  

                                  HARKEN
                    I m sure it does.  

                                  GARY 
                    Here he comes.  

      Nina and Harken suddenly glance towards the supermarket and 
      see that Hicks is coming towards them, head down, hands in 
      pockets -- a portrait of defeat.  

      There s a moment of tension as he walks right past them.

                                  GARY
                    He s walking south.

                                  HARKEN
                    Great, thanks.

                                  GARY
                    His apartment is eight blocks South.  
                    He will be there in fourteen minutes 
                    if that s where he s going.    

      Harken suddenly realizes...  

                                  HARKEN
                    His apartment.  Rachel...

      Nina suddenly catches on too.  She whips out her phone as 
      Harken starts the SUV.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - HICKS APARTMENT - DAY

      It s a one-bedroom, sparsely furnished, not very cheerful.   
      If Hicks has a past, he clearly running away from it -- no 
      photos of family, friends or sweetheart.   No souvenirs. Just 
        a threadbare sofa from the Salvation Army, a crappy TV, and a 
      bookshelf with a few self-help paperbacks with titles 
      involving  recovery.         

      Rachel is standing on a chair in the center of the room, 
      having trouble reaching a light fixture.  She's trying to 
      plant a surveillance camera with a wireless transmitter, but 
      she's too short to reach.  

      The CELL PHONE in her pocket starts VIBRATING.  She reaches 
      for it, fumbles and drops it.  Standing with the fixture in 
      her hand, she ignores the phone and hurries to finish what 
      she s doing.


      INT. SUV (MOVING) - DAY

      Nina, frustrated, leaves Rachel a message.  

                                  NINA
                          (into phone)
                    Rachel, it s Nina.  He s coming.  Get 
                    out NOW.  

      She flips the phone closed.

                                  HARKEN
                    We re gonna have to take him down.

                                  GARY
                    Dr. Rosen said  observe, not engage. 

                                  NINA
                    Those were the orders...

      INT. HICKS' APARTMENT - DAY

      Rachel has the cell phone to her ear. She blanches as Nina s 
      frantic message plays.  


      EXT. HICKS  BUILDING - DAY

      A row of run-down brownstones line the street, their brick 
      faces dotted with competing graffiti markings.  Hicks heads 
      up the stoop to his building s front door, just as Harken, 
      Nina and Gary pull up in the SUV.

                                  HARKEN
                    She s not trained for this.

                                  NINA
                    She can take care of herself if she 
                    needs to. You ve seen what she can do. 

                                  HARKEN
                    That s not the same as this.  We gotta 
                    get her out.  

      Harken bolts from the automobile just as Hicks goes inside.  

                                  NINA
                    STOP!

      Harken ignores her and charges towards the front door.  

                                  NINA
                          (to Gary)
                    Call Rosen! 

      She jumps out of the car and runs after Harken. 

      HOLD ON GARY --

      Alone in the car.  He looks around, not used to being 
      unsupervised.  He climbs in the front seat and starts playing 
      with the steering wheel, pretending to drive.

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Hicks walks up to his apartment door.  He s about to put the 
      key in the lock, when... He hears something.  Heavy 
      footsteps.  Not coming from inside the apartment, but from 
      the stairwell.  

      Hicks listens for a moment, then shrugs it off and puts his 
      key in the door.  


      INT. HICKS APARTMENT - DAY

      Rachel restores the light fixture to its proper position, 
      then heads for the front door.  She s about to reach for it 
      when...

      The front door begins to open.  Rachel quietly backs up, then 
      turns and bolts for the BACK DOOR.    


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Hicks is about to enter his apartment when...

      BOOM!

      The staircase door slams open and BILL HARKEN stumbles out 
      into the hall.  But he looks different.  His pupils are 
      dilated, the veins on his neck strain against his skin, his 
      face reddens as a flood of adrenaline courses through his 
      body.  These are the actual physiological manifestations of 
      the  fight or flight  instinct.  

      He sees Hicks at the door to his apartment.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Hey!  

      Hicks, turns, shocked to see this crazed man rushing towards 
      him, pointing at him and yelling.  


                                  HARKEN 
                    DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW! 

      BY THE STAIRS, Nina arrives to see Harken about to tackle 
      Hicks.

                                  NINA
                    Bill!

      Harken ignores her, lunges at Hicks.

      And, in the face of attack, another side of Hicks suddenly 
      emerges.  The wounded look and the world weary slouch vanish, 
      his heightened agility kicks in.  

      As Harken reaches for him...

      Hicks counters with a jackrabbit-fast evasive maneuver.  Then 
      a sweep kick that knocks Harken off his feet.  

      Even more enraged, Harken scrambles back to his feet and 
      swings a fist at Hicks. 

      Hicks dodges it -- 

      And Harken s hand smashes RIGHT THROUGH THE WALL! 

      Hicks is momentarily stunned at the strength of Harken s 
      blow.  

      Nina reaches for Hicks but he nimbly evades her and goes out 
      through an open window.  

      The chase is on.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                           ACT THREE


      FADE IN:


      EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

      It s a quiet narrow street lined with shops.  Hicks suddenly 
      comes barreling around the corner, running for his life.   

      He runs down a block when, suddenly...

      The SUV cuts in front of him and Harken springs out from the 
      driver s seat to block his path.

      Hicks doesn t break stride, just keeps running right at the 
      bigger man, then snatches up an empty beer bottle from the 
      gutter and throws it at Harken, but ten feet over his head.  

      The bottle hits the release on a fire escape ladder and just 
      as the two men are about to collide Hicks LEAPS up and  

      CLANG!

      The ladder slides down. 

      Hicks grabbing the bottom rung with perfect timing and 
      pulling himself UP AND OVER Harken, who flails beneath him.  

      He pushes off the top of Harken's head with one foot, then 
      swings up onto a narrow ledge, so thin that most would have 
      trouble standing.  He runs across it and around the corner of 
      the building, leaving a frustrated Harken in his dust.  

      NINA emerges from the opposite side of the SUV and picks up 
      the chase.  

      She realizes she s no match for Hicks in a footrace and tries 
      something else.  She grabs a jogger by his wrist...

                                  JOGGER
                    Hey!

                                  NINA
                    Follow me!

      And he does.  She continues down the street, tapping people 
      as she passes them.  She grabs onto the sleeve of a repairman 
      in a jumpsuit.

                                  NINA
                    This way!

      He yanks his arm away.

                                  REPAIRMAN
                    Get offa me!

      Nina grabs his hand and repeats her command.  This time he 
      does as he s told -- Nina s ability only works skin on skin.  

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                    Let s go, follow me! 

      Soon, she has a a motley assortment of businessmen, joggers, 
      and hot-dog vendors trailing behind, her own private team.  

      Nina speaks into a blue-tooth earpiece.

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                    Help me out, Gary.  He went down an 
                    alley on 15th.


      INT. SUV - DAY

      Gary is back in the driver s seat, his hands dancing in the 
      air.  

      WE GO BACK INTO GARY VISION -- 

      Gary uses his hands to manipulate the map of the neighborhood 
      floating in front of him.  He zooms in on a section, then, 
      with a flick of his wrist, spins the 3D image, revealing the 
      alley Hicks has chosen to run down.

      BACK TO SCENE, Gary talks into his cell on speakerphone.

                                  GARY
                    There s only two ways out of there.  
                    One s blocked by a fence.  



      EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

      Nina stops at the entrance to the alley, she turns to her 
      followers, barks out orders.  

                                  NINA
                    You three, block this entrance.  Don t 
                    let anyone pass.  You, jogger guy, 
                    circle the block.  If you see someone 
                    running, you tackle them.   

      Everybody takes off, except for the jogger, the first guy 
      Nina touched.

      He stumbles about in a daze, not sure where he is.  Nina s 
      alpha skill has severe limits, it wears off in minutes.  

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                          (to first guy)
                    Hey you.

      She grabs him, firmly.  Puts a hand on his chin to pull his 
      face closer.  

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                    Pay attention.  Circle the block.  
                    Tackle anyone running.

      Reprogrammed, he snaps back to attention and follows her 
      command.

      Spoiled heaps of trash litter the pavement.  The shadows of 
      the tall buildings framing the alley cover it in darkness.

      HICKS drops down from a ledge above.  He heads out towards 
      the street but then sees the JOGGER moving into position at 
      the end of the alley. 

      So he heads off in the opposite direction.  

      He comes to a stop when he reaches a chain-link fence that 
      blocks the alleyway.  But it s not the fence that stops him.  

      It s Nina.

      She s on the other side, her gun trained on him.  

                                  NINA
                    Don t move!   

                                  HICKS
                    Why are you chasing me?

                                  NINA
                    Gee, why do you think?

                                  HICKS
                    I didn t do anything!

                                  NINA
                    Then why are you running?

      Hicks doesn t have a good answer for her.  She takes a step 
      closer, and now notices something.

      It s the look in his eye; kind of glassy, confused.  It s a 
      look she s familiar with.  

      Nina aims her gun, drawing a bead on him.  

                                  NINA
                    I ll shoot you.   

                                  HICKS
                    You ll miss.  It s a harder shot than 
                    you think.  
                          (beat)
                    And you won t shoot me anyway.  

      Hicks suddenly takes off.  

      ON NINA -- finger on the trigger, but, damnit, he s right. 

      Hicks runs back out the way he came, then turns to give her 
      one last look when--

      BAM!

      Harken decks him with a cross-check that cracks a rib, 
      rattles his teeth and leaves him sucking air.  

      Hicks tries to get up and Harken grabs him with one hand and 
      tosses him like a rag doll.  He smashes into a dumpster, 
      tipping it and spilling garbage all over the street.  

      Hicks looks up, blood dripping from a gash on his head, to 
      see Harken lumbering towards him, hyperventilating, his face 
      beet-red, sweat pouring off his forehead.  

      Hicks grabs some debris off the ground... some peach pits, a 
      can of soda, anything he can get his hands on.  

      He scrambles to his feet and starts winging them at Harken as 
      he races for the mouth of the alley.

      Harken dodges most of the missiles, but one of the pits 
      catches him right in the throat.  A ROTTEN APPLE sails past 
      Harken, but then ricochets off the alley wall and hits Harken 
      in the back of his heel, kicking his foot up, pitching him 
      forward onto his face.  It's an amazing, precise, billiards 
      shot of a throw -- Minnesota Fats would be proud. 


      EXT. ALLEY MOUTH - DAY

      Hicks bursts out into the street, Harken stumbling behind 
      him.  Cars block Hicks  path for a moment, giving Harken the 
      chance to catch up, but then...  



































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              34.



      THE JOGGER runs right at Harken and TACKLES HIM.

      Well, it s not much of a tackle.  He really bounces off 
      Harken s massive frame.  But it s enough of a distraction. 
      Hicks makes it through traffic.

      In moments, he s gone.  Harken curses into his cell-phone.

                                  HARKEN
                    He got away.


      EXT. DESERTED SIDE STREET - DAY

      It seems like Hicks has lost his pursuers. He slows to a 
      quick walk, trying not to draw attention.  But as he heads 
      towards the next intersection, he hears...


      A STRANGE LOW-PITCHED SOUND

      Almost imperceptible at first, it grows in strength.  Hicks 
      stumbles, his nervous system no longer obeying the signals 
      from his brain.  

      He collapses to his knees, shaking like an epileptic.  

      Reveal RACHEL at the end of the block.  Her mouth is barely 
      open, but her throat is vibrating, super low frequency waves 
      emanating out from her body.  

      As she gets closer to Hicks the sound increases in intensity 
      until he is literally paralyzed on the ground.  Rachel wills 
      the sound to stop, then leans over and whispers...

                                  RACHEL
                    I m sorry.  

      Hicks is unconscious.  The chase is over.  

                                                                            FADE TO:


      A SERIES OF YOU TUBE CLIPS

      These are home made clips of people performing feats of 
      agility, balance and aim.  A kid bounces a ping pong ball off 
      five surfaces and into a beer cup. A girl stacks fifty cups 
      in three seconds.   A guy tries to do a triple flip on his 
      motocross bike...



































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              35.



                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    For most of us, there is a gap between 
                    what we imagine ourselves doing in our 
                    mind s eye, and what our bodies can 
                    actually accomplish.

      ...and wipes out.  Badly.  We see a few more examples.  
      Michael Jordan showing incredible body control as he switches 
      hands midair and hits a reverse lay-up.  A group of kids 
      playing  parkour soccer  fire passes back and forth across 
      the rooftops of Mexico City. 

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    But for the lucky few, the opposite is 
                    the case.  Any physical feat their 
                    mind can imagine, their body can 
                    achieve. The phenomenon is known as 
                       hyper-kinesis. 

      And finally, some footage that looks like something torn from 
      a soldier s web-blog, a bit of home video of a SNIPER UNIT 
      stationed in the foothills around Kabul.  A SNIPER lines up a 
      shot on a truck full of insurgents so far away you can barely 
      see it.    

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    They have perfect balance...perfect 
                    aim. Perfect synchrony between thought 
                    and action.

      He squeezes off the shot and there is a sharp clang in the 
      distance as the bullet smacks off a highway sign and 
      ricochets into the truck.  A moment later the truck SWERVES 
      VIOLENTLY off the road, its driver now dead.  The sniper 
      turns to face us, smiling, his buddies patting him on the 
      back... We freeze frame on

      ...a younger CHRISTIAN HICKS.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Christian Hicks was born with it.  


      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

      A typical, gung-ho, high school baseball game, but with the 
      razor sharp tension of a perfect game on the line.  
      Everything is shot handheld, the POV of a proud parent with a 
      handycam, filming from the stands.  

































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              36.



      One out in the ninth, and on the mound, an even younger 
      Christian Hicks throws yet another laser-guided pitch for a 
      strike.  The crowd goes wild, the magical feat just two 
      pitches away. 

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                      Hyperkinesis, like all alpha grade 
                    skills, confers extraordinary 
                      advantages...  

      Hicks winds up again and throws another fastball on the 
      outside corner, but this time the batter almost accidentally 
      gets wood on the ball, sending a slow dribbler down the first 
      base line.  

      Hicks springs off the mound and gathers the ball, but doesn't 
      have a clean throw to first base.  
 

      Instead, he laces the ball through the striding legs of the 
      runner and hits the corner of the base. 

      Miraculously, the ball bounces STRAIGHT UP and into the mitt 
      of the first baseman.  The crowd explodes.

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      ...coupled with profound drawbacks.  


      INT. SECTION 8 OFFICES - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

      Hicks is lying in a make-shift  hospital bed .  He s 
        unconscious, heavily sedated.  His wrists are restrained by 
      heavy, leather bands, as are his ankles.     

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    There is an extreme sensitivity to 
                    stimuli. Emotional issues become 
                      magnified, self medicating ensues to 
                    dull the exquisitely tuned senses, and 
                    what was once perfection...... 

      Rosen stands in front of a monitor, displaying the image of 
      Hicks, restrained in bed.  The rest of the team looks on. 

                                  ROSEN
                    ... turns into disaster.  Which is how 
                    a boy with so much promise ends up 
                    like this.  

                                  HARKEN
                    A perfect game, huh?  



















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              37.



                                  ROSEN
                    And in his one week in the majors he 
                    walked fifteen straight batters.  It s 
                    a pattern he would repeat, 
                      accelerating through the ranks in the 
                    Army Rangers.  And then, suddenly, 
                    going AWOL. His own worst enemy. 

                                  RACHEL
                            (whispering)
                    Like the rest of us. 

                                  HARKEN
                    You don t see me killing people for 
                    money, sister.  

                                  NINA
                    I m not sure he did, either.

                                  HARKEN
                    Really?  Cause I am sure.  His prints 
                    are on the shell casing.  He DID it.  

                                  NINA
                    That s not what I meant.  When I spoke 
                    to him, in the street, he had this 
                    look in his eyes. I know that look.  
                    I ve seen it before, when I push 
                    someone.  

      Rosen is interested by this, he suddenly perks up.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Really?  Can you elaborate?

                                  HARKEN
                    Wait a second, don t tell me you re 
                    falling for this...  

                                  ROSEN
                      I wondered why someone with his 
                    training would leave behind a 
                      fingerprint...

                                  HARKEN
                    Oh please, she s creaming her jeans 
                    for the guy! 

                                  ROSEN
                    Bill, that s completely inappropriate.

                                  HARKEN
                    Y know what s inappropriate, is we got 
                    a guy who killed someone sitting here, 
                    instead of in jail.  Just cause she...

      Harken suddenly realizes:  Nina s not in the room with them 
      anymore.  

                                  HARKEN (CONT D)
                    Hey.  Where is she? 

      Rosen and Harken look up. Rachel points to the monitor.  Both 
      men are surprised by what they see...

      NINA IS ENTERING THE ROOM WITH HICKS.


      INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

      Hicks, awake now, struggles to pull himself to a sitting 
      position.  He winces at his pounding headache -- a by-product 
      of Rachel Meyer's unusual gift.

                                  NINA 
                    Like the worst hangover you ever had, 
                    right?  Rachel s done it to me a 
                    couple times, by accident.  I think.  
                    Here, take these...

      He looks up to see Nina, holding out some pills.  With his 
      wrists restrained, he can t do much.  


                                  NINA 
                    Open wide.  

      She sits on the bed, next to him, then puts the pills in his 
      mouth.  She puts a glass of water to his lips and he chugs it 
      down as fast as she can pour, his throat parched.  

                                  HICKS
                    Where am I?  

                                  NINA
                    We ll get to that.  First, I have some 
                      questions.  


      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

      Everyone is watching the scene tensely through the monitor.  
      Harken looks like he s ready to bust into the next room.

      Nina sits very close to Hicks now.  She lifts her hands up 
      towards his face.  He flinches, pulls back instinctively.  We 
      see their lips move but can t hear what they are saying.

      Very gently, she places her hands on the base of his neck.  
      For a moment, it almost seems like she might pull him forward 
      to kiss him.   

      But she doesn t.  She whispers something in his ear, and 
      Hicks eyes go glassy...


      INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

      The line between professional and personal interest is blurry 
      for Nina, so it s hard to tell if she actually feels 
      something for the guy, or if it s all just a technique.  

                                  NINA
                    Where were you at 9:30 on Monday 
                    morning? 

                                  HICKS
                      I don t... know.  I don t remember.  

                                  NINA
                    Why don t you remember?   

                                  HICKS
                    I... have black outs.  I can t... I 
                    don t remember what happens.  

                                  NINA
                    Dig deeper, Christian, into your 
                      unconscious.  Why do you have 
                      blackouts?  When did they start?  

      Memories are flooding into his brain now, REPRESSED MEMORIES.  

                                  HICKS
                      Someone... did this to me.

      Even Hicks seems to be surprised by this revelation.  Nina 
      glances towards the one-way mirror with an  I told you so

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - LATER

      The team is discussing their options now.  Everyone in the 
      room looks at Rosen, who is busy with his monitors.  

                                  HARKEN
                    This is a mistake, Rosen.  We gotta 
                    turn this guy in.  

                                  NINA
                    Give it a rest Bill.  

                                  HARKEN
                    You got the hots for the guy, so...

                                  ROSEN
                    GO HOME.   

                                  NINA
                    You re the one whose judgement lives 
                    in his pants.  That s why...


                                  HARKEN
                    At least I know what...

                                  ROSEN
                    STOP IT!  Both of you! 

      They are shocked by this sudden outburst.  

                                  ROSEN
                    The phrase  get a room  comes to mind.  
                    Now GO HOME.  Everyone.  

      Sheepishly, they turn and walk out of the room.  Rosen taps 
      Rachel s arm.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Not you Rachel.  You stay. 

      Rosen turns back to the image of Hicks on the monitor. 

                                  ROSEN
                    We have work to do.  


      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

      Rachel pulls a cart of electronics across the room, plugs it 
      in.  As it lights up...

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    Take a look at this...

      Rachel joins Rosen by a monitor.  

                                  ROSEN
                    This is the beta wave of a normal 
                    subject.  

      Rosen gestures towards a series of measurements, marked Beta.

                                  ROSEN
                    Now a subject influenced by Nina s 
                       pushing.  

      Rosen quickly calls up another screen.  The inconsistent wave 
      has been smoothed out a bit.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Now Mr. Hicks... 

      He hits a few buttons, nothing happens.  He reaches down, 
      plugs in some wires that head into the next room, makes sure 
      they re secure and POP, another reading comes up...

                                  ROSEN
                    The beta wave is almost completely 
                      suppressed.   

      The brain wave is a flat line.  Rachel reacts.

                                  RACHEL
                    Have you ever seen this before?  

                                  ROSEN
                    Not to this extent.  It s similar to 
                    Nina, but much more powerful.  Hmm, 
                    we ll need to up the dose...

      He drums his fingers, counting, a nervous habit.  

                                  RACHEL
                    Don t we wait for the MRI results?  

                                  ROSEN
                    No, we just need to compensate for the 
                    strength of the suppression.  
                          (beat)
                    Prepare a dose of Topiramate for our 
                    guest.  We should have him 
                      straightened out in short order.

      As Rachel moves towards the medicine cabinet...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. BAR - NIGHT 

      It s a working class joint -- Billy Joel on the jukebox, off-
      duty cops and Feds knocking back tall ones and shooting pool.   
      Quinn is at the bar, blowing off steam with some of the guys 
      from work.  

                                  HARKEN (O.S.)
                    Knew I d find you here.  

      Quinn spins to see Harken. 

                                  QUINN
                          (a little shitfaced)
                    Hey, Billy.  You almost missed me, 
                    bro.  I was just leaving. 

      Harken sidles up to the bar, the TWO AGENTS next to Quinn are 
      giving him the stink eye.  Harken nods a greeting, and the 
      drunker of the two, a red faced sparkplug name WHELAN grits 
      his teeth. 

                                  WHELAN
                    You got no right bein  here, you piece 
                    a trash.

                                  QUINN
                    Hey, come on now, boys.  Ancient 
                    history.  

      Whelan glances at Quinn, defers to his superior, though not 
      happy about it.  He picks up his drink and moves, followed by 
      the other agent.  Quinn looks over at Harken...

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    Jeez, Bill, sorry bout that...

                                  HARKEN
                    Forget it.  You get my message? 

      Quinn shakes his head, then points to his watch.

                                  QUINN
                    Gotta catch the PATH.  Wasn t 
                    checking.

                                  HARKEN
                    If I had a lead on that Sanchez 
                    witness case, you think you could 
                    track something down? 

                                  QUINN
                    The Sanchez...?  Billy, we got that 
                    one in the bag already.  No worries 
                    there.  

      Harken is surprised to hear this.  

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    Ernesto Morez.  Wasn t that much of a 
                    stretch.  He s the go-to guy for the 
                    cartels.  One of our informants 
                    confirmed he got the contract on both 
                      witnesses.

      Quinn clumsily scrolls through his Blackberry, then holds it 
      up.  On screen, a grainy photo shows a man standing in a 
      doorway.  In his hand -- the conspicuous metal briefcase.   


                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    Slippery bastard, Everything s 
                      circumstantial on this guy.  Never 
                    leaves anything, no evidence.  That s 
                    his MO.  Nothing but a corpse. 

      Harken is startled, and a bit alarmed, by this news.  He 
      doesn t quite see how the pieces fit.  

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    Second witness comes in tomorrow.  
                      They re... you know these guys, 
                    they re puttin' out fake schedules,  
                    using body doubles. Hopin  ta flush 
                    this scumbag out.

      Quinn pulls on his beer, wipes his mouth.  Three sheets to 
      the wind. 

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    I gotta make the train, Billy.  Can 
                    you grab this one for me?   

      Before Harken can answer, Quinn is pushing through the crowd.  
      Harken watches him go.  

                                  HARKEN
                          (under his breath)
                    Ancient history, right.

      Harken motions for the check.  The bartender starts counting 
      empties.  Harken frowns, stuck by that cheapskate again. 


      EXT. BAR - NIGHT

      Quinn heads for the subway, squinting through beer goggles to 
      make out the sign for the PATH train at the Columbus Circle 
      station, when suddenly...

      Someone grabs him.  And shoves him, right into the wall.  And 
      puts something up to his mouth, a plastic breathing mask.  
      Snaps the band around his head.  The fight drains out of 
      Quinn like air from a balloon, he just deflates, and now he s 
      being dragged away.  The whole confrontation has taken 
      seconds, and he s just gone, like he was never there. 


      INT. VAN - NIGHT 

      A groggy Quinn comes to in the back of a van, even more 
      confused by the alcohol and the chemical solvent mickey he 
      just got slipped.  He looks up to see...

      ERNESTO MOREZ, the man himself.  Next to him, that briefcase 
      is snapped open, and he is holding a long, thin, razor-sharp 
      needle that is attached by a tube to an apparatus in the 
      briefcase.  The whole setup looks like something from a 
      Cronenberg movie, it s just creepy as shit.  

      Quinn tries to mumble something, but finds he can barely 
      move.  He watches in mute, paralyzed horror as Morez bends 
      his head forward and SLIDES THE NEEDLE RIGHT INTO HIS BRAIN 
      STEM.  As he meets resistance, Morez presses harder.  This 
      isn t a smooth process.  It s messy and difficult, and 
      probably too intense for younger viewers.


      Quinn is in a daze, his eyes fluttering.

      With the needle inserted, Morez reaches into Quinn s jacket 
      and finds his Blackberry.  His fingers fly across it as he 
      reprograms the settings, and then...

      That annoying RING-TONE plays, the same one we heard at the 
      courthouse. Morez puts it up to Quinn s ear.  He speaks 
      quickly and clearly, not wasting a moment.  

                                  MOREZ
                    When you hear this tone, you wait for 
                      instructions.  You WAIT until I tell 
                    you.  You follow every word I say...
                          (beat)

                                    MOREZ(cont'd)

                    I want to know when Duc Minh is 
                      transferred to the courthouse.   
                      Itinerary, travel route, security 
                    detail.  If it changes, you call me.  

      Morez makes some adjustments on the equipment in his case.  
      He grabs Quinn s slumping face and focuses it. 

                                  MOREZ
                    LISTEN TO ME!  Anything that comes in 
                    about me, Morez, Ernesto Morez, you 
                    update me.  You call the number.  You 
                    will notify me every time my name 
                    comes up. You will not let them catch 
                    me.  

      Morez checks Quinn s pulse, then his pupils with a penlight.  
      Satisfied, he yanks the needle out of his neck, wipes the 
      blood with a rag and puts it back in the suitcase. 

                                  MOREZ
                    You hear the ringtone, you forget 
                      everything. In 5 minutes, you wake up.  

      Morez hits the ringtone again and now we JUMP CUT TO:


      EXT. THE STREET -- NIGHT

      Quinn suddenly comes to, slumped down on the sidewalk next to  
      the subway sign.  The same place he disappeared from.   It 
      takes his brain a moment to reboot, then he gets to his 
      feet..  He checks his watch. 

                                  QUINN
                    Damn it, missed the goddamn train. 

      It s like the whole attack never happened. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FADE IN:


      INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

      Back in the offices of Section 8, all is quiet.  It's late at 
      night.  Hicks wakes up, slowly.  He is surprised to see the 
      straps removed from his arms and legs.  His head feels clear.  

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    Feeling better?

      He looks up to see Dr. Rosen, standing there.  

                                  ROSEN
                    We have a lot to talk about, Mr. 
                    Hicks. 


      INT. HALLWAY AT SECTION 8

      Rosen hands Hicks his belongings, phone, wallet, keys -- as 
      he leads him through the office.  

                                  ROSEN
                    ... our official purpose is to locate 
                    alphas, and determine if they re 
                    assets or liabilities to national 
                    security.  In practice, however, we 
                    are tasked with training them, 
                    treating them, rehabilitating them if 
                    need be.  

                                  HICKS
                    Can you back up a second.  You keep 
                    saying  alpha ...

                                  ROSEN
                    An individual with enhanced abilities 
                    due to differences in their brain 
                      structure.  It s just a term...

                                  HICKS
                    Like the girl who gave me the 
                    headache?  You re saying she did that

                                  ROSEN
                    Rachel, and, well...yes.  An anomaly 
                    in the structure of her left parietal 
                    lobe allows her to manipulate sound 
                    waves with her vocal chords.  



      INT. SECTION 8 OFFICES 

      Rachel Myers sits in her office, reading from a Hebrew prayer 
      book.  She nervously eyes a wine glass in front of her. 

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    Before Rachel, the largest recorded 
                    vocal range for a human being was 12 
                    and a half octaves.  When I came 
                    across her, she just happened to be 
                    working at the CIA as an analyst. And 
                    her vocal range was over thirty five 
                    octaves, past the level of sonar or a 
                    dog whistle. 

      The wine glass begins to vibrate, and Rachel adjusts the 
      implant on her throat, manages to finish without breaking it.  

      Pleased at her success, she lets out a small SQUEAK.  The 
      glass shatters.  Shit.

      We reveal Rosen and Hicks, watching this from the hallway. 

                                  ROSEN 
                    The same wiring that allows her to 
                    control octaves kept her from forming 
                    speech.  Her strict, religious 
                      upbringing didn t help matters, as her 
                    parents refused to get her therapy.  
                    So we re trying to make up for lost 
                    time.   


      EXT. SECTION 8 OFFICES

      Rosen and Hicks walk past the reception area of the offices.   

                                  ROSEN
                    Each person on the team has some alpha 
                    skill.  Gary Bell, for example, is an 
                    autistic with a 3D mapping ability 
                    that would put a Satellite Array to 
                    shame.  Which presents its own 
                      challenges.















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              48.



                                  HICKS
                    I don t know what that means. 

                                  ROSEN
                    Or Bill Harken?  You met him on the 
                    street, I believe. 

      Hicks winces at the memory, his ribs are still throbbing in 
      pain. 

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Bill can tap into his "fight or 
                    flight" reflex, giving him 
                      extraordinary strength and resistance, 
                    for a brief period of time.  But when 
                    I first met him, he had no control of 
                    this ability...


      EXT.  SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

      We see Harken at the front door of a quiet single family home 
      talking to a woman, his EX-WIFE, on the other side of a 
      screen door.  Though we don't hear the details, they appear 
      to be having a heated discussion.  Every time he raises his 
      voice, his wife flinches, the fear of Bill's temper never 
      that far from her mind.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    Any loss of his temper ended with 
                    serious repercussions.  An unfortunate 
                    situation at his former job lost him 
                    his career, and eventually his family.  
                    But now, with medication and 
                      treatment, Bill can better control his 
                    brain's release of epinephrine and 
                      adrenaline.  


      The arguments cease as their daughter comes out to say good 
      night to her dad.  He gives her a hug and a smile.  

      Harken eyes his ex-wife.  It's a tenuous relationship, but 
      they're working on it.


      INT.  SECTION 8 HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Rosen leads Hicks out of the main offices now, towards the 
      vending machines.  

                                  HICKS
                    What about the woman,  in the room... 
                    She did something to me.   












































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              49.



                                  ROSEN
                    Nina.  She  pushed  you.  

      Hicks looks at him.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    You ve seen hypnosis, I m sure?  Well, 
                    when Nina touches someone, she 
                    transfers a wavelength that resonates 
                    directly in the frontal lobe. It 
                    induces a small seizure, which lowers 
                      inhibition and makes the person 
                    extremely vulnerable to her 
                      suggestion. A chemical hypnosis.  We 
                    call it  pushing.   

                                  HICKS
                    So what s the downside there?  Seems 
                    like she can get whatever she wants.  

      Rosen smiles awkwardly, this is a whole can of worms.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Yes, well, that s true, but...


      EXT. TRUMP TOWERS - NIGHT

      An exotic sports car pulls up to the building.  Nina gets out 
      of the drivers' seat and tosses her keys to the valet she 
      woke up next to.  She touches his arm as she passes.


      INT.  NINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Nina's apartment in a deluxe Manhattan hi-rise is 
      ostentatiously expensive, if a little bare.  Not what you'd 
      expect for someone with her pay-grade, but knowing Nina, it's 
      easy to imagine that she didn't pay for any of it. The eager 
      valet follows her inside.  Nina directs him to undress and 
      get in bed.

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    ...there is a price for always getting 
                    what you want. You can never trust 
                    that people's feelings for you are 
                    genuine. 


      INT. BEDROOM

      Nina and the Valet are going at it in her bedroom.  Nina 
      whispers in the Valet s ear.

      It doesn t seem to have any effect.  So she puts her hands on 
      his head.  Now, more emphatically, we hear her say... 

                                  NINA
                    Tell me you love me. 

                                  VALET
                    I love you.  

      He says it like he means it, but it isn t real and Nina knows 
      it.  The pure carnality of the moment is undercut by the 
      profound sense of disgust she has with herself.  The pleasure 
      fades from her eyes.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    Imagine the insecurity that would 
                    create.  


      INT. BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

      Rosen and Hicks stop in a hallway across from the breakroom.    

                                  HICKS
                    I don t know, man, I m having a hard 
                    time with all this. I feel like I m 
                    being put on. 

                                  ROSEN
                    That s good, that means you re 
                      listening. Now, I want you to do 
                    something for me, Christian.  

      Rosen and reaches into his pocket, fishes out a handful of 
      quarters. He hands them to a confused Hicks, them motions to 
      THE VENDING MACHINE, which is visible across the hall, 
      through an open door.  About ten yards away.  


                                  ROSEN
                    I want you to get me a soda.

      Hicks, a bit baffled by this request, takes the quarters and 
      starts walking towards the machine.  Rosen grabs his arm. 

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    No, from here.  Throw them.

                                  HICKS
                    What?  That s... I can t do that. 

                                  ROSEN
                    Yes. You can.

      Hicks gives him a look like he s crazy.  Then he reaches back 
      and casually tosses the quarter at the machine. Miraculously, 
      it sails across the room and right into the coin slot.  

      Hicks looks at Rosen, amazed.  Rosen smiles.

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    See?  

      He motions for him to throw the next one.  

      Hicks flicks the next quarter, which also flies true.  The 
      third quarter misses, glancing off the slot, just a few 
      millimeters from the target.  

      Rosen reassures Hicks...

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Nobody's perfect.  

      Hicks then throws the final quarter, makes it in. 

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    But you're close.

      Rosen picks up the last quarter, drops it in.  The soda 
      tumbles out.  Rosen pops it open and takes a sip.  It s flat.  
      He puts it aside.  

                                  ROSEN
                    You are an Alpha, Christian.  One of 
                    the most talented ones I ve ever 
                      encountered.  Which is probably what 
                    made you a target.  

                                  HICKS
                    Me?  It doesn t make sense, I can t 
                    even hold a job down.   

                                  ROSEN
                    Someone wanted your skills, Mr. Hicks.  
                    And they weren t willing to take no 
                    for an answer.  

      The reality of this settles on Hicks.  In between all the 
      information he s spitting out, Rosen is starting to cut 
      through.  

                                  HICKS (CONT D)
                    I killed someone.  Didn t I?  


























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              52.



                                  ROSEN
                    I realize it s hard to accept.  But 
                    there s something you can do about it.  
                    We need to find the person who did 
                    this to you.  We need to find them and 
                    stop them from doing this again.  
                    That s why we need your help.   

      Rosen notices his pager ringing. He glances down at the 
      screen.  It s a message from Rachel,  URGENT. 

                                  ROSEN
                    Will you excuse me for a minute? 

      As Rosen leaves, Hicks  head drops.  The weight of everything 
      Rosen has told him is finally hitting home.    


      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

      TIGHT ON A 3D rendering of a brain rotating on a monitor. 
      Rosen joins Rachel who s staring at the image.   

                                  RACHEL
                    Look.  Right here.  

      Rachel points to a spot on the screen.  It s a BB-SIZED 
      OBJECT that is LODGED INSIDE HICKS  BRAIN, like a tumor. 


      Rosen leans in for a closer look.

      The object is perfectly spherical, man-made looking.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                          (an understatement)
                    Oh.  That isn t good.  


      INT. BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

      Hicks is left alone, contemplating his situation, the 
        implications that he s a killer. And then we hear something.  
      It is a familiar sound.  That same damned jingle, the 
      ringtone...

      Hicks picks up his cell phone. For some reason he can't 
      explain, he hesitates.

      Should he answer it?  Finally, he flips it open.  

                                  HICKS

                    Time to kill, Mr. Hicks.

      Off Hicks...


      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Rosen and Rachel are rushing towards the break room, when the 
      door suddenly swings open and Hicks steps out.  

                                  ROSEN
                      Christian?  Are you alright?  

      HICKS' POV:

      As Rosen speaks, we hear something different come from his 
      mouth.

                                  ROSEN
                    6 AM.  Bancroft Building.  Time to 
                    kill.

      Rosen tries to tell him again...

                                  ROSEN
                    6 AM.  Bancroft Building.  Time to 
                    kill.

      ROSEN knows something is wrong.  He puts his hand out to 
      touch Hicks  arm and...

      Without warning, Hicks grabs his hand and PUSHES HIM, right 
      into Rachel.  Knocking the two of them to the ground.  Then 
      he bolts for the exit.

      Rosen struggles to get up, his ankle twisted.  Rachel tries 
      to help him, but he waves her off.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Follow him.  Don t lose him!  

      Rachel takes off after Hicks.

                             ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

      A cab pulls to a stop on the corner of 44th and Broadway.  
      Hicks steps out into the bustle of New York s Times Square.  
      As he looks up, he is startled to see...

      A huge billboard showing a model in designer jeans along with 
      fifteen foot letters saying, "SIX A.M."

      Two shoppers stroll past and we overhear one casually telling 
      the other--

                                    SHOPPER
                    Bancroft building...

        A businesswoman passing the other way, jabbers into a cell 
      phone.

                                    BUSINESSWOMAN
                    ...time to kill. Six AM...

      A passing bus has an ad on the side for a holiday movie, 
      "BANCROFT BUILDING TIME TO KILL."    

      A dogwalker's t-shirt says, "6 AM."  

      The crosswalk light flashes, "TIME TO KILL"  

      And now, as Hicks steps out into the busy intersection--

      THE CAMERA COMES UP BEHIND HIM and reveals the MONEY SHOT of 
      our episode --

      Because EVERY SINGLE WORD SPOKEN, WRITTEN, or DISPLAYED 
      anywhere in Hicks' field of vision says the exact same thing.  
      Repeating the same chilling message&

       TIME TO KILL. TIME TO KILL.  TIME TO KILL.   

      Hicks walks up to the Bancroft building itself and goes 
      inside.  


      EXT. BANCROFT BUILDING - ROOF - DAY

      Hicks emerges from a stairwell and walks out onto the roof of 
      the building.   


































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              55.



      In a trance now, guided by instructions he is not even 
      consciously aware of, Hicks is not surprised to see someone 
      waiting on the roof for him.  

      It's MOREZ.   

      Besides his trademark suitcase, he also has a duffle bag 
      slung casually over one shoulder.  

                                  MOREZ
                    You're late.  

      Hicks follows him over to the building's edge as Morez looks 
      irritated by Hicks' tardiness.  Morez passes Hicks the duffle 
      bag.

                                  MOREZ
                    I called you four times.  Where were 
                    you?  

      Hicks doesn t answer.  He reaches into the duffle and pulls 
      out a brand new 30.06 SNIPER RIFLE...


                                  MOREZ
                    The people who employ me expect 
                    absolute punctuality.  That's what 
                    they pay for.  You don't jeopardize 
                    that.

      This is a man used to being in total control of events, and 
      the fact that he is even a minute behind has thrown him off.  

      Hicks racks the bolt on the rifle and slides a bullet into 
      the chamber.


      EXT.  BANCROFT BUILDING - DAY

      Nina and Harken pull to a stop in front of the Bancroft 
      Building.  Rachel is waiting for them.  

                                  RACHEL
                    He s on the roof.

                                  HARKEN
                          (to Rachel)
                    Stay here.  Watch the exits.

      Nina s cell phone rings.  She answers as she and Harken rush 
      for the entrance.

                          (into cell)
                    Were here.

      Nina and Harken head inside.


      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

      Rosen is studying the 3D image of Hicks  brain, his eyes 
      focused on the BB-size object nestled in the parietal lobe.  
      Rosen zooms in on the object revealing circuitry beneath a 
      translucent shell.  Rosen speaks into a speaker phone. 

                                  ROSEN
                    I was wrong.  The beta waves were a 
                    side effect, the source of Mr. Hicks 
                    problem is a physical object, an 
                      artificial tumor.  Point nine 
                      millimeters in diameter.  Silica 
                    based.  It s pressing against the 
                    language center of his parietal lobe, 
                    which explains the hallucinations.  
                    But it also means verbal communication 
                    will likely be ineffective...    


      EXT. ROOF - DAY

      Despite his condition, Hicks' unconscious mind knows how to 
      aim a rifle.  It's as ingrained in him as riding a bicycle.   

      As Hicks adjusts the scope on his gun as Morez takes him 
      through his motions.  

                                  MOREZ
                    This shot should be fairly simple for 
                    you. 
                          (beat)
                    Here is the target.

      Morez shows him a picture of the target -- Another Vietnamese 
      Man, thuggish-looking.  

      Morez indicates the skyline, where two distant office towers 
      are separated by less than a hundred yards of open space.   

                                  MOREZ (CONT D)
                    You'll have a three second window.  
                    That should give you ample 
                      opportunity.   Once he passes out of 
                    view the opportunity is gone.  Do not 
                    let that happen.

      Satisfied that everything is in place, Morez picks up his 
      BRIEFCASE and heads for the far side of the roof.  

      Morez pulls out binoculars and glances at his watch.  It's 
      6:10am.  And then we hear a distant sound rising over the din 
      of traffic far below.  It s the helicopter.


      INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - DAY

      Seated in the rear, next to two ARMED GUARDS, is NON DUC 
      MINH, the second witness.   

      He stares out the window, knowing whatever happens today is 
      sure to change his life.  


      EXT. BANCROFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY

      The scope to his eye, Hicks aims his rifle at the dead space 
      between the towers.  


      INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

      Nina and Harken are standing among several lawyer-types and a 
      bike messenger.  They watch the numbers light up as the 
      elevator rapidly ascends.

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                          (over cell)
                    Nina, your language based suggestion 
                    won t work without the proper 
                      trigger... 

                                  NINA
                          (into cell)
                    That s great, so...

      Other elevator-riders scowl at Nina.  She lowers her voice.

                                  NINA (CONT D)

                          (into cell)
                    How do I stop him?

                          (over cell)
                    You need to engage the pre-lingual

                    system.  You must go around the tumor 
                    and elicit a primal emotional 
                    response.

      EXT. BANCROFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY

      We can hear the chopper getting steadily closer.  Hicks eases 
      his finger onto the trigger and starts to exhale. Then--

      The door to the roof bursts open.  

      NINA AND HARKEN come running out.  

      Nina sees Hicks immediately and starts running towards him.

      Harken spots Morez, his binoculars out, at the other end of 
      the roof.  He heads for him.  

                                  NINA
                    Stop!

      Hicks turns to look at Nina, racing towards him, but all he 
      can perceive is her saying--

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                    Time to kill!

      He puts the scope back up to his eye, then finds the target 
      in his cross-hairs.  

      THE HELICOPTER flies between the two buildings now, Non Doc 
      Minh clearly visible through the window.  

      Hicks is about to pull the trigger when a hand reaches out 
      and GRABS HIM.  It's Nina.  

      Hicks is compelled by a force he cannot control, but Nina s 
      Alpha skill combats that force.  There is literally a war 
      going on inside his head.  

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                    DON T DO IT.  Don t pull the trigger.     

      Hicks hesitates.  Then shoves her aside and aims his rifle at 
      the chopper.  

      Nina realizes Rosen was right.  There s only one way to stop 
      him.

      ON HICKS

      As his finger tenses on the trigger...

      NINA suddenly grabs him and KISSES HIM.  And she isn t shy 
      about it.  









































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              59.



      Hicks  response is primal and emotional.  His body relaxes, 
      the instructions from his parietal lobe temporarily 
        interrupted.  

      THE CHOPPER passes behind the second building, safely out of 
      range.


      MOREZ is shocked, unable to process that the shot didn't 
      happen.

      He turns his binoculars towards Hicks and sees Nina pulling 
      the gun away from him.  Morez is furious, but then something 
      suddenly blocks his frame and he lowers the binoculars to 
      see...

      HARKEN, angry and filled with adrenaline, rushing towards 
      him.  

      His frustration and rage stifled most of the time, Harken 
      finally has a chance to let loose.  He lifts Morez up off his 
      feet and hurls him backwards.  Too far, in fact.  Morez 
      tumbles over the edge of the roof.  Harken panics for a 
      moment, he didn t mean to... He races to the side and sees...

      A BALCONY, one floor below.  


      EXT. BALCONY - BANCROFT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

      Morez just lays there, stunned for a moment, gasping for 
      breath.  Then he gathers himself and begins to crawl away, 
      grabbing his metal briefcase.  


      EXT. ROOFTOP - BANCROFT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

      Hicks stands on the rooftop, Nina by his side, squeezing his 
      hands tightly.  

      The glassy look in his eye seems to be fading, the spell is 
      broken.   Still, he's disoriented.   No idea where he is or 
      how he got there.

      But something catches his eye.  Morez, heading into the 
      stairwell, Harken on his tail.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:

      EXT. BANCROFT BUILDING ENTRANCE - DAY

      Morez pushes through the revolving doors at the entrance.  
      Rachel sees him, and wants to try to stop him, but there are 
      too many innocent people for her to scream.  Rachel tries to 
      block Morez s path but he shoves her aside and races past 
      her.

      Moments later, Harken comes through the door and sees Rachel 
      on the ground.  He stops and helps her to her feet.  Then 
      spots Morez disappearing down the block.  

      Harken barks into his cell phone.

                                  HARKEN
                    I lost him.


      EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

      At a full sprint, Morez pulls his cell phone from his jacket.  
      Speed dials a number--


      EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

      Hicks and Nina are on the edge of the roof.   Nina points to 
      Morez, escaping.  

                                  NINA
                    That s him.  He s the one who s been 
                    pulling your strings.  

      Hicks tracks Morez s path with the scope of his rifle.

                                  HICKS
                    Not anymore. 


      EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

      Morez hits redial on his phone, then glances at the screen.  
      It says,  NO SERVICE.  

      Just as it seems that Morez has made it around the corner and 
      safely out of range...

      Hicks exhales calmly and FIRES.  

      WE TRACK THE BULLET--

      As it explodes from the barrel and zips through the air.  


      EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

      The bullet CLANGS off a street sign, an echo of his earlier 
      shot --


      And disappears around the corner.


      EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

      We don't know for a moment if Hicks got Morez or not.  But 
      Hicks seems confident.  He lowers the sniper rifle and gives 
      Nina a look of grim satisfaction.   

                                  HICKS
                    It s done.


      EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

      An hour later, Agent Quinn pushes through a crush of 
      bystanders, then flashes his badge to a patrol officer to be 
      let inside the CRIME SCENE. 

      As he moves past a group of cops towards the BODY lying in 
      the street, Quinn is met by another AGENT. 

                                  AGENT ONE
                    Got confirmation. It s Morez.  

      Quinn bends down to inspect, sees the bullet hole in the 
      head.  

                                  AGENT ONE
                    Kinda strange.  Same way as that 
                    witness in the courthouse.  Bullet out 
                    of nowhere.

      Quinn nods, not quite getting it.  The pieces don t fit.

                                  AGENT ONE
                    You hear?  Sanchez took a plea. Once 
                    the other guy testified, they cut a 
                    deal to avoid the chair. Sometimes you 
                    get a happy ending, huh?  

      Quinn nods, then notices the cell phone in Morez s hand.  

      He slips on a plastic glove and delicately picks up the 
      phone.  The screen says,  LAST CALL DIALED.   Quinn considers 
      this, then hits  SEND.     

      We hear the familiar annoying RING TONE: it s coming from the 
      phone on Quinn s belt.

      A change comes over Quinn.  His eyes go glassy.  

      The other Agents leans over.

                                  AGENT ONE
                    And you said we d never catch him.  
                    Beer s on you tonight, Quinnie.

      Agent Quinn responds in a monotone.  

                                  QUINN
                    Beer s on me tonight. 

      Off Quinn s glazed look...


      INT. ROSEN S OFFICE - NIGHT

      A CLOSE UP of the strange device from Morez s briefcase.  A 
      combination of technology and parts that almost look organic.  
      It s unlike anything we ve ever seen before.  

      Examining the apparatus, Rosen is concerned.  Rachel looks 
      on. 

                                  ROSEN
                    I was alarmed by the prospect of an 
                    Alpha out there with a power even 
                    greater than Nina s.  But something 
                    about this...

      Referring to the device--

                                  ROSEN
                    ...this technology that mimics her 
                    ability, it actually frightens me 
                    more.  




















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              63.



      Rachel nods, sympathetically, then whispers...  

                                  RACHEL
                    He s ready.  


      INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

      Hicks lies unconscious on the hospital bed. 


      Standing over him are Rosen and Rachel who both wear scrubs 
      and a surgical masks.  Rachel assists Rosen who works the 
      needle into the back of Hick s neck.  

      A filament leads from the needle to a side table where 
      Morez s device quietly hums inside the metal briefcase.      


      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

      Nina stares at a stack of monitors showing different camera 
      angles on the examination room.  The operation is over.  
      Hicks sleeps on the hospital bed.  Rachel cleans up. 

      Rosen comes up behind her.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    He's been through a lot, Nina.  It s 
                    not a pleasant experience knowing 
                    you ve been manipulated, forced to do 
                    things against your will.    

                                  NINA
                          (annoyed)
                    Why don t you just tell me what you 
                    mean?  

                                  ROSEN
                    The things that come to you deservedly 
                    are more satisfying, Nina.  You have 
                    to trust me on that. 

      Nina frowns, not liking the implication of Rosen s advice.  
      She walks out.   


      INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

      Hicks opens his eyes, groggily.  Rachel stands over him.  She 
      smiles and whispers.

                                  RACHEL
                    It s gone.









































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              64.



      Hicks smiles.  It s the first time we ve seen it.  


      EXT. TRUMP TOWERS - NIGHT

      Nina drives up in her car.  The familiar Valet is there.  He 
      takes her keys.  She gets out and eyes him.  His bare skin 
      passes close to hers...  But this time she resists.  She 
      heads inside alone.  


      EXT. SECTION 8 - NIGHT

      It s dark out now.  Hicks walks out into the parking lot.  He 
      is a bit shaky, but no other side effects from the impromptu 
      brain surgery.  He waits on the sidewalk, and then is joined 
      by Rosen.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Need a lift?

                                  HICKS
                    No.  I called a cab.

      As they stand there together, Rosen nods towards the gym 
      across the street.  Despite the hour, it's brightly lit and 
      packed with people working out on treadmills and stair-
      masters. 


                                  ROSEN 
                    Look at them.  Marching away, hour 
                    after hour, day after day.  Some see a 
                    waste of consciousness. I see 
                    limitless potential.  

      Hicks nods, he understands Rosen s point.  

                                  ROSEN
                    There is so much I can do to help you, 
                      Christian.  And so much you can do to 
                    help us. 

                                  HICKS
                    I m flattered, Dr. Rosen.  And I m 
                    very grateful for everything you ve 
                    done.   But I ve worked for the 
                      government before.  Didn t turn out 
                    for me...

                                  ROSEN
                      Christian...


































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              65.



                                  HICKS
                    Guess I m not big on authority.  Not 
                    much of a joiner.  

      Rosen nods, sympathetically.  

                                  ROSEN 
                    Of course.  I just thought it might be 
                    a good way to relieve your guilt.   To 
                    kill a man is a terrible burden. 

      Hicks looks surprised, not sure what Rosen s getting at.

                                  HICKS
                    I.. I didn t kill him.  I mean, I had 
                    no choice, you know that.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Yes, I know that...

      Rosen smiles at him, and now we see another side to the good 
      doctor -- a cold, calculating and absolutely ruthless side 
      that will not compromise when it comes to his mission.  

                                  ROSEN
                    ... and you know that.  But who else 
                    does?  And who would ever believe it? 

      The implications of what Rosen is saying wash over Hicks.  
      This was not an invitation.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Really, the best place for you now is 
                    with us.  Where I can protect you.  

      And with that, Rosen heads off towards his car, disappearing 
      into the darkness of the lot.  

      We hold on Hicks, staring after him, as we hear Rosen's voice 
      one last time, echoing through the darkness.

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Welcome to Section 8, Mr. Hicks.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
