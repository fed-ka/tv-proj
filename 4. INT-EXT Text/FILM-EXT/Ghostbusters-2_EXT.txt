MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY
A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty
prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.
EAST 77TH STREET - DAY
A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full
bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The
building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to
notice.
DANA
(exasperated)
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand
with these bags?
FRANK
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.
I'm a
building superintendent.
DANA
You're also a human being, Frank.
FRANK
(reluctantly going to help)
Okay, okay.
It's not my job, but what the
hell.
I'll do you a favor.
He takes the
grocery bags from her.
DANA
(setting the wheel brakes on
the buggy)
Thank you, Frank.
I'll get the hang of this
eventually.
She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and
makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.
FRANK
(to the baby)
Hiya, Oscar.
What do you say, slugger?
FRANK
(to Dana)
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.
Barrett.
DANA
(finding her keys)
Thank you, Frank.
Oh, are you ever going to
fix the radiator in my bedroom?
I asked you
last week.
FRANK
Didn't I do it?
BABY BUGGY
It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.
EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY
He GURGLES with delight at the movement.
EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY
Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.
DANA
No, you didn't, Frank.
FRANK
Okay, that's no problem.
DANA
That's exactly what you said last week.
BUGGY WHEELS
The brakes unlock themselves.
DANA
She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward
just out of her reach and stops.
Surprised by the movement, she reaches
for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even
further.
Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.
SIDEWALK
Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians
for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked.
INTERSECTION
Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner.
DANA
She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.
EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY
A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.
BUGGY
It careens toward the corner.
EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY
Its eyes are wide open with excitement.
EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY
Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk.
BUS
The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the
intersection at high speed.
BUGGY
It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street.
The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches.
INTERSECTION
Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby.
She hugs it close, deeply
relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life.
CUT TO:
UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY
THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar "No Ghosts" symbol
and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the
Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the
Upper West Side.
RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding
shotgun.
WEST 77TH STREET - DAY
(MOMENTS LATER)
The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump
out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the
house.
Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.
WINSTON
That's it, Ray.
I've had it.
No more parties.
I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged
nine-year-olds.
STANTZ
Come on, Winston.
We can't quit now.
The
holidays are coming up.
It's our best season.
They get in the car
The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors.
Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.
Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.
A sign
identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research."
It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village.
The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore.
The TELEPHONE RINGS.
STANTZ
(v.o., answering the phone)
Ray's Occult.
Dana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the
runaway buggy.
Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring PKE valences from
the pavement and the buildings.
VENKMAN
(to Dana, nostalgic)
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't
it?
(pointing out familiar
neighborhood sights)
There's our old cash machine.
And the dry
cleaners we used to go to.
And the old
video store.
(he wipes away an imaginary
tear)
We really had some good times, didn't we?
DANA
We definitely had a moment or two.
Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.
DANA
That's where the buggy stopped.
VENKMAN
Okay, let's take a look.
Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill.
Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.
STANTZ
(reading the PKE meter)
Is this the spot?
DANA
A little to the left.
Right there!
That's
where it stopped.
Stantz reads the PKE meter.
STANTZ
Nothing.
Not a trace.
SPENGLER
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
VENKMAN
What's that?
STANTZ
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
giga electron volts.
SPENGLER
That's a thousand million electron volts.
VENKMAN
I knew that.
Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the
lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING
WILDLY.
STANTZ
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.
There's
something brewing under the street.
DANA
(worried, to Venkman)
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic
problem or something that makes me vulnerable
to these supernatural things.
VENKMAN
You mean like the time you got possessed and
turned into a monster terror dog?
No, not
a chance.
Total coincidence.
(to Stantz and Spengler)
Am I right?
Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the
coincidence theory.
CUT TO:
Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee,
sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street.
VENKMAN
I love this.
We're onto something really
big.
I can smell it, Ray.
We're going to
make some headlines with this one.
STANTZ
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!
Are you nuts?
If anybody found out about this we'd be in
serious trouble.
The judge couldn't have
been clearer - no ghostbusting.
VENKMAN
Relax.
We're going to keep this whole thing
nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the
street.
Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is
lit by strong work lights.
POLICE CAR
It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift
worksite and stops.
The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler
doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.
FIRST COP
How ya doing?
SPENGLER
(reeking with guilt)
Fine!
It's cutting fine now.
FIRST COP
(curious)
Why are you cutting?
SPENGLER
(looking for one of the
others)
Why are we cutting?
Uh - boss!
Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a
good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.
FIRST COP
What are you doing here?
VENKMAN
(belligerent)
What the hell's it look like we're doing?
We're bustin out asses over here 'cause
some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'
better to do than make idiots like us work
late on a Friday night, right?
(looks to Spengler for
agreement)
SPENGLER
(with a "right on" fist)
Yo.
The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.
FIRST COP
Okay, boys, take it easy.
They drive off.
Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders.
SPENGLER
You were supposed to help me with this.
VENKMAN
You need the exercise.
Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole.
Suddenly he hits metal.
They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.
STANTZ
(examing it)
NYPRR.
What the hell -- ?
Help me lift
this.
They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss.
STANTZ
(shining a flashlight into
the hole)
Wow!
It's an old airshaft.
It just goes
forever.
Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.
SPENGLER
Very intense.
We need a deeper reading.
Somebody has to go down there.
Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.
STANTZ
Thanks, boys.
They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong
cable attached to a winch.
Ray calls out orders to them as he descends
deeper and deeper.
STANTZ (O.S.)
(his voice echoing in the
airshaft)
Keep going -- more -- more --
EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.
SPENGLER
(explaining)
The New York Pneumatic Railway.
It was an
experimental subway system.
Fan-forced
air-trains, built around 1870.
STANTZ
(over the walkie-talkie)
This is about as deep as you can go under
Manhattan without digging your own hole.
SPENGLER
(to Stantz)
What's the reading?
EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's
car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier.
A
burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two
cops.
SUPERVISOR
(no nonsense)
Okay, what's the story here?
Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the
belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex
hardhat.
VENKMAN
What, I got time for this?
We got three
thousand phones out in the Village and about
eight million miles of cable to check.
SUPERVISOR
(not buying it)
The phone lines are over there.
(points to the curb)
Venkman pops Spengler on the head.
VENKMAN
I told ya!
Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.
STANTZ (O.S.)
(filtered)
Help!
Help!
Pull me up!
It's alive!
It's
eating my boots.
Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie.
FIRST COP
You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.
We checked.
Tell me another one.
Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.
VENKMAN
Gas leak?
EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright
FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz.
EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT
One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the
buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks
out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness.
STANTZ (O.S.)
Sorry.
FIREHOUSE - DAY
The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted
into place over the main entrance.
It's just like the original "No
Ghosts" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding
up two fingers.
Venkman enters the firehouse.
FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER)
The garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out
onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING.
Louis comes
running out after it.
CUT TO:
CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER)
Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog
along the track that circles the reservoir.
One of the runners looks
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.
GHOSTLY JOGGER
A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.
Other runners
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.
Seemingly
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.
Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the
newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.
STANTZ
He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging
track.
GHOST JOGGER
He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.
As the
ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit
concealed control buttons.
A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a
glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.
VENKMAN
(checking his watch)
You know he ran that last lap in under six
minutes?
STANTZ
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic
prospect.
CUT TO:
JEWELRY STORE - DAY
The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap
dime-store Santa Claus hats.
STANTZ
(to the client)
Merry Christmas!
CUT TO:
FIFTH AVENUE - ORREFORS GLASS STORE - DAY
The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the
Ghostbusters enter the store.
MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)
Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.
VENKMAN
Did you find anything at Dana's?
STANTZ
Nothing.
Just some mood-slime residue in
and around the bathtub.
But we did turn up
some interesting stuff on this Vigo character
you mentioned.
I found the name Vigo the
Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,
Martyrs and Madmen.
Listen to this:
SPENGLER
(reads from xerox of entry)
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
VENKMAN
A hundred and five years?
He really hung
on, didn't he.
STANTZ
And he didn't die of old age either.
He was
poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
WINSTON
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end
there.
SPENGLER
No, not exactly a man of the people.
(reads)
"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the
Unholy."
STANTZ
This guy was a bad monkey.
He dabbled in
all the Black Arts, and listen to this
prophecy.
Just before his head died, his
last words were, "Death is but a door, time
is but a window.
I'll be back."
VENKMAN
That's it?
"I'll be back?"
SPENGLER
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.
MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)
The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.
SPENGLER
There's definitely something going on in
that studio.
The PKE levels were max-plus
and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
WINSTON
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
VENKMAN
Yeah, that's a safe bet.
(to Stantz)
You and Spengman see what else you can dig
up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.
Those two were made for each other.
STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously
through traffic.
STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue.
Pedestrians leap to safety as
Stantz runs a red light.
ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The car heads right for a big tree.
ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The car skids into the tree and stops.
The Ghostbusters stumble out
dazed and shaken, but unhurt.
Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the
others, completely at a loss.
STANTZ
(himself again)
What happened?
VENKMAN
You just picked up three penalty points on
your driver's license.
WINSTON
Are you all right?
STANTZ
Yeah, I guess so.
It was the strangest
thing.
I knew what I was doing but I
couldn't stop.
This really terrible feeling
came over me and -- I don't know -- I just
felt like driving into that tree and ending
it all.
Whew!
Sorry, boys.
They inspect the damage to the car.
VENKMAN
(confidentially, to
Spengler)
Watch him, Egon.
Don't even let him shave.
CUT TO:
STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
A manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below.
It slides away,
and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.
They are exhausted and covered with slime.
WINSTON
(uncharacteristically
angry)
Nice going, Ray!
What were you trying to
do -- drown me?
STANTZ
(unusually mean)
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were
too stupid to drop that line.
WINSTON
(shoves him)
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll
punch your lights out.
STANTZ
Oh yeah?
Anytime, anytime.
Just go ahead
and try it.
Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.
SPENGLER
If you two are looking for a fight, you got
one.
(putting up his fists)
Who wants it first?
Come on, Ray.
Try me,
sucker.
STANTZ
(squaring off)
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.
I've had
it with you.
They grab each other and start to tussle.
Suddenly Spengler comes to his
senses and pulls them apart.
SPENGLER
(forcefully)
Strip!
Right now!
Get out of those clothes!
He starts yanking off his slicker and waders.
Bewildered, Stantz and
Winston start doing the same.
Spengler helps pull off their clothes and
throws them into the open manhole.
Now wearing only long underwear, they
seem to return to normal.
WINSTON
What are we doing?
Ray, I was ready to kill
you.
STANTZ
Don't you see?
It's the slime.
That stuff
is like pure, concentrated evil.
Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the
museum.
SPENGLER
And it's all flowing right to this spot.
CUT TO:
ARMAND'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The police car is parked right behind Ecto-2.
Spengler stops at the
police car and confronts the cops.
SPENGLER
Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy.
This is a matter of vital importance.
Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags.
COP
What are you doing?
VENKMAN
I just want to get your names right for when
the mayor asks us why we didn't let him know
about this sooner.
The Cops look at each other, uncertain about what to do.
COP
(relenting)
Okay, Doc.
You want to see the mayor, you
got it.
Follow us.
They head for their respective vehicles.
CUT TO:
CARL SCHURZ PARK - NIGHT (LATER)
Preceded by a police car, Ecto-2 enters the small park on the East River
at 88th Street and disappears into an underground entrance.
The CAMERA
PANS UP to reveal Gracie Mansion, the residence of the Mayor of New York
City.
WINDOW LEDGE - DANA'S POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
The baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building,
fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's
waiting for something.
WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby.
Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes.
LOUIS AND JANINE
They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition.
VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION
A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling
on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.
Her face looks
remarkably like Janosz Poha's.
The nanny extends her hand to the BABY
who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it.
DANA
She watches in helpless horror.
DANA
(screams)
No!!
GHOST NANNY
She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and
smiles at Dana.
The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny
shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.
DANA
She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through
the window assisted by Louis and Janine.
DANA
(resolutely)
Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him
what happened.
LOUIS
(confused and worried)
Where're you going?
DANA
To get my baby back.
CUT TO:
MUSEUM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER)
A taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum.
The moment
the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground
trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of
the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the
building.
CUT TO:
PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - DAY (NEXT MORNING)
It's the last day of the year and the sun is shining brightly.
CUT TO:
SKY - SHERMAN'S POV
The sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed.
HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
A drainpipe starts dripping slime into the river near the Cunard Line
docks.
CUT TO:
PUBLIC FOUNTAIN (59TH AND FIFTH) - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
With the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout
psycho-reactive slime.
HOTEL ENTRANCE
A well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps
toward the revolving door.
She looks up at the sky and frowns.
WOMAN
(shrewish)
I told you we should have stayed in Palm
Beach.
The weather here gets stranger every
year.
MAN
Yes, dear.
She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of
her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat.
The doorman nods
courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs.
WOMAN
She yelps in pain.
WOMAN
(to the doorman)
Something just bit me!
The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat
comes alive.
MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and
YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.
Reacting quickly, the
doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and
starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.
The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.
CUT TO:
PIER 34 - THEIR POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
The name "R.M.S. Titanic" is clearly visible on the side of the huge
ship.
The gangplank is down and dozens of drowned passengers, sopping
wet and festooned with seaweed, are disembarking while drowned porters
off-load their waterlogged baggage.
CUT TO:
PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)(ECLIPSE)
Ecto-2 is parked outside as Louis and Sherman come out of the hospital
with the Ghostbusters, now wearing their standard uniforms.
STANTZ
Good work, Louis.
How did you get us out?
LOUIS
Oh, I pulled a few strings.
I wouldn't want
to say any more than that.
Louis winks conspiratorially at Sherman.
LOUIS
This is my cousin Sherman.
Sherm, say hello
to the Ghostbusters.
(sotto voce to Stantz)
I promised him a ride in the car if he got
you out.
SHERMAN
(to the Ghostbusters)
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.
I
know this sounds weird but once I had a
dream that my grandfather was standing at
the foot of my bed, but I knew it was
impossible because he died and he started
to tell me that --
While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ectomobile and drive
off, leaving him and Louis standing at the curb.
LOUIS
Hey!
Wait!
Okay, I'll meet you there.
SHERMAN
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
LOUIS
I let them handle all the little stuff.
I
just come in on the big ones.
CUT TO:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
(original version of the above scene - 11/27/88)
(TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES: These two versions of this scene were put in my
copy of the script, so I have included both of them here)
LOUIS
Actually, they still think you're crazy, but
I convinced them you're not dangerous.
VENKMAN
(determined)
Yeah, well guess again.
BELLEVUE HOSPITAL - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)(MOMENTS LATER)
Ecto-2 is parked outside and the Ghostbusters are hastily donning their
standard uniforms.
LOUIS
I brought everything you asked for and I
gassed up the car with Super Unleaded.
It
cost twenty cents more than Regular Unleaded
but you get much better performance and in
an old car like this that'll end up saving
you money in the long run.
I put it on my
credit card, so you can either reimburse me
or I can take it out of petty cash --
While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ecto-2 and drive
off without him.
LOUIS
Hey!
Wait!
Okay, I'll meet you there.
CUT TO:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
MUSEUM - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)(LATER)
ECTO-2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum.
Hundreds of
spectators are already there gawking at the building as the Ghostbusters
jump out and gape at the sight that greets them.
MUSEUM THEIR POV - BUILDING
The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime.
CITY WORKMEN and FIREMEN are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches,
jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make
a dent.
GHOSTBUSTERS
They size up the situation as they don their proton packs.
STANTZ
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
VENKMAN
I hate Jello.
They stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to
the museum.
STANTZ
(to the Fire Captain)
Okay, give it a rest, Captain.
We'll take
it from here.
FIRE CAPTAIN
(skeptical)
Be my guest.
We been cutting here for three
hours.
What the hell's going on?
You know
the Titanic arrived this morning?
VENKMAN
Well, better late than never.
The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the
Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers.
SPENGLER
(monitoring valences)
Full neutronas, maser assist.
They adjust their settings and prepare to fire.
STANTZ
Throw 'em!
They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building
with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime.
VENKMAN
(to the firemen)
Okay, who knows "Cumbaya?"
A few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.
Venkman
grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum.
VENKMAN
All right.
Nice and sweet --
(starts singing)
Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya --
Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding
hands and swaying to the music.
ALL
(singing)
Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord,
cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya.
Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that
they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime.
STANTZ
Forget it.
The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't
get through this stuff.
VENKMAN
Good effort.
Now what?
Should we say
supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
SPENGLER
It won't work.
There's no way we could
generate enough positive energy to crack
that shell.
STANTZ
I can't believe things have gotten so bad
in this city that there's no way back.
Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy.
And there are too many people who'd just as
soon step on your face as look at you.
But
there've got to be a few sparks of sweet
humanity left in this burned-out burg.
We
just have to mobilize it.
SPENGLER
We need something that everyone can get
behind, a symbol --
His eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a
line drawing of the Statue of Liberty.
STANTZ
(he sees it, too)
Something that appeals to the best in each
and every one of us --
SPENGLER
Something good --
VENKMAN
And pure --
WINSTON
And decent.
THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives
with a police escort.
Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor
himself and they cross to the museum entrance.
Hardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the
Ghostbusters.
HARDEMEYER
Look, I've had it with you.
Get your stuff
together, get back in that clown car and get
out of here.
This is a city matter and
everything's under control.
VENKMAN
Oh, you think so?
Well, I've got news for
you.
You've got Dracula's brother-in-law
in there and he's got my girlfriend and her
kid.
Around about midnight tonight, when
you're partying uptown, this guy's going to
come to life and start doing amateur head
transplants.
And that's just round one.
MAYOR
Are you telling me there're people trapped
in there?
HARDEMEYER
(to his assistant)
This is dynamite.
Call A.P., U.P.I., and
C.N.N. and get them down here right away.
When the police bring this kid out I want
them to hand it right to the mayor and I
want it all on camera.
STANTZ
Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by
midnight, you're going to go down in history
as the man who let New York get sucked down
into the tenth level of hell.
The Mayor stops to consider the situation.
MAYOR
(to the Fire Captain)
Can you get into that museum?
FIRE CAPTAIN
If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe.
The Mayor turns to Venkman.
MAYOR
You know why all these things are happening?
VENKMAN
We tried to tell you last night, but Mr.
Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony
bin.
Hardemeyer flips out.
HARDEMEYER
This is preposterous!
You can't seriously
believe all this mumbo-jumbo!
It's the
Twentieth Century, for crying out loud!
(viciously, to Venkman)
Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff
is or how you got it all over the museum,
but you better get it off and I mean right
now!
He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in
amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily
through the slime curtain.
Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the
slime.
MAYOR
(to Venkman)
Okay, just tell me what you need.
CUT TO:
LIBERTY ISLAND (NEW YORK HARBOR) - NIGHT
With the city skyline in the b.g., the Ghostbusters prepare their
equipment.
Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks,
hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators.
Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them.
VENKMAN
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
WINSTON
Wonder what?
VENKMAN
If she's naked under that toga.
She's
French, you know.
SPENGLER
There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons
of iron and steel.
Stantz is looking worried.
STANTZ
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
VENKMAN
Only one way to find out.
(to Stantz)
Ready, Teddy?
They enter the statue.
CUT TO:
SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - NIGHT
New Years Eve celebrants line the riverfront, pointing and gawking at an
incredible sight.
EAST RIVER - THEIR POV - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The statue is moving up the river almost completely submerged, only her
head from the nose up is visible above the surface.
RIVERFRONT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Spectators cheer wildly, inspired by the sight of the Statue.
CUT TO:
TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
People are jammed together shoulder to shoulder filling Times Square,
watching the big Seiko clock count down the last ten minutes to midnight.
Suddenly, they look down Broadway and see a magnificent sight.
BROADWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The Statue of Liberty is walking up Broadway approaching 42nd Street,
with "Higher and Higher" BOOMING from the SPEAKERS inside.
A great cheer
goes up, and the crowd goes wild with joy, dancing and singing along with
the MUSIC.
FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT (LATER)
The avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all
the side streets.
A squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around
the corner at 72nd Street and proceeds up Fifth Avenue in the direction
of the museum.
Then MUSIC is heard BOOMING in the distance, the ground
shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto
Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The Statue's huge foot comes down and squashes a car.
TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
The people still in the square start counting off the last ten seconds to
midnight and the New Year.
CROWD
(chanting)
Ten .. nine ... eight ... seven ...
CUT TO:
MUSEUM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Kneeling beside the museum, the statue draws back it's mighty right arm
and smashes the skylight with its torch.
STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
A city bus pulls up near the museum and Louis steps off.
He waves his
thanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel.
LOUIS
(to Slimer)
Okay, so Monday night we'll get something
to eat and maybe go bowling?
Can you bowl
with those little arms?
SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.
LOUIS
Okay, I have to go save Dana.
I'll see you
later.
CUT TO:
The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come
out the main entrance with Dana and the baby.
Everybody starts singing
"Auld Lang Syne."
Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and
finds the Ghostbusters.
LOUIS
Am I too late?
STANTZ
No, you're right on time.
Stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him.
MUSEUM ENTRANCE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime.
He looks at the
celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears.
HARDEMEYER
(weepy)
Happy New Year, everybody!
He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne."
CUT TO:
CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT (LATER)
The Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind
the museum, her toga up over her knees.
The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.
The Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.
VENKMAN
She's all right.
She's just sleeping it off.
MAYOR
(stricken)
We just had it restored.
VENKMAN
This probably isn't a good time to bring
this up, but the last time we did a job for
the city you stiffed us.
STANTZ
(handing the Mayor an
invoice)
This is a bill for tonight's job.
The Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.
MAYOR
What!
This is way too much.
(hands the bill back to
Venkman)
We won't pay.
Venkman looks at the Statue.
VENKMAN
(to Stantz)
I think she looks pretty good here, don't
you?
STANTZ
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Realizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.
MAYOR
All right, all right.
If you can wait until
Monday I'll issue you a check.
SPENGLER
Sorry.
No checks.
Company policy.
CUT TO:
The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she
belongs.
The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.
VENKMAN
(looking up at the statue)
Pretty impressive, huh?
SPENGLER
(musing)
It's probably the first thing my
grandparents saw when they came to this
country.
VENKMAN
From where -- Neptune?
SPENGLER
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
VENKMAN
Ostrov?
I've been there.
Good party town.
STANTZ
(in a similarly reflective
mood)
My great-grandparents were Swiss.
I still
have the pictures they took of the statue
from the boat when they arrived.
VENKMAN
Oh, right, you told me that.
They came to
America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I
recall.
How about you, Winston?
WINSTON
My people weren't taking any pictures from
those slave ships, man.
And there wasn't
any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome
them, either.
What are you, Dana?
VENKMAN
Miss Blue Blood?
Her family's been here
since the year 12.
DANA
That's not true.
It was 1620.
VENKMAN
Same difference.
STANTZ
What's your story, Pete?
VENKMAN
Me?
I'm a little of everything.
Some Irish,
some German, some French, Dutch -- the women
in my family slept around.
And that's what
made this country great.
DANA
That's a terrible thing to say.
VENKMAN
So what?
It's a free country.
(looking up at the Statue)
Thanks, Lib.
They all look up at the Statue.
STATUE OF LIBERTY - HEAD OF STATUE - DAY
Slimer flies out one of the observation windows, THEME MUSIC KICKS IN and
the CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY FROM the island TO a HIGH SHOT of the
Statue, lower Manhattan and the shining sea beyond.
FADE OUT.
