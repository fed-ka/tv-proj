SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
My father, Stephan Gold, was the
youngest Unit Commander in
Mossad.
David is next...
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
David Peretz had his twenty-ninth
birthday while on the mission.
Then Rachel.
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
My mother was even younger. Only
twenty-five.
RACHEL'S P.O.V
Silhouetted against the bright light is a group of waiting
MILITARY and MOSSAD DIGNITARIES. Their hands are raised in
applause.
SARAH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Despite their youth they'd had
the courage to confront an
unimaginable evil....
The three walk towards their welcoming party. Rachel blinks
against the sunlight, takes out a pair of sunglasses and
slips them on.

CLOSE ON YOUNG RACHEL
...as she waits behind David and Stephan, face bleached out
by the sunlight. She stares at the ground.
SARAH (V.O.)
But this was not what was
celebrated. It was their youth
itself that became a symbol. Here
were the children who had faced
Israel's greatest nightmare, her
greatest pain...
David and Stephan have moved out of shot and Rachel reaches
the DIGNITARIES. Still looking down, she manages a smile, a
bob of her head, reaches out to shake the first hand...

She emerges onto the empty patio, slides the glass door
shut behind her, muffling the chatter from the room beyond.
She lights a cigarette, inhales greedily, trying to calm
down. She stares at the sun blazing over the Mediterranean
ahead of her. Her glasses darken against the reflected
glare.
As if sensing something she turns to see a SMALL BOY - her
GRANDSON - watching her from behind the glass of the patio
door, something UNNERVING in his direct gaze.
Rachel stares back at him in silence.
Sarah appears behind the boy, her son, and scoops him up
into a hug. Still the boy stares at his grandmother, who
gives a tight smile and turns back to the sea.
Another guest walks up to Sarah and she nods, smiling, at
what he is saying to her but her eyes slide back to her
mother, standing on the other side of the glass.

A shabby, dimly-lit stairwell in a run-down section of the
city.
A YOUNG MOSSAD AGENT knocks at one of the apartment doors.
After a moment it is answered by OLDER DAVID, now 62.
YOUNG AGENT
David Peretz?
DAVID
Yes.
YOUNG AGENT
You were expecting me?
David looks at this young version of himself.
DAVID
Yes. I was expecting you.
YOUNG AGENT
Would you come with me sir?
David stares at him, then walks back into the apartment.
The door almost swings shut and the Agent catches it,
considering walking in after him. But before he can, David
re-emerges carrying his jacket.
DAVID
Let's go.
TITLES BEGIN -
We TRACK with David, CLOSE on his face as the two men begin
the long walk down the staircase.
He doesn't say anything to his companion, doesn't look
around him, and we HOLD on that face as his mind tries to
catch up, tries to work something out, to decide...

The apartment block stands on stilts. Abandoned furniture
is piled around the columns supporting the building.
Still on David as the two men walk out from the darkness
into the street that services the run-down estate. David
follows as the agent moves ahead towards a larger road.

They cross a busy carriageway, and wait for a moment on the
central reservation for a break in the traffic.
Parked on the far side of the road, two identical cars,
their windows tinted.
The Agent moves to the leading car, opens the driver's door
and gets in. David stops in the road, opens the rear
passenger door and throws his jacket inside.
He pauses for a moment and turns to look back at the second
car.

DAVID
(Indistinctly)
Sorry.
The Agent turns.
YOUNG AGENT
What, sir?
DAVID
(Beat)
I - I think I...
He stands like that for a moment and then suddenly STEPS
OUT INTO THE ROAD in front of an on-coming TRUCK. The
impact sweeps him out of the frame.
The shocked Agent scrambles out of the vehicle as other
cars screech to a halt in front of David's lifeless body.
TITLES END.

A celebratory dinner for the book launch is in progress -
publishers, journalists, local dignitaries...
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
7.
Rachel is re-joining the table, taking her place beside her
daughter amidst the dinner party chatter. Sarah watches
her.
SARAH
When are you going to stop?
RACHEL
Stop what?
SARAH
The smoking.
RACHEL
Soon.
SARAH
I hope so. Do it for your
grandson.
SARAH
Are you sure you have to go back
home tomorrow?
RACHEL
It's all arranged, I'm afraid...
SARAH
But we'll have breakfast before
you go? I thought maybe we could
take a walk on the beach? (Trying
to sound casual) I'd like you to
see more of him.
A WAITER leans over with WINE for Rachel. She covers her
glass.
RACHEL
(To Sarah, ill-at-ease)
Well, I'll be back. We
can...maybe in the holidays or...
MIRIAM, a PUBLISHER appears at her shoulder with a copy of
Sarah's book.
MIRIAM
I've marked the place. I thought
perhaps from chapter eleven...?
RACHEL
...Yes, thank you.
Rachel nods absently, flicking through the pages of the
book. Sarah realizes, with a small stab of pain, that she
has no idea what that means.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09

SARAH
If you'd rather read something
else, mother.....
RACHEL
No, that's fine.
Rachel is barely listening. She is staring at a black and
white photograph in the book.
We see that the photograph is of a YOUNG MAN in NAZI
UNIFORM. It's titled: DIETER VOGEL, "The Surgeon of
Birkenau."
MIRIAM
You must be very proud.
Rachel looks up at her, realizes what Miriam is talking
about.
RACHEL
(A little automatic)
...It's a wonderful achievement.
I'm very proud of her.
MIRIAM
And I'm sure you were invaluable
in the research.
SARAH
(Keeping it light)
Actually, my mother withstood all
interrogation. My father was the
talker. (Trying a joke) I'm the
only journalist in Israel she
won't speak to.
Miriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the
remark.
There is a sudden excited MURMUR from the table. The women
look over to where Stephan approaches the table. He is in a
motorised WHEELCHAIR. The Mossad Agent attends discreetly
in the background.
Rachel's face hardens.
RACHEL
I thought he couldn't come.
SARAH
(Standing up, surprised)
So did I.
Several of the local POLITICOS have stood up to greet
Stephan, who is all smiles and handshakes.

STEPHAN
(To the politicos)
Please, sit, sit. My God, it must
be election season.
There's good-natured laughter from the table. Sarah joins
her father, kissing his cheek.
SARAH
You came.
STEPHAN
I came. So you're the famous
author I've heard so much about?
Rachel watches as he takes a place at the table, picks up a
copy of the book and examines the cover photograph, holding
his glasses a little from his eyes to focus.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
(Without looking)
Rachel.
RACHEL
Stephan.
STEPHAN
(To Sarah)
Now you're the expert, maybe you
could tell me something.
(Pointing to himself) Who's this
handsome devil on the cover?
More polite laughter from the table.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
It went well?
SARAH'S HUSBAND
She was wonderful.
STEPHAN
That's good. Good, good. That's
very good.
Rachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephen's hands,
crumbling some bread - they're SHAKING.
She looks up at his face, reads the hidden STRAIN there.
He senses her gaze and meets it, and for a second his smile
falters and SOMETHING LIKE PANIC flickers in his eyes.
Rachel stares back at him, disturbed. Miriam stands,
tapping her glass with her fork.

MIRIAM
I just want thank you all for
coming to help us celebrate the
launch of this wonderful book.
I'm sure we're all particularly
thrilled to have two of the
heroes of this story at the
table. And even more thrilled
that one of them has agreed to
read for us...
Applause. She gestures to Rachel who stands, still looking
at Stephan. The table quietens down. Rachel opens the book
at the marked place and hesitates, only now realising what
she is about to read. Then...
RACHEL
(reading)
"On the evening of the 31st of
December, it began to rain more
heavily. So isolated had they
become from the outside world
that it was only when she looked
out of the window that Rachel
remembered it was New Year's
Eve...

Vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off DOWN THE

Vogel runs down the spiral staircase.

Vogel's dwindling figure as he nears the bottom of the
stairs.

Streaming blood from her face, Rachel heaves herself out of
the apartment towards the railings guarding the walkway. We
hear the clatter of Vogel's feet on the stairs below. She
raises the gun to the railings, to take aim....
21
21
Bursting from the stairwell, Vogel starts to run across the
courtyard towards the street.
22
22
Rachel's aim follows Vogel's lunge for the gateway...
RACHEL'S P.O.V
There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a
moment we see Vogel lit, about to make it to the gate and
disappear forever...

Rachel FIRES. A single shot. And, improbably, incredibly,
the tiny figure of Vogel drops.
Rachel hangs over the banisters far above us, gun in hand,
staring at us with disbelief.
23
23
Rachel finishes reading and puts the book down.
Nobody
moves. The air of bonhomie has been replaced by an
uneasy
silence. Not knowing what else to do, one of the
guests
begins to clap and the others hurriedly join in.
Rachel
doesn't acknowledge the applause.
Stephan is staring at her with a STRANGE INTENSITY.
24
24
Stephan and Rachel sit in the back of the car. Behind a
screen the young Mossad Agent we saw earlier sits in the
front next to the Driver. Tel Aviv races by in neon smears.
The air is charged with tension.
RACHEL
(Of the driver)
He's driving too fast.
Stephan ignores her. She turns to the window, watches as
they streak past another car.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
This is ridiculous. What's so
important? Tell me where we're
going?
STEPHAN
We're going to David's apartment.
Rachel turns to him, startled.
RACHEL
David...?
STEPHAN
I keep track of people Rachel.
It's my job. (Beat) I know he
came to see you yesterday.
RACHEL
(contemptuous)
What's this? The jealous ex-
husband or the intelligence
officer?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09
14.
STEPHAN
A little of both. What did he
want?
RACHEL
Fuck you.
STEPHAN
What did he tell you?
Something about his intensity unnerves her.
RACHEL
He didn't tell me anything. (Off
his look) He didn't! He told me
where he'd been travelling, that
he'd been teaching... We spoke
for a few minutes and then I had
to go.
Stephan is still staring at her, reading her.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
(Bristling)
If you don't believe me ask him
yourself.
And then he can't keep it from his face - and she knows.
Something terrible has happened.
25
32
The Mossad Agent sits on the stairs, smoking.
As the door behind him opens he stands aside and watches
Rachel SWEEP past him down the stairs, without giving him a
glance.
33
34
The next day. Tables under umbrellas are ranged along the
terrace.
Sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with
their son, laughing. As if feeling our gaze, she looks up
at us, shielding her eyes against the sun.
REVERSE
Rachel sits at a table with Stephan, watching her daughter.
Stephan takes out an ENVELOPE and passes it to her.
She opens it and examines the contents - an AIR-PLANE
TICKET and TWO PASSPORTS.
Stephan takes out a small BLACK CASE and slides it across
the table towards her.
She turns to look at it with disgust, KNOWING WHAT IT IS.
Then she takes it and puts it in her handbag.
STEPHAN
My car's waiting outside. It can
take you to the airport.
Rachel turns back to stare at her daughter.
35

Sarah, playing with her son, glances up once more at her
mother on the patio.
36
SARAH'S P.O.V

Rachel stands, an elegant woman at breakfast, her dark
glasses, her suit...She raises a hand and waves.
Puzzled, Sarah waves back, then watches as her mother
begins to walk away from her.
37
38
Rachel climbs from the car and walks towards the building,
pulling her wheeled suitcase.
The young agent has climbed out and moves swiftly ahead of
her, waiting as she passes into the departure building.
39
41
Rachel takes her passport back from the BORDER GUARD and
walks forward, past the barrier into EAST GERMANY.
RACHEL'S P.O.V
A CROWD of people are waiting beyond the check-point for
their loved ones. They're all looking eagerly at us. Only
one YOUNG MAN has his back to us, turning away to light a
cigarette.
Then he turns - Young David - a fine, sensitive face,
darkly shadowed eyes. This is the SHOT we saw earlier. A
moment when we see how anxious he is to play his part
right. Then he smiles his beautiful smile...

Supered TITLES read "East Berlin, 1965."
Rachel walks up to him and after a fractional hesitation
they embrace.
DAVID

How was your trip?
RACHEL
(German)
Fine. Everyone sends their love.
DAVID
You've cut your hair.

David takes her suitcase, and they begin to walk away, hand
in hand, along the BERLIN WALL.
Finally...
DAVID
I'm David.
Rachel nods, embarrassed.
RACHEL

They have turned into another, quieter street.
David lets go of her hand, and they walk on.

A figure leans over the railing on the crumbling balcony at
the top of the building, smoking a cigarette, watching.
This is YOUNG STEPHAN.

David and Rachel are coming through the iron gate into the
run-down looking courtyard.
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN - the building's only other occupant -
watches the couple as the pass, David murmuring a greeting.

A tram trundles down the wide Berlin street.
Rachel and David are walking to Vogel's surgery, holding
hands. She's pale, very frightened. David walks, trying,
and failing, to think of anything to say to her.
He suddenly notices an odd sound. It's Rachel, humming
tunelessly to herself, very low. Something about this
pierces him. He gives her hand a squeeze.
54
54
The two stand in the doorway, at the foot of the stairs
leading into the clinic, their husband and wife routine.
DAVID
(In German)
I'll be waiting for you.
She nods, trying to smile.
RACHEL
(her throat is tight)
I won't...be long.
They kiss. She turns to go, looking so young and lost...
David hesitates, staring after her, then walks quickly
away. Rachel walks up the steps towards the entrance.
55
57
Rachel walks out and finds David waiting, smoking. He takes
her hand and they walk off without speaking.
58
58
The two turn the corner, out of sight of the clinic. David
glances at her. She looks pale, shaken. He feels a wave of
sudden tenderness for her, opens his mouth to say something
then catches himself.
CLOSE on their hands. After a moment David LETS GO. They
walk on.

Stephan walks down the street. A SMARTLY DRESSED MAN walks
towards him, absently jingling his CAR KEYS in his hand.
As he nears Stephan, the man fumbles the keys and they
drop. Stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back
to the man with a smile.
SMARTLY DRESSED MAN
Vielen dank!
STEPHAN
Bitte sehr.
The two continue on their way, and we follow the smartly
dressed man, closing in on his hand, in which he now holds
his keys AND THE LOCKET.
We see him tuck it into his jacket pocket as he walks on.

The FOOTBRIDGE which crosses over a closed RAILWAY STATION
below. On either side of the bridge runs a barbed wire
topped FENCE. A few PEDESTRIANS cross the bridge in the
early evening gloom, intent on getting home.

David and Stephan appear, walking over the bridge towards
us. David's eyes flick to the tracks ahead and below as a
TRAIN begins to thunder by.
Stephan begins to COUNT softly to himself as the train runs
below his feet.
STEPHAN
One, two, three, four, five,
six...
DAVID (O.S.)
It's a ghost station...

63
As the train disappears into the gloom and Stephan slows to
light his cigarette. Beside him David's eyes flick to the
STATION PLATFORM in between the tracks below, eerily lit in
the gathering dusk.
DAVID'S P.O.V - several BORDER GUARDS patrol the abandoned
platform.
DAVID (V.O.)
The station's guarded at all
times...
We're TRACKING PAST the entrance to stairs leading down
from the bridge onto the platform below. We see it's been
sealed off with a locked gate. Another BORDER GUARD stands
on the stairs below, staring up at us as we pass...
64
65
The two men have walked on past the mid-point of the
bridge. David glances at the far track.
DAVID'S P.O.V - the track runs along the far side of the
platform. On the other side of the track is a barbed-wire
topped WIRE FENCE.
DAVID (V.O.)
Our train driver makes an
unscheduled stop on the near
track.
STEPHAN (V.O.)
The last two carriages will be
around...

The two men are at the top of the stairs on the other side
of the bridge now. Stephan glances to his right...
STEPHEN'S P.O.V - TRACKING as we descend the stairs. We can
see that on the other side of that high wire fence is a CAR
PARK and a long, low building...
STEPHAN (V.O.)
...a postal depot.
We see that car park is lined with the yellow VANS of
Deutsche Post. Several FEMALE POSTAL WORKERS in dark skirts
and white blouses stand around the car park on their
breaks, smoking and chatting. As we watch one of the vans
trundles out of the OPEN FACTORY GATE.

A tram passes, revealing Stephan walking across the
scrubby, desolate park, jingling car keys in his hand.
Suddenly he drops them. He's about to pick them up when a
man dips down and hands them back to him.
We recognize the moment.
STEPHAN

Stephan walks on. In his hand he is now holding a small
METAL TUBE.

Rachel comes out to find David waiting for her again. Once
more he takes her hand and they walk off.

As they turn into the quiet street, David lets go of her
hand. Rachel stops. She looks shaken. David watches her.
DAVID
Are you alright?
She nods.
Suddenly Rachel takes his hand again. David stares straight
ahead but he DOESN'T PULL FREE and they walk on like that.

We are looking at a yellow DEUTSCHE POST van.
Stephan and David are walking towards it.
Stephan stops by the van, shielding David as he drops the
length of thin steel we saw him working on earlier, from
his sleeve - an improvised SLIM JIM. With professional ease
he slips the Jim between the window and the weather shield.
In seconds he has the door open and the two climb in...

Rachel and David cross the courtyard to the gate. David
holds it open for Rachel.
As they turn into the street, David takes her hand. Both
stare fixedly ahead, only too aware of what happened the
night before.

The ambulance is already on the
way, madam.
Stephan un-clips the phones and pockets them. He
straightens up, closes the junction box and walks calmly
away, through a gate in the wall, into the next courtyard.

Parked in the small courtyard beyond is the van we saw
before, now decorated with AMBULANCE DECALS and LIGHTS.

...a vehicle pulling up. Whether it's the real ambulance or
the fake one, we're not sure.

David closes the rear door of the van and the two jump in
and drive off as Rachel comes out of the building.
She begins to walk briskly away. Behind her, the real
ambulance is pulling up at the clinic. She doesn't turn
back.

The DEUTSCHE POST VAN that David and Stephan stole earlier
pulls out into the street. Behind it we catch a glimpse of

and climbs in.

Stephan draws up alongside Rachel and she climbs in as the

The depot car park is dark - rows of postal vans parked up.
An eerie silence.
Through the high fence behind the vans we can make out the
tracks and dimly lit STATION PLATFORM beyond - GUARDS
patrolling in the little pools of light.
As we watch a POSTAL WORKER comes out of the depot and
walks through the carpark and out of the gate, his shift
finished.

INSIDE THE VAN
106
P.O.V - THROUGH VAN WINDSCREEN
We're watching the WORKER walk in front of us and leave the
car park.
In the dark of the back of the van, Rachel crouches,
watching him leave. She turns back to where Stephan and
David wait by the van doors, bolt cutters in their hands.
On the floor of the van lies Vogel's unconscious form.
They wait in absolute silence, listening to the fading
footsteps of the worker.
David checks his watch, holds up a single finger to
Stephan. Moments later we hear the sound of an approaching
TRAIN.
Stephan raises a hand and counts them down - five, four,
three, two, one...
The two men open the van doors and run at a crouch to the
base of the foot-bridge stanchion, as the train roars from
the darkness and begins to pass them, screening the two men
from the GUARDS ON THE PLATFORM.
Rachel closes the rear door behind them and runs along the
line of the fence to the other end of the yard and crouches
down by a junction box, screened from the platform,
standing watch.
She looks over to Stephen and David in the shadows of the
bridge stanchion.

Again silence falls. Then faintly we hear another engine
approach. Moments later another train begins to roar past.
Instantly the two men rise from the shadows and begin to
CUT through the wire fence, working with fierce
concentration.

The train is almost past. The two men work feverishly,
snipping through the remaining links, working their way
towards each other - forming a four foot long split in the
fence. They sprint for the stanchion again...
STEPHAN
(As he runs)
Twenty, twenty one, twenty two...
As they dive for cover the last carriages of the train
pass.
A guard on the platform glances over but sees nothing but
darkness and the vague outline of the postal vans beyond
the fence. He continues walking down the platform.

Rachel holds her breath, but nothing disturbs the new
silence.
Along the fence she can just make out the two men crouched
in the shadows. Stephan raises his hand in an OK,
signalling they're ready.
Rachel suddenly hears FOOTSTEPS echoing in the car park.
Through the window of a van, she can see a POSTAL WORKER
emerging from the depot and crossing the car park.
As she watches he takes out a cigarette, starts to light it
but then stops. He is staring over at the footbridge, as if
he can faintly make out those dark shapes at the base...
He takes a few steps forward, puzzled. A little closer and
he might really see something...

Rachel looks to the PLATFORM - the two guards visible there
are talking to each other, looking the other way.
She takes her chance - moves up behind the parked vans...

..as he takes a few steps closer to where Stephan and David
are crouched...
RACHEL (O.S.)

Do you have a light?
The man turns and takes in this pretty postal worker, who
has emerged BEHIND HIM.
He smiles and walks back towards her.
He lights her cigarette, studies her face.

In the distance, at the head of the train, the driver can

Vogel, hands still tied has wormed his way over the seats

On the road ahead a Border Guard Jeep appears, driving

Rachel uncovers the dish of prepared oatmeal and kneels
down beside a sleeping Vogel.
She removes the tape. Vogel wakes, breathes out, watches
her. After a moment...
VOGEL
I was dreaming about my wife.
She feeds him some more.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
One of the great regrets of my
life is that we were unable to
have children. My wife would have
made a wonderful mother.
Vogel watches her, then suddenly SPEAKS IN ENGLISH...
VOGEL (CONT'D)
It's a great blessing.
Rachel stares at him.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
You should try lemons. For the
morning sickness.
Rachel can't move.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
They say it helps.
Rachel struggles to hold it together, feeds him another
spoonful.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
What's your name? (Beat) Sarah?

You Jews stay close to your
roots, don't you? It's a good
thing. Very good.

Rachel spoons in another mouthful.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
I loved the bible as a child.
Retribution. Higher justice.
Rachel shovels in another mouthful. He chews it
thoughtfully, examines her face.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Yes. I understand you perfectly.
(Beat) You weren't lying at the
clinic when you told me about
your mother were you? About her
death?
Rachel loads the spoon with more oatmeal, determined not to
show any emotion.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
I'm very sorry for your loss.
It almost takes her breath away. She tears the tape and
puts it over his mouth, gets up and walks away, determined
not to show him any emotion.
Vogel watches her go.

HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Rachel makes it out into the hallway before she feels the
tears running down her face. She gives in to them, turns
and finds David behind her.
DAVID
What happened? What's the matter?
She can't speak at first.
RACHEL
Nothing. He...nothing.
She wipes her face.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
He can understand us.

What?
RACHEL
He can understand every word
we're saying. He just spoke to

Her face contorts as she tries to compose herself. David
reaches out to hold her.
DAVID
It's alright. It's alright. It's
nearly over.
He pulls her close, holds her, rests his forehead against
hers. They stand like that, eyes closed. The moment hangs.
RACHEL
(Suddenly)
Why didn't you go? At the
station. You could have got away.
Why didn't you?
She looks up at him. He stares into her eyes. Beat. Then,
suddenly he kisses her. It's what she's waited so long for
and she's stunned for a moment, then puts her arms around
his neck, returning the kiss hungrily. They are helpless
with desire for one another.
There is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and,
instinctively, the two break apart.
Stephan enters, hair wet from the rain. He stops, seeing
them, sensing the atmosphere. They stare back at him.
Rachel steps away a little, wiping her face.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
What did they say?
Stephan stares at them in silence. He unbuttons his coat.
DAVID
Stephan?
STEPHAN
It's not happening.
They stare at him aghast - this is the last thing they
wanted to hear.

David instinctively steps in front of Rachel, raises a
hand.

I'm talking to her! Supposedly
it's her shift now, but instead
of doing what she's supposed to
be doing she's out here with you!

fucking question: Did you feed
him?
RACHEL
YES! I fed him!
Stephan stands glaring at her, then turns abruptly away.
STEPHAN
(Beat)
There's no plan. There's no
fucking plan. They said the
operation is being "re-

They stare at him shocked.

They can't just leave us!

Yes they can! Because we fucked
it all up! We fucked it all up

Suddenly we hear someone KNOCKING on the front door. The
three FREEZE, staring at each other. Silence.
DAVID
Were you followed?
Stephan stares at the door, thrown.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Could you have been...?
There is another KNOCK at the door. Stephan turns to the
chest of drawers and takes out the GUN.
RACHEL
Stephan?
Stephan is hurriedly screwing the SILENCER onto the GUN.
There's another KNOCK at the door.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
Stephan!
Stephan walks into the living room and aims the gun at
Vogel. Vogel instinctively squirms away, falling to one
side, wriggling back as far as he can.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
STEPHAN
If it's them, he dies.
Vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose, eyes on the
gun aimed at him.

David suddenly steps in between the two, the gun now
pointing at his chest.

Move.

You're not doing this.
STEPHAN
He's not getting away from me.
DAVID
This isn't the mission.
STEPHAN
I decide what the mission is! If
I say he dies, he dies.
DAVID
We're finishing this mission.
We're taking him back.
STEPHAN
Get out of the way!
There is another KNOCK at the door. David and Stephan stare
at each other, the tension building. Abruptly Rachel turns
and walks down the hallway towards the door. Stephan calls
after her.
STEPHAN
Rachel. Rachel!
From the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened
- the murmur of conversation.
The two men stand frozen, listening. Vogel lies, breathing
hard through his nose.
We hear the door close. The three listen as footsteps
approach down the hall...
Rachel walks back in. A long beat.
RACHEL

It was the lady from the bottom
apartment. She invited us to her

She turns and walks back out. The others stay where they
are, frozen.

Vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off down the

Below us Vogel clatters on down the stairs, flight after

Vogel clears the stairs and bursts into the courtyard.
There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a

earlier we saw him drop to the ground.
He reaches the gate and goes through, his shadow
disappearing on the pavement.
He's gone.

The young Mossad Agent stands smoking outside David's door.
This is the scene we saw earlier. From within we can hear

to let her pass, and watches as she sweeps down the stairs.

Stephan sits amongst the remains of a meal.
Sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with
their son.
Stephan watches them. He senses a presence and turns to
find Rachel behind him. She sits down, stares down at the
beach through her dark glasses.
Stephan watches, almost holding his breath, working through
lightning calculations of how to handle her. But Rachel is
the first to speak.
RACHEL

I always knew this would happen.
I knew we'd be punished. I knew
we'd have to pay.

I thought I'd already been
punished.

He stops. She is staring back at him coldly, unmoved. He
shrugs, letting that go.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
But there's one thing I would
never change.
She looks over to where Sarah is playing with her son,
laughing.
RACHEL
(Instantly)
She isn't going to find out.
She shakes her head, as if the idea itself were impossible.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
She can never find out.
Stephan stares at her, KNOWING THAT HE HAS HER, that it's
already decided.
He takes out the envelope and slides it across the table
towards her. She examines the ticket and passports inside.
Then he slides her the BLACK CASE. We've seen this part of
the scene before.
She stares at it with disgust, knowing what it is. Then she
takes it and puts it in her handbag.
STEPHAN
My car's waiting outside. It can
take you to the airport.
She stands up, an elegant woman at lunch, her dark glasses,
her suit...
She looks down to Sarah, raises a hand in farewell.
Sarah, not understanding, waves a hand in response, calls
something which is lost under the sound of the sea.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
Go down to her. Say goodbye to
her.
Rachel stands stock still, staring down at her daughter.
