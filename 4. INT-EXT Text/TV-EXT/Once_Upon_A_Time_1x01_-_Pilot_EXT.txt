      A bucolic countryside.  The sun is setting and casting a 
      magical glow over this beautiful stretch of land.  Peaceful.  
      Idyllic.  UNTIL --

      A HORSE breaks into frame.  On its back is a determined MAN.  
    His dress and attire tell us we re somewhere different.  In a 
    far off land.  In another time.  This is PRINCE CHARMING.  
    And he s in a fucking hurry.

      Charming pushes his horse hard, into the WOODS.  He moves 
      through the thick trees.  Dodging branches.  On a MISSION.  
    He reaches a clearing and skids to a halt.  As he dismounts --

                                  SAD VOICE (O.S.)
                    You re too late.

    The Prince strides toward the voice.  And we REVEAL -- a 
      DWARF.  This is DOC.  And yeah -- we re in the midst of a 
      tale we ALL know.  Charming shakes his head at Doc.

                                  CHARMING
                    It s never too late.

    He pushes through into the clearing and comes upon -- A GLASS 
      COFFIN.  Surrounding the coffin are the other SIX DWARVES.  
      They slowly part, revealing... in the coffin...

      SNOW WHITE.  Beautiful.  Dark haired.  Eyes closed.  Hands 
      folded over her chest.  DEAD.  Charming s eyes well up.  He 
      can t believe it.

                                  CHARMING
                    No.  No.NO!

    He moves to the coffin s side.  Kneels down in front of it as 
    the TEARS stream down his cheeks.  We SIT ON HIM in his 
      MOMENT of GRIEF.  And then -- he barks at the dwarves --

                                  CHARMING
                    Open it.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

      CONTINUED:

    Doc gently places a hand on the Prince s shoulder.

                                  DOC
                    There s nothing you can do. 

      Charming fills with resolve.

                                  CHARMING
                    OPEN IT.  

                                  DOC
                    I m sorry...  she s gone.

      Charming slowly unclenches his fists.  Realizes he s right.  
      There s no fighting this.  Sadly, he looks at Doc.

                                  CHARMING
                    At least let me say goodbye.

    Doc nods.  Then slowly OPENS the glass case.  Charming leans 
      over and softly kisses Snow White s lips.  

      A SHOCK OF ENERGY.  He pulls back, startled.  And now we 
      witness pure unadulterated MAGIC as --

      SNOW WHITE S eyes flutter open.  Yes folks, TRUE LOVE is 
      showing its power.  Snow smiles as she sits up, groggy, and 
      sees her Prince.

                                  SNOW
                    You... you found me.

    And now Charming s tears move from grief to JOY.

                                  CHARMING
                    Did you ever doubt I would?

      Snow looks around at her surroundings, smiles wryly.

                                  SNOW
                      Truthfully?  The glass coffin gave 
                    me pause.

                                  CHARMING
                          (smiles back)
                    Well you never have to worry.  I 
                    will alwaysfind you.

      BEAT.  Snow White drinks this in.  And more than anything 
      else.  She BELIEVES it.  She stares into his eyes.  Fully, 
      deeply, in LOVE.  Charming takes her hand, stands.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

      CONTINUED:

                                  SNOW
                    Do you promise?

    NOW WE RE SUPER TIGHT ON CHARMING S FACE.

                                  CHARMING
                    I do.

      PULL BACK.  And suddenly we re not in the forest anymore.  
      Charming is making this proclamation SOMEWHERE ELSE --


      Busy early evening pedestrian traffic moves to and fro as we 
      STAY on HENRY, drinking in the big city sights.  It s a 
      little seedy.  Rough.  But it doesn t bother him.  Behind 
      him, an OLD WOMAN steps off the bus.  She sees Henry all 
      alone.  Walks up, concerned. 

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    Are you lost, honey?

      Henry looks up at the kindly woman and smiles.

                                  HENRY
                    Oh no, I m fine.

    But the old woman isn t so sure.  She s nervous for this kid.

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    You re travelling alone?  All the 
                    way from Maine?

                                  HENRY
                    Do it all the time, was just 
                    visiting my Grandma.

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    Are your parents here to pick you 
                    up?

      Henry looks around.  Nods at a black TOWN CAR at the street 
      exit.  A DRIVER chats on his BLUE TOOTH in the front seat.

                                  HENRY
                    They re off at one of their fancy 
                    balls.  They sent their driver.  
                    That s Albert.  
                          (yellsout)
                    Hey Albert!
                          (then to the woman)
                    Thanks for your concern, ma am.

      Henry heads toward the Town Car.  The old lady shrugs and 
      moves off.  

      STAY ON HENRY.  He walks up to the Town Car.  The driver 
      keeps chatting on his blue tooth.  Henry sneaks a look over 
    his shoulder... the woman is gone... and then --




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.

      CONTINUED:

      Henry walks right PAST the car.  

      Huh.  He heads to the STREET CORNER.  Sees a parked YELLOW 
      CAB.  Henry RAPS on the window.  The driver rolls it down as 
      Henry rifles through his bag and pulls out a VISA.

                                  HENRY
                    You take credit cards?

    The driver nods.  And Henry opens the door.  Gets in.  

                                  CABBIE
                    Where to, kid?

    OFF THIS strange little boy, who is clearly FULL OF SHIT --


      Ryan races out the door and down the block.  Runs to a PARKED 
      AUDI.  Pulls open the door and hops in.  Glances over his 
      shoulder to see -- Anna striding down the block.  Still not 
      running.  Just moving with purpose.  A TERMINATOR in COUTURE.

    ON RYAN.  In the driver s seat.  Sweating.  Fumbles with his 
      keys.  Turns the IGNITION.  Guns the engine, hits the gas --

      KERRRRRRRRACK.  A horrible CRUNCHING sound.  The car stays 
      PUT.  Ryan looks confused, opens the door.  Looks down and 
      sees -- 

      A BOOT on his wheel.  He looks back up and sees -- Anna now 
      standing in front of him.  He gets it -- he s been SET UP.

                                  RYAN
                    You don t have to do this.  I can 
                    pay you.  I ve got money.

    She stares at him for a second -- reading him.  

                                  ANNA
                    No you don t.  And if you did, you 
                    should give it to your wife.  Take 
                    care of your family.

      Realizing he s fucked, Ryan stares at her, filled with venom.

                                  RYAN
                    What do youknow about family?

    And that seems to flip a switch in Anna.  She grabs him by 
    the collar and slams his face into the steering wheel.

          HOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNK.  Ryan slumps back, 
      unconscious.  Anna just stands there for a moment.  Then --

                                  ANNA
                    Nothing.


      ANNA.  Driving in a yellow  69 VW Bug.  Heading down the long 
      highway between Boston and Maine.  Her face says it all.  She 
      can t believe this is happening.

                                  HENRY (O.S.)
                    You got anything to eat in here?

      Anna turns to see Henry rifling through a BAG in the back.

                                  ANNA
                    Hey.  HEY.  That s my gym bag.  I 
                    don t generally travel with snack 
                    packs.

      Henry turns around, falls back into his seat.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HENRY
                    We could stop somewhere.

                                  ANNA
                    This isn t a road trip.  We re not 
                    getting snacks.  We re not singing 
                    songs and we re not playing I-Spy. 

                                  HENRY
                          (pouty)
                    Fine.

    He takes out his BOOK.  Opens it to a picture of Snow and 
      Charming.  Anna notices the thing is OLD and HUGE.

                                  ANNA
                    What s that -- ?

      Henry looks up from the book.  Oddly CAUTIOUS here.

                                  HENRY
                    If I told you -- you wouldn t 
                    believe me.

                                  ANNA
                    Why not?

                                  HENRY
                    I m not sure you re ready.

      Anna looks over his shoulder, glimpses SNOW and CHARMING --

                                  ANNA
                    Ready for some fairy tales?

                                  HENRY
                          (SERIOUS now --)
                    They re not fairy tales.  They re 
                    real.  Every story in this book is 
                    true.  It actually happened.  

                                  ANNA
                    Of course it did.

                                  HENRY
                    Use your  super power  and see if 
                    I m lying.

      Anna looks at him.  Shit.  He does seem awfully CONVINCED.

                                  ANNA
                    Just because you believe something 
                    don t make it true.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                                  HENRY
                    That s exactlywhat makes it true.  
                    And youshould know that more than 
                    anyone.

                                  ANNA
                    Why s that?

                                  HENRY
                    Because you re in it.

      Anna shoots him a look.  Oooookay.

                                  ANNA
                    Kid, you ve got problems.

                                  HENRY
                    Yup.And you re gonna fix them.

      Anna just shakes her head.  Turns up the music on the RADIO.  
      Henry shrugs.  Returns to his book, which WE PUSH INTO AND  --


    The WOODS.  PAN OFF the trees to Anna s car driving into this 
      small town.  Surrounded by the forest, Storybrooke, while 
      quaint, definitely has an air of magic to it.  The car heads 
      down the nearly deserted main street into the TOWN SQUARE.  
      Passing shops, a few restaurants, a clock tower.  No chain 
      stores.  This place is its own world.  And right now, it s 
      after midnight and pretty much shut down.

    IN THE CAR.  Anna looks at Henry.  

                                  ANNA
                    Okay, Kid.  How about an address? 

                                  HENRY
                    115 South Not-Telling-You Street.

      Anna s jaw tightens.  She quickly pulls the car over to the 
      side of the street.  Parked in the town square, she confronts 
      Henry.

                                  ANNA
                    Look, kid, it s been a really long 
                    day.  It s... almost... 
                          (looks up at the clock 
                          tower)
                    8:15?

                                  HENRY
                    That clock hasn t moved my whole 
                    life.  Time is frozen here.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

      CONTINUED:

      Anna can t believe how relentless this kid is.

                                  ANNA
                    ...Excuse me?

                                  HENRY
                    The Evil queen cursed the enchanted 
                    forest.  And now everybody who 
                    lived there, is here.  They re 
                    frozen in time.  Stuck in this 
                    town. 

                                  ANNA
                          (dripping sarcasm)
                    Well, isn t that horrible. 
                            (challenging him)
                    Why don t they just leave?

                                  HENRY
                    They can t.  Ask anyone.  See if 
                    they ve ever left.

      Before Anna can challenge him further, a voice from outside 
    the car interrupts.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    ...Henry?

      They look up to see an eccentric looking gentleman (think 
      Michael Emerson) walking a Dalmation and, oddly, carrying an 
      umbrella.  This is ARCHIE.

                                  ARCHIE
                    What re you doing here?  You missed 
                    our session today.  Is everything 
                    all right?

                                    HENRY
                    I m fine, Archie.

                          (studies Anna)
                    Who s this?

                                  ANNA
                    Just someone trying to give him a 
                    ride home.  Ya know where he lives?

                                  ARCHIE
                    Sure.  Just up there to the right.  
                    Mayor s house is the biggest house 
                    on Mifflin Street.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

    Now Anna shoots Henry another look.

                                  ANNA
                    You re the Mayor s kid?

                                  HENRY
                          (busted)
                    Maybe.

                                  ANNA
                          (to Archie; smiles)
                    Thank you.

                                  ARCHIE
                    Of course.  Welcome to Storybrooke!

    As they drive off, Henry looks completely defeated.  Anna 
      checks out Archie in her rear view mirror.

                                  ANNA
                    He didn t seem cursed to me.

      That s it.  Henry s had enough.  He blurts out --

                                  HENRY
                    Because he doesn t know.  None of 
                    them do.  They don t remember who 
                    they are.  It s part of the curse.  

                                  ANNA
                      Convenient.  So which fairy tale 
                    was he?

                                  HENRY
                    Jiminy Cricket.

    OH.  YEAH.  That voice DID sound familiar.

                                  ANNA
                    Right.  The umbrella.  How did I 
                    not catch that?

    OFF ANNA, this kid s got a real imagination, UPCUT TO --


      Mifflin street.  A cul de sac lined with large homes.  The 
      largest, and most inviting, is where Anna is now parked.  She 
      steps out with Henry.  He looks up, his demeanor CHANGED.  
    The smart assnessfalls away and is replaced by GENUINE FEAR.

                                  HENRY
                    Please don t take me back there.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

      CONTINUED:

      Anna softens.  And maybe for the first time, we see a twinkle 
    of actual MATERNAL INSTINCT.

                                  ANNA
                    Henry, I m sure your parents are 
                    worried sick about you.

                                  HENRY
                    I don t have parents.  Just a mom.  
                    And she s evil.
                          (fighting tears)
                    She doesn t love me.  She only 
                      pretendsto.

      Anna s heart breaks as she listens, because whether it s true 
    or not, this kid believes it.  And that s when --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Ohmygod, Henry!  Where have you 
                    been!

    ARM AROUND TO REVEAL -- the door of the house is open.  And 
      rushing out of it is Henry s adoptive mother, REGINA.  But 
      what we first notice is --

      She s IDENTICAL to the EVIL QUEEN in fairy tale land.  Only 
      without her Queen outfit, she just appears to be an 
      attractive suburban mom in her 30s.

      Regina s cheeks are tear stained and she s an emotional 
      wreck.  She rushes up and wraps Henry in a hug.

                                  REGINA
                    Are you alright?  Are you hurt?  
                    What happened?!?

    And standing behind her, looking concerned as he takes in the 
      scene is the oh-so handsome town SHERIFF.  Henry breaks from 
    the embrace --

                                  HENRY
                    What happened was I went to find my 
                    real mom. 

    And with that he scampers up the stairs into the house.  
      Regina looks up and sees Anna for the first time.  And it 
      really fucking hits her who this is.

                                  REGINA
                    ...you re Henry s birth mother?

      Anna forces an awkward smile.  Meekly responds --




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ANNA
                    ...Hi.

      It s an awkward moment.  The sheriff -- like any man would -- 
      senses it.  Speaks in a BRITISH ACCENT.

                                  SHERIFF
                    I ll just go check on the lad, make 
                    sure he s doing all right.

    The sheriff heads into the house.  Leaving Regina with Anna.

    As it sinks in on Regina who she s meeting, briefly, oh so 
      briefly, something flashes across her face.  Concern?  Worry?  
      Annoyance?  It s gone too fast for us to know for sure.

                                  REGINA
                    Thank you for bringing him home.

                                  ANNA
                    Sure.

      A beat of massive discomfort.  And then Regina puts on the 
      most welcoming smile imaginable.

                                  REGINA
                    How would you like a glass of the 
                    best apple cider you ve ever 
                    tasted?

                                  ANNA
                          (smiles)
                    Got anything stronger?

    OFF Regina nodding, UPCUT TO --


      Anna hurries out.  Just needing to get the hell out of here.  
    She comes upon the sheriff, leaning up against her car.  He 
      smiles at her.  Munching on a PIXIE STICK.  Offers her one.

                                  SHERIFF
                    Pixie stick?

                                  ANNA
                    I ll pass.  

                                  SHERIFF
                    Yes, I know.  Terrible habit.  It s 
                    amazing my teeth haven t rotted 
                    through.  I m Graham, by the way.

                                  ANNA
                    Anna.  So what part of England you 
                    from, Graham? 

                                  SHERIFF
                    Actually, I was born and raised 
                    here.  Picked the accent up from my 
                    parents.  Gives me some authority, 
                    don t you think?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ANNA
                      Absolutely.  Well, I ve got a long 
                    drive ahead of me.  So if you could 
                    find somewhere else to lean...

      Anna moves to her car, but he remains leaning on it.

                                  GRAHAM
                    I think it might be better if you 
                    spent the night.

                                  ANNA
                    Kindaforward of you.

    He smiles, mischievous.  

                                  GRAHAM
                    I know Regina s drinks.  I d hate 
                    to get out the breathalyzer. 
                    There s a B and B on the town 
                    square.  They have rooms available.  
                    I called ahead. 
                          (thinks)
                    I guess I amforward.

      Anna shakes her head.  Clearly not having a CHOICE.

                                  ANNA
                    Let me grab my bag.

      Graham grins, steps aside.  As Anna pulls out her gym bag --


    UP ON THE GUARD TOWER.  Overlooking a vast field leading to a 
      forest in the distance.  Grumpy keeps watch with two KNIGHTS.  
      Beside him is another DWARF, eyes closed and snoring.  Yeah, 
      this is SLEEPY.

    ON GRUMPY.  Glances around.  Sleepy s out.  No one sees him 
    so -- he pulls out a FLASK.  Takes a swig.  Then puts it away 
    as he resumes staring out into the forest.  He squints in the 
      moonlight.  He sees something that panics him.  BLINKS.  Then 
      turns quickly to Sleepy, ROUSES HIM.

                                  GRUMPY
                    Get up.  WAKE UP.

      Sleepy rubs his eyes.  Stands.  

                                  SLEEPY
                          (yawning)
                    What is it?

      Grumpy points out --

                                  GRUMPY
                    At the tree line... are you seeing 
                    this...

      Sleepy looks out.  The knights join them and they see --

    THE DISTANT TREE LINE of the FOREST.

      Animals -- squirrels.  A wolf.  A deer.  One after another, a 
      steady stream of woodland creatures race out.  A STAMPEDE.  
    And if we Tivo-paused... we might see a UNICORN in the 
      middle.  But what we can see is that, on their animal faces, 
    is an unmistakable look --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

      CONTINUED:

      FEAR.  For following the animals?  Is a BLACK CARRIAGE 
      surrounded by BLACK KNIGHTS.  Riding in the carriage is THE 
      EVIL QUEEN.  And then, behind the carriage... seeping out of 
    the forest is a SHEET of GREEN MIST.  Like a FOG that 
      envelopes everything it passes over and swallowing it up.

      BACK ON THE GUARD TOWER.

      Grumpy sucks in his breath.  Getting it.  He turns toward a 
      BELL.  And rings it LOUDLY.  Shouting --

                                  GRUMPY
                    The curse.  IT S HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    40.


                                        ACT FOUR


    The BLACK CARRIAGE pulls up.  Behind it, we see the mist 
      slowly encroaching, getting nearer.  The Queen steps out of 
    the carriage, addresses her assembled BLACK KNIGHTS.  And on 
    her face -- a smile.  A VICTORIOUS SMILE.

                                  QUEEN
                    Nothing like the smell of a good 
                    curse.  You know what you have to 
                    do.  Find the child.

    As the Knights hurry into the castle, the Queen watches the 
      Green Mist move ever closer.


    ON THE SPIRE of a CRAPPY PLASTIC CASTLE.  WIDEN TO -- reveal 
      we re in a shittyrenaissance playground on the edge of town.

      FIND ANNA.  At the entrance.  She carries the STORY BOOK and 
      shakes her head as she looks at the plastic castle.  Oh.  
      This is what Mary Margaret meant.  Anna walks up to the 
      jungle gym like stairs and climbs up to --

    THE TOP OF THE CASTLE.  She pulls herself up and finds HENRY, 
      sitting alone.  Staring out over the playground and into the 
      town.  The castle directly faces the CLOCK TOWER.  Henry 
      turns to see Anna arrive, then wordlessly turns back to stare 
    at the clock tower.  Anna settles down beside him.

      BEAT.  She slides over the book.

                                  ANNA
                    You  left  this in my gym bag.

      Henry takes it back.  But keeps staring out.

                                  ANNA
                    Still hasn t moved, huh?

      Anna stares out at the tower.  And it s still stuck at 
       8:15. 

                                  HENRY
                    I was hoping that when I brought 
                    you back, things would change here.  
                    That it would move again.  That... 
                    that the final battle would begin.

      Anna sighs.  Poor kid.

                                  ANNA
                    Henry, I m not gonna fight any 
                    battles.  

                                  HENRY
                    Yes you are.  You re here because 
                    it s your destiny.

                                  ANNA
                    Henry -- cut it with the book crap. 
                    It s enough already.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HENRY
                    You don t have to be hostile.  You 
                    like me.  I can tell.  You re just 
                    pushing me away because I make you 
                    feel guilty.
                          (then; sweetly --)
                    But it s okay.  I know why you gave 
                    me away.

      That stops her cold.  He looks at her now, gently.  
      Forgiving.

                                  HENRY
                    You did it because you wanted to 
                    give me my best chance.

      Hearing those words AFFECTS Anna.  Her tough veneer cracks.  
      Because he s RIGHT.  Her eyes well up.

                                  HENRY
                    Told you everybody cries.

      Anna wipes the tears away.  Reeling --

                                  ANNA
                    How... how do you knowthat...?

                                  HENRY
                    Because it s the same reason Snow 
                    White gave youaway.

    And Anna shakes it off.  Remembers what she s dealing with.

                                  ANNA
                    Right, because I min the book.

                                  HENRY
                    Yes.  And you re twenty eight now.  
                    So it s time to get started.  
                    You re the one who s gonna bring 
                    back all the happy endings.

                                  ANNA
                    Let me tell you something, kid, I m 
                    a real person.  I m no savior.  
                    You re wrong about that.  But you 
                    are right about one thing.  I 
                    wanted you to have your best 
                    chance.  And it ain t with me.  
                    Come on, I gotta get you home.

      Henry shakes his head.  Henry does not like hearing this one 
      damn bit.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    52.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HENRY
                    Please don t do this.  Don t bring 
                    me back to her.  Just stay here 
                    with me.  For one week.  That s all 
                    I ask.  One week and you ll see I m 
                    right.  You ll see I m not crazy.

                                  ANNA
                    I have to bring you back to your 
                    mother.

                                  HENRY
                    You don t know what it s like.  My 
                    life sucks.

                                  ANNA
                    You wanna know what sucking is?  
                    It s being left abandoned on a 
                    freeway.  My parents didn t even 
                    think to drop me at a hospital.  
                    Then I found my way into the foster 
                    system.  I was with a family until 
                    I was three.  Until they had their 
                    own kid.  So they sent me back.  I 
                    bounced around from family to 
                    family until I was sixteen and 
                    could be on my own.  Of course by 
                    then I realized I had alwaysbeen 
                    on my own.

      Anna tries to compose herself -- these are painful memories. 

                                  ANNA
                    Your mom s trying her best, Henry.  
                    It s hard.  But none of us are 
                    perfect.  You may not think she 
                    loves you...
                          (beat)
                    But at least she wants you.

      Henry absorbs this incredibly heartfelt soul baring.  But 
      only one thing registers with him.

                                  HENRY
                    Your parents didn t leave you in 
                    the street.  That s just where you 
                    came through.

                                  ANNA
                    What?





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HENRY
                    The wardrobe.  When you went 
                    through the wardrobe you appeared 
                    in the street.  Your parents were 
                    trying to save you from the curse.

    And now Anna realizes she s not equipped for this.  She 
      rises.  Takes his hand.

                                  ANNA
                    Sure they were.  Come on, Henry.

    OFF HENRY, reluctantly following her and carrying his BOOK --


    ON THE FRONT DOOR.  It opens.  Revealing -- Regina with a 
      look of supreme relief on her face.  ARM AROUND TO --

      Anna, with Henry in tow.  Henry doesn t even wait for her to 
      speak, he just blows by her and runs to his room.  Regina 
      calls after him --

                                  REGINA
                    Henry!

    But all we hear is a DOOR SLAM.  Regina turns back to Anna.

                                  REGINA
                    I m just glad he s back.  Thank 
                    you.

                                  ANNA
                          (not sure what to say)
                    Yeah... no problem.

      BEAT.  Regina just stands there.  Her relief now shifts to 
      another -- more VULNERABLE look.  Something is eating at her.

                                  REGINA
                    Did he say... why?

                                  ANNA
                    I dunno.  I think maybe... maybe 
                    that Evil Queen s curse just got in 
                    his head.

                                  REGINA
                    What?

                                  ANNA
                    From his stories.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    56.

      CONTINUED:

                                  REGINA
                    Right.  I should probably take that 
                    book away.

                                  ANNA
                    What s the harm?  It s only a book.

                                  REGINA
                    Yes.  That it is.  Well, have a 
                    safe trip home.

      Anna nods at her, steps way.  Ready to head home.  But 
      something s gnawing at her.

                                  ANNA
                    Hey --

      Regina stops, mid door close.

                                  REGINA
                    Yeah?

                                  ANNA
                    Do you love him?

    And Regina is thrown by that question.

                                  REGINA
                    Excuse me?

                                  ANNA
                    Henry.  Do you love him?

    For a flash we catch a look -- surprise perhaps -- on 
      Regina s face.  And just as quickly, it s gone.  

                                  REGINA
                    Of course I love him.

      Whatever Anna saw?  She s keeping to herself.

                                  ANNA
                    Right.  Sorry.  Goodbye.

    And with that Anna leaves.


    ON THE CLOCK TOWER.  Frozen at  8:15.   The sun is setting at 
    the end of another day in Storybrooke. 

    The old folk song Kookaburrastarts playing as we slowly PAN 
      DOWN TO --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    57.

      CONTINUED:

      Anna.  Walking through the town square.  Her encounter with 
      Regina weighing heavily on her as she looks at this place 
      through new eyes.  And while there is no OVERT magic, there 
    is certainly something odd and off about the place.  She 
      notices --

      A butcher shop.  A bakery.  A hippie selling candles.  A 
      dwarf shooting hoops on the basketball court.  

    And through this we, but not Anna, recognize some people from 
      Fairy Tale land.  The dwarf is GRUMPY.  Outside the bakery, a 
      HANDYMAN works on the bannister to the stairs.  This is 
      Geppetto.  And while it feels a bit surreal, Anna s not 
      actually seeing anything without a rational explanation here.  
      This is just small town America closing shop.  However, for 
    the first time, she s seeing the town the way Henry does.  
      She s seeing magic in a world that previously had none.  

      Anna shakes her head, can t believe he s gotten to her, as 
    she walks into --
