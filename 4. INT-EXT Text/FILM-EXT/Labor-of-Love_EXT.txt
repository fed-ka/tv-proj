ROUTE 476 - OUTSKIRTS OF PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT
A three lane highway relegated to one lane.
The serpentine
line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by.
An arch of
ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass
and twisted metal.
We are at the site of a gruesome car accident.
An ambulance
and four police cars are on the scene.
Two cars are involved
in the crash.
The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front
caved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the
car.
The second car is a different story entirely.
A DARK GREEN
HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that
separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes.
All the windows have imploded.
The original seventeen foot
length of the car, compressed to ten.
The hood has folded
back into the front seat.
This car is not empty!
Through
the sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand,
purple, swollen and bloody.
Some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have
walked over to the flares.
A set of cops wave them back.
POLICE OFFICER
Get back in your cars and continue
with the traffic.
There is nothing
you can do.
(beat)
Get back in your cars...
CUT TO:
OFFICER PIERCE speaks to a female OFFICER DANA.
OFFICER PIERCE
What's the story?
OFFICER DANA
She's been dead about ten minutes.
The jaws are on the way... Ran a
license check.
Her name is Ellen
Parker.
Forty-two years old.
OFFICER PIERCE
What about him?
Pierce gestures to a HISPANIC TEENAGER who is cuffed behind
his back and being led to a police car.
OFFICER DANA
D.U.I.
OFFICER PIERCE
Shit... How old is he?
OFFICER DANA
Seventeen.
It's his grandfather's
car.
On his way back from drinking
with the 'boys'.
Pierce lets it sink in.
OFFICER PIERCE
Who do we contact for her?
Dana checks the papers in her hand.
OFFICER DANA
Her husband.
Maurice Parker.
They
live in Wynnewood.
Married
seventeen years.
Pierce looks back at what remains of the HONDA PRELUDE.
Beat.
OFFICER PIERCE
There isn't any good left in the
world, Dana.
Not one damn thing.
CLOSE UP of the hypnotic RED AND BLUE LIGHTS that consume the
highway.
DISSOLVE TO:
ROAD - EARLY MORNING
"TWO WEEKS EARLIER"
Just AFTER DAWN.
A gentle mist hangs in the air.
The calm
suburban streets wait to be flooded with a sea of middle
class homeowners on their way to work...
A woman's REEBOK CROSS-TRAINERS move along the sidewalk...
long, brisk steps, steps people have when walking with a
purpose...
The Cross-Trainers enter the doors of a bakery store seconds
after a man turns a window-sign from "CLOSED" to "OPEN"...
This happens with precision timing, not losing a step... a
well practiced routine.
CUT TO:
PARKER HOUSE - MORNING
A "FTD" Florist truck pulls up.
A delivery man, moves with
an extravagant bouquet of flowers to the front door.
He
RINGS THE DOOR BELL.
No answer.
KNOCKS.
No answer.
The delivery man looks to the ground and searches, before
placing the bouquet on the porch.
WE NOW SEE that the porch is completely covered with flowers,
bouquets and wreaths.
The delivery man tip-toes his way
through the maze of condolences and moves to his truck.
CUT TO:
PARK - MORNING
The neighborhood park.
The trees in full bloom.
Maurice
walks down a path leading to the open fields.
Only mothers
with strollers and the elderly are out this early.
CUT TO:
PARK BENCH
Maurice is seated on a park bench.
Across from him is an
ELDERLY COUPLE -- in their seventies.
The OLD WOMAN is frail
with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles.
The husband
is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like
a little boy.
Maurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands...
Their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him.
He watches as the old man gets up.
The old woman tries to
make him stay, but he playfully pulls away.
She shakes her
head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down
the path by himself.
The old woman glances Maurice's way.
OLD WOMAN
Good morning.
MAURICE
Good morning.
The old woman glances at the empty baby carriage standing
next to the bench.
OLD WOMAN
Is it a boy or a girl?
MAURICE
Oh, that's not mine.
Maurice gestures to the woman and baby who are sitting on a
blanket in the grass.
MAURICE
I don't have kids.
OLD WOMAN
You should.
Children are a
blessing from God.
I have four.
The old woman studies him.
OLD WOMAN
Are you okay?
Beat.
MAURICE
Is that your husband?
She nods, "Yes."
MAURICE
You look so happy -- how long have
you been married?
OLD WOMAN
Forty-seven years.
This hits Maurice hard.
OLD WOMAN
Are you married?
This hits Maurice even harder.
MAURICE
(this is painful)
Yes... Seventeen years.
The old woman looks down the path for her husband.
MAURICE
Where did he go?
OLD WOMAN
He's getting my sweater from the
car.
I said there was a breeze.
(shaking her head)
I told him not to go.
Beat.
MAURICE
May I ask you a question that might
sound strange?
OLD WOMAN
Yes.
Beat.
MAURICE
How do you know he loves you?
The old woman looks at him oddly.
MAURICE
I mean besides... time -- how did
you know ten years ago -- twenty
years ago?
She thinks hard... tough question.
No answer for a moment
then --
The old woman sees something out of the corner of her eye --
her husband is walking up the path with her white lace
sweater over his arm...
She smiles as the answer comes to her.
OLD WOMAN
Because he shows me... he's not
much for words, but he shows me.
Maurice sits back -- her answer lingers in the air like a
haunting voice.
Maurice watches as the old man comes back and drapes his wife
with the sweater.
The old woman waves as they continue down
the path... hand in hand.
CUT TO:
WYNNEWOOD PENNSYLVANIA - DAWN
A BRILLIANT RED HUE BLANKETS THE HORIZON.
The suburbs come to life...
Men and women leaving for work...
School buses picking up their cargo of passengers...
Store owners opening their businesses...
CUT TO:
PARKER BOOKS
A group of eleven year old boys including the two
kleptomaniacs we saw earlier, are standing before a closed

PENNS LANDING - DAY
Maurice stands at the edge of the water.
Recreations of
historical ships are docked in the harbor.
The old fashioned
sails and masts sway in the gentle breeze.
The SOUNDS OF A STREET VENDOR catch Maurice's ears.
He turns
to see a funnel cake booth in a row of food stalls.
CUT TO:
TWENTY YEARS EARLIER - DAY (FLASHBACK)
The harbor is jammed with people.
A street fair is in full
swing.
The SOUNDS OF A LIVE BAND MIX WITH THE CRIES OF THE
STREET VENDORS...
MAURICE -- EARLY TWENTIES... Skinny, dark rich hair.
He
yells out from behind a booth of paperback books.
YOUNG MAURICE
Three dollars a piece... Two for
four dollars!
All the classics!
A young woman emerges from the crowd of browsers.
Maurice
begins to speak but is caught off guard by YOUNG ELLEN'S
beautiful features.
Maurice manages a few words.
YOUNG MAURICE
Can I help you?
Beat.
YOUNG ELLEN
My father owns the food stall over
there.
Maurice looks over to find an enormous man serving food.
YOUNG ELLEN
You look thirsty.
Ellen places the soda she had at her side on the table.
Maurice is completely flustered.
YOUNG MAURICE
Hi, I'm Ellen.
Ellen places her hand out.
Maurice grabs it instinctively
and shakes.
YOUNG MAURICE
Maurice.
Ellen looks at the full table of books.
YOUNG ELLEN
Not doing too good huh?
Maurice nods "no."
YOUNG ELLEN
It'll pick up.
I've been coming to
these things my whole life...
people don't want to carry things
as they walk around... you'll sell
as the fair starts to end...
Ellen waits for Maurice to say something but nothing comes
out.
YOUNG ELLEN
You don't talk much do you?
YOUNG MAURICE
I read a lot.
Ellen's father BELLOWS FOR HER OVER THE CROWD.
Maurice jumps
at the sound.
YOUNG MAURICE
I better go...
(Ellen starts for her
booth)
... Come over if you get hungry.
Ellen disappears into a sea of people.
Maurice stands in awe
for a second before snapping out.
He shakes his head to
himself.
YOUNG MAURICE
I read a lot?
CUT TO:
LATER - IN THE FAIR
The people are filing out of the street.
Maurice is a whirl
wind of activity as people wave dollar bills at him calling
out classical titles.
Maurice glances over to Ellen's booth.
She is watching him
with a big smile.
Maurice gestures to the line with a
shocked expression.
Ellen laughs.
CUT TO:
FOOD STALL
The booths are packing up.
Ellen helps pack away the
remaining food.
A book is placed in front of her on the
counter.
The book is "Romeo and Juliet."
Ellen looks up to
see a very shy Maurice standing before her.
Ellen gives him
a smile that melts him.
MAURICE
Are you trying to tell me
something?
Beat.
Maurice eyes Ellen's dad who throws him deadly
glances.
Maurice is very intimidated.
He whispers to her.
MAURICE
(barely audible)
Walk with me?
ELLEN
You like to take walks?
MAURICE
No.
But I want to take a walk with
you.
Ellen looks at him carefully... looks right through him.
ELLEN
You just said something very sweet.
CUT TO:
THE EDGE OF THE WATER - DUSK
The water reflects the lights from the harbor.
Maurice and
Ellen are standing very close.
MAURICE
What are you thinking?
Ellen looks out onto the water.
ELLEN
It's one of those thoughts you keep
to yourself.
MAURICE
Please tell me.
Beat.
ELLEN
I was just thinking that if we
actually became a couple -- this
was a beautiful place to begin
things.
Maurice is bright red.
Ellen giggles at his shyness.
Maurice gathers his strength and looks her straight in the
eyes.
Maurice leans forward and kisses her softly.
CUT TO:
PENNS LANDING - MORNING (PRESENT)
Maurice, tears in his eyes, stands in the spot they stood
many years before.
MAURICE
(softly)
I love you Ellen.

STREET - DAY
A topless CHERRY RED WRANGLER JEEP pulls out of a mechanic's
garage and moves down route 32.
Kris Reddy is at the wheel.
A "Daily Gazette" sign flaps from his roll-bar.
Kris changes the station on the radio as his eye catches a
man walking on the opposite side of the street... Kris turns
back to the road -- mind racing... BRAKES SCREECH as the jeep
slows and then RUMBLES over the island separating the
lanes... making a U turn across a four lane highway.
CUT TO:
STREET - DAY
Maurice wiping his brow with a handkerchief.
The Wrangler
jeep rolls up next to him as he walks.
Maurice doesn't stop
walking as Kris leans over the passenger seat.
KRIS
Phileas Fogg?
MAURICE
(looking ahead)
... Round The World In Eighty Days.
... Hello Kris.
KRIS
You're amazing... What are you
doing Mr. Parker?
MAURICE
I told you.
Beat.
Cars HONK as they pull by the slow duo.
KRIS
You're walking to California?
MAURICE
Pacifica, California -- it's a
coastal city.
KRIS
Oh, a coastal city.
That's good.
Kris looks around to see if anyone else sees the lunacy in
this moment.
MAURICE
Ellen told me that she didn't know
if I loved her.
KRIS
She knew you loved her.
MAURICE
She wasn't certain... I never
really showed her.
Beat.
KRIS
I'm really lost.
What does this
have to do with walking?
MAURICE
I said, 'I would do anything for
her'... and she didn't believe me.
I said, 'I'd walk across the
country for her'... she didn't
believe me.
Maurice looks to Kris rolling along beside him.
He sees the
worried expression on his face.
MAURICE
I need to show her how much I love
her Kris.
KRIS
Why know?
MAURICE
Because I should have shown her
before... Everyday, I should have
shown her.
Beat.
KRIS
Pacifica, California... that's a
long ways away.
MAURICE
So I've been informed.
Kris tries to act calm, but it doesn't last long.
KRIS
Shit Mr. Parker.
You can't walk
across the United States -- it's
over three thousand miles.
Maurice takes his time with the response.
Kris waves more
cars to pass them.
MAURICE
Ellen got up every morning and went
to the corner store to get me my
bread for breakfast... Everyday.
Now that's about a quarter mile
each way... 17 years... that comes
to about three thousand miles...
(he smiles to himself)
And you know what Kris?
KRIS
What Mr. Parker?
MAURICE
She never ate a slice.
Maurice picks up speed -- surer with every step... Kris slows
the jeep to a stop and reaches into his bag.
The mini tape
recorder goes on with a CLICK.
KRIS
Thursday, September 26... 'The
Question We Never Ask - What Would
We Do For Love?'
Kris watches through the windshield as Mr. Parker disappears

Nighttime.
The empty street ECHOES with the TIRED SHUFFLE OF
MAURICE'S FEET.
Maurice stops in this tracks and picks up a CRUSHED COKE CAN

He places it upright at the place
where he stands.
Maurice immediately walks off the highway
into a small MOTEL PARKING LOT.
CUT TO:
MOTEL - MORNING
Maurice looks down the highway... eyes squinting to block out
the sun.
The road winds and dissolves into the horizon...
Maurice looks back the way he came -- a second of

Maurice takes a deep breath before moving to the CRUSHED COKE
CAN.
He moves to the exact spot where he left the road the
night before and begins walking again...

His new sneakers

A SHARP PAIN SHOOTS UP MAURICE'S LEG.
His knees buckle.
The
shoulder bags tumble to the ground followed by Maurice
himself.
From a distance it looks like he's been shot.
Maurice grabs the back of his thigh and tries to straighten
his leg out... His face frozen in a painful expression.
Maurice rubs his legs slowly -- working the cramp out.
He
relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg.
Maurice
sits there motionless -- eyes glazed... defeated.
The SOUNDS OF A BIRD snap him out of his trance.
He looks up
to see a PAINTED BUNTING, a bird about six inches in height
FLY DOWN from a tree and land on a rock next to him.
Maurice
stares at the beautiful bird curiously.
Its body splashed
with brilliant blues, reds and greens.
It looks out of place
in these mundane surroundings.
Maurice looks around the
skies to see no other birds.
The Painted Bunting chirps a
few times before taking flight into the air.
It circles over
Maurice before disappearing behind the trees.
Maurice smiles.
He pulls himself to his feet with great
effort.
Maurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the
essentials -- the maps, food, a canister of water.
Maurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder with
great effort.
At his feet, are the rest of his belonging --
piled on the side of the road.
Maurice painfully begins walking again.
WE PULL BACK on Maurice's figure walking on the highway...

MAURICE
They are?
BOY 2
Sure man, High-Top Nike Cross
Trainers with heel supports and air
cushioned soles -- They're nasty.
The boys keep walking.
Maurice looks down at his sneakers
with new-found pride.
After a while, Maurice's attention switches back to the cars.
One car in question catches Maurice's eye.
A woman consoles
a small child who doesn't want to leave the car.
She wipes
his tiny tears with her hand and hugs him tenderly.
The
little boy's head cradled in her arms.

The Parker house many years ago.
The house semi-furnished.
Ellen carefully hangs her first bird photographs on the wall;

Wings spread,

MAURICE
I thought we both wanted the same
things.
ELLEN
I've changed my mind.
MAURICE
You can't change your mind.
Beat.
Ellen takes a seat on the only sofa.
ELLEN
I want children.
MAURICE
You've just decided, is that right?
ELLEN
Yes.
Young Maurice is visibly upset.
MAURICE
Ellen, there are two kinds of
people in the world --
ELLEN
Please not, 'The two kinds of
people' speech.
MAURICE
... People that were made to be
parents, and people who were not
made to be parents... My parents,
were people who were not made to be
parents but had kids anyway.
I
don't want us to be that way Ellen.
ELLEN
You can change.
MAURICE
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of
person who reads bedtime stories.
But you love me anyway.
ELLEN
(upset)
Don't be so sure.
Ellen fiddles with her dress.
She bites her bottom lip as
she tries not to cry.
ELLEN
(shaky voice)
What if something happens to one of
us?
We'll be all alone.
Maurice loses his hard demeanor and moves next to her.
He
lays his hand across her shoulder.
MAURICE
Nothing will happen to us.
It's a
bleak picture, I know, but we're
going to be together till were old
and grey and you don't remember my
name anymore.
Maurice lifts her chin with his hand gently.
She blinks her
eyes and a tear rolls down her cheek.
He takes a deep
breath.
MAURICE
Let me think about it okay.
Ellen brightens up immediately.
MAURICE
I'm not saying anytime soon.
I'm
just saying that maybe we can
consider it down the road sometime.
Ellen gives her patented glowing smile.
She hugs him with
all her strength.
She whispers in his ear.

CUT TO:
ROAD - DUSK
Maurice practically hobbles his way down a road lined by
towering pines.
He stops to take a drink from his canister
and keeps walking.
The SOUNDS OF A CAR GROW IN THE DISTANCE.
Maurice doesn't turn his back.
The CANARY YELLOW TRUCK pulls over the ridge with a load full
of passengers.
It gains distance on Maurice.
Maurice hears the ENGINE and waves HIS ARM IN THE AIR --
signaling for it to pass him.
Maurice walks ten more feet
before turning around.
Maurice's face instantly changes when he sees the demented
grins through the windshield of the truck.
Maurice turns and
quickens his pace... The truck picks up pace... Maurice
breaks into a run... The truck speeds up, passes Maurice and
stops in front of him.
Panic fills Maurice as he watches the truck unload it's
drunken passengers.
Eyes scan the forest on either side for
a way out.
Maurice decides to stand his ground.
MAURICE
(to himself)
This is Indiana -- nothing's going
to happen to you.
DENNY
You need a ride, Preacher?
The men walk up to Maurice.
MAURICE
No thank you I'll walk.
A tall lanky gentleman gestures to Maurice's shoulder bag
with his beer can.
Some beer sprays Maurice's feet with the
gesture.
WIL
Where you coming from?
MAURICE
Look gentlemen, I'm late, I need
to --
DENNY
I've been thinking -- who the hell
is this preacher guy?
Coming up to
me and my friends?
Looking like he
wanted to kick my ass for drinking?
Denny gives Maurice that inhuman stare.
Maurice is clearly
frightened.
DENNY
Then I figured it.
You're angry.
You lost somebody, because some
asshole was drinking.
Maurice is frozen.
DENNY
Maybe you lost a son?
A sister?
A
wife?
Maurice looks up for a millisecond.
Denny doesn't miss it.
DENNY
(stepping closer)
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk
run into your wife?
Crushed her
like a bug.
Snapped her bones?
MAURICE
That's enough.
Maurice is red with anger.
Denny loves it.
DENNY
Oh the preacher's getting angry
again...
(Denny goes ice cold)
Tell me something.
Did she die
instantly or did she feel every
torn muscle and shattered bone?
Were you there to help her?
Or
were you safe at home when the
windshield sliced into her face --
MAURICE
I'll kill you!
Maurice swings.
Denny easily avoids it.
Maurice doesn't see
the first BLOW COMING, IT HITS HIM IN THE CHEST -- Maurice
gasps for air as he buckles to the dirt.
Hands grab --
restrain.
A POWERFUL KICK IN THE RIBS -- ANOTHER...
LAUGHTER... ANOTHER SET OF VICIOUS KICKS... The road and
forest begin to spin... A PAINFUL SLASH ACROSS HIS FACE...
Maurice prepares for the next blow... it never comes.
RED

a man leans over a car door... The image becomes clearer -- a
POLICEMAN stands poised -- gun aimed directly at the men
hovering over him.
POLICE OFFICER

Step away from him now!

INDIANA POLICE STATION - MORNING
Maurice and Officer Grey are seated on the front stairs of

Adelle steps out of a RENTED TOYOTA CELICA.
Her tense --
frightened eyes betray her mental state for the past ten
hours.
She walks to the stairs.
GREY
Mrs. Matlin... good morning.
Maurice slowly gets up.
Adelle is in shock as she looks at
the stranger before her.
Maurice stands in a 'COLTS' football T-shirt, faded jeans and
sneakers.
His left cheek is black and blue, and his arm and
side are bandaged.
ADELLE
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing
sneakers?
MAURICE
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with
heel support and air-cushioned
soles.
They're nasty.
Adelle wasn't sure what that meant.
She shakes it off and
hugs Maurice.
She is visibly relieved to have him in her
arms.
GREY
My shift ended an hour ago.
Adelle notices the ROSE in Grey's hand.
Grey catches her
glance.
GREY
It's for my wife.
ADELLE
What's the occasion?
Grey looks to Maurice -- they exchange a knowing smile.
GREY
No occasion.
Adelle notices the WINK exchanged between Grey and Maurice.
GREY
You can use the conference room, if
you want to talk.
ADELLE
That won't be necessary.
GREY
Fine.
ADELLE
We can talk on the way back -- I
rented a car.
Beat.
MAURICE
It'll be kind of hard to talk,
since you'll be in the car and I
won't.
Adelle gives Maurice an angry glare -- Maurice holds his
ground.
GREY
The conference room is down the
hall on your right.
CUT TO:
GAS STATION/REST STOP - DAY
The rented Toyota Celica is parked at the convenience store.
Maurice is seated in the back staring out at the eighteen
wheelers that come in and out of the parking lot.
He glances
in to Adelle who is gathering food.
Maurice's dull eyes are about to shut when something catches
his attention.
He sits up and stares out the window with
great intensity.
Maurice watches as a large truck pulls into
the parking lot, across it's side in blazing red --
"Jackson Liquor Wholesalers - Since 1945"
Maurice scans the area... gas station ATTENDANTS... A BEARDED
HOMELESS MAN laying next to a heating unit... KIDS eating
fast food on old picnic tables...
Maurice's gaze steadies on the TRUCK, as the driver fills the
tank with gas.
CUT TO:
A PHONE BOOTH INSIDE THE CONVENIENCE STORE
Adelle is on the phone.
ADELLE
We'll figure everything out when we
get there... Oh, he's going to need
a lot of help with this... He
wasn't even going to come with me,
I had to tell him that he could do
the walk later if he plans well...
I know, but by that time I'll have
gotten him some treatment... I just
want to get back home before he
changes his mind.
CUT TO:
CAR - LATER
Adelle gets in the front seat of the car keeping the bag of
food on the passenger seat.
She starts the car as she talks
into the rearview mirror.
ADELLE
You want something to eat?
She stares at Maurice covered in a blanket with his back to
her... an unresponsive blob.
ADELLE
I know you're feeling a lot of
emotions right now.
It's okay to
be mad.
It's okay to feel
helpless.
It's part of the healing
process.
I understand.
I do.
Adelle puts the Celica into drive and pulls out onto the
highway.

The rented Toyota Celica pulls into
the driveway.
The front door of the house opens.
Gerald
walks out to greet them.
A tired Adelle slips out of the car and hugs Gerald.
ADELLE
He was exhausted -- slept the whole
way.
Adelle and Gerald move to the back door of the Celica.
They
open it and stare at Maurice covered by the blanket.
Adelle
shakes the blanket.
ADELLE
Uncle Maurice we're home... Uncle
Maurice.
Adelle shakes Maurice, who stirs a little as he wakes.
His
feet slide out from under the blanket -- Adelle stares
curiously at the ARMY COMBAT BOOTS that dangle out.
ADELLE
Uncle Maurice?
Adelle pulls aside the covers... THE HOMELESS MAN, from the
gas station, sits up.
ADELLE'S SHRILL SCREAM BLASTS THROUGH
THE AIR.
Gerald and Adelle stumble back as the large,
bearded man struggles out of the car and looks around the
quiet neighborhood.
HOMELESS MAN
So this is the City of Brotherly
Love.
The homeless man raises his hand.
He holds up MAURICE'S WELL
POLISHED BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION and kisses it lovingly.
Adelle and Gerald stare back speechless.
DISSOLVE TO:
ROAD - MORNING
JACKSON WHOLESALER'S PARKING LOT.
The truck from the gas
station, the only vehicle parked before the store.
CUT TO:
ROAD - MORNING
Maurice back on the road.
His limp only slightly visible at
this point in the day.
The bandages rubbing him with every
step.
The highway takes him around a beautiful bend of trees.
THE
AIR IS FILLED WITH THE SOUNDS OF BIRDS.
Maurice spots a
YELLOW WARBLER, a striking bird about eight inches long with
vivid yellow feathers.
It sits elegantly on a nearby branch.
He walks towards it -- it stays in position.
Closer.
The
bird chirps back at him.
Maurice is within arms reach of the
bird.
MAURICE
Ellen would have loved you.
Maurice looks closer -- and notices it's wings.
The feathers
bend back -- a dark area at the center.
MAURICE
How did that happen?
Maurice watches the bird hop around the branch -- unable to
fly.
CUT TO:
STREAM - DAY (PRESENT)
Maurice is kneeling at a stream by the side of the road.
He
gently clears away the dirt from the Yellow Warbler's
feathers.
MAURICE
You'll be all right.
A couple days
and you'll be up there again.
Maurice carries the bird back to the trees.
He lays it back
on the branch.
He stares at it's beautiful coat with a
smile.
MAURICE
Ellen would have loved you.
CUT TO:
MIDWEST HIGHWAYS - DAY
The land is flat.
From the roads one can see endless fields
in all directions.
When the wind blows, the crops bend in
unison, changing the shape and texture of the land for a
moment and instantly changing back with a snap of the wind.
Maurice takes in the beauty of the land through a painful
grimace.
Occasionally clutching his right leg in moments of
extreme pain.
Maurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road
and watches the wind change the fields.
He closes his jacket
as the gusts become stronger.
DISSOLVE TO:
HOTEL
The clock clicks past 11:30 am.
Maurice is still in bed --
the curtains drawn.
He crawls out from under the sheets and
downs two pills with a glass of water.
He looks bad.
His
face pale, his eyes at half-mast.
He wipes unnatural sweat
from his brow and melts into the bed again.
DISSOLVE TO:
STREET
Just after dusk.
A small town's main road.
Maurice quietly
passes under the street lights.
He stares up and tightens the hood on his parka as the first
SNOWFLAKE falls into the SHAFT OF THE STREET LIGHT.
Soon
thousands of flakes fall into the light...
DISSOLVE TO:
GAZETTE BUILDING
Kris fields calls frantically as the LIGHTS BLINK ANXIOUSLY
on his phone.
The front page of the Gazette is posted on his
pin up board.
It reads... "HE MARCHES ON..."
Underneath is
A PICTURE of Maurice standing outside his bookstore holding
up THE BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION proudly.
A teenage boy gets off the elevator and maneuvers an enormous
bag over his shoulder... emblazoned across his back are the
words "MAIL ROOM."
The boy comes to Kris and empties the bag
on Kris' desk without a word.
Hundreds of letters cascade
down swallowing the table top and covering Kris who stares in
awe as the letters keep coming.
DISSOLVE TO:
MOTEL
Maurice is COUGHING PAINFULLY.
He crouches over the edge of
the bed and holds his side with every strain.
Maurice looks worse than ever.
His hair and shirt are soaked
with sweat.
The coughing attack stops.
Maurice take a
couple deep breaths before laying back down.
His feet are visible -- sticking out from beneath the sheets.
They look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen
and bruised.
They disappear under the sheets.
DISSOLVE TO:
SNOW COVERED ROADS
that stretch into a white oblivion.
SUPERIMPOSE:
ELM CREEK, NEBRASKA... MILE 1,564
CUT TO:
STREET - DAY
Early morning.
The branches of the trees are encapsulated in
ice.
The snow piled ten inches on every surface.
Maurice,
buried deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around.
His breath materializes with every step.
He forces a weak
smile at the magical landscape before him.
White.
Pure.
Peaceful.
The SOUNDS OF A VOLVO STATION WAGON urges Maurice to the side
of the road.
As it passes a little girl waves from the
passenger window.
Maurice puts on a brave face and waves
back.
Another CAR ENTERS the picture -- A DARK BLUE FIREBIRD rises
over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast.
SLOW-MOTION as the Firebird skids over the ice and the snow
-- the driver desperately trying to gain control... The
mother in the Volvo hits the BRAKES as the Firebird spins
into her lane... Maurice yells out.
MAURICE
No!
The cars IMPACT with a sickening CRUNCH -- BACK TO REAL TIME:
The Firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and
coming to a stop in a bank of snow.
The Volvo isn't so lucky.
It flips from the impact...
sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the
road... It comes to a rest a hundred feet away.
SILENCE.
STILLNESS.
The entire event took only seconds.
Maurice runs frantically after the Volvo.
The windows are
SHATTERED.
Snow has packed into the over-turned car.
No one
can be seen inside the vehicle.
Maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his
hand.
His arm disappears up to the shoulder.
His face
grimacing with the strain.
His arm comes out slowly...
A few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks
through the wall of snow and slides out of the window.
She
lets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by
the wrist.
Maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs.
MAURICE
(panting)
It's okay.
It's all over.
Maurice lays her gently against a snow bank, before moving to
the other side of the car.
DRIVER (O.S.)
Is she okay?
Maurice looks up to see the driver of the Firebird walking
towards him.
He looks dazed.
Maurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in
the snow... deeper than before.
His cheek pressed against
the snow, almost laying flat on the ground.
MAURICE
(frantic)
Oh no... she's wearing a seat-belt.
Maurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... He lets out a
POWERFUL GRUNT as he pulls back with all his strength -- a
woman's WRIST appears first, then the tangled hair and then
the body spills out onto the road next to Maurice.
The driver appears over the Woman and Maurice and loses it
when he sees them.
DRIVER
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't my
fault.
Maurice, out of breath, clears the woman's face and mouth --
no movement.
No sound.
MAURICE
Come on... please...
Maurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth...
MAURICE
Please...
She doesn't respond.
CUT TO:
A FRIGHTENING FLASH
The mother's UNCONSCIOUS face turns into ELLEN.
Her lifeless
eyes -- her bruised cheek and forehead.
Her neck at an
awkward angle.
Maurice stares down at his wife in horror.
MAURICE
No Ellen... don't die...
CUT TO:
THE MOTHER
being revived by Maurice.
He pushes her chest in counting...
push, count, breath... push, count, breath...
The mother's BODY TWITCHES, slightly at first -- then
obviously... The mother let's out a FEW PAINFUL COUGHS.
She takes a breath.
Life quickly returns to her body.
Maurice places her head in his lap and hugs her, lightly
rocking back and forth.
The tears streaming down his red
face.
MAURICE
Everything's going to be fine
Ellen.
I won't let anything happen
to you.
I love you sweetie.
Everything's going to be different
now.
The SCENE BACKS OUT as Maurice comforts this stranger in his
arms.
CUT TO:
ROAD - AFTERNOON
The police have descended on the scene.
Traffic has been
blocked off in both directions.
The LIGHT thrown by the
ambulances tints the snow and fields a THROBBING RED.
Maurice's face can be seen in the shadows of the backseat of
a police car.
OUTSIDE THE CAR
OFFICER HANSEN AND OFFICER TANDY converse.
HANSEN
What's his story?
TANDY
His name is Maurice.
He's dancing
around everything else.
HANSEN
Red flag, man.
TANDY
If he's in trouble with the law --
fine.
Not our problem.
He yanked
two people from a car wreck, let's
give him some space.
Hansen looks in at the drawn, exhausted face of Maurice
through the window.
Hansen opens the back door.
HANSEN
Maurice, you need anything?
Which
way were you headed?
We can drive
you.
MAURICE
No thank you officer.
I'll walk.
Hansen throws a sharp glance to Tandy.
Hansen turns back to
Maurice.
HANSEN
Grub?
Food?
How about food?
Our
dime at the local diner...
Maurice mulls this offer.
HANSEN
Come on man, you're a hero.
In
Nebraska we don't let hero's walk
around with empty stomachs.
Beat.
MAURICE
... I need to be brought back here.
HANSEN
Deal.
CUT TO:
POLICE CAR - NIGHT
The ride progresses in silence.
Hansen and Tandy in the
front seat.
Maurice's head is pressed against the back-seat
window.
His eyes begin to shut slightly as sleep overcomes
him.
The car goes over a BUMP.
Maurice jars awake.
He
glances out the window to see a highway sign swish by in the
HEADLIGHTS.
'ROUTE 80 EAST'.
East?
Maurice looks around quickly at the passing scenery.
MAURICE
Where are you taking me?
Hansen and Tandy exchange looks.
HANSEN
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the
station and then drop you back.
TANDY
That's all right isn't it?
MAURICE
Sure.
Hansen looks back to the road.
The drive continues in
silence.
Tandy checks his watch just when a CLICK -- A HARD
WIND -- AND A METALLIC SLAM in quick succession shakes the
car.
HANSEN
What the hell was that?
Tandy looks back -- Maurice is GONE.
The back seat empty.
Tandy stares out the blackness of the back window.
TANDY
Shit!
He jumped!
HANSEN
Jumped where?
TANDY
Out of the car.
He jumped out of
the god damn car!
CUT TO:
FOREST - NIGHT
Maurice staggers through the naked trees.
Thin trees every
few feet with no branches.
The snow ankle deep.
Maurice braces himself against a trunk, checking his hands.
His vision blurs as he stares down at his scraped bloody
palms.
The forest clears quickly into an open field.
Far in the
distance across the field of white is a small pointed
building standing alone.
The glow of a LIGHT can be seen
through the windows.
Maurice trudges through the deeper snow.
Stumbling many
times.
The frigid wind pushing him to his knees.
Maurice
keeps moving -- the field seems endless...
CUT TO:
DRIVEWAY
Maurice's feet hit the snow of the driveway, just as his legs
buckle -- his face HITS the snow hard.
He manages to roll
over on his back with great effort.
He stares up at the
pointed building -- the dull light becoming duller...
something blocks the light.
A man.
Maurice feels himself
rise into the air as two powerful arms scoop him off the ice.
A PRIEST carries him into the doors of a CHURCH.
CUT TO:
CHURCH - WESTERN HIGHWAY - DAY
Father Berchman wraps one powerful hand around a tiny silver
cross dangling from his neck.
The other hand waves high into
the air at the shrinking figure of Maurice Parker walking
through the snow.
DISSOLVE TO:
HIGHWAY
The long trek continues.
The black tar of the roads peek out
in spots as the SUN BEATS down on the flatlands.
Maurice
drapes his worn scarf around a melting snowman.
DISSOLVE TO:
RESTAURANT
We are looking inside a fancy Center-City Philadelphia
restaurant.
Adelle and Gerald are seated by an enormous bay
window.
A waiter comes to their table with their main
course.
Gerald watches the food being served with great
anticipation.
Gerald's eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on
the sidewalk... He squints to see better.
Realization hits
hard... His eyes light up.
He looks to Adelle and back to
the magazine stand.
In a mad race for time, Gerald begins to devour the food on
his plate.
The waiter and Adelle watch him in shock.
Adelle
glances out the window.
Her eyes squint... then light up.
She jumps to her feet and grabs Gerald by the arm, a fork
full of food drops to his plate.
Gerald looks back at his
full plate longingly as Adelle pulls him out of the
restaurant.
The waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand.
He
squints.
CUT TO:
MAGAZINE STAND
The NEW YORK TIMES are hung like stockings around the border
of the stand.
On the front pages, a singular headline stands
out among the others:
"A JOURNEY OF THE HEART"
A large PHOTO OF MAURICE is next to the headline.
DISSOLVE TO:
DINER
A red-headed waitress slices a credit card through the

The waitress returns with the card -- she shakes her head
"No" at Maurice who digs into his wallet for cash.
DISSOLVE TO:
MOTEL
Maurice slides two twenties across the counter to the motel
manager.
Maurice checks the remaining bills in his wallet...
only a few bills left.
In the motel room we find Maurice sitting over the edge of a
bed buckled over in a coughing attack.
It finally stops.
Maurice flops back to the pillows, completely drained.
DISSOLVE TO:
ROADS
The flatlands have vanished.
The roads now serpentine
through mountain ranges.
VIEW FROM THE MOUNTAIN RANGE; Maurice moves like a grain of
dust over the black line of the road.
Maurice rests every half mile.
He labors up every incline
with ultimate effort.
He braces himself with a branch
serving as a make due crutch.
Maurice spots a small town nestled in the arms of the
mountain range.
He begins the journey to rest.

Maurice pays for his food with the last few bills in his

Maurice wipes the mailbox clean with his hand.
The name

"CALDWELLS."
CUT TO:
FRONT DOOR
Maurice tentatively moving to the front door.
His hand
instinctively clutches his empty stomach.
The wind blows gently.
Maurice shuts his eyes and takes a
deep breath.
He opens his eyes slowly to see a dinner table
being set.
Potatoes, gravy, fresh baked bread... floating
through the half open window to Maurice's thankful smile.
THE SOUNDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS CAN BE HEARD INSIDE.
The first LIGHT KNOCKS go unheard with all the commotion.
HARDER.
The door squeaks open.
Maurice puts on his best
smile... the door opens wider -- no one stands before him.
BOY (O.S.)
Hi.
Maurice looks down to find an adorable little boy, black
hair, big eyes and an even bigger grin.
This is three year
old ISAAC CALDWELL.
MAURICE
Well, hello.
ISAAC
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
MAURICE
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much
older than three.
Are your parents
home?
Beat.
Isaac thinks.
ISAAC
You know what, I can play baseball
with my brothers when I'm bigger.
MAURICE
Is that right?
ISAAC
You know what... I'm just little
now, but I'll be big soon.
MAURICE
You'll probably be bigger than your
brothers.
ISAAC
Yeah!
Isaac is happy with this thought.
Maurice looks up as MRS. CALDWELL comes to the door.
MRS. CALDWELL
Who are you talking to Isaac?
Mrs. Caldwell stops as she stares at Maurice.
MAURICE
Hello, I'm Maurice Parker.
I'm
just passing through and I need to
conserve what little funds I
have... I need some food and a roof
to sleep under for one night... Now
I don't look like much, but if
there are any things that need to
get done around the house --
Mrs. Caldwell doesn't listen, but instead yells behind the
door.
MRS. CALDWELL
Dave... you're not going to believe
who's here.
Maurice looks at her oddly.
MR. CALDWELL comes to the door;
his face lights up.
MRS. CALDWELL
This is Maurice Parker -- the one
walking for his wife.
Mr. Caldwell is completely floored.
So, for that matter is
Maurice.
Mr. Caldwell puts out his hand with awe.
MR. CALDWELL
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave
Caldwell.
I do the copy for the
anchor on the evening news down
here.
MAURICE
Evening News?
MR. CALDWELL
We did a piece after your story ran
in the New York Times.
Maurice is truly surprised.
MAURICE
New York Times?
Mrs. Caldwell ushers Maurice in the doorway by the elbow.
MRS. CALDWELL
Someone said they spotted you in
town... Mr. Parker, you're a
celebrity.
CUT TO:
CALDWELL DRIVEWAY - MORNING
The family dog "Max", scurries up and down with great
excitement.
Max can sense something big is happening.
The Caldwell clan, one and all has gathered at the end of
their driveway.
Maurice is escorted out by Isaac who clings
tightly to his hand.
Mr. Caldwell meets Maurice halfway and
pulls him aside.
MR. CALDWELL
That's a nice watch.
Maurice looks down at his beat-up Seiko.
MR. CALDWELL
I've always wanted a watch like
that.
MAURICE
(unstrapping it)
It's yours.
MR. CALDWELL
No.
I won't take it unless I pay
for it... Let's see, that's a
pretty nice watch -- I can see
that.
Maurice watches him suspiciously as he pulls out an envelope
from his jacket pocket.
MR. CALDWELL
Let's say I give you what's in this
envelope for that beautiful watch.
Maurice is handed the envelope.
He opens it to find a thick
PILE OF CASH, TENS AND TWENTIES.
MR. CALDWELL
I really want that watch.
MAURICE
This isn't right.
MR. CALDWELL
This is my only chance to get a
watch like that.
It would mean a
lot to me and my family.
Please
take it.
It really isn't that
much.
Maurice stares into the envelope emotionally and hands over
the watch tentatively.
MAURICE
This is a loan.
Mr. Caldwell straps on the watch and then hugs Maurice.
The rest of the family say their good-byes.
Isaac won't let go of Maurice's hand as he walks out into the
street.
MR. CALDWELL
Isaac, come back here.
Isaac just holds on tighter.
After Maurice and Isaac have
walked a few steps out into the street, Maurice kneels down.
MAURICE
I have to go now.
Isaac's bottom lip protrudes as he tries not to cry.
Maurice
has to hold back a few tears himself.
He hugs Isaac tightly.
MAURICE
(whispers)
Why didn't I meet you fifteen years
ago?
Maurice pulls away from Isaac slowly.
Isaac runs to his
mother's arms.
Maurice waves good-bye to the Caldwells as he
heads down the road.
CUT TO:
ROAD - DAY
Maurice stops, bends down to the road and picks up a TORN
WHITE PAPER STREAMER that spiraled its way to his feet.
He looks ahead and finds both sides of the street lined with
parked cars.
Some of the cars are decorated with white
streamers.
CUT TO:
OUTDOOR WEDDING
A beautiful canopy of flowers sits at the end of ten rows of
lawn chairs.
Maurice watches from near the cars.
He smiles

Everyone LAUGHS warmly as the groom stumbles over his lines.
CUT TO:
OUTDOOR MARRIAGE - DAY (PRESENT)
The bride and groom run through a shower of rice into their
limousine.
CUT TO:
INSIDE LIMOUSINE
They wave through the window as the car pulls away.
They
settle in and look to the seat across from them.
On the seat
is a fresh flower.
Next to the flower is a note.
The groom
picks it up and shows it to the bride.
It reads:
"CHERISH EVERYDAY TOGETHER"
It is signed "M.P."
The bride and groom look at each other curiously.
CUT TO:
ROAD
The limousine passes Maurice on the road as he walks.
CUT TO:
HIGHWAY - DAY
A merciless sun beats down on a long stretch of highway.
The
black tar from the road melting slightly.
No sign of Maurice.
WE SEE into the distance, not a soul in
sight.
WE LOOK to a hillside a hundred meters from the road.
There we see a figure lying still in the shade of an
overhanging rock formation.
Maurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on
his shoulder bag.
He is fast asleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
DUSK
The SUN TURNS RED for one brilliant moment before hiding
behind the horizon.
Like an alarm went off, Maurice wakes up
and packs his things.
CUT TO:
ROAD
The MOONLIGHT outlines a line figure hobbling his way step by
step with a walking stick.
The air fills with a POWERFUL RUMBLE.
Maurice turns to see a
wave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road.
They CAUSE A GREAT THUNDER that settles to dust.
Maurice
walks down the center of the highway away from the hillside.
DISSOLVE TO:
HIGHWAY - DAWN
THE FIERY NEVADA SUN BEGINS ITS ASCENT INTO THE SKY.
Maurice
looks bad.
He's breathing heavy as he moves up a steep
incline by the side of the road.
His feet slide on the loose
dirt.
Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment.
He makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough
room to lay down in the shade.
Maurice lays out slowly.
He
pries off his sneakers, band-aids and blisters cover every
inch of his feet.
Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers
and painfully pulls them back on.
His eyes close as he tries
to unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep.
Maurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the
hill... First WE SEE nothing, then some grains of sand escape
from the crack where the rock meets the hillside.
The CRACK
BECOMES SLIGHTLY LARGER -- PULLING AWAY FROM THE HILL BY A
FRACTION OF AN INCH.
It stabilizes there.
Maurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty
five feet above the ground.
CUT TO:
MID-DAY
Another sizzler.
Temperatures in the nineties.
The sun is
directly overhead.
Maurice stirs in his sleep, moving closer to the edge of the
rock.
A STEADY STREAM OF SAND POURS FROM THE CRACK...
A SLIGHT TREMOR...
THEN THE FRIGHTENING SOUND OF ROCK MOVING AGAINST ROCK...
Maurice wakes up as he begins to slide off... Hands scraping
at the dirt... He SLIDES OFF THE ROCK... Feet and hands
desperately trying to cling to the hillside... He picks up
speed as he tumbles down... Maurice looks down in time to see
a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time for
panic... SLAM!
A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS the
rock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of the
slope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt,
clutching his ribs.
The sun beats down on his stunned eyes.
Maurice stares up at the dizzying slope.
Sand still
trickling down to a stop.
He doesn't try to move for the
first few seconds.
His breathing increasingly erratic.
Maurice drags himself to sit upright.
The sharp pains
causing a distorted grimace on his face.
A short rest,
before working his way to his feet.
CUT TO:
HIGHWAY
Maurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest.
He takes a
seat in the dirt.
Maurice's hair is damp with sweat.
His
breathing relegated to slow gasps.
His left hand covering
his rib cage protectively.
Blood begins to trickle through
the spaces between his fingers.
Maurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg
goes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leg
instantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings to
the back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the verge
of tears.
He glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE
miles away in the distance.
A car is moving in his
direction.
Maurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY.
Drops of sweat
falling into his eyes.
MAURICE
(whisper)
It's over Ellen... I failed you
again.
Maurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing
larger.
MAURICE
I tried Ellen, I really tried... I
don't have the strength.
The cloud is now clearly a car... Maurice stares up into the
sky again... The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks.
Maurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS.
MAURICE
You said I would never be alone!...
You promised...
(his yelling turns to
sobs)
... You promised.
Maurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS
HEAD.
Maurice turns and looks through his tears...
There, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically
on the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.
It stands two and half
feet tall.
It spreads it's great wings.
The feathers expand
like a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle
shade on Maurice's face.
Maurice is frozen in wonder.
The MAGIC of the moment glows
in his eyes.
Maurice's face gains life... The dark feathered
eagle stands like a god before Maurice.
The moment is
breathtaking.
CUT TO:
ROAD
The car on the road, takes the last quarter mile in
seconds... SCREECHING IT'S BRAKES at the sight of Maurice on
the side of the road.
Maurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up.
The
driver gets out and calls over the hood.
DRIVER
Hey, man are you okay?
Maurice's face filled with strength.
He grins through the
pain.
MAURICE
I'm fine.
DRIVER
What the hell are you doing out
here?
You need a ride somewhere?
MAURICE
No thank you.
The driver is concerned.
He opens the driver door.
DRIVER
You by yourself?
Beat.
MAURICE
No.
This pacifies the driver somewhat.
He nods and gets in the
car.
Maurice watches as the car pulls away.
He turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone.
Maurice
looks up into the sky.
The Golden Eagle is flying
overhead... a tiny dot against the blazing sun.
Maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support.
Maurice takes his first step...
DISSOLVE TO:
SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
Suburbia.
Rows of similar houses with small lawns and custom

Beautiful trees line the streets creating a

Two women sit on a swing on the front porch of a small

JANIS AND AMMIE'S conversation is cut in mid
sentence.
JANIS
Who is that?
AMMIE
I don't know.
What's the matter

Janis and Ammie stare to the street where a sunburnt MAURICE
staggers in a daze.
MAURICE'S POV
Maurice is on the edge of darkness... the trees and faces
swimming -- mixed with the colors of red and blue cloth
waving in the wind... Images come in and out of focus... two
women walking towards him... Maurice clutches his head as the

STEPHANIE
I never thanked my father.
He did

him.
Maurice holds her sad face in his scared hands.
MAURICE
(whispering)
It's not too late.
Maurice gets out of the car painfully slow.
He pulls his
shoulder back upright with a laborious breath.
A sense of
pride returns to his face.
He turns back to Stephanie and
catches a horrified look.
He follows her stare...
She is staring at his shirt... He looks down to see a DARK
CRIMSON STAIN GROWING beneath the surface.
He covers the
area with his hand.
MAURICE
You're going to have a lot of work
to do when I get back.
STEPHANIE
Someone should be with you.
Beat.
MAURICE
Someone is.
He gives her his best smile and begins shuffling his feet
over the loose gravel of the road... one step at a time.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT
Police vehicles roam the city streets -- slowing to a crawl
at every white male over forty, walking the sidewalks.
CUT TO:
ADELLE
scanning the crowded intersections through the open window of
her moving taxi.
CUT TO:
KRIS
patrolling the streets on foot.
He stops at a hot dog vendor
and flashes a picture of Maurice from his wallet.
The vendor
shakes his head, "No."
A COMMOTION BREAKS OUT ONE BLOCK DOWN... Kris spins in that
direction... sees a crowd forming at the corner of the
sidewalk... Starts toward them... Kris sees something through
the thinner parts of the crowd... something laying on the
sidewalk... A man!
Kris' walk turns into a sprint.
Kris works his way through the growing crowd, puncturing the
center of the circle... Kris gazes down at the man writhing
on the concrete... A black man, shaking uncontrollably.
A
women standing over the fallen man waves the crowd back.
WOMAN
He has Epilepsy, just give him
room... An ambulance is on the way.
The crowd spreads out.
Kris looks down at the unconscious
man on the sidewalk sadly -- Kris' thoughts race.
He moves
on with newfound concern.
CUT TO:
POLICE STATION - MORNING
SUNRISE ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
CUT TO:
JUNIPERO SERRA FREEWAY - DAY
The freeway is packed -- bumper to bumper.
Cars standing
still in the hot sun.
A hispanic man in his late forties, JUAN is seated in his
Dodge Caravan when he sees someone in his rearview mirror.
A
man is using a stick as a cane.
The struggling man makes his
way along the shoulder very slowly.
Juan reaches over to his passenger seat and turns over the
L.A. Times.
Under the heading, "He's Back!" is Maurice's
picture.
Juan quickly rolls down his window as Maurice
passes by on the shoulder.
JUAN
(yelling)
Hey, Maurice man -- keep going
buddy!
Maurice is startled at the man's yell, but then smiles when
the words register.
Maurice struggles forward.
Juan keeps yelling encouragements... This grabs the attention
of other drivers who realize who is walking past them.
One
by one, car doors open and people call to Maurice.
OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
Don't stop Maurice!
YOUNG MAN
Go Mr. Parker!
Cars start to HONK... More and more people turn to see the
commotion... The YELLING AND HONKING IS JOINED BY WHISTLES
AND CHEERS --
Maurice can't believe it -- he tries to smile but can't hold
it.
His face tightens with every step.
His shirt is soiled
with blood.
He raises his hand and gives a weak wave to a
woman who holds up her little boy through the sunroof of the
car.
CUT TO:
A WCAU NEWS VAN
parked in the traffic.
A NEWSREPORTER stares through
binoculars.
REPORTER
Thank you God!
The crew quickly prepares their cameras and equipment.
They
move like lightning.
In seconds they are shooting the crowd
and their hero.
The air is CHARGED... THE NOISE GROWING, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
JOIN IN... LOUDER... People stand on top of their cars to get
a better view...
CUT TO:
A POLICE CAR
stuck in traffic.
OFFICER DAWSON looks around as the PARADE
OF NOISE SURGES TOWARDS HIM.
He looks out his window and
catches a GLIMPSE OF MAURICE LIMPING UP THE FREEWAY.
DAWSON
Sweet Jesus!
CUT TO:
STREET - DAY
Newspapers spiral through the air.
Maurice stretches his
neck up, squinting at the sun.
The SILHOUETTE OF A
HELICOPTER hovers above him.
The NOISE is overpowering.
Maurice's fatigue grows, every muscle, every ounce of energy
goes into each step.
Maurice clutches the side of his
head... the steps halted... hands trembling, teeth clenched,
eyes squeezed shut.
A surge of intense pain tries to buckle
him... Maurice fights it off as he moves his feet again.
The helicopter SWOOPS above as he makes his turn onto a FINAL
STRETCH OF ROAD adjacent to the BEACH.
Maurice stops dead in his tracks as he turns the corner to
find a SEA OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR HIM.
A momentous sight...
people lined along the street for as far as the eye can see.
AN EXPLOSION OF YELLING, CHEERING CALIFORNIAN'S ENGULFS THE
AIR as they spot Maurice standing at the end of the street.
The CROWD SURGES TOWARDS HIM.
Maurice is dazed... the noise, the pain, the faces swirl in
his head as thousands of people surround him.
Maurice is
overwhelmed.
He is about to collapse when someone takes hold
of his arm.
Maurice turns to see KRIS REDDY STANDING NEXT TO
HIM.
In the midst of this chaos and growing madness.
Maurice and Kris have an entire conversation with one
emotional look.
The SOUNDS of SIRENS BREAK the moment.
Kris turns to see two
police cars turn on the street behind them.
Kris turns to Maurice.
KRIS
Don't stop walking.
Kris lets go of his arm and moves like lightning.
He jumps
atop a fire-hydrant and yells to the crowd.
KRIS
The police are here.
They're
coming to take Mr. Parker away.
He
needs our help.
Kris points to the squad cars inching their way up the
street.
KRIS
Help Mr. Parker!
Don't let them
end the walk.
CUT TO:
THE SQUAD CARS
AS THEY COME TO A HALT as a wall of people stand in their
way.
The SPEAKER ON THE POLICE CAR BLARES THROUGH THE AIR.
SPEAKER
Step aside now!
You are ordered to
step aside now!
The people don't move.
A WOMAN carrying a BABY makes the
baby move her little hand in a waving gesture to the officers
behind the wheel of the police cars.
The officers look at
each other in disbelief.
CUT TO:
STREET - DAY
The far end of the beach road.
A POLICE CAR SCREECHES TO A
STOP.
Sergeant Emory and Adelle get out.
Adelle is completely blown away.
She looks around at the
PANDEMONIUM.
Thousands of men, women and children
celebrating with APPLAUSE AND CHEERS, HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR,
camera crews standing on raised platforms.
Adelle drinks in
the ELECTRIC ATMOSPHERE with awe.
Emory yells orders into his WALKIE-TALKIE as Adelle breaks
the outer edge of the crowd and disappears into the field of
spectators.
EMORY
(yelling)
What the hell is going on?
It's
frickin wall to wall people and
they're way too emotional.
We need
mucho backup -- now!... Officers
are to bring in Mr. Parker on
sight, don't ask questions, don't
hesitate, bring him in... I want a
barricade placed along the entire
beach area... Now God damn it, now!
Emory CLICKS OFF and looks around at the growing crowd -- he
turns to see a PUBLIC BUS UNLOADING PASSENGERS -- fifty more
spectators rush off the bus and rush toward the crowded
street.
EMORY
Holy shit.
CUT TO:
STREET - DAY
Maurice stares down at the ground... willing each new step.
THE CHEERS AND WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT BLURRING INTO A
UNDISTINGUISHABLE SOUND.
Maurice looks up for a moment as something grabs his
attention -- Maurice gasps for air as his eyes focus... The
small faces become clearer... Maurice stands twenty feet from
the entire population of PACIFICA HIGH SCHOOL.
They cover
one side of the street for an entire block.
Stretched over
their heads, held up by twenty students is a HUGE HAND
PAINTED BANNER.
Maurice reads the words:
"ELLEN IS WATCHING!"
CUT TO:
BEACH - DAY
Trucks unload dozens upon dozens of blue-wooden barricades.
An assembly line of officers place the barricades end to end
at the place where the sand meets the pavement.
Emory yells orders as a new truck arrives.
CUT TO:
STREET - DAY
The BOISTEROUS crowd parts like a ripple effect as Maurice
walks through.
The eyes fall emotionally on him as he stares
down at the ground trying to keep moving.
Maurice gasps harder now, his eyes stinging with drops of
sweat falling from his brow.
People in the crowd cover their
mouths in shock as they get a clear view of him... His shirt
soaked on one side with blood, his entire body shaking with
pain, and exhaustion, his face hollow and pale -- ghostly.
Maurice stops in his tracks.
He looks up at a wooden sign,
worn from the years of salt water air.
The sign reads:
"PACIFICA BEACH - 1/2 MILE"
Maurice's thoughts fade away from this place, this time...
CUT TO:
PHILADELPHIA - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
WE ARE IN THE PARKER BEDROOM.
The lights are off.
The
MOONLIGHT FROM THE WINDOWS BLANKETS Young Maurice and Young
Ellen as they lay in bed.
Ellen is cradled in Maurice's
arms.
She is awake and watching the shadows dance on the
ceiling.
She speaks in whispers.
ELLEN
What do you think heaven is like?
Maurice opens his eyes and stares at his beautiful wife.
MAURICE
I don't know.
ELLEN
I think it's a different place for
each person.
MAURICE
Did you have a dream?
Beat.
ELLEN
I know where my heaven is.
MAURICE
Where?
ELLEN
Pacifica, California.
Maurice chuckles.
MAURICE
Why there?
ELLEN
When I was ten, my family lived in
Pacifica for a year.
I used to go
to the beach everyday that summer.
I never felt so happy, carefree.
It was a magic place for me...
That's where my heaven will be.
Beat.
ELLEN
Maurice?
MAURICE
Yes.
ELLEN
If I die, you'll know where to look
for me?
MAURICE
Go to sleep Ellen.
ELLEN
No really, if God takes us away
from each other, you know where to
look now?
Beat.
MAURICE
(pacifying her)
The beach of Pacifica, California.
ELLEN
Good.
Beat.
MAURICE
Go to sleep Ellen.
Ellen smiles as she cradles deeper into Maurice's arms.
Husband and wife fall asleep together.
CUT TO:
PACIFICA BEACH SIGN - DAY (PRESENT)
Maurice snaps back to the present, the PAIN AND COMMOTION
come back in a tidal wave of reality.
Maurice wipes the tears in his eyes and tries to take a step.
Someone blocks his way.
ADELLE
Uncle Maurice, please, we have to
get you to a hospital.
Adelle looks at her wounded Uncle sadly.
She touches his
shirt and her hand comes away with blood.
MAURICE
I have to finish first.
ADELLE
I won't let you die.
The inner circle of people bursts open, as KRIS BREAKS
THROUGH.
KRIS
Let him finish Adelle.
He's almost
there.
ADELLE
(yelling)
He's almost dead.
Can't you see
that!
This has nothing to do with
you.
Maurice touches Adelle's cheek turning her attention back to
him.
He barely manages to get the words out.
MAURICE
It has nothing to do with you
either... This is between Ellen and
me.
Beat.
Maurice begins crying uncontrollably.
MAURICE
I'm begging you...
Maurice takes her hand and bends down putting his forehead to
her hand as if getting blessings from her.
MAURICE
Let me do this for Ellen, let me do
this for my wife.
Adelle's heart is breaking.
She weeps openly as she
straightens her Uncle to an upright position.
She wipes the
tears from his eyes with her hand gently.
AT THAT MOMENT THE INNER CIRCLE BREAKS OPEN AS TWO OFFICERS
RUSH IN.
They reach for Maurice.
ADELLE
Touch him, and they'll be a riot...
Adelle stands firm, the strength in her growing with each
second.
ADELLE
... and I'll start it.
The officers are taken off guard.
They look around at the
countless sea of eyes on them.
Adelle sees they won't do
anything and moves to Maurice's side.
Maurice begins to walk again.
Adelle to one side, Kris to
the other and thousands of people following in step.
CUT TO:
BEACH FRONT - DAY
The wave of people led by Maurice walk toward the beach.
The
beach is blocked off by barricades all along it's perimeter.
Police officers stand every ten feet along it's edge.
A young officer watches fearfully as the ocean of people move
towards him.
OFFICER GANTZ TALKS INTO HIS WALKIE-TALKIE.
GANTZ
He's coming.
What should I do?
CUT TO:
SERGEANT EMORY
at the other end of the beach barricade, holding back
hundreds of people trying to get to the beach.
Emory holds
his walkie-talkie and looks around at the sea of anxious
faces.
He makes eye contact with a woman in tears.
CUT TO:
OFFICER GANTZ
clicking off his walkie-talkie as the crowd presses up to the
barricade.
Officer Gantz is in awe as Maurice appears from
the crowd -- looking like a ghost of war... a holy
apparition.
Maurice works his way painfully to Gantz.
Gantz looks into Maurice's pleading eyes.
Maurice tries to
say something, but nothing can come out...
Gantz turns away from Maurice and picks up one of the
barricades.
He makes an opening about three feet wide.
Gantz turns back to Maurice, stands at attention, and steps
aside.
GANTZ
(with unspeakable
admiration)
Watch your step Mr. Parker.
Adelle and Kris watch in amazement as Maurice TAKES HIS FIRST
STEP ONTO THE SAND.
CUT TO:
BEACH - DAY
An empty beach.
ALL SOUND AND CHAOS DISAPPEARS.
THE GENTLE
HISS OF THE OCEAN FILLS THE AIR.
The last fifty yards...
The steps in the sand, heavy, torturous.
Each step, a step
closer to her...
Maurice picks up the pace.
His numb feet making prints in
the sand.
His lungs on fire...
Twenty feet left... Ten... Five...
The COOL WATER engulfs his feet and ankles.
Maurice falls to
his knees like a man falling before God.
Kneeling in the water, Maurice raises his hands to his eyes.
The water spills between his fingers... clear, pure, magical.
Maurice GASPS hard as he falls onto his back.
The water
comes in and washes over him... Gasping harder... He's
staring into the sky... Another wave of ocean gently blankets
him... Gasp... He spots something above him, fluttering...
his vision BLURS... WHITE FLUTTERING... SLOW-MOTION.
THE
IMAGE CLEARS... Maurice smiles as he makes out the image of a
WHITE DOVE FLYING ABOVE HIM...
Maurice takes a short breath, very short.
His body goes
still -- his eyes stay fixes at one point... No more pain, no
more loss, no more words...
The water washes over Maurice A. Parker...
Over his lifeless body...
And over his smile...
FADE TO BLACK.
