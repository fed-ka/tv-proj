          A dark hallway.  We PUSH IN on a closed door.

          We hear giggling from the other side.  The door POPS open. 
          It's Sarah, laughing.  Walt's covering her eyes, Johnny's
          leading them.

                                        SARAH
                        Where are we?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The whole point of a surprise is
                        for me not to have to answer
                        questions.

          The sound of MUFFLED CONVERSATION gets closer.

                                        SARAH
                        Walt, a little help here?

                                        WALT
                        I'm just along for the ride...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Trust me.  This'll be worth it.

          Johnny leads us towards another door.  Opens it --



          A cacophony of voices in small venue STUFFED with people. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, you can look now. 

          Walt removes his hands.  Sarah looks around.

                                        SARAH
                        You brought me to 'open mike'
                        night?

          The LIGHTS dim.  The audience STIRS.  Johnny points to a
          lit playbill that reads:

          "LIVE: DARREN FOLDES"

                        Oh my God.  OH MY GOD.

                        Who the heck is Derek Foldes?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darren Foldes.  Son of the greatest
                          singer-songwriter of our
                          generation.
                                (off Walt's look)
                        Roy Foldes?

                                        SARAH
                        I told you about him, the tour I
                          followed when I was 17.

          Spotlights PIERCE the darkness and light up the stage. 
          People CLAP and CHEER.  They yell over the noise.

                                        WALT
                                (remembering)
                        Roy Foldes!  Didn't that guy drive
                        his car off a cliff?

          Lights WHIRL as DARREN FOLDES (27) takes the stage.  He's
          young, good-looking, intense.

                                        DARREN
                        This is a song you might know...
                        it was written by my father and
                        it's called, "I'll Remember."

          He cracks a powerful CHORD on his guitar and starts into
          what will be his (and Roy's) SIGNATURE SONG.  Sarah is
          all smiles as the crowd ERUPTS as the music continues...



          Sarah, Johnny and Walt hanging out after the show.  Walt
          bangs on the side of his head.

                                        WALT
                        DO YOU GUYS HEAR A SIREN?  I HEAR
                          A SIREN?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have fun?

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah, it was cool.  There was
                          something a little sad about it,
                        though.

          Darren walks towards them, carrying his guitar (no case). 
          He seems a little unsteady.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, we really enjoyed the show.

                                        SARAH
                        You were great.  Really.

                                        WALT
                        Loud!

                                        DARREN
                        Thanks for comin' out.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        You got another gig in the area?

                                        DARREN
                        I'm in Philly day after tomorrow. 
                        If they've sold any tickets. 

          Darren takes a long swig from a silver flask.  Johnny and
          Sarah share a concerned look.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, is that your dad's Fender?

                                        DARREN
                        One and only.  Bought it off some
                        guy on eBay. 

                                        SARAH
                        You weren't close?

                                        DARREN
                                (amused and drunk)
                        I never met the guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Would you mind if I...?

                                        DARREN
                        Knock yourself out.

          Darren offers the guitar to Johnny, who handles it
          carefully:

                                        JOHNNY
                        All the songs written on this
                        guitar.

          WHOOSH!            DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - TEASER - 2/10/05 - YELLOW  4.


          VISION

          FLASH TO WHITE! 

          Johnny's eyes re-adjust to the SPOTLIGHT.  He stands on a
          stage.  Next to him is (YOUNGER) ROY FOLDES, 27, in the
          middle of an intense GUITAR SOLO.  In a grand finish, Roy
          raises his guitar over his head and we - FLASH!  



          The SAME GUITAR is placed on a glass countertop.  A MAN
          we cannot see.  Johnny stands behind him.  A scraggly, 20-
            something CLERK.  He snaps the case open as we see the
          pristine Fender guitar.

                                        CLERK
                        I'll give ya a hundred bucks. 

                                        MAN (O.S.)
                        This thing used to belong to that
                        dead rock star, Roy Foldes.

                                        CLERK
                        How old d'you think I am?  One
                        fifty, plus the case.

                                        MAN (O.S.)
                        What the hell, I don't need it
                          anymore. 

          Johnny looks up in the mirror, and sees Roy Foldes.  Older,
          45ish, thick beard, but it's definitely him.



          Johnny whirls out of the vision.

                                        DARREN
                        Hey, man, you okay?

          Off Johnny, as he looks into Darren's eyes...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                        Made me think about things, old
                          feelings.

                        No.  Well, yeah, Johnny was part
                        of it, but it's not what you think. 
                        The music inspired me... gave me
                        the strength I needed at a
                          difficult time in my life.

          Walt can see how much this all means to her.

                        Then you should go with him.

          Sarah is caught off guard...

                        And you don't have a problem with
                        me taking off with Johnny?

                                        WALT
                        When you put it that way.

          She shoves him playfully.

                                        SARAH
                        You know what I mean.

          Walt puts his arm around her and draws her close.

                        I never thought I'd ever get
                          married.  It just wasn't on the
                        radar.  I'd seen too many broken
                          relationships, people tearing
                        each other to pieces in the name
                        of love.  Then I met you and
                        everything changed.  I'd finally
                        met someone I could trust and who
                        could trust me.  No matter what. 
                        So, if you want to go look for
                        this guy, I'm all for it.

                        I'll be here when you get back.

          Sarah is nearly in tears.

                                        SARAH
                        You're the most amazing man I've

          She realizes he's messing with her and jumps on top of
          him.



          Sarah has her high top tennis shoes propped up on the
          dash.  There's an energy about them, as if they were
          reaching back into their own lives.  Johnny sips from a
          take-out cup.

                        right now.  He put his hand on my
                          shoulder...

          She touches him and...

          WHOOSH. 



          Johnny glances over at Sarah, but a doe-eyed, teenage
          Sarah stares back at him.

                                        TEENAGE SARAH
                          Meeting him changed my life...

          A lucid vision.  Half of Johnny's SUV is normal, the other
          half is TEENAGE SARAH sitting in the front seat (NYC
            outside).  Feet sticking out the window.  An acoustic
          guitar by her side...

                                        TEENAGE SARAH
                        It was before one of his concerts. 
                        Lacey Rolfey and I snuck around
                        behind the theater to see if we
                        could talk our way in.  I turned
                        around and Roy was standing right
                        behind me.  He took one look at
                        me and said "Little girl, you got
                        the music in you."  It was --
                          magical.  Like he could see a
                        part of me that nobody else could
                        see.



          WHOOSH.   Sarah stares back at him.

                        I must sound like some crazed
                        fan.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You sound like somebody that loved
                        the music.

          Sarah shifts subjects...

                                        SARAH
                        So, you think his old tour manager
                        will know anything? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe.  He's the CEO of a major
                        label now.  I've been trying to
                        get him on the phone since
                        yesterday, but his secretary keeps
                        blowing me off.

                                        SARAH
                        How are we gonna get in to see
                        him?

                        Haven't figured that out, yet.

          The SUV glides into New York City...

            A massive office overlooks Manhattan.  NATHAN BERK (50s)
          leans on his desk, his arms crossed.

                                        NATHAN
                        Y'know, there's only a handful'a
                        guys in the music business that
                        can make or break a career with
                        one phone call -- I'm one of them. 
                        But when I hear there's a psychic
                        sitting in the lobby with
                          information about a rock star
                        that's been dead for twenty years,
                        well, I've gotta take a minute. 
                                (checks his watch)
                          Alright, Mister Smith, you're now
                        on the clock.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I realize this sounds... crazy,
                        but I have reason to believe that
                        Roy Foldes is still alive.

                                        NATHAN
                        Alive?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's right.

                                        NATHAN
                        You saw him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes.

                                        NATHAN
                        In the flesh?

                                        JOHNNY
                        In my mind.

          He checks his watch.

                                        NATHAN
                        35 seconds.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I have no reason to lie
                        about this.  I figured since you
                        and Roy were friends, that maybe
                        you'd be interested to know he
                        might still be out there somewhere.

          Nathan's calm demeanor suddenly shifts...

                                        NATHAN
                        Roy was like every other rock
                        star... a self-centered pain in
                        the ass.  He was also gifted. 
                        I'd put him right up there with
                        Dylan and Morrison on raw talent. 
                        But he wasn't immortal.  He drove
                        his car into the ocean.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They never found his body.

                                        NATHAN
                        Let me explain something to you. 
                        People fall in love with musicians
                        because they represent the best
                        part of us.

                        They mark a time and place in our
                        lives that we don't want to let
                        go of.  I can assure you, Roy's
                        time has come and gone.  And so
                        has ours.  It was nice meeting
                        you.

          Johnny turns to walk out, then he stops and steps back to
          where Nathan is standing --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you for your time.

          Johnny extends his hand, as Nathan takes it --


          VISION - (REFER TO SCENE 53)

          SMACK.  Nathan slaps Roy in the face.  He's livid.

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        Do you know how much money I have
                        riding on this?!  Now you're gonna
                        throw it all away?  For what?!  A
                          groupie?!

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                          Crystal's not a groupie.  I love
                        her.



          Whoosh.  Johnny lets his hand go...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who is "Crystal?"

          Nathan stiffens, then...

                          Goodbye, Mister Smith.

          Johnny EXITS as the CAMERA lingers on Nathan's face...

                        You sell stuff that used to belong
                        to dead musicians.

                        I don't specifically specialize
                        in deceased rock star memorabilia,
                          although I do consider it a growth

                        Does this count?

          Matthew pulls a car cover off - a shiny, black fully
          restored 1981 Corvette.  It's amazing.

          FADE IN:


          A small crowd.  Johnny and Sarah are here.  Darren is on
          stage.  He adjusts the strings on his Fender Strat.  He's
          slightly drunk and unsteady.

                                        DARREN
                        This last song is an original
                        tune.

          Darren breaks into the song, which is surprisingly soft*
          and beautiful.  A DRUNK GUY yells:

                                        DRUNK
                        Play "I'll Remember"!

          Darren continues to play, trying to ignore this
            loudmouth...

                                        DRUNK
                        This is a bunch'a crap!

          The disappointment in Darren's face is not lost on Johnny
          and Sara, as he stops playing.

                                        DARREN
                        Look, I already played that song. 
                        So why don't you shut up and let
                        me finish?

                                        DRUNK
                        Why don't you jump off a cliff
                        like your dead old man!

                                        DARREN
                        Gee, that's original.

          Darren hesitates, then drops his guitar and leaps into
          the crowd as a huge fight begins...



          Johnny and Sarah approach the crowded bar.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Grab a table.  I'm gonna find a
                          bathroom.

          Johnny walks away, as Sarah looks around and suddenly
          notices Darren at the end of the bar.  He's by himself
          drinking a beer.  Sarah decides to approach him.

          He looks around...

                                        SARAH
                        We met after your show the other
                        night in Portland.

          Darren tries to place her, then...

                        Oh yeah.

                                        SARAH
                        I saw the show tonight.

                                        DARREN
                        Crazy, huh?

                                        SARAH
                        I can't believe how some people
                        act.  Are you okay?

          Darren swigs from a bottle of beer.

                                        DARREN
                        Right as rain.  How 'bout that
                        guy in the front?  Big dude.  He
                        didn't look quite so large from
                        the stage.

                                        SARAH
                        I would've liked to have heard
                        that original song.

                                        DARREN
                        That makes you a majority of one.

          Darren takes another look at Sarah, she's cute.  He
            scribbles something on a cocktail napkin and hands it to
          her.

                                        SARAH
                        What's this?

                                        DARREN
                        My cell number.  I'm in town 'til
                          tomorrow.

                        Oh, no... I'm married.

          She shows him her wedding ring.

                                        DARREN
                        Can't blame a guy for tryin'.  My
                        dad was a real ladies man.  So I
                        hear. 

                                        SARAH
                        You never met him? 

                                        DARREN
                          I didn't even know he was my father
                        'til a few years ago.  My mom got
                        sick.  Guess she thought I should
                        know where I came from.  That was
                        nice of her, don't you think?

          Sarah can see his pain.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sure he's proud of you --
                          wherever he is.

          Darren's demeanor suddenly shifts, like he's been kicked
          in the stomach.  He looks at her hard...

                                        DARREN
                        What's that suppose t'mean?

                                        SARAH
                        I just meant...

                                        DARREN
                        What is it you people?  I mean, I
                        understand not being able to let
                        go of the music, but can't you
                        let the poor sucker rest in peace?

          Darren grabs his jacket and guitar case.

                                        DARREN
                        Oh, but if you do see my old man,
                        tell him I said thanks for nothin'. 

          Darren walks off passing Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What was that all about?

          Off Sarah's bothered look...


          CONTINUOUS

          Johnny glances at him in the rear view.  Sarah holds the
          cocktail napkin with Darren's phone number.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You really gave it to that guy
                        back there.

                                        SARAH
                          Somebody has to stand up for the
                        kid.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's that?

                                        SARAH
                          Darren's cellphone number.

                        He hit on you?

                                        SARAH
                        Surprised?

                        Impressed.

          She sticks the napkin in the glove box and closes it.

                                        SARAH
                        I been thinking... If Roy's really
                        out there then maybe he's in touch
                        with somebody from his past.

                        The question is 'who'?

          Sarah thinks and then picks up a CD case and studies it.

                                        SARAH
                        How far is it to Rockland County?



          An indie record store FILLED with vinyl albums and vintage
          rock posters.  Johnny and Sarah ENTER.

                        How did you know about this place?

                        It was mentioned on a Roy Foldes
                        tribute CD.  It said that Roy's
                        writing partner, Stephen Vickings,
                        retired and opened a vintage record
                        shop.

                                        VICKINGS (O.S.)
                        We don't have any gangsta rap
                          records, if that's what you're
                        lookin' for?

          STEPHEN VICKINGS, 40s, spins towards them - smiling at
          his own joke.  He manuvers a racing style wheelchair.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We were wondering if you have any
                        Roy Foldes albums?

                        At least I cut my mullet.

                                        SARAH
                        We're big fans of yours, Mr.
                          Vickings.

                                        VICKINGS
                        Mr. Vickings is married to my
                        mother.  Stephen'll do fine. 

          Stephen wheels down the aisle.  Johnny and Sarah follow.

                        people listen.

                        We still need to find something
                        that Roy and Aubrey shared.  Maybe
                        I can get a hit and find out what
                          happened to her.

          Sarah is still studying the CD case.

                        How about a motel room?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                        The liner notes..."Roy would like
                        to thank Sid and Bonnie at the

                        place to lay his head while he
                        made this record."


          MINUTES LATER

          Johnny eases up next to the first door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I feel like a peeping tom.

          He gently sets his finger tips on the door... WHOOSH!...
          Johnny steps away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nothing but some puking prom dates
                        and a traveling bus tour of 'CATS.'

          He MOVES to the next door, but shakes his head.

          Then, Johnny MOVES to the third door (Room 3).  This time --
          WHOOSH!

          Johnny snaps out of the vision.

                        and Aubrey stayed.


          TIME LATER

          Johnny and Sarah ENTER the dark room.  Johnny carries two
          suitcases.

                                        JOHNNY
                        After we check it out, I'll move
                        your suitcase next door to your
                        room.

          Sarah flips on the light.  It's a crummy little room.

                                        SARAH
                        At least business is off and we
                        could get this room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not exactly the penthouse suite.

                                        SARAH
                        I guess when you're in love, the
                          furniture isn't that important.

          Johnny flicks on the bathroom lights and - WHOOSH!


          VISION

          Aubrey is in the shower.  We can just make out her naked
          body behind the fogged glass.  An UNSEEN FIGURE steps
          into the bathroom.  The HAND turns on the sink faucet.

                                        AUBREY (O.S.)
                        Roy?  Whatchu doing back so soon?

          She OPENS the shower door and reaches for a towel.

                                        AUBREY (O.S.)
                          I thought you were going to the
                          studio... 

          When she grabs the towel she's jabbed with a SYRINGE. 
          Aubrey slides OPEN the shower door and stares bewildered
          at her UNSEEN ASSAILANT.

                                        AUBREY
                        Why?

          She collapses into the bathtub.  The used syringe is tossed
          into the tub next to her lifeless body. 



          Johnny stares at the tub.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Aubrey was murdered.  Right here
                        in this room.

          Johnny stands looking into the bathroom, as Sarah sits on
          the edge of the bed.

                                        SARAH
                        Why would anybody want to kill
                        her?

                        I don't know, but I think she
                        knew the person who did it.

          Sarah's cell-phone RINGS.

                                        SARAH
                        Walt?

          Walt's on the phone in front of a computer screen.

                                        WALT
                        I found her.  Nassau County, Long
                        Island, has a death certificate
                        for an Aubrey Henderson.  She
                        OD'ed the same year Roy died. 
                        But it says here the body was
                        found in her apartment.

                                        SARAH
                        That can't be right.  Johnny saw
                        her die in the bathroom of the
                        motel.  Unless somebody moved the
                        body.

                        case has suddenly evolved into
                        cold blooded murder.  Maybe you
                        should back off and let the police
                        take over?

                        we'll call the police.

                        In the vision, Roy brought up the
                        idea of them getting married.  He
                        laughed about how it might ruin
                        his rock star image.

          Before they can finish the thought, there's a KNOCK at
          the door.  Johnny OPENS it to find Doug Driscoll -- he's*
          been beaten up pretty good.

          Johnny scans the new environment.  (Although Johnny and

                        through the music.  Then Roy died,
                        and so did a little part of us. 
                          I didn't think I could live without
                        you.  But JJ needed a mother, and
                          I needed to move on with my life. 
                                (beat)
                        When I realized Roy might still
                        be out there somewhere, I knew I
                        had to find him.  To tell him how
                        much his music meant to me, how
                        he helped me choose the light
                        over the darkness.  And maybe, I
                        might be able to return the favor.

          Whoosh!  The vision ends. 


          NY) - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          The motel room.  Sarah releases his hand.

                                        SARAH
                        If Roy's death was a lie, I need
                        to know.  I need to see it for
                        myself.

          Johnny, maybe for the first time, sees the depth of her
          conviction.



          Johnny BARGES into Nathan Berk's office, quickly followed
          by the Receptionist.

                                        RECEPTIONIST
                        I'm sorry, Mr. Berk.  I tried to
                        stop him.

                                        NATHAN
                        It's alright, Janice.  Call
                          security.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good idea, Janice.  Why don't you
                        make a real party and call the
                        police while you're at it.

          Berk starts past Johnny, who grabs him by the arm.  Then,
            WHOOSH...


          NIGHT - VISION

          Roy kneels over Aubrey's dead body, crying.  Upset. 
          Touching her TURQUOISE bracelet.  Johnny watches as Nathan
          comes into the bathroom.  He's all business, cold and
          calculated. 

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        I don't know what happened.  She
                        wanted to get some sleep while I
                        was up at the studio.

          Nathan checks her pulse. The syringe next to her arm...

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        We have to get you out of here...

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        I'm not leaving her.  Not like
                        this... 

          Nathan pulls Roy up and SMACKS him.  (The same vision
          Johnny had of Nathan in Scene 15.)

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        You gonna throw your life away? 
                        Your career?  For what?  A
                          groupie?!

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                          Crystal's not a groupie.  I love
                        her.

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        We're in the middle of a North
                          American tour.  The press finds
                        this chick overdosed in your hotel
                        room, it's over.  Look, she's
                        already dead, but you have the
                        next minute to decide if your
                        career dies with her.          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT THREE - 2/11/05 - GREEN  38.



          Nathan pulls away from Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were there.  You covered up
                          Aubrey's death.  Did you kill
                        her, too?

                                        NATHAN
                        You have no idea what you're
                        talking about.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Money.  Lot's of money.  If Roy
                        takes off with Aubrey, you're
                        back booking one hit wonders. 
                        Imagine how much cash could have
                        been made if John Lennon hadn't
                        married Yoko Ono.  Five, maybe
                        six more Beatles records.  Big
                          business.

                          I didn't kill anybody.  Besides, 
                        Roy Foldes is dead.

                        What about his son?

                        What about him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't he deserve a chance to
                        know what really happened to his
                        father?

                                        NATHAN
                        I'm not getting through to you am
                        I?  Darren Foldes is a disaster
                        waiting to happen.  I've tried to
                        help him, but the truth is he'll
                        never be his father.

          Angry, Nathan grabs a DEMO TAPE off his desk.

                                        NATHAN
                        I sent a guy down to tape his
                        show the other night.

          He throws the demo tape at Johnny.  As Johnny catches it:          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT THREE - 2/10/05 - YELLOW  39.


          DAY - VISION

          WHOOSH!  NDS OUT OF THE MIC.  DARREN IS ON THE STAGE.

          This is the SAME PERFORMANCE that Johnny and Sarah were
          at in Philadelphia.  (SCENE 24 REPEATED)

                                        DARREN
                        This last song is an original
                        tune.

          A DRUNK yells out...

                                        DRUNK
                        Play "I'll Remember"!

          THE SCENE CONTINUES PLAYING OUT JUST AS BEFORE, AS DARREN
          JUMPS INTO THE CROWD TO FIGHT, JOHNNY NOTICES SARAH AND
          HIMSELF IN THE AUDIENCE.

          Johnny notices a bearded man, 45ish, innocuously standing
          in the back.  It's Roy Foldes. 



          Johnny reels from the vision.  Two SECURITY GUARDS enter.

                                        NATHAN
                        Escort Mister Smith down to the

                        I can find my way out.

          Johnny exits...


    56A56AHALLWAY OUTSIDE BERK'S OFFICE (NYC) - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny joins Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Darren's show, the one in Philly -
                        Roy was there.

                                        SARAH
                        You saw him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was in the back... in the dark.

                                        SARAH
                        He watches his son play.  That
                        means if we find Darren...

                                        JOHNNY
                        We might find Roy.          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT THREE - 2/10/05 - YELLOW  40.



            A nondescript diner.  Johnny sits in a booth across from
          Roy Foldes, 45ish.  Drinking coffee by himself.  Roy writes
          an anonymous letter to his son, Darren.  We SEE some KEY
          WORDS AND PHRASES...

          "I've seen you play..." "...like your father."  "...don't
          give up."  "A loyal fan." 

          He seals it and writes DARREN FOLDES across the front of
          the envelope.  Exactly like the envelope Johnny picked up
          off the ground.

          Johnny looks around and sees the NEON SIGN of the diner. 
          (It's outside facing forwards; from inside, the letters
          are backwards.)  From Johnny's POV, it reads:

          "S'AHTRAM"



          Johnny orders some coffee.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just coffee, black.

          He turns to look out the window.

          JOHNNY'S POV - SUV

          A tinted SUV pulls into the parking lot in the front of
          the diner.  Nathan Berk gets out.



          Johnny and Sarah walk into the records store.  Vickings
          is organizing some records.

                                        VICKINGS
                        You guys come back for some more
                        rock 'n' roll stories?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually, we came to tell you
                        one.

          Johnny picks out the album "From Within to Without."

                                        JOHNNY
                        Man, I loved this record.  This
                        carried me through high school.

                        of our teenage lives.

          Vickings has a bad vibe about where this might be going...

                          inspiration.

                        Maybe.  Or maybe you never wrote
                        them to begin with.

                        You and Roy were childhood friends. 
                        There were rumors that he let you
                        put your name down and collect
                        fifty percent of the royalties.

                        Everything was fine until Aubrey
                        came along.  Roy was tired of the
                        grind.  He wanted to get off the
                        road.  Get married and settle
                        down.  But that would have been a
                        problem for you.  You had to find
                        a way to change his mind.

                        So you killed the woman he loved
                        and made it look like an overdose.

          Stephen stares up at them, his eyes a tornado of emotion.
