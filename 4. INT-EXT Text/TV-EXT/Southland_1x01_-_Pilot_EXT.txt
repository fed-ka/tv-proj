      A police officer is down and bleeding, is being ministered
      to by paramedics, he is grievously hurt.  We can't see his
      face. 

      Another gun-shot victim, late teens, t-shirt, is pronounced
      dead by EMT technicians.

      In the BG, various uniform cops take statements from three
      Latino teenage girls, various neighbors, the hysterical mother
      of one of the girls, as FID (force investigation division)
      officers arrive.  

      The coroner's van pulls up.  A K-9 unit patrols the grounds,
      as flashlights cross-beam into dark corners around this small
      bungalow.

      In the FG, a young uniform cop, 22, BEN, stands stricken. 

      A crime scene PHOTOGRAPHER stops documenting this chaotic
      scene and calls out to him --

                                      PHOTOGRAPHER
                    You okay, son?

      Ben doesn't answer.

      A bright white flash as the camera freezes on his face, and
      it tranforms into a still photograph. The typed words

                   "BEN - GLASSELL PARK 1:45 AM"

      appear at the bottom of the image and we HEAR OVER the
      anonymous voice of a man.

                                      MAN'S VOICE.
                    Ben Sherman just finished phase one
                    of his probationary training.  He*
                    still needed to have his daily book
                    signed by his training officer if he
                    was going to move on to phase two. 
                    The night had not gone well.

      After credits, we abruptly  --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      As Lydia walks down the pathway to her car at the curb. 
      Suddenly, from the bushes...

                                      MAN'S VOICE.
                    Do you want some?

      Lydia stops, can barely make out a man, who is partially
      hidden by the bushes.

                                      LYDIA
                    Excuse me?

                                    MAN
                          (louder now)
                    Do you want some?

                                      LYDIA
                    Gee, do I want some?

      She approaches him, opens her duffel, reaches for something.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Hold on, let me get a closer look. 
                    That way I can make a better decision
                    for myself here.

      He steps out, and from her expression we can tell he is
      exposing himself. Before he knows what has happened, she has
      cuffed him and is marching him towards her car.  Puts him in
      the backseat, careful not to bump his head.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    What's your name and date of birth,

      Lydia picks up the radio in her car, calls it in as she starts
      the car and pulls out --

                                      LYDIA
                    Good morning.  One King 54.  Show me*
                    Code six at Burbank and Olive with*
                    one in custody --

      The dispatcher obviously recognizes her from her voice --

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hey, Della.  How's your son? 

      She laughs, listens as Della tells her something about her
      kid.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    That's cute. I've got a 311, Stanley

                          (as she holds)
                    Thanks, Della.

      Appraises him in the rear view mirror as she drives --

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Stanley, you the Valley Molester?

                                    STAN
                    Oh God, no.  Nothing like that.

                                      LYDIA
                    Stan, I gotta tell you, I've seen
                    one before.  You do this to a kid? 
                    That's very, very bad.

                                    STAN
                    I know.

                                      LYDIA
                    What can we do about this?  Have you
                    been in therapy?

                                    STAN
                    I've tried -- lots of different
                      modalities. 

      She turns to look at him.  He starts to cry. Lydia hands him
      a tissue from a box on the dash. *

                                                                                  CUT TO:      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                       4.


      As Lydia and Stanley pull in, we pass a group of young uniform
      Cops, watch as they try to find their designated cars and
      training officers in a sea of black and whites.  They carry
      their gear for the day.

      One of them is Ben, who we recognize from the first scene. 
      The other is a female boot, his own age.  She stops walking
      suddenly, just stands there, as the others continue on.

                                      BEATRIZ
                          (to herself)
                    I can't do this.

      Ben has overheard her, stops, looks at her.  We don't get
      the feeling that they are friends particularly.

                                      BEATRIZ (CONT'D)
                    I slept an hour last night, my
                    stomach's been upset for three weeks.  
                    I've got this crazy tic in one eye.

      Ben is torn, wants to go find his training officer, but a
      fellow boot is freaking out. 

                                    BEN
                    One day at a time.  You've heard
                    that, right?

                                      BEATRIZ
                    Yeah, my dad's an alcoholic.

                                    BEN
                    It's one day.  That's all you have
                    to do. 
                          (beat)
                    You can do this.

      She takes a deep breath.  He waits, clearly divided -- 

                                      BEATRIZ
                    Okay.  I can do this.

      As he turns to walk away -- 

                                    BEN
                    That tic is ridiculous.

      He turns back, gives her a killer grin to show he's teasing
      her.  She laughs.  A piercing whistle suddenly.  Ben looks
      over at a man who has his fingers in his mouth, in his early
      40's --

               "JOHN COOPER - NORTH HOLLYWOOD 7:45"

                                    JOHN
                    You done?

      When Ben nods yes, John appraises him, from top to bottom --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Look sharp, act sharp, be sharp. 
                    Guys coming out of prison are buff
                    and on drugs.  You do what they teach
                    you in the academy, you will die.

      As they walk towards their car --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                      Knucklehead wants to take your gun. 
                    So, if it's you or some 300 lb. naked
                    guy on PCP, you put him down any way
                    you can.  You have to be able to
                    back your badge.

      If this makes Ben nervous, he doesn't show it. They find
      their car.  John opens the door and recoils from the smell.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Great.  Just what I need, a nice
                    little staph infection.  A detective
                    over at Central's gonna lose her
                    foot.  It's going around.

      Ben has been trained to go through the car, make sure
      everything they need is in place.  As he goes through a
      checklist, shot-guns, radio, etc. Checks the trunk, then
      gets in next to John.

                    of the Academy, what, a month ago?

      Ben nods.

      They pull out of the lot, hit the streets.  They will chase
      the radio, listen to dispatch as calls come out.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)

                    Said they'd gotten him into trouble
                    his whole life.  I took a Polaroid,
                    put it in my pocket.  Captain shows
                    up, says-- "make sure you attach the

                    What are you, Canadian?

      They pass a run down apartment building in North Hollywood. 
      We stay behind, move into the courtyard of the building,
      where a ten year old girl, KAYLA DAVIS, plays ball by herself
      against the side of the building, repeatedly throwing the
      ball, and then catching it with her mit.  Adjacent, two other
      identical buildings, all three stories, all with burnt out
      grass, ill-kempt.  Neighbors are starting their day.  From
      the second floor of her building we see her Dad, BRAD, 36,
      pull the curtains aside to check on her.  Over, WE HEAR the
      repeated percussive THWONK of the ball hitting the wall.

      A cop neighbor.  He pulls up next to him.

                        "SAL"

      SAL is older than Russell, 45 to his 42, but looks even older. 
      Old acne scars, still handsome.  He is smoking, checking his
      garage sensor to make sure it works, closes tight behind
      him.  We can HEAR a Dog barking down the block.

                    No one calls the cops cause they're
                    happy.  We're the first line of

      Just then, a young, thin, very unkempt man flags down their
      cruiser.

                    Meth.  They get that real disheveled
                    look.

                    You are too stupid to live.

      He drives on.  Ben turns to look at him.

      They pull up at a light, next to another car, a red Camaro. 
      John seems to barely glance at the occupants, then---

      Ben turns the computer towards him, waits for the car to*
      pull ahead of him so he can read the license plate.

      A row of unmarked cop cars, all identical.  Except for one,

      wadded up as a pillow.

      His partner, NATE, also mid 30's, raps hard on the side

      The car does an abrupt U-turn and pulls up near him.  Three
      Latino kids lean out the window.

      They spill from the car.  The two others, DANNY and PANCHO,
      are the same age as Zig-ZAG, all under twenty.  They all
      raise guns and open fire on Henry.  Then, as quickly as they
      arrived, they are gone.  Henry lays still, bleeding out under
      the hot merciless sun.

                                                                                CUT TO:*

      have stopped.  John was right, wants and warrants have come
      back telling us the car was used in the commission of a
      robbery.  Their guns are on the ground in a little pile. 
      The last suspect, a rough looking woman in her thirties,  is

      arm bar choke-hold.  Ben jumps to his feet to help her, but
      she vehemently waves him off, struggles with Dewey.


      Nate and Sammy work the scene of the kid's shooting.  Henry
      has already been transported to the hospital.  Both have
      gloves on, are going through evidence, putting up numbered
      plastic flags where there are shell casings.  The Dash bus
      has been retained and the DRIVER and THREE BLACK GIRLS are
      being interviewed by ANDY.  The Girls are crying. KENNY NO-
      GUN approaches Nate and Sammy.

                                      KENNY NO-GUN
                          (points to girls)
                    They said they didn't see anything. 

                                      SAMMY
                    And they're crying because --?

                                    NATE
                          (agreeing with Sammy)
                    Bring 'em in. 

      As Kenny moves off --

                                      SAMMY
                    Stop and get 'em something to eat,
                    it might be a long wait.

      Kenny  nods.

      Other uniform officers are cordoning off the crime scene, as
      neighbors gather.  An ELDERLY MAN steps forward --

                                      ELDERLY MAN
                    You wanna know how y'll can stop all

                    Thank you, sir.  We'll bring that up
                    up at the next city council meeting.

      A Ferrari with illegally tinted windows does a U-turn on
      Sunset almost in front of John and Ben, in their car.  John
      hits the siren and chases him down Sunset for a beat.  The
      car finally pulls over.  John and Ben step from the car and
      move over to the Ferrari.  A young Beverly Hills type is
      fanning the air in the car.

                                    JOHN

                    Why do I have to get out of the car?

                                    JOHN
                    Get out of the car now, numbnuts.

      WARD, 23, gets out reluctantly, hands his driver's license
      to John, who studies it for a beat.

                                    WARD
                    Do you know who my father is?

                    Why?  Your mother didn't tell you?

      Ward is speechless.  Then he notices Ben, takes in his uniform --

                                    WARD
                    Dude, you became an actor?

      John looks at Ben, astounded he knows this asshole.

                                    BEN
                    I'm not an actor.

                                    WARD
                    I'm being punked, right?

      John picks up on Ben's mortification.

                                    JOHN
                    Search the car.

      Ben does.  Holds up a small bag of dope.

                                    WARD
                    You're making a big mistake.  You
                    can't search my car without "just
                    cause."

                                    JOHN
                    You watch too much T.V, "dude."  Put
                    your palms on the car and spread
                    your legs.

                                    WARD
                    You're arresting me?  What are the
                    charges?

                                    JOHN

                    are free for you.

      For a moment, we should think this is a dog that is trying
      to pick up the scent of Kayla Davis.  It is only when we
      pull back and the dog comes up fast on a SKATEBOARDER,
      knocking him off his skateboard and pinning him to the ground,
      and then menacing him when he tries to move --

      That we realize this is --

                  "RICHTER" - CASTAIC 3:07 PM"

      the retired drug dog that had a breakdown.

      Sammy's young wife, TAMMI, comes running up.  She is holding
      her cell phone, we can HEAR Sammy's recorded message on the
      other end.  She snaps it shut.

                                      TAMMI

      As Lydia and Russell continue to work the missing kid case. 
      A field command center has been set up there.  Maria Davis
      is sitting on a stoop.  She is shivering.  Brad comes out of
      his apartment upstairs with Russell. 

      Lydia has been doing field interviews with various neighbors. 
      She notices  Maria Davis, her arms clasped around herself,
      and goes to her car and opens the trunk.  Takes out a nylon
      windbreaker with LAPD written on it, comes and drapes it
      over Maria Davis's shoulders.  Maria manages a weak smile. 
      Her teeth are chattering.

                    with some honey.

      He nods yes and goes to do it.  Lydia turns to see a group
      of neighbors gathered together on the lawn of the apartment
      building next to them.  An Armenian woman in her 60's steps
      forward.

                    book bag on her shoulders, weighing
                    her down, so she was walking really
                    slow.  They're real heavy nowadays,
                    you ever notice that?

                    There's a race war going on, maybe
                    you haven't noticed.

      She smiles at him.

                    You're doing this cause I haven't

                    Look, you knew I was married.  What

                    I'm sorry.  I'm under a lot of
                    pressure here.  You have no idea.

      A long beat.

                    Don't put that on the air.  All Malik

      She turns and walks back to Malik, who waves at Sal.  Sal
      waves back and then turns and walks into the building.

      John and Ben are walking up to the front of a small duplex. 
      The grass is overgrown, the lights are out inside the house. 
      The LANDLORD of the property is with them, going through a
      large key ring.  Neighborhood kids have gathered around.

      He shakes his head no.

                    supposed to do?

      Two very excited dogs from inside the house start to bark.

                                      LANDLORD (CONT'D)
                    He's got dogs.  I forgot.

      John goes up to the door, knocks loudly.

                                    JOHN
                    Sir?  Hello?  Sir?

      Ben nods.  He has a radio with him, steps off the porch to*
      make the call.*

      John looks in the window of the house, can just make out a
      dark form sitting in a chair.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Russell has been talking to Maria Davis.  Brad Davis is
      talking to another bunch of cops upstairs near his apartment.

      Lydia gets out of her car, with a piece of paper.  Russell
      sees her, comes over to her.

                                      LYDIA
                    We just got the warrant, but I want
                    you to get her out of here, okay? 
                    Take her for coffee, I'll call you
                    when we're done.

      He nods.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Russ?

      He turns back.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    She has people she can call.  Get
                    her to do that, okay?  She has family,
                    she has friends.  Get her to call
                    someone, alright?

      He is quiet, finally nods, heads back to Maria.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Animal control has arrived.  Two officers with huge poles
      with a type of noose attached in a loop at the ends.  Ben
      tries to shoo away the neighborhood kids, but they keep
      breaking free.  When he has herded them up, John nods at the
      landlord, who opens the door with a key.  Then waits till
      animal control gives the go ahead.

                                      ANIMAL CONTROL WOMAN
                    We're ready.

      John opens the door and shines in a powerful flashlight. 
      Chaos as the animals begin to bark and go nuts. 

      The two Animal Control officers, wearing protective clothing,
      go in and capture the two dogs, come out with them attached
      to the sticks.      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                      35.


      Dewey and Chickie have arrived.  Animal control is having
      the landlord sign a piece of paper, and then John signs it. 
      Ben is taking deep gulps of air over by their car.

                                      DEWEY
                          (dogs)
                    Why do you gotta put 'em down?  I'll
                    take 'em.  That little pink nose is
                      a sweetie.

                                      ANIMAL CONTROL WOMAN
                    Cause they've tasted human flesh. 
                    Once they've tasted human flesh, you
                    just can't be sure.

                                      DEWEY
                    I went down on my wife about a year
                    ago, you gonna put me down?

      John laughs, he can't help it.  Dewey gestures at Ben over
      by the car.

                                      DEWEY (CONT'D)

                      mary-janes.  Be nice when you say
                    goodbye, this could be his last day
                    on the job.

      Ben has heard him, is about to finally lose it, Chickie grabs
      him, pulls him aside --

                                      CHICKIE
                    No, no, no, no, no.  Do not let him
                    get to you.  This isn't personal.

                    What is his problem?!

      John and Ben are driving, Ben lethally quiet, when John spots
      a YOUNG WOMAN, walking down the sidewalk by herself, without
      a purse, wearing a tight t-shirt and jeans.  He pulls up*
      just behind her, leans out the window --

                                    JOHN
                    Hey, baby, show me your tits.

      She turns around, angry, then sees it's him, laughs.

              "SHAWNA - SANTA MONICA BLVD. 6:45"

                                      SHAWNA
                    No freebies for you, asshole.

      She leans into the window.  John makes the introductions.

                    Shawna, Ben.  Ben, Shawna.

                    Hey.

                                      SHAWNA
                    Howdy.

                                    JOHN
                    I trained this crazy chick.
                          (to ben)
                    Shawna works Vice in case you didn't
                    guess.  Where's the guys?

      She points to a plain car across the street and down about
      1/2 a block.  John waves to them, then pulls her in close to
      him.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Never, ever lean into the John's
                    side of the car.

      She laughs, kisses him goodbye, starts doing a slow strut
      down the street. John does a u-turn and pulls up alongside
      the plain car.  Inside, two undercover Vice cops with long
      hair, "VID, and EDDIE".  VID has a really bad moustache. An
      embarrased looking ARRESTEE is in the backseat with hand-*
      cuffs on.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                          (referring to Vid's

                    it once?  I hear it's really big.

      They all crack up.

      The guy leaves tire tracks he pulls away so fast.  Ben looks
      shocked.

      the neighbor, DWAYNE, who lives in the adjacent apartment
      building across from Brad's.  Goofy photos of him are on the
      fridge.  They are frantically searching for Kayla Davis,
      calling her name, looking in every closet, under the beds,
      etc. The apartment is filthy, chicken bones on a plate, a
      stack of unwashed dishes.  One of the uniforms finds a huge
      stash of kiddie porn under one of the beds.  He brings it
      over to Lydia --

      Lydia looks at it, looks sick.  Dwayne is gone.

      They hurry off to set up in the common parking lot for the

      down, notices a trail of ANTS that are moving in a column. 
      She doesn't notice they are leaving the apartment, not
      entering.  She assumes they are coming in to eat the food
      left on the plates.

      John and Ben pull up outside the house.  The MUSIC IS BLASTING
      and they can hear loud SHOUTING and LAUGHTER coming from the
      back of the bungalow.  The sound of GLASS BREAKING.  There
      is a car in the driveway.  Ben goes to get out, John puts
      his arm out, stopping him.

      Maria and Russell pull up in his car.  Both remain quiet. 
      Maria watches as Ellis hugs Brad.

      Dewey and Chickie have arrived as back up.  They are all
      outside of their patrol cars, a few houses down from the
      ruckus.  John is on the radio.

                    We should call SWAT in.

                                    JOHN
                    This isn't a SWAT callout.  Bunch of*
                    drunk cholos.*

      The noise from the back of the house is even louder now --
      MUSIC, SHOUTING, GLASS BREAKING.  As they begin to move --

                          (to Ben)
                    Cuff first and then search.

      Ben nods, he remembers the drill.  Once they are close to
      the house, they pull out their guns.

      John comes around the house first, followed by Ben.  Three
      small chihuahuas begin to go nuts.

      The Three Gangbangers who shot Henry, ZIG-ZAG, PANCHO, and*
      DANNY, have been partying with THREE GIRLS. Pancho is very*
      drunk, he is making out with one of the girls, as her MOTHER,*
      a small woman, pulls at him.  Another girl is puking in the*
      bushes.  Danny and Zig-Zag are sitting with the third girl
      on Danny's lap, they are throwing empty bottles against a*
      wall, where they are breaking. 

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Stand up and put your hands in the
                    air, now!

      Danny doesn't move, his hand reaches for a gun.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    I will shoot you through your head. 
                    Put your hands in the air, now!!

      Danny does.  The girl on his lap is laughing.  John pulls
      her off of him and stands Danny up.  Takes his gun, turns
      him around and cuffs him.  Roughly knocks his legs out from
      under him and Danny goes down.  John prones him out, puts a
      foot up on his back to keep him there.  He turns to see that --

      Chickie has gotten Pancho off the girl, has proned him out,
      and cuffed him.

      Dewey has Zig-Zag cuffed.  Ben begins to search him.

      All three gangbangers are speaking in Spanish, it is spooking
      Dewey, as is the very LOUD MUSIC and the dogs BARKING. 

                                      DEWEY
                    Take him outside, down on the lawn.

                                    BEN
                            (protesting)
                    I haven't finished --

                                      DEWEY
                          (interrupting him,
                            shouting)
                    What are you --generation why?  I
                    ask you to do something, you do it! 
                    I'm your senior officer.*

      Dewey grabs Zig-Zag, takes him down the steps and out on the
      tarmac.  Then goes to check inside the car in the driveway
      to make sure it's not an ambush.  As he does --

                                      ZIG-ZAG
                    How you doing?

                                      ZIG-ZAG
                    Good, cause you look like a dead man
                    to me.  You just got temporary use
                    of your arms and legs.

                                      DEWEY
                    Shut your fucking mouth.

      Zig-Zag has reached for a gun still tucked in his back waist,
      and turns around, still hand-cuffed, and SHOOTS Dewey.

      Ben, from the porch, turns and fires, shooting Zig-Zag in
      the chest and blowing him two feet down the driveway.

      Pancho has lept to his feet and sprinted off while Chickie
      has turned away.  She has no idea which way he went.  She
      gets on the radio to call for a helicopter.

      Both shot men lay in the driveway.  John is already on the
      radio --

                                    JOHN

      As he moves to Dewey, who is still alive and mumbling.  Tries
      to comfort him and perform rudimentary life-saving techniques.
      Zig-Zag is dead.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                    You can call me for anything. *
                    Alright?  I'll be right back.*

                                    BRAD
                    Thank you.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      They are transporting Dewey, still alive and conscious, into
      an ambulance.  Zig-Zag lies dead, the Coroner is examining
      him.  The crime photographer is documenting this chaotic
      scene. 

      In the FG, Ben stands stricken.

                                      PHOTOGRAPHER
                    You okay, son?

      Ben doesn't answer.

      A BRIGHT WHITE FLASH as the camera freezes on his face, and
      it transforms into a still photograph.  This is the exact
      same sequence that we opened with --

      John is talking to a superior officer, a CAPT. who has
      arrived.  He moves to talk to Ben.

                                      CAPTAIN
                    You can't do that.

                                    JOHN
                    I'm doing it.

                                      CAPTAIN
                    I gotta keep you two seperate till
                    FID arrives.

                                    JOHN
                    The shooting was in freakin' policy
                    and that's not what I need to talk
                    to him about.

                                      CAPTAIN
                    You're pissing me off, Cooper.

                                    JOHN
                    I don't mean to, sir.

      He shrugs, let's him go.

      John goes over to Ben. 

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Sit down.

      They both sit down on the porch, watch as Dewey, still
      thrashing around, is loaded into the ambulance.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Where'd you learn to shoot like that,
                    the Beverly Hills Gun Club?

      Ben's taken it all day, he's had enough.

                                    BEN
                    Why don't you shut the hell up, sir?

      John laughs.

                                    JOHN
                    Right in his ten-ring.  Superb.

      Then, gesturing at Dewey -- angry --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    The fuzz that was.

      When Ben turns to look at him --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    He should have vested out ten years
                    ago.  He was a crap magnet.  Nothing
                    worse than a twenty year dinosaur
                    with a drinking problem. 
                          (softening)
                    I liked the guy, alright?  But you
                    want to put a gun in your mouth,
                    pull the trigger before someone else
                    gets hurt.  He was on a last chance
                    contract.  Did that change a freaking
                    thing?  No. 

      A car pulls up and disgorges two men.  Internal affairs --
      FID, force investigation division.  They go over to the
      Captain who told John not to sit with Ben.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Burn squad just showed up.  You heard
                    of Warner Brothers?

                    This is "warn a brother." You don't
                    lie.  That's how they get you.  Lying
                    is worse than an out of policy
                    shooting, so just tell it the way it
                    happened, you'll be fine.  No big
                    deal.

                                    BEN
                          (angry)
                    Taking a life is a big deal to me,
                    okay?  Anybody's life.

                                    JOHN
                    What'd  you think the gun was for,
                    show and tell?
                          (beat)
                    You'll get over it.  They'll send
                    you over to BSS, you can do all that
                    Buddhist "I love and revere all
                    sentient beings crap" and then O'dark
                    thirty the next time you're up?  You
                    drag your weary, fried-ass out of
                    bed, you put on your gun, and your
                    vest, and you do it all over again.

      A long beat.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    You know why?

      Ben looks at him, waits --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Cause it's a front row seat to the
                    greatest show on earth.

      Ben has just had it, he puts his head in his hands.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Can you abuse it?  Yes, sir.  You
                    can and you will, I guarantee it.
                          (beat)
                    Because it is relentless and it gets
                    to you and it seems like it changes
                    nothing.  But a day like today --
                    with some interesting capers and a
                    few good arrests?  That's pretty
                    good.  But once in awhile, you take
                    a bad guy off the streets for good? 
                    That's doing God's work.

      He turns to leave, throws Ben his rookie book, which he has
      already signed.

                    But, you want to be a pussy and quit,
                    then quit.  You're a cop because you
                    don't know how not to be one.  If
                    you feel that way, you're a cop.  If
                    you don't, you're not.  You decide.

      Lydia pulls up in her car on a side street.  It has started
      to rain.  She doesn't walk towards Brad's apartment, but
      away from it, towards the other building where Dwayne lives
      and she saw the ants.  She is walking away from the cops and
      media which has now trickled down to one van.  She turns
      into the courtyard of the other building, most of the lights
      are out.  She moves towards the stairs, goes up to Dwayne's
      floor, trying to find the ants.  She stands there, in the
      dark hallway, on the second floor, and sees the ants now,
      leaving Dwayne's apartment.  She follows them to a doorway
      two apartments down, where they disappear under the door. 
      She is standing in the shadows and doesn't see the large man
      come up behind her and strike her.  She goes down hard.

                                                                                  CUT TO:      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                      62.


      John stops at an intersection, which is backed up with
      traffic.  A tree has fallen across the road.  He thinks about
      driving past it, does a quick U-turn.  Gets out of his car,
      cursing, and starts to direct traffic as he waits for
      assistance.  He is getting soaked.  After a moment a WOMAN
      stops in her car.

                                      WOMAN
                    What happened here?

                    moving, Mam'n.

      Her eyes get big, then she realizes he is fucking with her. 
      She moves on.

      Lydia pulls up in front of Maria's house.  Sees Maria and
      Russell still sitting on the porch.  She steps from her car,
      takes a moment to gather herself together.  Maria stands up,
      as does Russell.  As Lydia gets closer to her, Maria lets
      out a wail and sits down hard.  She knows from Lydia's
      expression that her child is dead.

                                                                                CUT TO:*

      The press have gathered again.  Lydia and Russell pull up
      with Maria in the car.  Lydia has a gauze bandage on her
      head where Arsham struck her.  Maria gets out, moves towards
      her husband.  They made this life together, she needs to
      grieve with him.  Brad puts his arms around her.*

      She knows, reaches a hand up to his face.  Russell watches
      for a long beat.  He turns to look at Lydia, who has been
      quiet.  She can't stop thinking about what happened.
