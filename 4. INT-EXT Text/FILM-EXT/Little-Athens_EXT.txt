The old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job.
A faded
sign reading "ATHENS RESCUE SQUAD" stands in front.
HEATHER (O.S.)
You hear about your ex?
ALLISON (O.S.)
Jerry?
BRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is
standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt
and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their
late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept
last night.
Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over
to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through
the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of
the mailbox that hangs next to the door.
BRAD
(banging on the window
pane)
Hey! Jimmy!
The door opens and JIMMY answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4"
and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers.
Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face.
BRAD (CONT'D)
Finally!
JIMMY
Office hours are nine to five.
MEGAN
You have a lot of credit card bills in
there, Jimmy.
JIMMY
(holding his hand out for
the Mail)
I know.
Megan hands Jimmy the Mail.
MEGAN
You're not mad that we're stopping by like
this?
JIMMY
It's no big deal, but let's hurry up.
I
gotta go to work.
4
MEGAN
(explaining to Amy)
Jimmy's got like, six jobs.
Jimmy stands aside, allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment.
Megan and Amy step inside, but Brad holds back. He needs to talk to
Jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear.
BRAD
Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec. Look, not for
nothin', but you know Buggerin' Bobby
Bales is askin' about you?
JIMMY
Askin'?
Like how?
BRAD
Like how you owe him money on the Dallas
fiasco, those chokin' motherfuckers, and
you haven't been returnin' his calls.
JIMMY
How you hear this?
BRAD
Yesterday. I was puttin' a twenty-timer
on Indiana for tonight, and he up and out-
of-the-blue asks about you. Jimmy, man.
Goddam.
JIMMY
(unconvincing)
It ain't nothin'. He's just makin'
conversation.
BRAD
It ain't nothin'? That faggot juicehead's
gonna make a playground outta your asshole
like he's back in the joint, and it ain't
nothin'? And you heard all the stories I
heard, about that horse-cock, and how he
can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it
too, like when he whipped it out at
Tomlinson's party...
JIMMY
Alright Brad! Christ Jesus, I owe a
little, shit, but I'll pay. Believe me,
that guy wants his juice, his e, he comes
to me. It's fine.
BRAD
Put some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy.
5
JIMMY
Yeah. Alright, come inside and let's do
this thing. I got work.
Brad steps past Jimmy into the apartment, and Jimmy shuts the door
after them.
The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening
blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about
twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is
standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as
if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with
tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard
concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many
pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up,
down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to
him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic.
Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.
COREY
Nice.
PEDRO
Fuck you, conjo. This is my shower.
COREY
Maybe back in Mexico that's a shower, in
Athens that's just dirty.
PEDRO
Clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool.
COREY
At least I'm paid to be here.
Pedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey, starting to enjoy his
morning swim. A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing.
Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone. In the
background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly.
COREY (CONT'D)
Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking.
EMILY, the voice on the other end, is hushed and uncertain.
EMILY'S VOICE
It's me.
COREY
Emily?
EMILY'S VOICE
Some other girl would be calling you?
6
COREY
How'd you get this number?
EMILY'S VOICE
Don't you work there?
COREY
What do you want?
EMILY'S VOICE
I need you to come pick me up.
COREY
Are you kidding? Where are you?
EMILY'S VOICE
At home.
COREY
What for?
EMILY'S VOICE
Just because. I need to stay with you for
a couple days.
COREY
Emily, our place is tiny, we got no water.
Our phone just got shut off, too. You'd
be miserable like us. What for anyway?
EMILY'S VOICE
It's no big deal. Just come pick me up.
COREY
Fine, forget it then.
EMILY'S VOICE
Corey, come on! How many times have I
called you since you left? I wouldn't
ask, except I don't have anywhere to go.
Please.
COREY
Fine. Alright, fine. If you wanna stay
in our little dump, fine.
EMILY'S VOICE
Fine.
Thanks, then.
Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT hatchback is parked in front of the small
bare-bones gym.
WIDE across the width of the pool. COREY, wet, with GOGGLES on his
head, holding a WRENCH and SCREW DRIVER, and BYSTANDER #1, stand
over a young twenty-ish female VICTIM who lies passed out on the
cement. A young female LIFEGUARD is kneeling beside the Victim,
checking her pulse and breathing. The two SWIMMERS left in the pool
are climbing out. PETE, a no-nonsense grounds-keeper in his late
thirties, wearing cut-off shorts, a faded t-shirt and a tool belt,
approaches to have a word with Corey.
12
PETE
Is she alright?
COREY
She fainted.
LIFEGUARD
Alright, I'm calling 911.
Everybody stay
out of the pool.
The Lifeguard stands and runs off toward the PAYPHONE.
PETE
Alright, well, quit horsing around. The
Blandino's had a break-in. There's glass
all over the patio.
COREY
That's Jerry's unit.
PETE
Jerry moved to Middletown.
COREY
He quit?
PETE
He left a message. You gotta take care of
all his stuff now, too.
COREY
Aw, come on, Pete! I need off tomorrow!
I told you I got community service!
PETE
So you're gonna have to get everything
done today then. Get going.
Corey tears the Goggles off his head, throws them into the pool, and
about-faces toward the pool-house. As Corey leaves, a RED-HEADED
IDIOT does a sloppy can-opener off the side of the pool.
LIFEGUARD (O.S.)
Keith, I told you to clear the pool!
Though the park is in a poor neighborhood, it is relatively clean.
The park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young GIRLS
making their way across it. Prominent in the background sits an old
run-down yellow CAR that Jessica drove to the park.
13
JESSICA is carrying KATIE, a plain, tiny seven-year-old girl, in
piggy-back fashion, with Katie's legs dangling out in front of
Jessica. Katie holds Jessica tight around the collarbone.
KATIE
Doesn't Carlos want his car back?
JESSICA
He's letting me borrow it.
KATIE
Well then why were you late if you had his
car?
JESSICA
I slept late.
KATIE
Were you drinking last night?
JESSICA
No.
But thanks for asking.
KATIE
Were you doing drugs?
JESSICA
Katie, I told you, drugs are for losers.
KATIE
And you're not a loser.
JESSICA
And neither are you.
KATIE
But it's okay to drink.
JESSICA
When you're older it'll be okay.
KATIE
How old are you?
JESSICA
Old enough.
KATIE
But you're not twenty-one yet. The law
says you have to be twenty-one.
JESSICA
Katie, can you not ask so many questions
today? I've got too much to think about.
14
KATIE
Cause it's your birthday?
JESSICA
Yes.
KATIE
Happy Birthday!
JESSICA
Thank you.
Jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run,
the weight of Katie bearing down on her. They reach their
destination - a rickety old merry-go-round. Jessica turns her back
to the merry-go-round, allowing Katie to step onto it.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Hold on tight or you'll get hurt.
KATIE
I will.
Katie grabs a handle as Jessica begins to spin the machine. Katie
sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch, Katie's
youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom.
WIDE on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing.
Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation,
recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary
vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to
running through a red light. In the rear of the ambulance, Harry
whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware
of Heather's reckless driving.
Within the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in
front of a large picket fence encircling the pool. At the gate
stands the LIFEGUARD.
15
All three climb out of the ambulance.
Harry rushes toward the
Lifeguard. Heather takes a final puff
of her Cigarette and flicks
it aside before continuing in the same
direction as Harry. Allison
lags behind, pulling a BACKBOARD and a
large FIRST AID KIT out of
the ambulance.
LIFEGUARD
She's in here.
They enter the gate.
Heather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area, where
several BYSTANDERS have gathered around the VICTIM, BYSTANDER #1 and
PETE among them. Heather gets to the Victim first, but stops short
- she recognizes the Victim. Harry brushes past Heather.
HARRY
(to Bystanders)
Can you give us some room, please?
The crowd backs up a bit, and Harry checks for vitals.
HARRY (CONT'D)
(looking up to Heather)
She's breathing.
Harry looks the Victim over a bit.
HARRY (CONT'D)
(to Lifeguard)
What happened?
LIFEGUARD
I'm not sure. She just passed out, right
where you see her.
HARRY
Did you see her eat anything?
LIFEGUARD
Uh-uh.
Heather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate
carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with
Allison. They talk in hushed tones.
HEATHER
I know her.
ALLISON
Yeah?
How?
16
Allison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward
Harry.
HEATHER
When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked
him.
ALLISON
How do you know?
HEATHER
She started dating Steve right after we
broke up. I mean right after. I asked
him if there was another girl, and he
never answered. He couldn't answer,
because he was fucking that slut.
ALLISON
That doesn't mean they fucked.
Heather gives Allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be
stupid, stupid."
As Heather and Allison approach the Victim, Harry looks up.
HARRY
Alright, she ain't comin' around.
Allison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim, and the three
place her on the Backboard. Heather is a bit rough.
HARRY (CONT'D)
(instinctively)
Whoa, easy.
HEATHER
(without looking up)
I know what I'm doing.
Harry gives a concerned look to Allison, who returns the look, but
the two say nothing. They place the Victim into the back of the
Ambulance as Heather looks on.
The Ambulance is moving along a near-empty single-lane road at a
patient pace, with two CARS tailgating behind it.
The Tow Truck has just pulled up into the driveway. Pedro climbs
out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door, carrying a
gallon of MILK. Emily climbs out and trails behind him, carrying
her LAUNDRY BAG and PURSE. The house is very small, with a front
yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk, and neighboring
houses not much more than a body length apart from each other.
Pedro notices an EVICTION NOTICE on the front door, and that a
brand-new lock has been placed on the otherwise run-down door. He
tries unsuccessfully to open the door.
He walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen
and sees his DOG. Pedro taps on the window. The Dog looks up at
Pedro, wagging its tail. Pedro tries to open the window, but it's
locked.
Pedro walks around to the side of the house. Emily throws her
Laundry Bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the
wait. He looks in the window on the pantry door. He backs up and
18
looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house,
frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the
neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure
the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her
head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole
situation.
Jimmy parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of a mom-and-pop pizza shop
and exits. A sign that reads "Poppy's Pizzeria" hangs above the
pizza shop. He enters.
CARLOS, a skinny Hispanic teenager, is walking out of the
convenience store with a tray of NACHOS, talking on a CELL PHONE.
We cut back and forth between Jessica and Carlos.
CARLOS
Why weren't you answering your phone?!
You were supposed to bring my car back
last night!
JESSICA'S VOICE
Yeah.
Sorry.
CARLOS
You bringing it or what?
I need it for
work!
JESSICA'S VOICE
Not 'til this afternoon.
CARLOS
What the hell, Jess?!
You said I'd have
it last night!
JESSICA'S VOICE
Alright, relax, I'll bring it.
CARLOS
Dammit!
Where are you?
JESSICA'S VOICE
I'm getting on the Parkway.
The old run-down yellow Car passes Carlos and continues down the
street. Carlos is dumbfounded.
CARLOS
What the hell?!
Carlos runs into the street and stands staring down the road at his
Car speeding away from him.
JESSICA'S VOICE
What's the matter?
CARLOS
Jess, you just passed me!
In my car!
Carlos continues to look as his Car makes a right turn and
disappears from view.
20
CARLOS (CONT'D)
Jess, this is bullshit! Bring back my
car!
A horn honks, and Carlos steps toward the side of the road as a
STATION WAGON passes right by him. He continues to stand in the
street, although to the side.
CARLOS (CONT'D)
Jess, I know you're coming back here. I
know you're not leaving me standing here.
Carlos waits impatiently. Jessica pulls up in the Car and comes to
a stop alongside him - she had gone around the block to pick him up.
He gets in the passenger-side door.
JESSICA
Sorry.
The Car pulls away.
Jimmy is carrying several full insulated pizza CARRYING BAGS, with
several brown LUNCH BAGS full of food on top. Although the pile
looks unwieldy, Jimmy has no trouble with it. He places the pile on
the roof of his PIECE-OF-SHIT, opens the passenger door, and places
the pile on the passenger seat.
He closes the door, and pulls a DELIVERY LIST out of his pocket to
examine while walking around to the driver's side. Jimmy gets into
the driver's seat and pulls out his CELL PHONE.
JIMMY
(into his cell phone)
Hey, Car, it's me. I got a delivery in
the area so I'm stopping by a little
early. See you in a little while.
Jimmy hangs up, starts his Piece-of-Shit, and pulls out of the
parking lot.
A POLICE CAR is sitting off the road, positioned to surprise
unsuspecting speeders. The lone occupant, DEREK, twenty, about 6'
tall with athletic build, in his police-officer uniform, is reading
the SPORTS SECTION of a newspaper.
ALLISON is seated on a small wooden bench in the yard in front of
the rescue squad. HEATHER is pacing back and forth in front of her,
CELL PHONE to her ear. Both are smoking CIGARETTES. Heather is
still heated from seeing Steve's girl, and Allison is uncomfortable
being around Heather, who may lash out at anything. We cut back and
forth between Derek and Heather.
HEATHER
Are you seeing anybody else?
DEREK
Hello?
HEATHER
(louder)
Hello?! Are you seeing anybody else?!
DEREK
No.
HEATHER
You're not cheating on me?
DEREK
No.
HEATHER
Be honest.
DEREK
You're startin' to annoy me.
HEATHER
You're fucking annoying me!
DEREK
(dismissive)
Fine.
HEATHER
Don't you hang up!
24
DEREK
Then calm down. You told me to tell you
when you're in one of your moods? Well
guess what?
DEREK hears a click, hangs up, puts his Cell Phone down and goes
back to reading the Sports Section.
HEATHER
See?
That asshole's cheating.
ALLISON
Just because he won't move in with you
doesn't mean he's cheating.
HEATHER
Ally, he's a cheater. That's what he does
- he cheats. Now it's my turn just like
all the others.
Heather grabs her PURSE off the bench, replaces her Cell Phone, and
pulls out her KEYS.
HEATHER (CONT'D)
Let's go.
ALLISON
Where?
Allison gets up and follows Heather toward the parking lot.
CARLOS has parked in front of an old house, which is in a high state
of disrepair. JESSICA gets out of the CAR with Carlos' NACHOS.
JESSICA
You coming in?
CARLOS
No, but tell asshole I said hello.
JESSICA
See ya.
Jessica shuts the door. As she walks away, Carlos cannot take his
eyes off of her - he is obsessed.
Jessica walks up the steps and bangs on the screen door. PITT,
African-American, medium build, in his late teens, with thick-framed
glasses, walks up behind the screen door and holds it open for
Jessica to walk in.
25
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Aaron here?
PITT
No, he went to yer place lookin' fer you.
JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT into the driveway of what appears to
be a one-story house, next to a RANGE ROVER. He climbs out with the
strap of his BACKPACK hanging over one shoulder and walks around the
house to the back yard.
The yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard,
and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. As Jimmy
turns the corner, he spots a black CAT walking up to him. He grabs
the Cat.
Jimmy shuts the doors behind him. He stops in his tracks just
outside the doors, thoughts running through his mind.
WIDE on Jimmy as he throws his Backpack into his trunk, climbs into
his Piece-of-Shit, and sits, reflecting.
Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit has just rear-ended another CAR of equal value
parked in front of a STOP SIGN in an otherwise empty intersection.
The DRIVER of the forward Car stirs.
The driver, DAVE, a large, ripped, soft-spoken juicehead, gets out
of the forward car holding the back of his neck. He slams the door
shut with his free hand, pissed, and staggers towards Jimmy's car.
A twenty-something FEMALE PASSENGER is sitting motionless in the
passenger seat. Dave glances up and sees Jimmy.
DAVE
Jimmy?
(still dazed, but
immediately friendly)
Hey, what's up, man?
Jimmy turns off the ringer on his Cell Phone and gets out of his
vehicle.
JIMMY
Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that. I was
talkin' on the phone. I didn't see the
stop sign, I guess.
DAVE
Don't sweat it.
(regarding his Car)
I could give a shit about this thing. I
was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or
somethin' hit me.
Jimmy notices the Female Passenger in the passenger seat and walks
toward her, with Dave following.
JIMMY
Holy shit, man, is she alright?
32
Jimmy and Dave both stand near the passenger side of the car. The
window is completely open. The Female Passenger lies motionless,
bleeding noticeably from the forehead.
DAVE
She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that
hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.
JIMMY
What're you, a fuckin' doctor?
We need ta
get her to a hospital.
DAVE
Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a
problems if we do that. Cops, insurance
and whatnot. You probably got drugs on
you...
JIMMY
Dave, look at her fuckin' head!
She's
bleedin' all over the place!
DAVE
Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of
it. She's a stripper, for god-sake.
JIMMY
That's retarded.
The Female Passenger begins to slowly stir.
It is clear she is out
of it - still very woozy.
DAVE
See?
I told ya.
JIMMY
Dave, you're a sick fuck.
I'm calling
911. Look at the blood!
Jimmy reaches for his Cell Phone, but Dave again objects.
DAVE
Put that shit away. I'll take her home
and give her some K, she'll be fine.
JIMMY
She needs a doctor.
What the hell's K
gonna do?
DAVE
Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy
like you should be avoidin' that kinda'
attention.
33
JIMMY
You should take better care of your girl.
DAVE
Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through
all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam
whore. She's a whore.
FEMALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
Fuck you, Dave, you asshole!
DAVE
See, she's fine.
Dave lights a CIGARETTE.
JIMMY
Holy shit. You're fucked up.
(seeing an opportunity)
Hey, you need any juice or anythin'?
DAVE
No, man, I'm good.
JIMMY
You sure? Look, man, I just got a buncha'
stuff. Coke, e, K. I gotta sell it fast,
you can sell it to your crackhead friends
whenever.
DAVE
You been placin' bets with Bobby the
Bookie again?
JIMMY
No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty
percent on my cards and shit, and it
drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my
money away.
DAVE
Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh?
JIMMY
You want it?
DAVE
Look, I'm definitely interested in a
little bit for myself, definitely, but I
ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think
about it.
JIMMY
Hey, your nose is bleedin'.
34
Dave reflexively puts a finger to his nostril and examines it for
blood.
DAVE
Seriously?
JIMMY
No, just horsin' around.
DAVE
Listen, I gotta get going.
Patch her head
up and shit.
JIMMY
Yeah.
(regarding Dave's Car)
Sorry, man.
DAVE
Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya.
Jimmy and Dave get in their respective cars and drive off.
EMILY is seated on a swing off to the side of the gated pool area,
smoking a CIGARETTE, looking in through the gate at the pool. She's
wearing an old, yet barely worn, BASEBALL CAP.
COREY (O.S.)
You smoke?!
EMILY
Yeah, so?
You do drugs.
Corey enters the frame, grabs the Cigarette and stomps it out, but
Emily's nonchalant demeanor remains.
COREY
How would you know?
EMILY
Everybody knows my brother does drugs.
COREY
So you heard about that thing that
happened?
EMILY
Yeah.
Everybody knows about that, too.
COREY
If you think so highly of me, what the
hell are you doing here?
35
EMILY
I'm just saying. Why'd you try to put
everything back in the house?
COREY
We ran outta of gas. We were right
outside his house - what the hell else
were we supposed to do? He wasn't
supposed to be home for another hour. At
least he took it easy on us.
EMILY
(changing the subject)
Here, I brought this.
Emily hands Corey the Baseball Cap.
Corey is caught off-guard.
COREY
What for?
EMILY
Dad gave it to you, remember?
You left
it. I brought it for you.
COREY
Keep it.
I don't wear hats.
EMILY
I don't want it.
Corey has no desire to wear it, so he holds it.
COREY
You go to see him at all?
EMILY
In prison?
No, not lately.
COREY
So what's the problem?
Vincent hitting
you?
EMILY
Vincent?
Vincent's gone.
She's on Victor
now.
COREY
What happened to Vincent?
EMILY
He found out about Victor.
36
PEDRO (O.S.)
(to Corey)
Vamos, I need the address!
I have a pen
in the truck!
Pedro is standing at the gate.
COREY
So is Victor hitting you or what?
EMILY
No.
COREY
What then?
EMILY
I don't wanna talk about it.
Forget it.
PEDRO
(to Corey)
Hurry up, mehn!
EMILY
You know he has porno magazines all over
his truck.
COREY
So?
Corey heads toward the gate and spots KEVIN, a young boy of about
ten, sitting on the MOPED that was leaning up along the interior of
the pool-area fence.
COREY (CONT'D)
Hey, Kevin, get off my bike, alright?
KEVIN
It's a moped.
COREY
Just lay off it.
Kevin gets off.
Corey continues toward the gate.
The driver-side door of a TOW TRUCK is swung wide open, with "ATHENS
TOWING SERVICE" written on side. Pedro is leaning one hand on the
rolled down window and his other hand on the roof of the Tow Truck,
watching Corey, who is leaning over the Tow Truck's hood, writing
Mr. Carson's address on a piece of PAPER with a PEN.
PEDRO
Gracias.
37
Pedro throws the Paper and Pen into the Tow Truck.
PEDRO (CONT'D)
Oye, don't get mad, but would you be mad
if I try to fuck your sister?
COREY
If you think you can.
PEDRO
Maybe you think you can talk to her for
me?
COREY
Pedro, she's fifteen!
PEDRO
No way, mehn.
(forming breasts with his
hands)
No con esas tetas.
COREY
I'll have you sent to jail, man.
I'm
serious.
PEDRO
No way she is fifteen.
She looks way
older.
COREY
She'll look a lot younger on the witness
stand, with my mom sitting in the
courtroom.
PEDRO
Bueno, tell her I say good-bye.
I call
you soon.
Pedro climbs behind the wheel as Corey holds the door open to talk
to him.
COREY
So what're you gonna do?
PEDRO
I'm gonna find Mr. Cocksucker and say,
"Look, mehn, let us into our fucking
home."
Corey steps aside as Pedro shuts his door and turns the ignition.
38
COREY
Wait a second... Why are you still
driving this thing? I thought you got
fired.
PEDRO
Si, si, but I need it. How am I gonna
drive without my truck. They fired me,
mehn.
Corey watches as Pedro pulls out.
ESTABLISHING SHOT on the police station with a number of POLICE CARS
parked neatly in front. Two middle-age MALE POLICE OFFICERS are
standing in front of the entrance, talking. Heather and Allison's
AMBULANCE is parked in the lot across the street, facing the police
station.
Aaron is out the front door, yelling at Jessica who is further down
the street.
AARON
Where you goin', bitch?!
Jessica runs to Carlos's CAR, opens the door, throws the Novel in
and jumps in after it. She throws on her seatbelt and rifles
through her purse, looking for her pepper spray.
JESSICA
Drive!
CARLOS
(starting the Car)
What's the deal?
Aaron, holding a ROCK slightly bigger than his fist, smashes the
passenger-side window.
CARLOS (CONT'D)
What the fuck!
JESSICA
Fucking drive!
Aaron reaches in and grabs Jessica's hair and begins to rip her out
of the car, cutting his own arm while doing so. Aaron growls, more
in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might. Jessica is
holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is
scratching and clawing at Aaron to get Aaron to release her with her
other hand. Jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping
her in the car. Carlos is pulling away slowly. Aaron releases one
hand from Jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Fuck you!
AARON
Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!
Aaron repeatedly tries to hit Jessica with his free hand as Carlos
pulls into the street. Aaron runs along with the car. Jessica
reaches toward Aaron with a closed fist, where she is holding her
PEPPER SPRAY. She sprays at Aaron but misses. Aaron grabs at her
fist with his free hand and rips the Pepper Spray from Jessica.
Jessica screams in pain as Aaron sprays away.
AARON (CONT'D)
You like that, bitch?! Huh?!
42
Carlos swerves violently to the side towards a parked CAR along the
side of the road. Aaron is plowed along toward the Car, but
releases Jessica at the last possible second, just avoiding a
collision with the Car. Carlos was not fooling around.
Aaron watches them tear down the street before he about-faces and
walks briskly back toward the house, where Troy is standing on the
front porch watching the action.
Pedro pulls his TOW TRUCK and parallel parks on the street in front
of the house.
Pedro gets out of his Tow Truck and walks up to the front door. He
rings the doorbell. There is no answer, so he rings the doorbell
again, then knocks on the door. Again no answer, so he bangs on the
door vigorously. He leans over and peers inside the window. As he
does so, MR. CARSON opens the front door, apparently having just
woken up.
MR. CARSON
Pedro? What're you doing here?
Get the
hell off my porch.
43
PEDRO
Hey, mehn, let me into my fucking
apartment.
MR. CARSON
Either pay me or get off my porch.
Mr. Carson shuts the door. Pedro turns around and eyes the gray
FORD TAURUS parked behind his Tow Truck. He walks back to his Tow
Truck and grabs some tools. He begins hitching up the Ford Taurus
to his Tow Truck.
Mr. Carson parts the curtain behind his front window, eyes wide as
he watches Pedro. The front door opens, and Mr. Carson comes
storming out.
MR. CARSON (CONT'D)
Pedro!
What the hell are you doing?!
PEDRO
I'm hitching up your car to my tow truck.
MR. CARSON
Let it down right now you psychotic
sonuvabitch!
PEDRO
Let me in my fucking apartment, mehn!
MR. CARSON
Pay the damn rent!
PEDRO
I'm gonna pay, mehn!
I got fired!
MR. CARSON
Bullshit! You never pay rent, and I know
you've had a job! I'm sicka' this shit!
Put down my car, or I'm callin' the cops
to haul your ass outta here!
PEDRO
Listen, don't be a cocksucker.
It's not
needed.
MR. CARSON
I'm done with it. Let my car down.
PEDRO
I need a job, mehn, then I pay you.
MR. CARSON
Margaret wants you out of the house
anyway. Now let my car down.
44
PEDRO
You need some balls, mehn!
Why do you let
her slap you around?!
MR. CARSON
Nobody slaps nobody around.
PEDRO
Hay, por favor! I come by here to pay
rent, I always hear her slapping your ass
around.
MR. CARSON
I'm going inside to get the phone. If
you're still here when I come back out I'm
gonna dial the police with you standing
right here next to me.
Mr. Carson proceeds inside. Pedro watches Mr. Carson proceed back
into the house as he releases the Ford Taurus back down to the
ground.
The baseball field is empty. MATT is leaning against the driver-
side door of his CAR, which is parked all by itself near a dumpster
at the edge of the lot. JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT up and parks
next to the driver-side door of Matt's Car.
Jimmy climbs out of his Piece-of-Shit.
MATT
Dude, what the hell?! I'm ready to go
here! Where the hell were you?!
JIMMY
I got into a freakin' accident!
Matt starts walking to meet Jimmy at the rear of the cars.
MATT
Bullshit, man, fucking bullshit! You make
me come all the way out here! I been
waitin'!
JIMMY
Look, you're pissin' me off now! Remember
who's doin' fuckin' who the favor! I got
shit I gotta do!
Matt pulls his WALLET out of his back pocket.
45
MATT
(about to blow, then
controls himself)
Fine, fine! Just give it to me.
JIMMY
I didn't want to bring my bag to your
house, with your fuckin' parents home.
Jimmy opens his trunk and pulls his BACKPACK out.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
Where's my Grand Theft Auto?
MATT
I lent it to Jerry.
JIMMY
What'd you do that for?
Get it back.
MATT
He moved down the shore.
This morning.
Rushed, Jimmy blows it off and pulls a jar of K out of his Backpack.
JIMMY
Alright, sixty bucks.
MATT
What?
Fer one freakin' jar?!
JIMMY
Dude, stop your bitchin' and pay up.
I
told you this shit, I told you.
MATT
You said extra, I thought you meant, like,
fifty!
JIMMY
Asshole, fifty is the regular fuckin'
price!
MATT
This is fuckin' extortion! Knowin' I'm
meetin' this chick, so you jack up the
price!
JIMMY
Look! This is a pain in my ass, comin'
way out here, and I said I'd charge you
extra. I don't give a shit if its ten
over the regular price, or twenty-five
over your fuckin' "discount price," but
you're payin' sixty bucks for this jar.
46
MATT
(weakly)
Man, what the hell.
(looks in his Wallet)
I need some cash for food and drinks, man!
I'm takin' this girl out!
JIMMY
(considering)
Gimme fifty even.
MATT
C'mon, man! I need as much cash as I can
get! What if she wants to go somewhere?!
And gas! Dude, just take forty-five!
JIMMY
(breaking)
Fine, you cheap-ass fuckin' bastard.
Jimmy accepts the Forty-Five Dollars, and gives Matt the jar of K.
Jimmy is pissed.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
Here, man, go fuckin' get high.
MATT
(almost apologetic)
See ya.
Jimmy throws his Backpack back in the trunk and slams it shut.
COREY is on a PAYPHONE outside the restrooms, talking to PEDRO.
PEDRO'S VOICE
He said "no," mehn. The cocksucker won't
let us back in.
Pedro is on a PAYPHONE.
We cut back and forth between Pedro and
Corey.
COREY
That's great.
PEDRO
Hey, this isn't my fault, mehn.
A short beat as Corey thinks.
47
PEDRO (CONT'D)
Hello?
Corey hangs up and puts more coins into the Payphone.
Pete
approaches, looking for Corey.
PETE
Corey.
Corey tries to phase out Pete's voice.
PETE (CONT'D)
The Blandinos just called again.
The
broken glass is still there.
ROB'S VOICE
(via the Payphone)
Hello?
PETE
And the grass needs to be cut.
COREY
(hurriedly to Pete)
Okay, I'll take care of it.
PETE
(sarcastic)
Don't forget to put gas in it.
Pete exits.
COREY
Rob?
It's Corey Becker.
ROB'S VOICE
Hey.
COREY
You got any spare cash?
EMILY is laying back in a lounge chair. Corey enters the pool area
from clubhouse carrying the BASEBALL CAP. He walks over to his
MOPED chained to the gate, throws on his Baseball Cap, unlocks his
Moped, and pushes it through the gate where resident KIDS are
gathered around a ping pong table. Emily watches as he hops on the
Moped and throws on his HELMET. KID #1, one of the younger kids at
the table, spot Corey in the distance.
KID #1
Corey!
Hey Corey!
Corey looks over as he starts his Moped.
48
KID #1 (CONT'D)
Gorski says he can beat you!
COREY
Maybe he can.
KID #1
Yeah right! Get over here and whip his
ass real quick!
Corey kicks the stand up on his Moped and rides off.
KID #1 (CONT'D)
(shouting after him)
Aw, c'mon! Corey!
ESTABLISHING SHOT. The small wooden bench on which Heather and
Allison were sitting earlier is empty.
JIMMY is driving his PIECE-OF-SHIT with a clear look of anger and
frustration in his face. The windows are down, but the radio is no
longer playing.
Cars are still honking at Jimmy as he continues to sit at a
standstill in the intersection.
53
JIMMY
(generally to the other
drivers)
Fuck off!
Jimmy throws his Piece-of-Shit in reverse, then cuts left, through
and out of the intersection.
JIMMY parallel parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of his apartment and
exits carrying his BACKPACK. He unlocks the door to his apartment,
opens it, and steps one foot inside.
COREY is standing in the middle of an unkept lawn, watching ROB,
about eighteen and wearing Corey's HELMET, ride Corey's MOPED in
circles around him on the lawn. He's treating the Moped rather
roughly, pulling wheelies and kicking the tail end out repeatedly.
Corey is watching impatiently, holding the BASEBALL CAP at his side.
Rob jumps the Moped over the curb into the street, then turns up the
driveway and pulls up alongside Corey. Rob removes the Helmet.
ROB
I'll take it.
CARLOS has parked his CAR along the side of the street.
JESSICA is
in the passenger seat on her CELL PHONE.
AARON'S VOICE
Jess, come back here.
JESSICA
Yeah right.
ESTABLISHING SHOT on the Car pulling back out onto the street as
Kwon continues talking to the Police Officer in the background.
ROB is riding his newly-acquired MOPED, with COREY on the back.
Corey is holding Rob with one hand, his BASEBALL CAP with the other.
He drops Corey off in front of Mr. Carson's house.
As Rob pulls a wheelie and exits the frame, Corey walks up to the
front door of the house. He rings the doorbell, reaching into his
pocket and pulling out a wad of BILLS as he waits. Mr. Carson opens
the door.
58
COREY
Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent.
Mr. Carson opens the screen door, and Corey hands him the Bills.
Mr. Carson begins counting them.
COREY (CONT'D)
Can you let us back into our apartment
now?
MR. CARSON
This is only one month.
You boys owe
three.
COREY
That's all we have. We'll give you the
rest later, as soon as we can.
MR. CARSON
When you get me the rest, I'll let you
back in.
COREY
Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just
temporary. Pedro lost his job.
MR. CARSON
Bullshit. You're always late. You should
spend less time trying to rob houses, and
more time working.
COREY
Aren't you supposed to take us to court
before you throw us out?
MRS. CARSON (O.S.)
Holy fuck, Shelby! Shut the goddam door
already you stupid bastard! You're
letting the cold air out!
MR. CARSON
(suddenly in a hurry)
Tell it to my lawyer.
COREY
Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're
doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless!
MRS. CARSON (O.S.)
Shut the goddam door!
MR. CARSON
Three months!
59
Mr. Carson slams the door.
COREY
(banging on the door)
C'mon!
Corey stands and stares at the door a moment.
He turns and leaves,
resigned to a long walk back to the pool.
PEDRO is driving nonchalantly toward the back-lot.
A song is
playing on the car radio.
WIDE on a parked MUSTANG, a couple empty parking spaces on the
passenger side of it. Pedro's TOW TRUCK backs up into the frame so
that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the Mustang.
Pedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking
around to the back of it. Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and
sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas
gage. It's more than 3/4 full.
Satisfied, Pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and
hitches the Mustang to the back of it. An older couple pulls into
the parking lot and parks one car length from the Mustang. OLDER
MAN and OLDER WOMAN climb out of their CAR. The Older Man has taken
an interest in what Pedro is doing.
OLDER MAN
Hey, can I park here?
PEDRO
(very friendly)
Si, si, of course.
(motioning toward the
Mustang)
The transmission is broke.
Transmissions
on these cars suck.
Older Woman notices that the front passenger-side tire is flat.
OLDER WOMAN
(pointing)
Oh, and the tire's flat, too.
Pedro steps around to the passenger side of the Mustang, surprised
to see the FLAT TIRE.
PEDRO
Ah, si, but that's no big deal.
That's
fine, believe me.
Older Man and Older Woman begin walking toward the entrance to the
diner.
60
OLDER MAN
Good luck.
PEDRO
Gracias!
As Older Man and Older Woman proceed toward the diner, Pedro opens
the door to his Tow Truck, and reaches in to hit the control which
lifts the Mustang.
Through the window we see PATRONS eating. Pedro drives by in his
Tow Truck with the Mustang hitched to the back.
The sound of panting can be heard. Two people are having sex.
There are no words, although the girl regularly lets out high-
pitched groans, indicative of at least a little pain.
Jimmy is sitting in an alley behind the pizza shop, finishing a COKE
with plenty of ice. Kwon emerges from the back door of the pizza
shop. Jimmy sees Kwon, and hides his displeasure as best he can.
KWON
Hey, Jimmy.
JIMMY
What's up.
69
KWON
I'm just looking for my stuff.
Let's take
a ride.
JIMMY
Where?
KWON
Your place.
JIMMY
Can't do it 'til after work.
KWON
You're sitting here on your ass!
JIMMY
I gotta eat. I'm going back to work now.
My boss needs me - I'm the only delivery
guy.
KWON
Is that your piece-of-shit out front?
JIMMY
Yeah.
KWON
Let's check that out.
JIMMY
I told you, I ain't got your shit.
KWON
Hey! Until I find the drugs, everyone is
a suspect!
Jimmy's Cell Phone rings.
KWON (CONT'D)
(regarding the call)
Fuck that. Let's look in your car.
Jimmy reaches into his pocket, but instead of a cell phone, he pulls
out his car KEYS, which he tosses at Kwon. Kwon storms off, and
Jimmy grabs his CELL PHONE out of his other pocket and answers it.
JIMMY
Hey, it's Jimmy.
The doors of Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT are flung wide open.
Kwon is
hauling Jimmy's spare TIRE out of the trunk.
JIMMY
Kwon, what the hell are you doing?
Kwon dumps the Tire on the ground and, seeing nowhere to hide
anything, stands straight up and looks at Jimmy.
KWON
When you off work?
JIMMY
Don't know.
Maybe nine or nine-thirty.
Kwon tosses Jimmy his KEYS back, jumps in his BMW, and takes off.
Jimmy becomes increasingly resolved as he watches him leave. Jimmy
pulls out his Delivery List and his Cell Phone. He turns the
Delivery List over to the number on the back and punches it into his
Cell Phone. He paces as he talks.
SINJIN'S VOICE
Hello?
JIMMY
Is this Sinjin?
SINJIN'S VOICE
Yeah, who's this?
JIMMY
This is Jimmy. Juicehead Dave's friend.
SINJIN'S VOICE
Yeah, I know.
PETE is on a ride-on LAWN MOWER.
He spots COREY walking toward the
gate to the pool area.
PETE
(over the noise of the
lawn mower)
Hey!
Pete shuts off the blade and steers the Lawn Mower over to Corey,
stopping just short of him.
72
PETE (CONT'D)
Where the hell have you been!
COREY
I know, Pete. I'm real real sorry. I got
things going on, you wouldn't believe it.
My life is crazy right now.
PETE
You have a job here, Corey!
You can't
just go taking off!
COREY
I know. I'm sorry. I mean, I know, the
Blandino's. I'm going now.
PETE
I already took care of that!
(hopping off the Lawn
Mower)
Just finish up what I'm doing, then take
care of the fertilizer spill in the
utility room.
COREY
Okay, alright, I will.
Corey hops on the Lawn Mower, turns on the blade, and picks up where
Pete left off. Pete shakes his head in disgust and heads into the
garage.
Corey is wide-eyed as he turns the corner entering the last leg of
his first lawn lap and spots PEDRO approaching in his TOW TRUCK with
the MUSTANG hitched to the back of it. He shuts the blade off and
steers the Lawn Mower over to the tow truck. Pedro parks as Corey
hops off the Lawn Mower.
COREY (CONT'D)
You got your job back?
PEDRO
Que?
COREY
(pointing at the Mustang)
What the hell is that?!
PEDRO
(looking back at the
Mustang)
Ah, el Mustang?
COREY
Yeah!
73
PEDRO
That's our rent, mehn.
We stole it.
COREY
Hey, uh-uh, no way!
I didn't steal
anything!
PEDRO
Don't worry.
We're going to sell it,
mehn.
COREY
Seriously, are you out of your mind?
To
who?!
PEDRO
This guy I know.
COREY
How do ya know he'll even buy it?
PEDRO
Don't worry. He likes Mustangs, mehn.
Vamos, I got a place for us to stay.
COREY
Jesus, Pedro! I told you I wanna stay out
of trouble! I mean, this is big trouble!
PEDRO
No jodas, don't worry about it. I stole
it. But we need rent, mehn. I lost my
job.
Corey looks over at Emily, laying down in a lounge chair.
PEDRO (CONT'D)
So you in or out?
COREY
Hey, Emily!
Get your stuff!
PEDRO
Asi me gusta, now you're being smart.
EMILY
Where are we going?!
COREY
Just get in the truck!
Corey heads toward the garage. Emily looks over at Pedro sitting in
the Tow Truck. Pedro sticks his hand up to say hello to Emily,
awkward. She ignores him and begins gathering her stuff.
74
Music is audible from inside the house. Carter's house is an old
dilapidated house, with a tiny front yard and huge back yard
surrounded by trees, with rusty old cars scattered throughout. Just
about everybody enters the house from the back. BERUBI, in his
early twenties, very large and athletic, wearing mesh shorts and a
beat-up t-shirt, and a MALE FRIEND, of a similar age with an average
build and dressed lazily in khakis and an un-tucked shirt, are
unloading a KEG from the bed of a PICK-UP TRUCK onto a dolly.
HEATHER and ALLISON are standing on the back porch. Heather is
holding a bottle of VODKA in her hand. Heather bangs on the screen
door. CARTER approaches. In his early twenties, Carter is tough,
with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an
appetite for greasy food and cheap beer. He's a guy's guy.
CARTER
What's up.
Heather tries to open the screen door - it's stuck.
ALLISON
Hey Carter.
Carter slams the handle from the inside - the door opens.
CARTER
What's up.
75
HEATHER
(busting Carter's chops
with a mocking tone)
What's up.
As Heather passes, Carter mockingly shows Heather the back of his
hand as if to smack her. Heather and Allison pass, and Carter holds
the door open with his foot as he looks for something to prop it
open.
PEDRO, EMILY and COREY, now wearing the BASEBALL CAP, are parked in
the TOW TRUCK across the street from the front of Carter's house.
Porno magazines lie on the dashboard and the floor. BERUBI, walking
along the side of the house from the back yard, spots Pedro behind
the wheel. He approaches.
EMILY
(to Corey, disapproving)
I can't believe you're doing this.
COREY
(aside to Pedro)
Ya think it's a good idea we leave it out
here on the street like this?
PEDRO
(aside to Corey)
Forget about that, mehn.
(referring to Berubi)
76
I'll talk to Berubi. I know what to say
to this guy. Don't worry.
BERUBI
Hey, Pedro, what's up with the Mustang?
Berubi motions to the MUSTANG hitched to the back of it.
PEDRO
Que?
Ah, el Mustang?
Pedro starts to climb out of the Tow Truck.
BERUBI
Yeah.
PEDRO
Nada.
I'm doing a favor for a friend.
BERUBI
So you're driving around with his car
hitched to your tow truck?
Pedro shuts the door to his Tow Truck and pulls up his shorts.
PEDRO
Bueno, he's a good friend.
BERUBI
Sounds good.
Come on an' grab a beer.
PEDRO
(to Berubi)
Hey, listen, can I sleep on your couch?
BERUBI
Kimmock's got couch.
PEDRO
Come on, mehn, we're in trouble here.
We
got thrown out of our home.
BERUBI
You got evicted?
PEDRO
Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk
for my dog, I come back, my keys don't
work, and the cocksucker put an eviction
notice on the door. He didn't even tell
us! Now my milk's spoiling in my truck,
Pancho's probably pissing all over the
place, I'm fucked.
77
BERUBI
Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in
Jerry's room. He moved out.
PEDRO
He did?
BERUBI
Don't park there. Park in back.
PEDRO
Si, si.
No problem, mehn.
BERUBI
(to Corey)
What's up, Becker.
Corey sticks his hand up to say hello.
Jessica climbs out of the car and shuts the door. Carlos follows
suit. They move around the side of the house toward the back porch.
Jessica stops in her tracks and turns to face Carlos.
JESSICA
Wait here a second and let me talk to him.
78
Without waiting for a response, Jessica turns around and climbs onto
the back porch, walking its length toward Carter, who is kneeling
with his back to us as he puts a TAP on the KEG. Carlos stands
watching, not sure what to do.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
What're you doing?
Carter turns around, and seems disappointed to see her.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
You need a hand?
CARTER
I'm done.
Carter climbs to his feet and heads toward the back door, shaking
off his hands, passing right by Jessica. Jessica pulls her
Sunglasses from her shirt.
JESSICA
Carter, I brought your sunglasses back.
Carter turns and grabs the Sunglasses.
CARTER
Those were Jerry's anyway.
Carter heads into the house.
Jessica follows Carter, and we follow
Jessica.
JIMMY has parked his PIECE-OF-SHIT in the rear of the back yard
behind all of the other CARS that have pulled in. He climbs out,
slides his CHINESE STRESS BALLS into his pocket, and walks toward
the house, his BACKPACK strapped over both shoulders like a
schoolboy.
PEDRO and EMILY grab CUPS off the rusted washing machine that sits
on the back porch. Corey takes notice of a ping pong table set up
in the back yard, where BARNES is playing PING PONG PLAYER 1.
Barnes is skinny but attractive, and has an even more attractive
BARNES' GIRLFRIEND watching him play, along with PING PONG PLAYER 2
and various PARTYGOERS.
COREY
(turning to grab a Cup
for himself)
I don't know about leaving the car out
there in the open like that. You think we
should, like, hide it somewhere?
PEDRO
Coo ya! Don't take this the wrong way,
mehn, but you're like a girl. Bitch,
bitch, bitch.
Pedro begins dispensing beer from the KEG.
COREY
Somebody could see it out there!
85
PEDRO
Si, si.
Does your pussy hurt?
COREY
I'm serious, Pedro!
PEDRO
Who's gonna see it out there by the woods?
EMILY
Everybody who reads tomorrow's paper.
COREY
Shut up Emily.
EMILY
No, you shut up! Do you know how
embarrassing you are?!
COREY
Look, it was bad luck as usual.
So what?
EMILY
The car ran out of gas in the driveway!
COREY
The gage was busted!
EMILY
Everybody at school makes fun of me!
PEDRO
And it was way down the block anyway.
EMILY
(to Corey)
And then you try to put everything back!
I mean, God, how stupid can you be?!
COREY
Just shut up, alright?! 'Cause you don't
know shit about anything!
EMILY
The Herald had a picture of the owner
laughing at you!
Corey drops his BEER and moves in aggressively, grabbing Emily by
the wrists.
COREY
Listen, I'm sick of your shit!
86
EMILY
(struggling to break
free)
Get off me! You fucking loser!
Emily falls on her ass.
COREY
No wonder Victor tried to fuck you.
Emily stands up, turns around and heads toward the back door leading
into the kitchen, storming past a TEENAGE BOY and TEENAGE GIRL
passionately kissing each other against a tree in the back yard. We
hang on the couple as Emily walks out of frame. As the boy works
his way down to her neck, the girl's eyes open for a moment and
catch someone watching her.
JIMMY is standing in the kitchen in front of the door looking out
onto the back porch, staring at the couple making out, momentarily
transfixed. Jimmy's hand is in his pocket, turning his CHINESE
STRESS BALLS over and over and over. The girl closes her eyes
again, and Jimmy is forgotten, the moment lost. Jimmy is alone
again, still, as usual.
Jessica sees CARLOS standing against a post on the back porch
drinking his BEER. He is surrounded by several PARTYGOERS, but
isn't talking to any of them.
JESSICA
Hey.
CARLOS
Where you been?
JESSICA
Talking to Carter.
CARLOS
Is he gonna help?
JESSICA
He said he would.
Carlos pulls a pint of WHISKEY out of his back pocket.
CARLOS
Look.
Wanna shot?
Jessica accepts the Whiskey and takes a long pull. She holds onto
the Whiskey without saying anything, and Carlos does not object.
She begins to take in the sights and sounds of the party, and
notices COREY leaning against a rusty old washing machine near the
KEG as PEDRO hands him another BEER.
Jessica's POV as Corey spots her standing next to Carlos. He
continues to stare at Jessica, clearly taken by the sight of her,
his eyes locking onto hers. The desperation of their individual
struggles is lost for a moment.
PEDRO
You want me to talk to her?
The moment quickly passes as Corey turns his attention back to
Pedro.
COREY
No.
PEDRO
Si. So let's go fix the tire on the
Mustang.
88
Corey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game, and Jessica
takes note.
CARLOS
(to Jessica)
You wanna play?
Carlos motions toward the large kitchen window.
Jessica turns to
look through it.
EMILY is standing on the front steps, wondering whether to continue
outside or head back inside. She's completely out of place here
among the older crowd. FEMALE PARTYGOER 1 and a PARTYGOER appear
behind her in the doorway behind her.
FEMALE PARTYGOER 1
Excuse me.
Emily politely moves down to the bottom of the stairs and steps
aside. She watches as Female Partygoer 1 and the Partygoer pass by
her into the front yard.
COREY and PEDRO climb off the back porch toward the ping pong table.
BARNES and PING PONG PLAYER 1 are just finishing a point, which
Barnes takes easily, as PING PONG PLAYER 2 waits his turn. Barnes
91
is skinny but attractive, and has an even more attractive BARNES'
GIRLFRIEND watching him play.
PEDRO
What the hell are you doing?
We got shit
to do mehn, important shit.
Ping Pong Player 1 steps back and notes Corey approaching.
PING PONG PLAYER 1
Corey!
Hey, come beat this asshole!
BARNES
Hey, nineteen-ten, let's go.
PING PONG PLAYER 1
Screw it, you won again. Play Corey.
BARNES
C'mon.
Becker can't beat me.
PING PONG PLAYER 1
(to Barnes' Girlfriend,
handing Corey his paddle)
Watch this.
Corey steps to the table opposite Barnes, confident, but
unenthusiastic. Corey is not playing for the fun of it - somewhere
deep down Corey wants to remind himself that he's good at something.
Barnes tosses the PING PONG BALL to Corey.
BARNES
You serve, Becker.
Corey's first serve is wicked - fast and spinning wildly.
Barnes
has no chance.
BARNES' GIRLFRIEND
Not too good, baby.
Pedro stands alongside and watches silently, pensive, his mind
distraught over their larger dilemma.
COREY
Go find Mitch.
Pedro leaves obediently.
JESSICA takes another pull from the WHISKEY.
CARLOS is watches
attentively.
92
CARLOS
Take it easy. You got to go back and
watch Katie.
JESSICA
Don't remind me. Please.
CARLOS
You signed up for it.
JESSICA
It seemed like a good idea then! Give
some crappy advice every once in a while.
I didn't think it'd be this constant
torture, always wanting to do something,
go somewhere. I'm so sick of it.
CARLOS
Some big sister.
Jessica takes another drink and looks toward the ping pong table,
where Corey is manhandling Barnes, as Ping Pong Player 1, Ping Pong
Player 2, Barnes' Girlfriend and various Partygoers look on.
JIMMY has his CELL PHONE to his ear, waiting for voicemail, anxious.
94
JIMMY
Bobby, where the hell are you? I gotta
talk to you. Call me back right away.
Jimmy hangs up and takes a moment to think about his options.
COREY and BARNES are continue to play as PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING
PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES' GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS continue to
watch. In the background, JESSICA paces back and forth as CARLOS
sits on the ground indian-style watching the Partygoers on the back
porch. Carlos takes a shot of WHISKEY.
EMILY stands against the garage door, keeping to herself.
PEDRO and MITCH make their way into the back yard towards the ping
pong table. PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES'
GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS are gathered around COREY and
BARNES. Corey functions mechanically - his mind is not on the game.
Barnes is openly frustrated as Corey finishes him off.
BARNES
One more.
PING PONG PLAYER 2
(reaching for Barnes'
RACKET)
Let someone else play, Barnes.
BARNES
(to Ping Pong Player 2)
You guys suck - he'll be at the table all
night.
PING PONG PLAYER 1
So let him beat someone else.
Corey notices Mitch standing next to Pedro.
COREY
You're Mitch?
MITCH
Nice ta meet ya.
97
COREY
(tossing his RACKET to
other side the table in
front of Ping Pong Player
2)
Follow me.
Corey heads toward the Mustang, and Pedro and Mitch follow.
PING PONG PLAYER 2
(wanting to play Corey)
Where you going Becker?
EMILY is standing with her back to the garage door talking to MALE
PARTYGOER 1, an average size boy about Corey's age.
MALE PARTYGOER 1
How come I haven't seen you before?
Did
you go to Athens?
EMILY
I still go there. I'm a freshman.
MALE PARTYGOER 1
Really? I graduated last year.
You know
anyone my year?
EMILY
My brother.
Corey.
Becker.
MALE PARTYGOER 1
Oh yeah, I know Becker. He dropped out
our senior year, though. He's your bro?
EMILY
Unfortunately.
MALE PARTYGOER 1
Yeah, he's kind of a loser.
99
EMILY
(defending her brother)
So what are you?
Changing the subject, Male Partygoer 1 pulls a couple of white
TABLETS out of his pocket.
MALE PARTYGOER 1
Ever try this?
EMILY
Yeah...
Male Partygoer 1 hands a Tablet to Emily, but she waits to see how
Male Partygoer 1 take it, which he does by biting it in half and
chasing it with his DRINK. Emily takes Male Partygoer 1's Drink and
does the same.
COREY and MITCH barter over the Mustang, though Mitch seems more
interested in his BEER than the car. PEDRO is putting the last
touches on putting on the NEW TIRE. He picks the FLAT TIRE up and
tosses it in the trunk.
COREY
It's a good car.
MITCH
It's alright. I'd have to ask Jeremy.
What do you want for it?
COREY
Make an offer.
MITCH
Twelve hundred.
COREY
Twelve hundred! That's nothing!
MITCH
Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's
gotta do with it. It's not like he can
just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a
go.
PEDRO
Coo, we got thrown outta our apartment!
We need more money!
MITCH
Steal some more cars.
I'll see what I can
do.
Mitch polishes off his Beer and holds the empty cup up.
101
MITCH (CONT'D)
You want another?
AARON and TROY step out onto the back porch and spot JESSICA and
CARLOS. Upon seeing them, Carlos stands straight up.
CARLOS
Aaron's here.
Jessica, still pacing, stops in her tracks and turns around beside
Carlos. It's too late to gracefully exit, so Carlos stands there
frozen. Jessica does not seem afraid.
Aaron and Troy approach.
It's clear Troy doesn't really want to be
there.
AARON
(to Carlos)
Hey guy.
CARLOS
Hey.
AARON
You like talking to my girl?
CARLOS
Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'.
AARON
No?
Just friends?
CARLOS
Yeah.
AARON
What's the matter, don't like her that
way?
Carlos painfully does not answer. Jessica, unfazed, takes another
hit of WHISKEY. Jessica is confident because of the booze and
because of Carter's promise. Jessica and Aaron begin arguing in
calm "I'm above this" mannerisms.
AARON (CONT'D)
(to Carlos)
Go 'head, take her home. Fuck 'er brains
out. She'll give you a little surprise.
Carlos simply stands there, ashamed of his inability to act.
102
JESSICA
Fuck you, I'm clean. You're the cheatin'
asshole with bumps on your cock.
AARON
(to Troy)
Hold this.
Aaron hands his beer to Troy and then grabs the Whiskey Jessica is
holding. Jessica flinches as if afraid Aaron would hit her.
AARON (CONT'D)
Better wipe this off good. You never
know.
Aaron uses his shirt to vigorously rub the mouth of the bottle
before taking a long pull. The Whiskey is almost gone. Jessica
grabs back the Whiskey, wipes it off as Aaron did, and polishes it
off.
AARON (CONT'D)
You're good at that. You ready yet to go
bang some dude? Maybe Carlos here?
JESSICA
Fuck you. I'm going to get Carter, and
he's gonna kick your ass.
AARON
Carter ain't gonna kick shit.
JESSICA
We'll see, right?
Jessica moves to leave, but Aaron grabs her arm.
AARON
Hold on a minute ...
Jessica smashes the bottle over Aaron's head, knocking Aaron to the
floor in a daze.
JESSICA
That's for the pepper spray, asshole!
The PARTYGOERS in the back yard are now fixed on Jessica and Aaron.
CARTER runs over, holding his CIGAR and a BEER. BERUBI is behind
Carter, eager for a fight.
CARTER
What's goin' on?
TROY
She smashed a whiskey bottle over his
head.
103
JESSICA
He grabbed me! I'm not gonna sit and wait
until he hits me again! He can just keep
his fuckin' hands off me!
CARTER
He grabbed her?
Troy shrugs his shoulders.
TROY
I guess so.
It wasn't a big deal.
AARON
(recovering, to Jessica)
You're dead.
JESSICA
See?
CARTER
Jess, you hit him with a bottle?
JESSICA
Before he fucking hit me!
AARON
(to Carter)
Look, I ain't got no problem with you.
CARTER
Fine. You touch her, and I promised her
I'd beat the livin' piss outta you. I'll
do it. Lay off.
Aaron sits up against a tree, his hands to his head. Carter starts
to leave. Carlos feels even more ashamed that Carter stepped in and
did something that Carlos did not have the courage to do himself.
BERUBI
(to Aaron)
You're lucky.
Jessica grabs Carter by the shirt.
JESSICA
Carter, what the hell?!
You said you were
gonna kick his ass!
CARTER
I said I would step in if he hit you, and
he's not gonna hit you.
104
JESSICA
This is fuckin' bullshit!
Jessica winds up and stomps Aaron in the groin.
Aaron growls in
pain and doubles over.
TROY
(in awe of Jessica's
ferociousness)
Woe, dude.
CARTER
(to Jessica)
Jessica! What the fuck are you doing?!
JESSICA
If you're not man enough to do what you
said, I will!
CARTER
Jess, I'm not gettin' into this! I'm
sicka' this bullshit with you! You bring
this shit on yourself!
(to Aaron)
Don't touch her.
Carter leaves, followed by Berubi.
Jessica watches them leave.
She
turns down to Aaron.
JESSICA
You know what? I don't need Carter.
What're you gonna do, tough guy?
AARON
(still recovering)
Why don't you give me a minute and see?
JESSICA
Fuck you, you had your minute.
Jessica storms toward Carlos' CAR, and Carlos follows.
JESSICA storms through the yard toward Carlos' CAR.
CARLOS is right
behind.
JESSICA
Where'd we park?
CARLOS
Over here.
Carlos begins walking over to his CAR, and Jessica walks alongside.
Jessica is clearly drunk. Passing by a now high EMILY backed up
against a tree staring off into nowhere as MALE PARTYGOER 1 kisses
her neck, they arrive at Carlos' Car. Carlos walks over to the
driver-side door, but Jessica walks immediately over to the trunk.
CARLOS (CONT'D)
What are you doing? Get in.
JESSICA
Open the trunk.
CARLOS
Jess, let's get out of here.
JESSICA
I want your bat.
CARLOS
Screw that.
JESSICA
I'm gonna finish what I started.
I'm
gonna knock his teeth out.
CARLOS
Let's just go home.
JESSICA
Carlos, open the trunk!
110
Carlos grudgingly obeys. He walks back to the trunk and inserts his
KEY, then lifts up. Jessica reaches in and grabs a wooden baseball
BAT. She shuts the trunk and looks over to the house.
AARON walks through Carter's front door and steps onto the porch,
TROY right behind. Aaron is holding a bag of FROZEN VEGETABLES to
his head in the area where Jessica hit him with the whiskey bottle.
He spots Carlos and Jessica, and walks deliberately toward them.
CARLOS
Get in the car.
JESSICA
I'm staying, and so are you, so shut up.
Carlos swallows his pride, too yellow to push the point. Aaron
moves toward Jessica very quickly, but a look at the bat Jessica is
holding makes Aaron keep his distance.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
What's the matter? Aren't you gonna put
me in my place?
AARON
(calming down)
Why don't you put that down.
JESSICA
Because I'm gonna use it to bash your head
in.
AARON
You really want to do that?
JESSICA
You really wanna make me?
AARON
You're gonna do what you're gonna do, like
always.
JESSICA
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
AARON
Let me show you something.
Can I show
you?
JESSICA
What?
111
AARON
(inching closer to
Jessica and beginning to
loosen his pants)
I just wanna show you something.
Jessica stands back and holds the bat in a cocked position.
JESSICA
No more 'a this shit, Aaron. Just stand
back there. I'll bash you with this, I
swear.
Aaron drops the Frozen Vegetables to the ground and loosens his
pants.
AARON
Look, just hold on. I wanna show you
this. I got it a little while ago, for
your birthday.
Aaron lowers the left side of his pants to reveal a scarring TATTOO,
which is placed above and to the side of his groin. Jessica looks
closer. Troy, uncomfortable and not wanting to be there, lights up
another CIGARETTE.
AARON (CONT'D)
Can you see it?
JESSICA
What the hell is it?
AARON
It's J. H. C. I got it for your birthday.
JESSICA
(not knowing what to say)
Bullshit.
AARON
Will you come closer and look?
Troy, tell
her.
TROY
(to Jessica)
It's your initials.
I told him it was
stupid.
Jessica lowers the Bat and walks cautiously up to Aaron. She
attempts to read the Tattoo, which is difficult because of the low
light and the scarring.
AARON
You like it, don't you?
I knew you would.
112
JESSICA
You're an idiot.
AARON
I know.
Jessica touches the Tattoo.
JESSICA
Does that hurt?
AARON
No.
Try whacking it with the bat.
Jessica laughs as Aaron smiles. Troy is bored. Carlos is
miserable. Jessica stands up in front of Aaron, holding the Bat
loosely by her side, unsure of what to do. Aaron gently grabs
Jessica around the elbows and pulls her close. He puts his arms
around her and hugs her loosely.
AARON (CONT'D)
Can we just forget about this?
JESSICA
Yes.
Aaron hugs Jessica tightly as she drops the Bat and hugs back.
AARON
Happy birthday.
JESSICA
Thank you.
EMILY, her back up against a tree, continues making out with an
aggressive MALE PARTYGOER 1. As MALE PARTYGOER 1 comes up for air,
we see that he has a hand down Emily's pants, fingering her.
Emily's mind is somewhere else.
Emily snaps back to reality and removes Male Partygoer 1's hand and
pushes him away from her - she won't become another slut in a town
full of them.
MALE PARTYGOER 1
Hey, what's wrong?
Emily makes for the front door and into the house.
MITCH has refilled his BEER and patiently waits for a counteroffer
from COREY.
113
COREY
How about two thousand even?
Impatient with the proceedings, PEDRO walks over to the passenger
door of the Mustang, swings it open, and leans inside, struggling a
bit.
MITCH
Can't do it.
COREY
Why not?
MITCH
It's not economically...
(searching for the word)
Good, right, sound, whatever.
Pedro reappears from the backseat, holding an expensive STEREO.
PEDRO
Okay, give us two thousand and I give you
this nice stereo for free.
MITCH
Where the hell you get that?
COREY
Yeah, what the hell is that?!
PEDRO
(to Mitch)
It was in the car.
MITCH
I don't want a stereo.
PEDRO
You can have it for free, mehn.
MITCH
Where's the speakers?
PEDRO
In the back.
Corey walks over, opens the door and looks in the back.
His gaze
falls upon an item on the floor in the back seat area.
PEDRO (CONT'D)
(O.S.)
This stereo's a motherfucker, mehn, I'm
telling you. I was gonna keep it myself.
114
Corey pulls out from the back seat of the Mustang holding a large
red and blue POLICE LIGHT. He is dumbfounded. Corey looks to Pedro
for an explanation.
PEDRO (CONT'D)
What's that?
COREY
I thought you'd tell me!
MITCH
It looks like police cherries.
COREY
It can't be.
MITCH
Look fellas, I'd like to help you out, but
I'm not into buying stolen cop cars. It
don't seem right somehow.
Corey and Pedro struggle for an explanation, but are left
speechless.
JESSICA and AARON are leaning against a random partygoer's CAR.
They look very calm.
JESSICA
I didn't cheat.
AARON
Fine, you say so, fine.
JESSICA
That's it?
AARON
Well what the hell can I do? There's
nothin'. I got your goddam initials
tattoo'd next to my balls.
JESSICA
It was a stupid thing to do.
AARON
You don't like it?!
JESSICA
Well of course I like it!
But what if we
break up?
115
AARON
Yeah, I thought about that.
I'll say it's
for Jesus H. Christ.
JESSICA
Great. Then you could start going to
church.
Two POLICE CARS pull onto the lawn to break up the party, both cars
flashing their red and blue lights. TROY approaches Jessica and
Aaron.
TROY
Cops're here. I'm goin'.
AARON
(to Jessica)
You need a lift?
JESSICA
Okay.
COREY gets out of the truck, hands in the air. POLICE OFFICER 1
HANDCUFFS PEDRO. POLICE OFFICER 2 takes out his HANDCUFFS, spins
Corey around by his arm, and throws him roughly against the tow
truck, cuffing his hands behind his back. In the background, MITCH
quietly places the stereo on the ground and begins walking
indiscreetly toward the street.
POLICE OFFICER 1 is using one hand to hold onto PEDRO, still
HANDCUFFED, by his upper arm, and the other hand to unlock and open
the rear driver side door of his POLICE CAR. POLICE OFFICER 2
watches as he keeps hold of COREY by his HANDCUFFS.
POLICE OFFICER 2
(to Police Officer 1)
Holy shit, you hear that?
The two officers hasten their actions. Police Officer 1 lowers
Pedro into the Police Car, then moves to the front seat of the
vehicle and grabs the C.B.
POLICE OFFICER 1
This is Unit one five seven. Shot fired
at 15 Saddlebrook. Repeat, shot fired at
15 Saddlebrook. Request backup
immediately.
DEREK walks up the steps onto the back porch as PARTYGOERS move out
of the house away from the sound of the gunshot. He notices POLICE
OFFICER 2 behind him.
DEREK
You call that in?
POLICE OFFICER 2
(moving up the porch and
into the house)
We should get everybody out of the house.
HEATHER (O.S.)
(friendly)
Derek?
Derek and Police Officer 2 turn to see HEATHER walking onto the back
porch from the kitchen.
DEREK
Heather, go home. This is gonna get-
Heather interrupts Derek's statement with a swift, unexpected knee
to Derek's groin. Derek doubles over, and Heather grabs him by the
hair.
POLICE OFFICER 2
Hey!
Police Officer 2 shoves Heather to the ground, grabs Derek's
HANDCUFFS, and cuffs her hands behind her. Derek is still stunned
from the assault.
POLICE OFFICER 2 (CONT'D)
Derek, you alright?
ALLISON, who had been standing back watching the assault, approaches
Heather, who is getting up onto her knees. Allison gets on her
knees and hugs Heather, who cannot hug back because of the
handcuffs. Allison is bawling.
ALLISON
I'm so sorry, Heather, I'm so sorry.
Heather is shutting her eyes extremely tightly, struggling not to
cry. She does not attempt to pull away from Allison's tight
embrace.
120
Most of the PARTYGOERS are clearing out of the house moving toward
their cars, but some of the more curious STRAGGLERS are gathering
around on the back porch, wondering what happened. POLICE OFFICER 1
is encouraging everyone to leave.
POLICE OFFICER 1
Everybody clear outta here.
FEMALE PARTYGOER 2
There was a gunshot.
FEMALE PARTYGOER 3
(pointing back toward the
bedrooms)
Over there.
POLICE OFFICER 1
We've got it. Clear outta here.
Police Officer 1 enters the house, passing CARLOS among the crowd
making it's way out of the house. He walks across the back yard
with his KEYS in his hand. He glances down at his shoes a moment as
he spots JESSICA, AARON and TROY approaching. JIMMY enters and
moves across the frame toward his PIECE-OF-SHIT parked in the rear
of the back yard.
122
JESSICA
(to Carlos)
Hey. What happened in there?
CARLOS
I just heard a gunshot and everybody's
jettin'. Probably more cops'll be here
soon.
(regarding Aaron)
Are you goin' with him?
JESSICA
Yeah.
TROY
C'mon, let's get outta here.
JESSICA
(to Carlos)
Are you alright? You okay to drive?
CARLOS
(weakly)
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'm fine, I mean.
I'll see you.
JESSICA
Call me tomorrow.
Carlos walks off toward his CAR, and Jessica, Aaron and Troy walk
toward Troy's CAR.
STRAGGLERS are heading out the front door, joining the other
PARTYGOERS in looking for their cars.
STRAGGLERS
are heading out the back door, joining the other
PARTYGOERS
in looking for their cars, and for their friends. A few
Partygoers
remain continue to loiter in groups scattered sparsely
throughout
the yard.
124
HEATHER is seated in the back of a POLICE CAR with her hands cuffed
behind her back.
COREY and PEDRO are seated in the back of the POLICE CAR. Corey
looks over at Pedro- the look of foolish optimism usually present on
Pedro's face has vanished. He looks down at the floor of the Police
Car.
Through the side window of the Police Car we see JESSICA, AARON, and
TROY and climbing into Troy's CAR. Troy is handing Aaron his KEYS
before climbing into the back seat.
Aaron is behind the wheel sticking the Keys into the ignition.
Jessica is in the passenger seat looking through her PURSE for her
CIGARETTES. Troy sits in the back seat, spent.
JESSICA
I left my novel in Carlos' car.
125
AARON
You wanna get it?
JESSICA
I'll get it tomorrow.
We should just get
out of here.
AARON
Alright.
Aaron starts the car as Jessica lights her Cigarette. Without
warning, as Jessica takes a drag, Aaron punches Jessica square in
the jaw. The lit Cigarette flies out of Jessica's mouth, and
Jessica falls out of view. Aaron reaches down, grabs the Cigarette
and puts it in his mouth, still angry.
He slowly pulls the car out of the back yard and toward the street,
passing Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT parked in the opposite direction.
The engine is still off. JIMMY is sitting still behind the wheel,
hands down in his lap, staring straight ahead. PULL IN and HOLD on
Jimmy.
ESTABLISHING SHOT with the house IN FOCUS in the background. A few
STRAGGLERS remain in the backyard, smoking cigarettes, gossiping,
staring back at the house, etc. RACK FOCUS to a group of stragglers
in the foreground to the right of the frame, STRAGGLER 1 and
STRAGGLER 2 smoking CIGARETTES among them. Straggler 2 flicks his
Cigarette and leads all of the group except Straggler 1 frame left
toward the street. Straggler 1 glances back at the house before
taking a final puff of his Cigarette. He stomps it out under his
foot and exits frame left after his buddies. HOLD on the house OUT
OF FOCUS.
FADE OUT:
THE END
