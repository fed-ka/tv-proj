GEORGE TWISP, 41, scruffy and greying, waters the foliage
outside the house with a high powered hose.
NICK (V.O.)
Dad is a copywriter for
agricultural magazines.
In the drive, Nick slaves over the duty of washing the rims
of his dad's BMW 325i.
NICK (V.O.)
He'd like to own a more prestigious
model of BMW, but, as he often
reminds me, he is burdened with
crippling child support payments.
4.
Nick glances up and spots LACEY, 20, coming up the drive
toward him in a weensy bikini. Her body has more outcroppings
than the coastline of Albania.
She continues past him and embraces George.
NICK (V.O.)
Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette. She
is twenty and a recently minted
alumna of Stanfort.
Super:
(Stanfort Institute of Cosmetology)
George and Lacey exchange saliva shamelessly. Nick turns his
attention back to the Beamer.
As the making out becomes heated groping, George's grip on
the hose slackens.
Nick gets blindsided by the jet of water.
Nick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for
Jerry to open the passenger door for her.
NICK (V.O.)
After spending twelve years with
Dad, Mom has had a string of
lovers, none of whom she has asked
me to approve.
Jerry fails to notice Estelle waiting and instead just climbs
in and chugs his beer. Estelle appears mildly disappointed
before opening the door herself.
NICK (V.O.)
I'm starting to think her
boyfriends are like U.S.
Presidents.
As Jerry pulls out, he tosses his beer bottle in the
direction of the trash can at the end of the drive.
NICK (V.O.)
Just when you think they can't get
any worse...
He misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement, but Jerry
drives off anyway.
NICK (V.O.)
...she manages to find God's
Perfect Asshole.
In the clearing, a UC JOCK stands behind his ASIAN
GIRLFRIEND, kissing her neck and removing her clothes.
NICK (V.O.)
I hope you have a good reason.
Reveal Nick and his friend LEFTY, 16, belly down in the grass
overlooking the clearing. Lefty watches the copulating couple
with a pair of binoculars.
LEFTY
My sister said she saw Millie
Filbert holding hands with some
college guy.
NICK
I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister
is just waging psychological
warfare.
LEFTY
Well it's working. What am I gonna
do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think
about Millie so much my balls ache.
NICK
Maybe your just not wacking off
enough.
As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick
and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants.
As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance...
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
The couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air.
LEFTY (O.S.)
So, I've been taping my pecker to
my right leg at night.
NICK (V.O.)
In case you haven't heard, Lefty's
erect member takes a dramatic turn
midway up the shaft.
9.
LEFTY (O.S.)
Then I look at this issue of Better
Homes and Gardens that has a girl
that looks just like Millie until
it gets good and hard. I think it's
starting to straighten out.
NICK
Why don't you just have your
parents take you to the dick
doctor?
LEFTY (O.S.)
Are you kidding? It would kill them
to know that I even get hard-ons.
NICK
Still, you might want to get it
fixed before asking Millie out.
LEFTY (O.S.)
True. What if I shove it up the
wrong hole?
Nick gives a dubious glance in Lefty's direction.
NICK (V.O.)
Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy
is somewhat tenuous; he imagines
there are orifices galore down
there.
The Lincoln makes it's way upstate, and dips into the mist
covered hills of Ukiah.
They've pulled to a stop. Estelle stares in horror.
ESTELLE
Jerry...? You said it was a cabin.
In the back, Nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long,
green, turd of a trailer. Some concrete dwarves in the grass.
A dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio. A decrepit
picket fence with a sign that reads: MY GREEN HAVEN.
Estelle looks as if she's about to cry. Jerry puts his arm
around her.
JERRY
C'mon Estelle. It's real cute on
the inside.
An old crone, MRS. SAUNDERS, makes her way up the walk. She
gets to the door of My Green Haven and bangs on the screen.
Nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe, toiletries in
one hand, towel in the other. He heads off down the wooded
path.
The serene melodies of rousing HYMNS float from the well-
attended congregation in the meeting hall.
WE TRACK across the trees as Nick makes his way down the
path. He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy
overhead. He glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop.
A grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the
blue of Clear Lake. A chestnut haired SHEENI SAUNDERS stands
facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in
her hands. The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just
enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath.
15.
Light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor
like something out of a Franois Boucher painting.
NICK (V.O.)
The moment I see her I know the
Gods, while having cruelly endowed
me with imperfect posture and pussy
postponing pimples, had put me here
for a purpose. My heart palpitates.
My mind races. I get an instant
T.E.
Super:
(Thundering Erection)
Sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder
at him. Nick just stares. She gives an amused smile, almost
flirtatious. Nick grins back.
SHEENI
Your robe is open.
Nick looks down. He pulls the robe closed, scowls, and goes
into a flustered march down the path.
Nick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence.
Estelle and Sheeni squat on the patio steps.
SHEENI
Hel-lo, Excitable Boy.
ESTELLE
Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders.
NICK
Hello.
ESTELLE
Sheeni needs to go to the grocery
store. I've offered her your help
in carrying her bags.
Nick regards Sheeni and her mischievous smirk.
16.
NICK
Thanks a pantsful.
A dusty road. Nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag. He
watches as Sheeni works on a Popsicle. Full lips that cry out
to be kissed.
NICK
You don't have to go to services?
SHEENI
No. Much to the consternation of my
fanatical parents I have converted
to atheism. Fortunately my brother,
Paul, paved the way for such
transgressions.
NICK
Paul is an atheist too?
SHEENI
Buddhist, I believe, though we have
not seen him in some time. I myself
am looking forward to being free of
parental bondage.
NICK
Likewise.
SHEENI
Well, your mother seems very nice,
though your father I think might be
rather dim.
NICK
Jerry and I share no blood links of
any kind.
As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of HYMNS in
chorus.
NICK
Sounds rather zealous.
SHEENI
Yes, even though I am no longer a
believer I always found the
services wonderfully aerobic.
NICK
You could say the same thing about
sex.
Sheeni stops. She looks at Nick intently.
17.
SHEENI
Nick, are you going to turn out
like all the other young men and
have nothing on your mind except
carnal pleasures?
NICK
I hardly ever think about sex.
SHEENI
Really? I think about it all the
time. It's the hormones at work,
you know.
She resumes walking. Nick follows her with confusion.
They regard the two story Pacemaker mobile home.
NICK
Wow. A second floor.
SHEENI
Yes. Father bought it so that he
could look down upon the world. For
him, Christian humility has always
been a struggle.
Sheeni relieves him of the watermelon.
SHEENI
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Nick.
She trudges down the slate path to the home.
NICK
Sheeni? Do you want to come to the
beach with me?
She turns around. Gives a little smirk.
SHEENI
What a thoughtful invitation. I'd
love to, Nick. Wait for me in the
living room.
Sheeni and Nick lay on their backs on the blue beach blanket,
reading their respective books. Nick watches her turning
pages and making notes in the margins. She hands him her
tanning lotion.
SHEENI
Would you mind applying this to my
exposed areas?
NICK
Not at all.
19.
She rolls over onto her stomach, exposing her exquisite back.
Nick straddles her, hands shaking as he smooths sweet oils
into her tanned flesh.
Flashing super:
Thundering Erection
SHEENI
My, you get turned on easily.
Nick's hands freeze.
SHEENI
Oh, don't stop, Nick. We all have
our hormones to deal with. Girls
are fortunate in that it doesn't
show. For all the world knows, my
vagina could be moist with desire
as we speak.
NICK
Is it?
SHEENI
That's none of your business, I'm
sure. Shall you do my front too?
NICK
I'm up for it.
She rolls over onto her back, her young breasts straining up
against the yellow spandex.
SHEENI
I hope you don't find it too
stimulating, Nick.
NICK
I'm coping.
He starts in on her flawless legs, gliding on the oil all the
way within a finger's reach of her sweet apex.
With each daring pass, he comes closer to that final split.
Finally the hand swerves too late, and lightly grazes the
softly yielding vee.
SHEENI
Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the
top now.
Nick moves up, lubricating her arms, shoulders and neck. He
smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills.
SHEENI
Thanks, Nick.
20.
She rolls back onto her stomach with finality and goes back
to her book. Nick hovers above her a moment, then painfully
returns to his own reading.
They make their way down the path. Nick totes the beach bag.
SHEENI
Breathless is one of my favorite
films, though it might be eclipsed
by Rebel Without a Cause. I often
wonder what American cinema would
be like today had Dean done more
than three.
Nick nods, and for a beat they trek on in silence. He glances
down at her hand and fumbles for it with his own.
SHEENI
Oh, Nick. You seem very nice. But
in fairness, I should tell you that
I have a boyfriend.
Nick becomes sickeningly pale.
NICK
What's his name?
SHEENI
Trent Preston.
NICK
What's he like?
SHEENI
Seventeen years of age, six-two,
fluent in French, plays the piano,
a champion swimmer, and writes
Futurist Percussive poetry.
They stop at the gate to the Saunders' home.
NICK
I'm not familiar with Futurist
Percussive poems.
SHEENI
I could recite one of Trent's if
you'd like.
NICK
Please do.
She takes a dramatic pause.
21.
SHEENI
RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down/
Safety net/ Hot! Hot! Hot!/ Void.
She gives a slightly amused smile at Nick's blank expression.
NICK (V.O.)
If that's poetry, I'm a turkey
scrotum.
A light comes on in the window.
Nick paces about back and forth in the yard.
NICK (V.O.)
3 AM. I decide I am too chicken for
any of the manly, violent means of
suicide. I shall swallow sleeping
pills. Where to get them, though?
22.
Sheeni leads the way up hill. Nick clutches his cramped
stomach with one hand, his journal in the other.
He watches the rhythmic movements of her ass through her
hiking shorts.
Nick and Sheeni peer over the edge of the cliff. The waters
of Clear Lake churn below.
NICK
Quite a drop.
SHEENI
Yes. Not to be morbid, but this
sight has been the chosen means of
at least three teen suicides.
NICK
Huh. Quite a hike just to end your
life.
SHEENI
Well, there is a road. But I agree.
Adolescents have a tendency toward
the over-dramatic.
Sheeni backs away. Nick stays, staring over the edge.
24.
Nick's eyes roll back as he relieves himself against a tree.
He shakes off the last of it and zips up.
He emerges from the woods only to find Sheeni reading his
journal. She looks up at his and smiles. The brazen sneak
isn't even embarrassed.
NICK
That's my journal!
SHEENI
Don't get so upset Nick. Though
your handwriting is egregious, you
have a fairly decent vocabulary.
Although, Trent is not an "affected
twit."
Nick snatches the journal out of her hands.
NICK
Those are my private thoughts and
are none of your business!
SHEENI
Nick?
NICK
What?
SHEENI
The lengths you say you are willing
to go to to win my heart, the
contemplation of suicide at the
thought of not having me...
(taking a sensual breath)
It all evokes a strong emotional
warmth in my breast.
Nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if
posing for a centerfold.
SHEENI
Did you mean it, Nickie?
A beat as he is lost in the ocean of her gaze before he
manages to gain his senses.
NICK
How would you like it if I read
your journal?
SHEENI
You can read it if you'd like.
25.
She hands it over. Nick squints at the writing.
NICK
It's in French.
SHEENI
A necessity for a child in a
household with prying Christian
parents.
NICK
What does it say?
SHEENI
Wouldn't you like to know. That
last passage would be of particular
interest to you.
Nick leaps on top of her, grabbing her thin wrists. She
squeals and giggles.
NICK
Spill it! I demand full disclosure!
SHEENI
Never!
They wrestle, perspiring, squirming bodies brushing together.
Flashing super:
Thundering Erection
They pause. He's got her arms pinned. She's on her back. He
hovers above her.
SHEENI
(softly chanting)
Nickie's got a hard-on.
Nick considers her expression.
SHEENI
You're still a virgin, I can tell.
Maybe that's why I like you.
A beat. She looks at him expectantly. Nick is at a loss.
SHEENI
Kiss me, you wienie.
Nick tentatively approaches her luscious mouth. Their noses
dodge successfully and their lips meet.
After a long moment, they break it off. Staring into each
other's eyes. Sheeni jumps up.
26.
SHEENI
Okay, lover. Break's over. Let's
go!
Nick lays in the grass a moment, watching after her.
Nick walks Sheeni to the gate. She turns around to face him.
NICK
When can I see you again?
SHEENI
Get up early tomorrow and you can
shower with me in the ladies room.
Five minutes to six. If you dare.
Nick grins with excitement.
Another perfect California summer dawn, a pale moon lingering
in the blue morning sky. Nick emerges from My Green Haven in
his robe. He starts off down the path.
The trailer park is relatively silent save for birds and the
distant sound of dogs barking.
27.
Nick approaches the shower building. As he nears, the sound
of water running can be heard from the ladies' side.
Estelle, Jerry, Nick, and a toothless old GEEZER whose gut
rivals Jerry's, all stare at a rusty RV that looks like it
might not make the trip back.
In the background, Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard.
29.
JERRY
What's your cash price?
GEEZER
I said in the ad. Thousand dollars
firm.
JERRY
Thousand, huh? That must be with a
guarantee.
GEEZER
As is, where she is.
JERRY
I don't know. Those rusty propane
tanks are a fire hazard. The roof
probably needs work. I couldn't go
above eight hundred.
The geezer ponders the bad news. Estelle shakes her head and
goes inside the RV to inspect.
ESTELLE (O.S.)
There are mouse droppings in all
the closets, Jerry.
GEEZER
I might take nine fifty.
JERRY
Nine hundred.
Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight. They all turn their
attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming
PUPPIES.
She brings one of them over.
SHEENI
Look, Nick!
She shows him the ugly little pug. Short droopy ears, a tiny,
batlike face.
NICK
Great.
SHEENI
(to the geezer)
How much?
GEEZER
Ten dollars.
Sheeni turns to Nick pleadingly. Nick fishes through his
wallet.
30.
NICK
All I have is a Subway card with
four stickers.
GEEZER
Sold.
NICK
No doubt close to the dog's actual
value.
SHEENI
Oh, thank you, Nickie!
She plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her
attention to the dog, who licks her face affectionately. Nick
looks on with appropriate jealousy.
SHEENI
I'm going to name him Albert.
(pronounced Al-bear)
GEEZER
That don't sound like any kind of
name for a dog.
SHEENI
(scowling defensively)
I'll have you know I've named him
after the deceased French writer,
Albert Camus. Author of L'Etranger
and other works of existential
brilliance.
The geezer looks to Nick with an expression of "I stand
corrected." Nick returns with a nod that says "You have no
idea."
Jerry hitches the trailer to the back of the Lincoln. Estelle
loads up the trunk.
ESTELLE
Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni.
It's time to hit the road.
Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert. He looks less than enthused
at the thought of sloppy-seconds. Finally Sheeni hands Nick
the dog.
Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat. Sheeni leans in
and gives him a peck on the cheek.
SHEENI
(whispering in his ear)
Don't forget, darling. Red wine and
Consumer Reports.
She smiles. They're the sexiest words Nick's ever heard.
He grabs her and kisses her deeply.
Jerry HONKS the horn and they break off.
The Lincoln and RV slow to a stop outside the home.
I/E. LINCOLN - DAY
They all stare at the empty space where the Chevy-Nova used
to be. Jerry gets a smirk of satisfaction.
JERRY
You see that, Babe. They caved.
Jerry backs the RV into the drive as Nick helps his mother
with her belongings and they enter the house. The RV scrapes
its way through a few overhanging tree branches before Jerry
decides it's parked.
There comes a woman's scream from inside the house.
A cab pulls up in front of the house and Nick's sister,
Joanie gets out of the back. She tips the driver, and as she
crosses the front yard, gawks at the RV sitting in the drive.
A BLOODCURDLING SCREAM rises up from the home.
Nick sprays the trailer in wide sweeping motions.
Joanie and Nick sun bathe in the lawn chairs. Estelle stands
over them.
ESTELLE
What the in God's name has gotten
into you?!? Jerry paid good money
for that trailer!
NICK
And just what makes you so sure it
was me?
ESTELLE
Who the hell else would write such
a thing?
Estelle gestures to the trailer, which we can see has been
defaced with the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE.
ESTELLE
And just how do you explain this?
She holds up a semi-nude Polaroid of Lacey.
NICK
That's Lacey.
ESTELLE
And just who the hell is Lacey?
NICK
Dad's girlfriend.
Estelle stares at the photo, face contorted by revulsion and
envy.
45.
ESTELLE
His girlfriend? What are you doing
with a picture like this of your
father's girlfriend?
JOANIE
C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have
pictures like that to...
ESTELLE
When I want your opinion on raising
my child, I'll ask for it.
(to Nick; morbidly
CURIOUS)
And what's this Lacey tart like?
NICK
Well, she likes fast cars and takes
a lot of naps with dad.
Super:
(True)
NICK
She likes to sit on Dad's lap while
he eats and blow in his ear.
Super:
(Not true)
NICK
And she calls him "Thunder Rod" and
he calls her "Sugar Puss."
Super:
(True; believe it or not)
At this point Estelle has turned bright red.
ESTELLE
You are confined to your room until
school starts, you sick pervert.
She stalks off. Joanie glances over at Nick with amusement.
NICK
I wish I was leaving with you
tonight.
JOANIE
Your day will come. I never thought
mine would, but it did. Was all
that stuff about Lacey and Dad made
up?
NICK
I wish. Did you really take a
posture class?
46.
JOANIE
Implants. I wanted them all my
life.
Intimidating PUNK MUSIC. School bus doors fold open and Nick
steps off. The MUSIC pounds from the boom box resting on the
hood of the Mustang GT where a pack of SKINHEADS follow Nick
with their eyes.
Nick walks past them, glancing over at the assembly of ASIAN
GANGSTERS glaring at him from their perch on the wall.
Nick walks Albert down the sidewalk. Lefty crosses the street
to him and they walk together.
NICK
Hey, Lefty. How's it hangin'?
LEFTY
You'll never believe who called me,
Nick. Millie Filbert!
NICK
What?!? Why?
LEFTY
I dunno. She just called and asked
if I wanted to hang out tonight. I
didn't want to ask why. I need to
find someplace for us to get it on.
Albert squats to poop in someone's yard. The boys pause to
wait for him.
51.
NICK
You can use my house if you want.
LEFTY
Really?
NICK
Sure. My Mom and Lance are going to
a movie and I'm planning on
stealing Jerry's trailer and
torching it in a parking lot, so
you'll have the whole house to
yourself.
LEFTY
Right on.
Albert finishes his business and they resume walking.
NICK
So where you headed anyway?
LEFTY
Dr. Browerly's office. My parents
are making me see a shrink now.
NICK
He asking lots of weird questions?
LEFTY
You bet your left nut he is! He
asked if I had any lustful thoughts
toward my sister.
NICK
What did you tell him?
LEFTY
I told him about beating off once
with her brassiere.
NICK
What did you tell him that for?
LEFTY
You don't know what it's like. I
think they release chemicals in
their office to make you tell the
truth.
NICK
Sounds like a professional. He must
be very expensive.
LEFTY
I wouldn't know. The bill goes to
your house.
52.
NICK
My mom is paying for your therapy?
LEFTY
I guess so. It was your cyclops I
was staring at.
NICK
Yes, but it was your idea.
LEFTY
That's true. Gee, maybe I am gay.
NICK
Don't be retarded. We were doing
research for our girlfriends.
LEFTY
Oh, right. I forgot. That's a
relief. So you'll leave the door
open?
NICK
Yeah, just don't blow your load on
my sheets.
LEFTY
Thanks a pantsful, Nick.
NICK
Don't mention it. See ya, Lefty.
NICK (V.O.)
The plan is simple.
Nick places two full cannisters of gasoline into the trunk of
the Lincoln.
Nick's behind the wheel, backing up the car.
NICK (V.O.)
Tow Jerry's trailer to a remote
parking lot in Berkeley and burn it
to the ground.
The hitch ball grinds under the trailer socket.
NICK (V.O.)
Thus evicting myself from my
mother's clutches and into the arms
of My One And Only Love.
Nick fires up the V-8 engine and shifts into drive, pulling
forward. He cuts across the lawn.
NICK (V.O.)
Franois wanted to torch the
trailer where it sits, but I've
convinced him a parking lot will
reduce the risk of collateral
damage.
The trailer clips the corner of the house. Chunks of stucco
fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes,
collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of
the home.
Nick guns it, and with a lurch the trailer splinters free. He
dodges the birch tree, but plows over the smaller Asian pear.
The Lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street,
the trailer weaving back and forth, smashing parked cars.
Nick hits the bump in the road right before the stop sign.
The car bottoms out. The trailer bounces up, coming
unhitched.
I/E. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY
Nick hits the gas and the Lincoln suddenly surges forward,
released from the great weight.
Nick smiles. Behind him, through the rear window, the trailer
can be seen receding into the distance. He glances into the
mirror and spots the trailer plunging down the hill.
Then he crashes into the Fiat parked in front of him at the
intersection. The gas tank on the Fiat cracks, spurting fuel
onto the pavement.
Nick leaps from the Lincoln and watches open-mouthed as the
vehicular ballet unfolds.
Down the hill - the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery
van and goes into a spin. The BOHEMIANS sipping espresso at
the outdoor caf look up to see the words GOD'S PERFECT
ASSHOLE bearing down on them.
The delivery van veers out of control. The Bohemians scatter.
The truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way
through the patio furniture and into the caf.
A geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood.
The trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy cross
street below.
KWOMP! Nick turns to see the still-restive Lincoln part from
the Fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner.
NICK
Oh no! I forgot to set the brake!
The DRIVER OF THE FIAT bolts after the accelerating Lincoln,
but as he realizes the futility, slows to a jog.
The driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake, and
desperately rolls out of the way of the Fiat.
MOTORISTS slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer
crosses four lanes of traffic. It jumps the curb crashing
into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop.
A cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection, just in
time to get clipped by the Lincoln.
The cop car goes into a tail spin, smashing into a chicken
transport. The flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom.
55.
The Lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom run,
thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked
building like a runaway express train.
The gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop
explodes, the trailer's two propane tanks going off like
bombs.
The Fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts apart,
sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down
on the spectators.
The blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken
fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill,
ending at Nick's feet.
Nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of
smoke billow into the sky, the geyser of water, the storm of
dazed chickens. He turns around and does his best to
inconspicuously walk OUT OF FRAME.
We find Nick waiting in the drive with a pile of suitcases
beside him.
LEFTY (O.S.)
Psst. Nick.
Nick finds Lefty lurking in the shrubs that divide his
mother's lawn from the neighbor's. He limps to his friend.
NICK
I was wondering what happened to
you. Did you get to blow your wad?
LEFTY
No. I did not get to blow my wad.
58.
NICK
Did you get interrupted?
LEFTY
No. Worse.
NICK
What's worse than being
interrupted?
LEFTY
Millie is a lesbian.
NICK
WHAT?!?
LEFTY
The only reason she wanted to hang
out with me is because she heard
that I showed you my slinky and
thought I was gay too.
NICK
Sorry, man. I didn't have a great
night either.
LEFTY
Well, I dunno what you're gonna do,
but I'm giving suicide serious
consideration this time.
NICK
Or you could just fake it and then
hide out in Ukiah with me. Then
later come back and maybe Millie
Filbert will boink you out of pity.
LEFTY
Hey, that's not a bad idea. Thanks
a pantsful, Nick.
A pair of headlights swing into the drive and Lefty ducks out
of sight. The headlights turn out to belong to George Twisp's
BMW.
The driver's side window rolls down to reveal Nick's dad.
Lacey leans over George's seat to wave at Nick through the
window and show him some of her cleavage.
LACEY
Hiya, Nick!
NICK
Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad.
The trunk pops open.
59.
NICK
Is there any way I could sit up
front with Lacey, Dad? Mom's
boyfriend beat me pretty badly.
GEORGE
Sorry, Nick. In this car, faggots
get the back seat.
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT
Nick is in the back, crowded in by his belongings and Albert.
They ride in tense silence until they pass the sight of the
fire, where FIRE FIGHTERS sift through the ash.
GEORGE
My God. Look what you've done.
Lacey turns to look at Nick over the seat. They share a
smile.
Morning peers over the distant hills.
Nick reaches the door and gently knocks. But it's Sheeni's
ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at Nick
sternly.
NICK
Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available?
MR. SAUNDERS
She most certainly is not. As a
matter of fact, we've banned you
from her life, Nick Twisp.
60.
NICK
Excuse me?
MR. SAUNDERS
Trent Preston informed us that not
only were you moving here to pursue
my daughter, but that you're not
even mentally-handicapped, and thus
molested my wife in the shower of
sound mind and body.
NICK
That rat-fink-fuck!
MR. SAUNDERS
You watch your language. This is a
Christian home. We're sending
Sheeni to Les cole des Arts and
Literatures in Santa Cruz.
NICK
Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable
without me. We're in love.
The ogre snorts in condescending amusement.
MR. SAUNDERS
Then I guess it's a good thing
Trent is going there too. She'll
have someone to console her.
And with that, Mr. Saunders slams the door so hard in Nick's
face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and
forth.
Nick makes his way past the arbor, crestfallen. Sheeni
emerges from the shadows in a hooded sweatshirt over a
lavender dress.
SHEENI
Nick! Oh, Nick!
Nick lights up at the sight of her and they embrace. They
kiss passionately. He works his way to her neck and starts to
reach under the sweatshirt.
SHEENI
I had to sneak away just to see
you.
NICK
That's okay. I had to burn down
half of Berkley.
61.
SHEENI
That was you? Nick, are you out of
your mind?
NICK
I felt a grand gesture was
required, darling.
Sheeni's expression indicates that she is touched, but it
turns to troubled.
SHEENI
Nick, Trent betrayed us.
NICK
Franois will kill him later.
SHEENI
Who's Franois?
NICK
Nevermind. The point is we must
elope.
Sheeni takes a step back at the notion.
SHEENI
I don't know, Nick. I do love you,
but I don't want to spend the rest
of our lives on the run.
NICK
It's a small price to pay.
She takes another step back.
SHEENI
I... I can't, Nick.
NICK
What?!? But, Sheeni. I just don't
get it. I'm here. Albert's here
too.
SHEENI
I know, Nick, and I've been longing
for you so. But we'll just have to
find another way. The car is
already packed.
Nick nods glumly and Sheeni seems overcome with remorse.
SHEENI
Nick Twisp, I will not allow you to
accept defeat so easily!
(MORE)
62.
SHEENI (cont'd)
When the time is right, you must
make your way to Santa Cruz. And
then we will make love.
Nick lifts his gaze with renewed determination.
NICK
Or we could consummate here in the
woods.
SHEENI
Did you bring the consumer reports?
Nick just blinks blankly.
SHEENI
Then it will have to be Santa Cruz.
I really must go now, darling.
NICK
Well... Goodbye, Sheeni. I love
you.
SHEENI
I love you too. Squeeze darling
Albert for me.
She pulls her hood over her head. Nick watches wistfully as
she slips away into the forest.
NICK (V.O.)
I have endured a five million
dollar beating for nothing.
(BEAT)
I have been stabbed. Stabbed in the
back.
Nick comes up the dusty road toting his backpack.
On the porch of the Saunders' home, a handsome but somewhat
unkempt PAUL SAUNDERS, mid-twenties, blows cool jazz on a
beat-up trumpet.
PAUL
Hey, Nick. I'm Paul, Sheeni's
brother.
Nick comes up the path to meet him.
NICK
Hello, Paul. How did you know my
name?
PAUL
We've met.
NICK
No we haven't.
PAUL
In a previous life.
NICK
Oh.
Paul begins rolling a joint.
PAUL
Nice fire in Berkeley.
64.
NICK
Did Sheeni tell you that was me?
PAUL
She didn't have to.
NICK
Why? Was I an arsonist in a
previous life?
PAUL
No. But Sheeni was.
NICK
My God. What did she burn?
PAUL
Men. Men and boys.
Paul hands the joint out to Nick. He regards it dubiously.
Nick emerges from the home. He makes his way down the road.
He stops at the familiar sight of My Green Haven. He gets an
amused smile and sighs with nostalgia.
The front door of the trailer opens and Lefty emerges. Nick
furrows his brow in confusion as Lefty locks the door and
comes down the path.
NICK
Lefty?
LEFTY
Oh. Hey, Nick!
NICK
Lefty, what are you doing here?
LEFTY
I live here. The guy's only
charging me fifty in cash a month.
NICK
I mean, what are you doing in town?
LEFTY
I did what you told me, Nick. I
threw my backpack off the pier and
reported my own suicide. I even
left a note.
NICK
Wow, Lefty, I'm kinda impressed.
Faking your suicide is pretty
ballsy.
Lefty joins Nick in his walk down the road.
LEFTY
So where you headed?
68.
NICK
Redwood High School.
LEFTY
Can I come?
NICK
Why would you want to go to school
if you didn't have to?
LEFTY
It's weird, Nick, but school seems
like a pretty fun place to hang out
once you get rid of classes and
homework.
NICK
I can see this stunt really has
liberated your mind.
LEFTY
I'm telling you, Nick: killing
myself was the best thing that ever
happened to me.
The distant figure on the windsurf board can only be Trent.
71.
SHEENI (V.O.)
Trent has taken up windsurfing and
has been designated target number
one by all the girls. I am still
very angry at him for the betrayal
but he claims he wants to mend our
friendship.
The figure falls into the surf and the crowd of watching
BIKINI-CLAD GIRLS gasp in horror.
SHEENI (V.O.)
I guess we shall see.
WE FLY through the forest to keep up with the Beamer.
The BMW passes cars on the Golden Gate Bridge.
The Beamer navigates the winding curves of the highway where
green hills meet the Pacific Ocean.
The car pulls to a stop in the parking lot, the school
looming beyond, slightly obfuscated by a light drizzle. The
music cuts out with the engine.
The grouping of BOYS part as we move through them. Finally,
we reach the center of their attention...
Sheeni, Taggarty, and Heather standing together in their
coats.
SHEENI
Nickie?
Nick, Vijay, and Lefty are noticeably shorter than the older
boys around them.
NICK
Hello, Sheeni.
(to Taggarty and Heather)
Hi, I'm Nick.
TAGGARTY
Oh. So you're Nick.
HEATHER
We've heard so much about you.
NICK
And this is Vijay. And this is
Lefty. Lefty goes to USC.
74.
LEFTY
And I'm not gay.
SHEENI
Nick, I knew you'd come!
Sheeni glances over at the disapproving MATRON. She leans in
close.
SHEENI
...but you must wait in the car
until we can sneak you in.
Nick nods in understanding.
The school SECURITY VAN crawls by in the background, a
searchlight sweeping the grounds.
The moment it is out of sight, Nick darts from the bushes of
the girls' dorm and races across the campus to the boys'
dorm.
The security van continues to make its rounds. We find Nick
crouching behind the steps to the boys dorm.
He pulls the hood of his windbreaker over his head and takes
a deep breath.
As the searchlight passes by, he makes a break for it.
TRACK with Nick as he darts from one form of cover to the
next, perhaps accompanied by the imagined sounds of mortar
blasts and machine gun turret fire.
79.
At long last he reaches the girls' dorm undetected.
The boys come out of the front door of the dormitory, the
matron, flanked by SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS, hot on their
heels. The girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves,
cheering the boys' escape.
Vijay's pants fall to his ankles, tripping him up.
Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again
as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the
Vietnamese Army.
They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds. Nick gets
in first. Lefty dives through the back window, legs kicking.
Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team
catches up to them. The authorities bang on the windows as
Nick peels out.
INDIAN POP blares from the car. They speed off into the
night.
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT
Lefty lets out a holler of joy.
LEFTY
I did it three times! Two long ones
and a quickie.
NICK
Great. Just great. How about you,
Vijay?
VIJAY
It was difficult to tell with that
condom, Nick. Why did you buy such
thick ones?
NICK
That brand was top-rated by
Consumers.
83.
VIJAY
Well, she's safe. No organism could
penetrate those walls.
NICK
You think the girls are in trouble?
VIJAY
They will likely notify their
parents. Perhaps even expel them.
NICK
That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni
will have to come back to Ukiah.
The car sputters. Nick's eyes go to the gas gauge.
The rain is coming down again. Nick shivers in his underwear.
Vijay isn't in much more and Lefty's sheet is drenched.
VIJAY
What will we do?
NICK
Well, we can't stay in the car.
Sooner or later Highway Patrol is
going to come by and ask for our
non-existent driver's license.
LEFTY
But we have no money!
VIJAY
I have no shoes! I'll catch
pneumonia and die a indeterminate
proto-quasi-virgin!
A couple coins are inserted into a roadside pay phone. There
is ringing on the other end.
ESTELLE (V.O.)
Hello?
NICK
(into phone)
Mom? It's Nick. I'm sorry to wake
you, but I'm hoping you'll help
your only son. Especially seeing as
it would really piss off Dad.
A long beat.
84.
ESTELLE (V.O.)
Where are you, Nick?
The three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay
phone. The three of them huddle under their only windbreaker.
A pair of headlights appear in the rain. The headlights flash
twice and Nick runs out into the road.
POV TRUCK DRIVER
Nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie-whities.
The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to
reveal, the driver, a man named WALLY RUMPKIN, a seven foot
tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. He looks down
at our three waylaid adventurers.
WALLY
Pardon me. But is one of you Nick
Twisp?
The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if
this is how people go missing.
NICK
Yeah. I'm Nick.
WALLY
I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your
mom's.
Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is
actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being
sent on a midnight mission.
WALLY
So, uhm, uh... Your mom says you
need a ride. Did I mention I'm a
friend?
Nick breaks into a smile. Finally the Gods have cut him a
break.
The truck rumbles to a stop and the three boys climb out.
Nick looks, over his shoulder at Wally blushing behind the
wheel of the truck.
WALLY
Well, uhm... It was nice meeting
you, Nick.
NICK
You too, Mr. Rumpkin.
Wally blushes even more. He closes the door and starts to
turn the truck around. Nick watches him go. Wally waves
goodbye.
Nick turns and the three boys make their way down the dusty
road.
Nick wanders up the drive. WE FOLLOW him into the house.
Nick totes boxes of belongings from the house to the
Crampton's dilapidated camper.
NICK (V.O.)
He has deemed it strike three, but
is only banishing me as far as Mrs.
Crampton's condemned trailer.
The velvet voices of the Rat Pack come from the home.
Nick emerges from the Camper wrapped in the electric blanket.
He scurries into the house.
The window slides open and Nick comes crawling out, leaping
to the ground. He takes off running through the woods.
Nick pounds on the door.
LEFTY (O.S.)
Nick?
Nick turns to find Lefty coming up the path with two bags of
groceries under his arms.
NICK
Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today?
LEFTY
Nick, haven't you heard? Vijay's
been arrested.
NICK
Arrested?!?
LEFTY
For grand theft auto. They found
his prints in your father's car.
NICK
That's terrible. Did he go quietly?
LEFTY
No. He said you were his accomplice
and now the Ukiah police are
looking for you!
We linger a beat on Nick's blank expression. Then -
102.
We're off and running through the woods, trying to keep up
with Nick as he flees.
NICK (V.O.)
The day has proven to be a
disaster. Where did I gone wrong? I
have a decision to make.
The spotlight from the overhead helicopter sweeps over the
bridge and continues down the road.
NICK (V.O.)
I could hit the road and spend my
life a fugitive with my integrity
nearly intact.
UNDER THE BRIDGE
Nick squats in the shadows. He's holding a bouquet of
municipal flowers and dabs the sweat on his head with his
tie.
NICK (V.O.)
It's that or risk incarceration to
keep my dinner date.
(BEAT)
Obviously the answer is clear.
Nick peers through the bushes at the mobile home across the
street. A squad car crawls past, the rover squawking a terse
description of a teenage white male.
Nick emerges from the shrubs and approaches the house.
He rings the ornate Victorian doorbell. Paul answers in an
apron.
PAUL
Hello, Nick. Right on time. Come
in.
Nick's silhouette figure racing through the trees.
NICK (V.O.)
Here I am, reviled by friends and
family. Relentlessly pursued by
three police jurisdictions.
Nick stops at the edge of the woods to catch his breath.
NICK (V.O.)
Fronois suggests we flee the
country. But where to go? Mexico?
Canada? India, perhaps?
He looks up the road which has been blocked off by flashing
squad cars.
The downtown high-rises protrude from the layer of smog. In
pre-lap, someone pushes a door BUZZER repeatedly.
Nick is crammed into the phone booth. He's wearing shades and
a fedora. WE INTERCUT.
NICK
You're on a need to know basis,
gorilla boy.
Lance seethes inwardly.
112.
LANCE
No matter, they'll get you
eventually.
NICK
Let me make it easy. I'll be at
Redwood High School tomorrow
morning. Round up your donut
dipping friends. I'm turning myself
in.
Nick slams down the phone before Lance can respond.
I/E. BUS (MOVING) - DAY
Nick sits by the window, the suitcase on the seat next to
him.
And the bus flies past the sign that says WELCOME TO UKIAH.
Nick steps off the bus and finds Lefty loading his belongings
underneath.
NICK
Lefty?
Lefty lifts his eyes and sees his friend.
LEFTY
Nick? What are you doing here?
Everyone and their mother's mother
is looking for you.
NICK
They have me soon enough. Where are
you going?
LEFTY
Home. I'm done being dead, Nick.
Heather and I are going back to
Oakland for Christmas. You should
have heard how glad my parents were
that I didn't kill myself. They
were even happier when they found
out I'm not gay.
NICK
That's great, Lefty.
LEFTY
Yeah, being in love is pretty
great. So what's your plan, Nick?
113.
Nick answers with only pensive silence.
Nick is about to knock on the door when Paul opens it in
another display of clairvoyance.
PAUL
Welcome back, Nick. We had a
feeling you were coming.
...where a crowd begins to form in anticipation of Nick's
arrival.
Nick watches from behind a tree on the ridge.
DISSOLVE TO:
114.
...where police cars and news crews are pulling up to
interview the students.
DISSOLVE TO:
The parking lot is now filled with police cruisers and FBI
vans, the news crews, REDWOOD HIGH STUDENTS, and an
apparently CALIFORNIA WIDE NICK TWISP CULT FOLLOWING.
TINA MANION, 17, speaks into a STUDENT NEWS CREW CAMERA.
TINA
This is Tina Manion reporting live
at Redwood High in Ukiah where
local law enforcement as well as
the FBI awaits the promised arrival
of Nick Twisp.
There comes a murmur from the crowd and Tina directs the
student camera-man to the road on the ridge where...
George's BMW pulls to a stop overlooking the school.
GEORGE
Hey. That's my car!
The crowd hushes as the door opens and Nick emerges.
NICK'S POV
of the parking lot below, which looks like the kind of turn
out one would expect of a Star Wars prequel.
ON THE VARIOUS FACES OF THE CROWD
staring up in silence. Estelle, Wally, Vijay, Trent, Dwayne,
George, Lacey, Paul...
Nick gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity.
The parking lot erupts with CHEERS of his name. A few
Berkeley KIDS hold up a sign that reads I'M SINGLE, LET'S
MINGLE.
Then - shouts of warning from the megaphones.
And as the flashers and sirens come to life, Nick jumps back
into his father's car and peels out.
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
Nick glances in the rear view mirror as the cops bear through
the cloud kicked up in his wake.
115.
Nick pops in a CD and turns up the Christmas music to drown
out the sirens.
He zips across the covered bridge, the train of law
enforcement in hot pursuit.
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
He yanks the wheel hard and veers off onto the mountain road.
A few of the squad cars miss the turn and skid side-long
through a picket fence.
Nick takes the switchbacks at 60 per, wheels practically
sliding off the turns.
The BMW crests the hill and smashes through the chain link
gate.
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
As Nick watches the quickly approaching cliffs edge, he
undoes his seat belt.
He goes for the door handle, eyes going wide when he finds
power lock has engaged.
The BMW hurtles off the bluff and soars through the air,
tires spinning, a plume of snow blowing off the hood.
The car descends into a nose dive and flips completely upside-
down, hitting the ice covered surface of Clear Lake with a
thundering SMACK.
Police cars swerve to a stop at the edge of the bluff and the
crowd of officers and agents peer over the side at the hole
in the ice.
UNDERWATER
The BMW descends toward us in a storm of air bubbles.
As it gently touches down at the bottom of the lake, a somber
TRUMPET SOLO comes in pre-lap and we are...
Where a crowd of family, friends, and fans stand around in
mourning garb over the funeral ceremony.
116.
NICK (V.O.)
My only comfort regarding my
untimely death is knowing my
friends and family will do just
fine without me.
We move from Lacey and Paul, the latter of which is wailing
away on the trumpet, to Lefty, his head hung low. Heather
pulls his head to her breasts.
NICK (V.O.)
As it would turn out Heather's
vaginal canal is slightly
misshapen...
...where we find Vijay glancing over at Taggarty as she
smokes a cigarette.
NICK (V.O.)
Vijay would eventually manage to
pin the car theft on me. But had
lost the attention of Taggarty
forever. Who by the way...
...where we find Joanie sniffling.
NICK (V.O.)
Joanie of course would get to
continue to travel the world...
...where we find Estelle weeping quietly against Wally's
shoulder.
NICK (V.O.)
Wally as it turns out...
...where we find George puffing on a cigar, Mrs. Crampton
behind him, his hand resting on Dwayne's shoulder.
NICK (V.O.)
...my father, no longer burdened
with crippling child support
payments, would now be able to
afford the model BMW he always
wanted...
118.
I/E. BMW M6SMG - MOVING - FLASHFORWARD - DAY
Dwayne sticks his head out the window and shouts with glee as
his flab flaps in the wind.
NICK (V.O.)
...and would come to find the
surrogate son he always wanted in
Dwayne, the only organism alive
that could possibly appreciate
George's driving.
As the car accelerates, we see the vanity plate reads THUNDER
ROD.
NICK (V.O.)
Leaving just one last piece of
business.
And finally we arrive on Sheeni, expressionless. And as we
continue to PAN we reach...
Carlotta standing in the background. The bombshell haircut
and thick glasses can barely be made out through her veil.
Paul finishes his trumpet solo and there is a moment of
silence to observe the open casket and the SINGLE, LET'S
MINGLE shirt and shorts that are being buried inside.
Sheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses.
She approaches the distant Carlotta.
SHEENI
Excuse me. Are you a friend of
Nick's?
Carlotta looks up, startled. She composes herself and shakes
Sheeni's hand.
NICK/CARLOTTA
A terribly old friend. Carlotta
Ulanksy. I'm sorry for your loss.
SHEENI
You shouldn't be, Carlotta. I am no
doubt culpable for Nick's actions.
NICK/CARLOTTA
Well, love does compel us to
desperate acts. People cannot
always act rationally.
(MORE)
119.
NICK/CARLOTTA (cont'd)
The greater the love, the stronger
the passions, the more reckless the
crimes.
Sheeni lets go a slight, wistful smile.
SHEENI
Yes, Carlotta. Nick had wonderful a
way of making me feel worthy of the
pursuit.
NICK/CARLOTTA
My dear, if there's one thing the
demise of Nick Twisp has taught me,
it's that self worth comes from
within.
Sheeni gives a pensive nod.
SHEENI
Would you like to stay the night,
Carlotta? We can reminisce of our
departed.
NICK/CARLOTTA
Oh, my. A kind offer, but I really
must...
SHEENI
It's just... I don't think I could
bear to be alone tonight.
Carlotta does her best not to look conflicted, but it shows.
The agents lead Nick to the caravan of law enforcement parked
in the road.
124.
NICK (V.O.)
Arrested? Ha. It may not appear so,
but the truth is... I've got the
world on a string.
Sheeni emerges from the home, Albert barking in protest.
Nick strains against his cuffs to look over his shoulder at
her.
SHEENI
Write often, Nickie.
NICK
I will, darling.
SHEENI
And don't worry about Albert. He'll
be waiting for you too.
NICK (V.O.)
As Franois would remind me, I'm
intelligent, healthy, virile, not
violently ugly... On the whole I am
splendidly equipped for this great
adventure we call the human
existence.
The FBI agents shove Nick into the back of their black
Saturn.
