JACK IS PREPARING THE BAR FOR OPENING.  STEVE COMES 
DOWNSTAIRS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR LIVING AREA.

STEVE

Need some help opening up?

JACK

Could always use a hand.

TOGETHER THEY GO THROUGH THE RITUALS OF OPENING.

STEVE

Dad, why are you selling this place?  

I mean, really?

JACK

You know when people lay awake at 

night and are stressed about bills, 

life, the future and they can't sleep?

STEVE

Yeah.

JACK

STEVE

I do.

JACK

 You get that from your mother.  That s

a Korean thing.  See, I never worried 

about any of that stuff.  

(MORE)"Last, Best, and Final"41.

JACK (CONT'D)

My dad told me, this is a place people 

come to forget about worries.  So I 

just always knew if I kept this place 

fun, and open, and treated everybody 

well, it would always put food on the 

 sixty five, and table.  But now, I m

 got to think about your mother.  I ve

m going  face it.  I I mean, let s

first.  Those Koreans, they live 

forever. And this place, this is what 

d  got instead of savings.  So I we ve

feel better to get the money, put it 

in the bank, and then if I go, your 

mother is free and clear.  I guess I 

should have planned it better.  Maybe 

I lived my life wrong or something.

STEVE

Are you kidding, Dad?  This bar was 

filled with people who love you.  The 

whole neighborhood was here.  That's 

not a guy who lived his life wrong.  

When I'm your age, no one's going to 

be saying that stuff about me.

JACK

Sure they will.  You do that important 

stuff with the money and the stocks 

and&.what the hell do you do again?"Last, Best, and Final"42.

I work in the legal department of a 

large investment bank.  I make sure

That would be nice.
