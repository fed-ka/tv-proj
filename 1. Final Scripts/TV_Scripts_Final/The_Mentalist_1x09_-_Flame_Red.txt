      FADE IN:

      EXT. MARQUESA, CA. - DAY (D/1)11

      Farmland stretches to the horizon, shimmering in a heat haze.  
      Panning, we discover A BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising ominously 
      from the landscape, like a Kansas tornado.  As a fire engine 
      SIREN wails louder --

22INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ. SACRAMENTO - DAY 

      PATRICK JANE looks directly to camera.  He uses his hands to 
      accentuate his words and subtly shape Lisbon s response.

                                  JANE
                    Look at me.  Look in my eyes.

      ANGLE -- He s sitting opposite LISBON, who looks in his eyes.  
      RIGSBY and VAN PELT watch in happy anticipation. 

                                  LISBON
                    I m looking. 

                                   JANE 
                    Imagine a simple geometric shape.  
                    Any shape you like.  Picture it in 
                    your mind as strongly as you can, 
                    so that I can see it too.  

                                  LISBON
                    Okay. 

                                  JANE
                    Good.  Now, around that first shape 
                    I want you to put another simple 
                    shape, any shape you like.  Around 
                    the first shape.  Picture it in 
                    your mind.  Clear as you can.  Make 
                    a mental photograph.  Tell me when 
                    you have it clear.

                                  LISBON
                    Okay.  It s clear.  

      Jane gazes deep into her eyes.

                                  JANE 
                    I see a triangle.  Inside a circle.

      Lisbon grins.

                                  LISBON
                    No.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     2.

                                  JANE
                          (dubious)
                    No?

                                  LISBON
                    I was thinking of an octagon inside 
                    a square.

                                  JANE
                    Liar.

                                  LISBON
                    All right.  You got me.

      Van Pelt and Rigsby laugh delightedly.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Pretty good uh?  He got me and Rigs 
                    the same way.


                                  JANE
                    That s nothing.  That s just the 
                      calibration key for the real mind 
                    reading.  Now I have total access 
                    to your innermost thoughts.

                                  LISBON
                    Yeah right.  

                                  JANE
                    No, seriously.

                                  LISBON
                    So what am I thinking?

                                  JANE 
                    You re thinking thank God he s  
                    joking around and can t really read 
                    my mind.  

                                  LISBON
                    No.  Well, yes actually, but not 
                    for the reason you think...

                                  JANE
                    What reason do I think?

      Lisbon realizes he s trapping her.

                                  LISBON
                    Never you mind...





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     3.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Hah, you re blushing. 

      Lisbon gives him a stern glance, and Rigsby looks abashed.

                                  JANE
                    You are, though.

      Just then, much to Lisbon s relief, CHO enters. 

                                  CHO
                    We re up.  Suspected arson/murder 
                    on a farm in Marquesa.  The County 
                    DA is asking if we ll check it out.

      EXT. BURNED-OUT GARAGE. GARCIA HOUSE. MARQUESA, CA - DAY33

      Follow SMOKE wafting up from burned-out wreckage to FIND --

      Jane, Lisbon, Cho, Van Pelt and Rigsby being led across 
      smoking ruins by Marquesa Police Chief TREY PILLER, 30.  
      Piller s got the genial noblesse oblige of a former high 
      school football star, but it doesn t quite hide his stress.  
      Farmland all around, but it s parched and dry, the corn only 
      half-grown.  FIRETRUCKS and looky-loos in the b.g.

                                  LISBON
                    Chief Piller, why the firetrucks?  
                    Shouldn t they be gone by now? 

                                  PILLER
                    Took forever to put the fire out.  
                    Not enough pressure for the hoses, 
                    see, not with this drought.  Rich 
                    Garcia had the best corn in the 
                    county, and now look.

      They reach a burned-out hulk of a car.  Piller points to it.

                                  PILLER (CONT D)
                    That s where we found him.  What 
                    was left.  Hardly enough for Susan 
                    and Madeleine to bury.

      Piller s a little upset.  Jaw clenched tight, red-eyed.

                                  JANE
                    Tough to lose a comrade, uh?

                                  PILLER
                    Yup.

                                  JANE 
                    Probably saved your life more than 
                    once.  And vice versa.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     4.

      CONTINUED:33

                                  PILLER
                    How do you know we served together?

                                  JANE
                    You ve been crying.  You re not the 
                    kind of man that cries without good 
                    reason.  And that s a National 
                    Guard signet ring you re wearing. 

                                  PILLER
                              ( three-one-ninety-two )
                    We were with the 3-192 Armor.  Two 
                    tours in Anbar.  You re the arson 
                      specialist? 

                                  LISBON 
                    No.  That would be Agent Rigsby. 
                    Mr. Jane is... a consultant.

                                  PILLER
                          (eyes Rigsby)
                    You ll be able to tell, right?  
                      Definitively.  Whether the fire was 
                    an accident, arson, whatever?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Two years with the San Diego County 
                    arson squad, Chief.  I ll be able 
                    to tell.  

      Rigsby is just a little psyched to get to use his expertise.  
      Especially in front of Van Pelt.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    Chief Piller, you and your men 
                    haven t contaminated the scene, 
                    correct?

                                  PILLER
                    My men?  It s just me and Terry 
                    O Brien, Agent.  But yes, we did 
                    like you said -- haven t set foot 
                    after we pulled Rich out.

                                  RIGSBY
                    OK, so to determine if it s arson, 
                    I ll need to analyze the burn path, 
                    find the point of origin, check for 
                    signs of accelerant --

      He sees something.  Goes over to a charred piece of wood with 
        a carbonized lock on it.  Picks it up and examines it.  
      Trying to hide his disappointment --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     5.

                    Oh.  It s arson, all right.  And 
                    murder. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    How do you know?

                                  RIGSBY
                          (hands it to Lisbon)
                    This is part of the garage door.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    ...Yes?

                                  RIGSBY
                    The lock s on the outside of the 
                    door.  Someone locked Garcia in.  
                    Then lit the place up.    
                          (to Piller)
                    Your friend was murdered.  Sorry.

      Cho is looking around.

                                  CHO
                    Don t they usually like to watch 
                    their work, arsonists?  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yes.  Even more so when it s 
                    coupled with murder.

                                  CHO
                    I m not seeing a spot where he 
                    could do that.

      They survey the area:  Except for the house, it s just that 
      low cornfield and flat land...

                                  LISBON
                    This guy must be different.  
                    There s nowhere he could hide, 
                      especially once the fire department 
                    got here.  Jane, what do you think 
                    it (means) --?

      Jane s nowhere around.  He s vanished.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Jane?  Patrick Jane!

      A faint  Hellloooo!   From the cornfield.  They look --





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     6.

      THEIR POV - THE CORNFIELD

      A SCARECROW out in the middle waves to them.  It s Jane, 
      standing behind it and waggling its arm.

                                  JANE
                    He was here!  

      ANGLE -- JANE AT THE SCARECROW

      He looks -- HIS POV, a perfect view of the garage.  And 
      behind him, a faint trail through the corn to a road beyond.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. GARCIA HOUSE - DAY (D/1 CONT D)44

      Lisbon confers with Piller, Rigsby, Cho and Van Pelt.  Jane 
      sits on a nearby tractor, checking out the cool gears and 
      gadgets.  He s a bit like a big kid. 

                                  LISBON
                    What s it look like?

                                  RIGSBY
                    It s sophisticated work...  

      He holds up a small charred black object in a clear evidence 
      baggie.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                      Electronic timers, mercury 
                    switches.  We ll need the lab on it 
                    to be sure, but it looks like a 
                      distinctive accelerant.  Rocket 
                    fuel or something like that.  

                                  CHO
                    So we have a pro or a very gifted 
                    amateur at work.  Great.

                                  LISBON
                          (to Cho)
                    See if you can get a cast of those 
                    tire tracks on the road back there. 
                          (to Van Pelt and Rigsby)
                    You two go into town, talk to the 
                    guy Garcia was meeting with that 
                    night -- Chief, what was his name?

                                  PILLER
                    Mitchell Reese.  Runs the gas 
                    station over on Main.   

                                  RIGSBY
                    Mitchell Reese.  On our way.

      Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt exit.  Lisbon eyes Jane, who is 
      engrossed in the tractor s workings.  She turns to Piller.  
      So Jane can hear --

                                  LISBON
                    Let s you and me talk to the widow.

      As she and Piller head for the house...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     8.

      CONTINUED:44

                                  JANE
                    Like you didn t want to ride it, 
                    too.

      Jane jumps off the tractor, trots after Lisbon and Piller.

      INT. DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM. GARCIA HOUSE - DAY55

      A simple nicely-appointed farmer s home.  The kitchen table 
      groans with every potluck dish imaginable.  Lisbon and Jane 
      enter with Piller.  

      They meet SUSAN GARCIA, mid-30s, pretty in a girl-next-door 
      way, palely glowing with grief, holding it together.  NB -- 
      There s other women drifting in and out being vaguely 
      helpful, as is usual at times like this.   

                                  PILLER
                    Susan, these folks are from the 
                      California Bureau of Investigation.  
                    They re going to find out who did 
                    this to Rich.

      JANE S POV -- When Piller touches Susan, she shies away very 
      slightly.  There s something skittish about the way Susan and 
      Piller interact.  Both of them constrained by some unspoken 
      tension.  

                                  SUSAN
                    Hi, nice to meet you.  Thank you 
                    for coming.  I uh, are you hungry?  
                    There s more than enough.  

                                  JANE
                          (hungry)
                    Hmmmm.   

                                  LISBON
                          (warning glance at Jane)
                    No, thank you, Mrs. Garcia.  

      BEN MACHADO, 30, steel under the can-do charm, enters from 
      the kitchen.

                                    MACHADO
                    Maddy s in her room.  I did some KP 
                    with the dishes and brought in the 
                    firewood.  So you re all set.

                                  SUSAN
                    Thank you.

                                    MACHADO
                    You need anything?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     9.

      CONTINUED:55

                                  SUSAN
                    No, Ben.  I m good.  Thank you so 
                    much.  These are the State Police 
                    people.

      Machado shakes Lisbon and Jane s hands, firm but friendly.

                                    MACHADO
                    Ben Machado.  Anything you need, 
                    just say the word, you got it.

                                  PILLER
                    Ben s our go-to guy in Marquesa. 

                                    MACHADO
                    He means I m the only real estate 
                    agent around that ll take his 
                      commission in fertilizer and 
                    chickens.

                                  JANE
                    And you were in the 192nd also?

                                    MACHADO
                          (how did you know?)
                    That s right. 

                                  JANE
                    You have that military bearing.  

                                  PILLER
                    Rich and Ben and me and a couple 
                    other guys ran a platoon together.

                                    MACHADO
                    Been through a whole lot.  And then 
                    for this to happen?  Right here at 
                    home?  You re going to catch the 
                    bastard who did this ASAP, right?

                                  LISBON
                    We ll certainly try.

                                    MACHADO
                    Guess that ll have to do.
                          (to Susan)
                    See you in the morning. 

      Machado exits with Piller.  (Jane has noted -- as we might 
      also -- that Piller and Susan have carefully avoided eye 
      contact throughout, though there was a yearning look in 
      Piller s gaze).




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     10.

                    Ma am, if we could ask you a few 
                      questions...

      Jane ghosts his way from the room.

      INT. DINING ROOM. GARCIA HOUSE - DAY66

      Jane finds a PHOTO wall -- neatly framed pictures of family, 
      friends... (Note:  No pictures from Garcia s military days). 

      Looking through to the KITCHEN, Jane sees someone open the 
        refrigerator door, blocking his view.  THUNK, the door 
      closes.  Just a glimpse of dark hair streaked with pink, 
      earbud cords, and a big bowl of cereal in a ring-studded 
      girl s hand.

      INT. KITCHEN. GARCIA HOUSE - DAY77

      Jane enters to find emo/goth 16-year-old MADELEINE ( Maddy ) 
      GARCIA.  Black hair streaked with pink, black clothes, 
      disgusted with the world long before her father was killed.  
      She s at the sink pouring milk on her cereal.  Earbuds in, 
      fierce MUSIC SEEPING OUT.  Eyes closed.  Jane stands in the 
      doorway looking at her until Maddy finally opens her eyes.  
      Startled by Jane, she compensates by then gazing at him 
      blandly, without removing the headphones.  Shovels some 
      cereal in her mouth.

      Jane waves a small hello.  She doesn t respond.  He mimes 
      asking her to please take the phones off.  She does. 

                                  JANE
                    You must be Madeleine.

                                  MADDY
                    Maddy.  Whatever it is you re 
                    selling, pass.

      She puts the headphones back on, takes another bite.  Jane 
      starts silently mouthing words as though he were speaking.  
      After a while, Maddy realizes what he s doing and takes off 
      the phones again, angry now.

                                  MADDY (CONT D)
                    Funny.  What are you, a moron?  My 
                    dad just died. 

                                  JANE
                    Yes, my condolences.  It happens.  
                    You ll learn to live with it.  Not 
                    for a while, but in the end you 
                    will.  Mind if I sit down?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     11.

      CONTINUED:77

      He sits at the little kitchen table.  She s shocked by his 
      brutal yet optimistic honesty.  Got her attention now.

                                  MADDY
                    Who are you?

                                  JANE 
                    My name s Patrick Jane.  I m the 
                    man that will find out who it was 
                    killed your father and have him or 
                    her or them put in a prison cell.  
                    If you ll talk to me.  

                                  MADDY
                    If I ll talk to you.  Like I know 
                    who did it.

                                  JANE
                    Maybe you can help me find out.  

                                  MADDY
                          (go on)
                    Yeah?...

                                  JANE
                    Your dad was in the National Guard 
                    a long time.  How come there are no 
                    pictures of him and his buddies?

                                  MADDY
                    He used to have all this military 
                    crap in a glass case on the photo 
                    wall.  You know, medals and 
                    pictures and stuff.  But he took it 
                    down.

                                  JANE
                    Why is that?

                                  MADDY
                    How should I know?  He didn t like 
                    to talk about what he did over 
                    there.  Not with me anyway. 

                                  JANE
                    Who did he talk with?  Your mom?  

                                  MADDY
                          (kissing her teeth 
                              contemptuously)
                    Tsch.  No.

                    Nothing.  I mean, he didn t talk 
                    about that stuff.  

                                  JANE
                    Why are you so angry with your

                                  MADDY
                    I m, I m not.

                                  JANE
                    If you weren t angry, you d be with 
                    her.  She needs you.  Her husband 
                    just died.

      A tentative KNOCK on the back door.

                                  MADDY
                    Oh I m sure she ll learn to live 
                    with it.   

      Maddy opens the door.  It s a shambling mentally handicapped-
      looking guy in his version of mourning clothes -- a black 
      death metal band t-shirt with a big laughing skull under a 
      dark jacket.  Meet TOMMY OLDS, (20 s).  He has a giant bag of 
      corn chips. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Hi, Maddy.  I m sorry for your 
                    loss.  This is for you.

      Maddy takes the bag, admires it.  For a moment not the surly 
      teen.

                                  MADDY 
                    That s nice, Tommy.  Thanks.

                    I was watching TV.  Maddy was in 
                    her room.  Richard called to say he 
                    was leaving Mitch s, be home soon.  
                    He was doing stuff for the Avocado 
                    Parade?  Marquesa is the Avocado 
                    capital of the world, Rich has been 
                    float captain for six years running 
                    now.  Next thing, I heard a strange 
                    noise and then I saw a light out 
                    that window...
                          (hard to say)
                    It was the garage, burning.  And 
                    Rich inside, screaming.  That s 
                    what the noise was.  Rich 
                      screaming, trying to get out of the 
                    garage.

      From the kitchen door area, Maddy enters with Tommy.  Maddy 
      is sullen to her mother --

                                  TOMMY
                    Hello, Mrs. Garcia.  I brought corn 
                    chips.  Cool ranch.

                                  SUSAN
                    Thank you, sweetie.  Want some 
                    food?

                                  TOMMY
                    Can I have some chicken?

                                  SUSAN
                    Of course.  Whatever you like.  
                    Help yourself.

      Tommy takes a piece of chicken and shambles out, eating.  
      Lisbon looks questioning...

                    Tommy does odd jobs around town.  
                      Challenged.  But ever so 
                      independent, bless him.

      Maddy stomps out.

                                  SUSAN
                    Sorry.  You know, teenagers.

                                  JANE
                    You know why she s so angry?  She 
                    suspects your lover is responsible 
                    for killing her father. 

                                  SUSAN

                                  SUSAN
                    Maddy suspects no such thing.

      Lisbon eyes her, noting it s not a denial.

                                  JANE
                    That wasn t very convincing.  
                    D you want to try that again with 
                    more feeling? 

                                  SUSAN
                    You can t come in here and make 
                    wild accusations like this.

                                  JANE
                    You wouldn t look him in the eye, 
                    not once.  He kept trying to take 
                    your hand, but you wouldn t let 
                    him.  The air was practically 
                    buzzing with furtive shame and 
                    yearning.  Which tells me you re 
                    lovers, and suggests two 
                      possibilities... You and Piller 
                    killed your husband together and 
                    now you re remorseful.

                    No, I believe you.  You d have 
                    found a more humane method of 
                    killing him.  Second possibility.  
                    You have a horrible feeling maybe 
                    Piller did this thing to leave the

      INT. REESE GAS & AUTO REPAIR. MARQUESA - DAY99

      MITCH REESE, 30, tinkers with an avocado green Cadillac 
      convertible while he talks to Rigsby and Van Pelt.  Mitch has 
      a full beard and impossibly bushy shock of hair, dark glasses 
      and a gruff manner.  His arms are scarred with burns.  ZZ Top 
      roadie maybe.  Rigsby s a little impatient, making little

      The attractive ranch house is ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  A crowd of 
      frantic people watching.  Lisbon and Cho squeal up in their

      CRASH!  A chair bursts through a window, falls to the ground.  
      A backdraft tongue of FLAME jets out after.  Nothing can 
      survive in there.  A beat and --

                    at first.

      Rigsby obediently sits up, surprised at her authority.  Van 
      Pelt plunks herself beside him on the bed.  Rigsby s voice is 
      a little slurred by painkillers.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I m glad you didn t die.

      Rigsby smiles shyly.

                                  RIGSBY
                    You are? 

      Van Pelt smiles and deftly cuts a bandage.  Rigsby feels the 
      room light up.  He s about to say something when Jane and 
      Lisbon enter. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     21.

                    Check out Dr. Van Pelt.

      Lisbon opens a bottle of juice, sticks a straw in it and sets 
      it on the table next to Rigsby, gruff to hide her concern.

                                  LISBON
                    Here.  It s that mango crap you 
                    like.

                    How re you feeling?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Took some kickass painkillers man.

                          (beat)
                    I guess this lets Piller out as a 
                    suspect.

                                  LISBON 
                    Yuh.  Especially since Burn Unit 
                    doctors found the date rape drug in 
                    his system.  He told them he woke 
                    up with smoke and fire all around.

                      Interesting level of cruelty.  
                    Dosing someone to wake just in time 
                    to burn alive.

      Cho enters.

      Cho opposite Susan on the porch.  As the scene proceeds,  
      Maddy comes out of the house, but on seeing her mom, goes 
      back indoors.  Obviously still not speaking to her.

                                  CHO
                    Why didn t you tell us about Dave

                    Same National Guard unit.  Same

                                  SUSAN
                    But Dave s death was an accident -- 
                    and nearly three years ago, 
                    besides.  

                                  CHO
                    An accident.

                                  SUSAN
                    Passed out with a cigarette, poor 
                    fool.  He d done it before -- I 
                    mended the holes in his shirt 
                    myself.  Burned his place right 
                    down to a cinder.  There wasn t a 
                    thing left of him.  We had to bury 
                    ashes.

                    Well, sure, now that you mention 
                    it, Dave was kind of in business 
                    with them.  With Rich and Trey and

                    Lord, no.  Started out, it was just 
                    a way of giving Dave Martin a place 
                    to live.  Rich and the others in 
                    the unit convinced him to move to 
                    Marquesa with them after mustering 
                    out.  You know, no man left behind

                    Idea was Dave would work it up into 
                      a specialty market type farm -- you 
                    know, high-end produce and such.

                    anyhow, not since the water ran 
                    dry.  But they always had some kind 
                    of cockamamie scheme going.  
                    Petting Zoo.  Golf Range.  Tommy

                    Good.  Dave did and he got burned 
                    up on accident.

                                  LISBON
                    Did you see it?

                                  TOMMY
                    Naw, I was in the hospital because 
                    my appendix busted.  
                          (brightening)
                    Want to see my scar?

                                  LISBON
                    No.  No.  But I m sure Mr. Jane 
                    does...

      She realizes Jane s gone.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Jane?

      EXT. TRAILER - DAY1717

      Lisbon emerges to see Jane heading up the hill toward the 
      fence just beyond the trailer.  She catches up to him --

                                  LISBON
                    Jane?  What is up with you?  Eww.

      She looks down.  Her foot has squished into mud.  The mud 
      puddle extends to the fence gate.

                                  JANE
                    Exactly.

      He throws open the gate...

      THEIR POV - BEYOND THE GATE

      A tiny, gorgeous GARDEN.  Lush greenery and gorgeous flowers.  
      It s an oasis in a desert.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     28.

      BACK TO JANE AND LISBON

      As they go inside the mini-Shan-gri-La.

                                  LISBON 
                    All this green... But there s a 
                    drought.  

      Jane treads on the ground in the middle of the garden.  It s 
      sodden, water soaking everything.

                                  JANE
                    Not at Alton s Grove there s not.

      Tommy has entered, a shy smile. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Do you like it?  I got geraniums, 
                    too.

                                  LISBON
                    It s very pretty.  

                                  TOMMY
                          (suddenly worried)
                    But don t tell, okay?  The company 
                    will make me move out, I won t have 
                    nowhere to live.

      Lisbon kneels, presses the ground beneath her.  It wells like 
      a squeezed sponge.

                                  LISBON
                    It s just coming up from the 
                    ground.

                                  JANE 
                    It s an aquifer.  A new source of 
                      groundwater.

                                  LISBON
                    Got to be worth millions.

                                  JANE
                    Worth killing for.

      EXT. BEN MACHADO S HOUSE - DAY1818

      A nice large place.  The CBI car parked in the drive.  Cho 
      and Van Pelt KNOCK on the big front door.  (Note:  they are 
      not wearing clothing that would indicate they are police.)

                                  VAN PELT
                    Mr. Machado?... Hello?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     29.

                                  CHO
                    Maybe he s around back.

      Cho points to the large outbuilding behind the house.

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    Barn.  Let s check it.

      Suddenly BANG!  Their car s window explodes as a bullet ZINGS 
      between Cho and Van Pelt.  They dive to the ground behind a 
      tree --

      BEHIND THE TREE

      They hurriedly draw their weapons as another bullet plugs the 
      tree just over their heads.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I guess we found Machado.

                                  CHO 
                    Mr. Machado!  Ben Machado?! 

      ANGLE -- Machado rising from cover, very scared, holding a 
      semi-automatic rifle. 

                                    MACHADO
                    Come any closer, and I ll shoot 
                    you!  And I will shoot to kill!

                                  CHO 
                    Mr. Machado, we re police!  This is 
                    the police!

      Beat.

                                    MACHADO
                    Show me some badges!

      Van Pelt holds up her badge so that Machado can see it.  
      Machado s relieved, and a little embarrassed.

                                    MACHADO (CONT D)
                    Crap.  Okay, don t shoot.  

      He puts down his gun and rises, hands in air.

                                    MACHADO (CONT D)
                    How was I to know you re cops?

      Cho and Van Pelt move toward him guns levelled at him. 

                                  CHO
                    You thought we were selling

      SAME SCENE - A MOMENT LATER

      Van Pelt closes the CBI car door on Machado in the backseat, 
      cuffed.

      Cho emerges from the nearby barn...

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                     Check this out.

      He s carrying a big metal jug of --

                    The accelerant used in the fires.  
                    Six jugs of it in the barn.    

      Off him and Van Pelt --

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      Cho and Rigsby question Machado.  

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM. CBI HQ - CONTINUOUS2020

      Lisbon watches, with Jane.  She notes the tension in Jane s 
      shoulders. 

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - CONTINUOUS2121

      Machado is nervous.  With effort, Rigsby plunks a metal jug 
      on the table.  Smiles grimly.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Ethyl ether.  Burns at 600 degrees 
                      Fahrenheit. 

      Rigsby holds up a bandaged arm.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    You know what temp human skin melts 
                    at?  Two-fifty.  I got lucky -- 
                    mostly second degree burns.  But 
                    Trey Piller s face, it just came 
                    off.

                                    MACHADO
                    I don t know where that stuff came 
                    from!  Someone s framing me.

                                  CHO
                    Somebody frame you for shooting at 
                    us, Mr. Machado?   Cause from where 
                    I stood, sure looked like you.

                                    MACHADO
                    That was a misunderstanding.  I 
                    didn t know who you were.  I was 
                    defending myself.

                                  CHO
                    Really.  From whom?

                                    MACHADO
                    From someone trying to kill me!  
                    Like they killed Rich and tried to 
                    kill Trey.

                    And why would you be next on 
                    someone s to-burn list?

                                    MACHADO
                      Because... because we were all in 
                    business together.

                                  CHO
                    And with them gone, you re the sole 
                      proprietor of Alton's Grove.  Sole 
                    owner of all that water.

      Machado reacts guiltily...

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yes, we know about the aquifer, 
                    Ben.  All that money, right under 
                    your feet.  But see, that s a 
                    perfect motive for you to burn out 
                    Garcia and Piller.  You.

                                    MACHADO

                    Uh-huh.  So you re saying, whoever 
                    did kill them is going to try and 
                    kill you.  Who was that again?

                                    MACHADO
                    I don t know.

                                  CHO
                    Ben.  Gotta say I m skeptical.  Why 
                    would anyone want you three dead?  
                    Who benefits from that?  

      Jane quietly comes and sits next to Machado.  Still watching 
      him.  Machado s even more unnerved. 

                                  JANE
                    D you want to know my guess?

                          (hard)
                    I m saying it.  You three tried to 
                    kill him.  To get Alton s Grove for 
                      yourselves.

                                    MACHADO

                    Dave came to you all excited --

                    On land you bought for him.  
                      Practically your land.  Dave owed 
                    you.  But he didn t even offer you 
                    a taste, did he?  Ungrateful 
                    bastard.

                                    MACHADO
                      Ridiculous.  We had no idea what 
                    was there until recently.

                                  JANE
                    You and Rich and Trey wanted what 
                    Dave had.  So you set his house on 
                    fire and left him to die.  Imagine 
                    the betrayal he felt.  The helpless

                    Two notes here.  One, we have 
                    plenty on him.  Armed assault on 
                    Cho and Van Pelt, and a barn-ful of 
                    fire accelerant.

                                  JANE
                    The assault was self-defense and 
                    the accelerant was a plant.  But go 
                    ahead -- two?

                                  LISBON
                    Where do you get off giving orders 
                    in the first place?  I say who goes 
                    and who stays, not you.

                                  JANE
                    Fiery but calm.  Very good.  Try it 
                    with a forceful hand gesture.

                     I say who goes. 

                                  LISBON 
                    I m serious.

                                  JANE
                    So am I.  If he s in here, how s 
                    the killer going to get to him? 

                                  LISBON
                    He could be the killer, and even if 
                    he s not, we don t want the killer 
                    to get him.

                                  JANE
                    Yes we do.  Machado is our bait.  
                    Our tethered goat.

                                  LISBON
                    And too bad if the bait gets 
                    killed.

                                  JANE
                    Well, yes.  That s why you use 
                    goats and not babies or virgins. 

                                  LISBON
                    Machado isn t a goat.

                                  JANE

                    We ve never discussed this before

                    I m going to cut him open and watch 
                    him die, slowly.  Like he did to my 
                    wife and child.  If you have a 
                    problem with that, we should talk

                    Then let s talk.  Because when we

      NOISE behind him.  He whirls.

      Eerie moonlight comes through the slats.  Now we see the 
      shadowy skeletons of old farming equipment, a THRESHER, 
      SCYTHE, other scary sharp stuff.  There are stairs to a 
      SECOND LEVEL... Where someone watches Ben.  The person 
      walks... Dust sprinkles down below... A DARK FIGURE appears 
      from the shadows, steps forward into a dim shaft of 
      moonlight.  We see a small part of his face -- it hints at 
      horrible burns, melted skin.  Speaks with a growling voice, 
        unrecognizable. 

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Hello, Ben.

      Machado screams and aims his gun and PULLS THE TRIGGER, BUT 
      NOTHING HAPPENS.

      The Disfigured Man holds something up in a shaft of 
      moonlight.  A small piece of metal.  

                                  DISFIGURED MAN (CONT D)
                    You ll need your firing pin.

      The Disfigured Man tosses it at Machado s feet.  Holds up a 
      metal jug with a flourish and splashes liquid all over 
      Machado and the ground before him.  Machado s no coward, and 
      advances toward the stairs; the Disfigured Man holds up a 
      lighter, menacing.

                                  DISFIGURED MAN (CONT D)
                    Get back or I ll light you up. 

      Machado stops, backs up.

                                    MACHADO
                    Who are you?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     42.

                    You know who I am.  

                                    MACHADO
                    I have no freaking idea, man.

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Sure you do, Ben.  You tried to 
                    kill me. 

                                    MACHADO
                    No.  Oh no.  That s not possible. 

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Oh yes, Ben, it is.  It s me.

                                    MACHADO
                    Dave?

      The Disfigured Man chuckles softly.  Terrified now, Machado 
      runs back to the locked door.  Tries to open it. 

                                    MACHADO (CONT D)

      INT. BARN. MACHADO HOUSE - NIGHT (N/3 CONT D)3535

      Machado bangs on the door...

                                    MACHADO
                    Help!  Help me!

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Forget it, Ben.  Nobody can hear 
                    you.  You re going to die alone, 
                    screaming in agony.  Like I did.

      Machado groans in terror.

                                    MACHADO
                    This is a dream.  It s not 
                      happening.

                                  DISFIGURED MAN
                    Why did you kill me, Ben?  We were 
                    friends.  If you needed money so 
                    bad, you should have told me.  
                    I would have helped you.

                                    MACHADO
                    I did tell you!  All of us, we 
                    begged you.  This is your own 
                    fault.  You selfish bastard!  We 
                    didn t want to kill you.  But you 
                    wouldn t see sense.
                          (beat)
                    I m sorry.  I m sorry.

       Dave  finally reveals his visage -- the horrible, ruined 
      face.  Machado recoils in horror.  A beat.   Dave  yanks off 
      his mask, steps into the shaft of moonlight.  It s Jane.  
      Very pleased with himself.

                                  JANE
                    See how much better you feel now?  
                    I forgive you.  Can t speak for 
                    Dave Martin, though.

    He clicks off a little digital recorder.  

                                  MACHADO
                    You sonofabitch.    

      Machado looks around, picks up a BIG AXE and advances on 
      Jane...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     44.

      Jane backs up to the door.   

                                    MACHADO
                    I killed an intruder in my barn, 
                    how was I to know it was a cop?  
                    If that s what you are.  What are 
                    you exactly?

                                  JANE
                    Cho!  Rigsby!

      No reply.  Jane rattles the door.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    They re right outside.

      Machado raises the blade.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Wait!  You re forgetting something!

                                    MACHADO
                    What?

                    Any shape you d like...

                    Machado!  Ben Machado!  

      Machado curses, lowers the machete.

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    You ready to die?

                    That s not...

      Jane goes to a crack between boards, peers through a slat --

      JANE S POV

      A figure tosses a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL right at him.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     45.

      CONTINUED: (2)3535

      BACK TO JANE 

      as he throws himself behind a thresher just as a SPLASH OF 
      FIRE pops into the barn.  The light from the flames outside 
      licks at the windows.  Smoke starts seeping in.

                                    MACHADO 
                    What the hell s going on?  

                                  JANE
                    Oh, dear.

      Jane goes to a crack in the wall, calling out to the killer --

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Open the door!  

      No answer.  A window IMPLODES from the heat, shattering above 
      Jane s head.

                                    MACHADO
                    We re going to die, you son of a 
                    bitch!  What have you done?

      The two race up the stairs to a rear door.  Machado stumbles, 
      falls back.  Jane grabs his arm and thrusts him to the door.    
      Tries it.  Won t open.  Slams his body against it.  No luck.  
      A wall of flame ROARS in like a train...

      EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS3636

      Cho and Rigsby drive up.  The barn is engulfed in flame.  
      Nothing can survive that...

      Cho and Rigsby get out of the car, horrified.

                                  CHO
                    Oh crap.

      A beat and Jane walks out of the darkness.  Machado behind 
      him, hacking and coughing from smoke inhalation.  Jane seems 
      fine, although relieved.

                    No harm done.  Arrest this man.  He 
                    confessed to killing Dave Martin.

                                  CHO 
                    Cool.

      Machado already on his knees, Cho puts cuffs on him.  Just 
      then, Rigsby taps Jane on the shoulder, points.  Crouched 
      behind a tree, watching the blaze, a SILHOUETTED MALE 
      FIGURE...

      When he sees Rigsby coming toward him, the mystery man runs.  
      Rigsby pursues him.  

                                  JANE

      Jane enters.

                                  JANE
                    Hey, Cho.  You mind?

                                  CHO
                    Sure thing.
                          (stands up)
                    Don t make a mess.

      Jane takes his place.

                                  JANE
                    Cop humor.  Not funny.  

      Jane gazes back steadily at Tommy s uncomprehending smile.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I m supposed to be in here finding 
                    out who put you up to this.  See, 
                    my friends think you re an idiot.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Everybody says that.  Sometimes 
                    they re not nice.  

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Being a fool gives you a 
                    strange kind of power, doesn t it?  
                    You re there but you re not there.  
                    It s like having a wizard s cloak 
                    of invisibility.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     49.

                    I don t understand what you re 
                    saying, sir.  But I like wizards.  
                    The other man said he would get me 
                    a root beer.  But he never did.

                                  JANE
                    Revenge is a hard road, Tommy.  
                    Hard.  It s like when Captain Ahab 
                    chased Moby Dick, the whale died 
                    alright, but the Peapod went down 
                    too, and Ahab with it.  

                                  TOMMY
                          (quick as a flash)
                    Pequod.  Ahab s ship is the Pequod.

      He immediately regrets saying it.  Jane smiles.  Gotcha.  

                                  JANE
                    Exactly right.  Pequod.  Silly of 
                    me. 
   

      Jane takes a dog-eared copy of Moby Dick from his jacket 
      pocket.

                    Here s your copy.

      Tommy takes it.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I must say I m impressed.  
                    I know English Literature 
                      professors who haven t read Moby 
                    Dick.

      Tommy looks away, tries to smile blankly.

                                  TOMMY
                    I like whales.  They eat squids.

      RESUME SCENE as Jane eyes Tommy closely.

                                  JANE
                    Only an idiot would wear a t-shirt 
                    like that to a house in mourning.  
                    An idiot, or a daring killer with a 
                    warped sense of humor.

      A faint smile from Tommy.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You re going down for this.  
                    Why not go down as your true self?    
                    You ve pulled off something 
                    amazing.  You should be proud. 
                    In a way.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Is that root beer coming?

                                  JANE
                    I can see you.  Come out and talk 
                    to me, Thomas.  There s no use 
                    hiding any more.

      Tommy seems to straighten and expand into a self-assured, 
      clever, though deeply twisted young man.  He speaks with 
      precision.

                                  TOMMY
                    What do you want to know?

                                  JANE
                    I m curious.  Are there two of you 
                    or is Tommy just an act you put on? 

                                  TOMMY
                    Please, I m not a mental case.

                                  TOMMY
                    Tommy s an act.  A performance. 

                                  JANE
                    That you never turn off.  

                                  TOMMY
                    He amuses me.  He protects me.  
                    When I was 18, I jacked a car.  Got 
                    caught.  But when I pulled the 
                    Tommy act the cops let me go.  I ve 
                    gotten much better since then, of 
                    course.

                                  JANE
                    Good enough to avenge Dave Martin s 
                    death.

                                  TOMMY
                    Three months ago, the company 
                    finally got a permit to exploit the 
                    aquifer.  All that money.  I put 
                    things together, realized what 
                    they d done to Dave.  

      Jane hands Tommy the book.

                                  TOMMY (CONT D)
                    Thanks.

                                  JANE 
                      I confess, I never have gotten to 
                    the end.  I know Ahab dies though, 
                    doesn t he?

                                  TOMMY
                    Yes.  But so does the whale.

                    Does he?  My point is, revenge 
                    never comes cheap.  

                                  TOMMY 
                    Spare me your moralizing.  I know 
                    what revenge costs.  It s worth the 
                    price.  David Martin had many 
                    flaws, no doubt, but he was my 
                    friend.  My friend.  Those animals 
                    deserve what they got.  It was 
                    justice. 

      Jane takes a beat, throws a sardonic look to Lisbon in the 
      observation room. 

                                  JANE
                    You admit killing Rich Garcia and 
                    trying to kill Trey Piller. 

                                  TOMMY
                    I watched them scream and writhe in 
                    agony and it was beautiful.  It was 
                      redemptive and beautiful.
                          (off Jane; contemptuous)
                    You wouldn t understand.  

      A beat.  Jane eyes Tommy sadly, stands.

                                  JANE
                    Someone will be along in a moment 
                    to charge you formally.  Good luck, 
                    Thomas.

                                  TOMMY
                    Would you do one thing for me?  

                                  JANE
                    You can ask.

                                  TOMMY
                    Tell Maddy Garcia I m sorry I hurt 
                    her. 

      Jane nods.  Exits.

      Jane and Lisbon talking with Maddy and Susan.  Mother and 
      daughter are barely speaking to each other.

                                  MADDY
                    Sorry?  He s sorry?  You tell him,

                                  JANE
                    Your father killed a man.  That s why 
                    he died.  You need to own that.  Tommy 
                    only did what you re now planning to 
                    do to him.  Revenge is a poison.  
                    Revenge is for fools and madmen.

      That gives Maddy pause.

                                  MADDY
                    I don t care.

                    We have to go.  Do me one favor.

      They both nod warily.

                    Now hold that pose until we leave.

                    Goodbye.

      Jane and Lisbon exit.  But Susan and Maddy don t separate.   
      We hold as they hug tighter.

                    That was rather good, wasn t it?  
                    Complete bull, but good. 

      And they sprint for the car through the rain.  Off them --
