                     For Sean Only

                                 DANIEL LUCAS HOLDEN is waiting in a HOLDING CELL at the
      GEORGIA DIAGNOSTIC STATE PRISON in Jackson, Georgia.  At 18
      years old, Daniel was sentenced to die.  He has spent over
      19 years on Death Row.  That's 233 months, 1012 weeks, 7084
      days of waiting.  Waiting to die.  Waiting to live.  Or
      waiting for a miracle.  Today his waiting will end.  

      Daniel is now 37 years old, lean with a pleasing but pale
      face, and faint, dark shadows under his eyes.  Through the
      Plexiglas window, Daniel observes a new INMATE stripping
      down to be searched.  As the Inmate is ordered to bend over,
      Daniel looks away.  He closes his eyes and begins meditating
      or remembering or dreaming. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      A BLACK-TOP ROAD RUSHING BY

      EXT. TWO LANE ROAD -- MORNING

      An IMPALA speeds down a rural road, past rows of corn and
      soy beans.  Cows and rotting barns.

      Behind the Impala is a TOYOTA LAND CRUISER followed by a
      HONDA CIVIC.  A caravan of sorts.  Running late and in a
      hurry.  

      INT. IMPALA -- CONTINUOUS

      Daniel's MOTHER, JANET TEBOW, 58, reserved and attractive,
      is on her cell phone.  TED TEBOW, SR, Janet's husband of 15
      years and Daniel's STEP-FATHER drives.  They are tense.

                                      JANET
                          (on phone)
                    I don't know why you wouldn't ride
                    with us.

      INT. HONDA CIVIC -- CONTINUOUS

      AMANTHA HOLDEN, Daniel's 32 year old SISTER rides alone.  

                                      AMANTHA
                          (on phone)
                    Something seemed karmically wrong
                    about that, Mother.

      Amantha has been angry for oh... about 19 years.

                                      JANET
                    Well, we're late.  Karma or not.  So
                    have your ID ready and take off your
                    jewelry.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    I've been there a lot more than you
                    lately, Mother.  I know the drill.                                                                                        2.

      Janet lets that go.  Her call waiting beeps.

                                      JANET
                    Honey, it's Ted Junior calling in. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    What?  Does he want to stop at 7-11
                    for a Ding Dong?

      Janet ignores that too. 

                                      JANET
                    I'll see you there, Amantha.

      Janet clicks over to Ted JR.  

      INT. LAND CRUISER -- CONTINUOUS

      TED TEBOW, JR, 29, Janet's STEP-SON and Daniel's STEP-BROTHER,
      drives while Ted JR's 24 year old wife,  TAWNEY, rides.  

                                    TED JR
                    Hey Mom.  Tell Dad he'd better pick
                    it up.  It would really suck if we
                    were late for this thing.

                                      JANET
                    I know.  I know. 
                          (to Ted SR)
                    Ted, Teddy said pick it up.

      Ted SR doesn't say anything.  Just picks it up.

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                          (to Ted JR)
                    Teddy?

                                    TED JR
                    Yeah, Mom?

                                      JANET
                    Could you call me Janet?

                                    TED JR
                    What? 

                                      JANET
                    Just until Daniel gets used to all
                    the changes and everything.

      INT. LAND CRUISER -- CONTINUOUS

                                    TED JR
                    Sure... Janet.

                                      JANET
                    Just for a while.                                                                                          3.

      Ted JR puts his phone away, looks at his wife.   

                                    TED JR
                    We've got to call her Janet.

                                      TAWNEY
                    God, I can't imagine what she's going
                    through right now.

                                    TED JR
                    Don't assume it's all good.

                                      TAWNEY
                    What do you mean?

                                    TED JR
                    Mayor Johnny still believes Daniel
                    was in on it.  A lot of people do.

                                      TAWNEY
                    You don't believe that, do you? 
                    That he could have done something
                    that horrible to her? 

                                    TED JR
                    Well, I sure did.  I mean, he was
                      convicted.  What would a rational
                    person think all these years?  Now? 
                    Hell, I don't know.  I've never even
                    met the guy.  

                                      TAWNEY
                    Which I still don't understand.

                                    TED JR
                    Come on, Tawney.  What was I supposed
                    to do?  Go down to death row and
                    introduce myself.  "Hi, I'm your new
                      step-brother, Ted, and I'll be taking
                    over the business you thought would
                    be yours one day."  Why torture the
                    guy?  

      Tawney thinks about that.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    I hate to say this but we all thought
                    he'd be dead by now anyway.  

      INT. HOLDING AREA -- CONTINUOUS

      Daniel's trance is broken by the sound of a door opening.  A
      YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUARD enters holding a suit, shirt,
      tie, shoes, belt, the works.

                                      YOUNG GUARD
                    These are for you, Daniel.                                                                                        4.

      Daniel stands up.  Stares at the suit.  After a moment:

                                      YOUNG GUARD (CONT'D)
                    I'm supposed to take your prison
                    clothes.

      With that, Daniel begins stripping.  Without any self-
      consciousness.  The Young Guard turns his back to Daniel to
      give him privacy.

      Daniel continues undressing and then stops and looks at the
      Young Guard.  It's the first time any guard has turned his
      back on Daniel in 19 years.  It is surreal to him.

                                      YOUNG GUARD (CONT'D)
                          (with back to Daniel)
                    Would you like something to drink?

                                      DANIEL
                    What?

                                      YOUNG GUARD
                    When I come back, I could bring you
                    something to drink.

      Daniel thinks about it.

                                      DANIEL
                    A coke.

                                      YOUNG GUARD
                    Ice?

      Pause.

                                      DANIEL
                    Sure. 

      All sounds stop.  The Young Guard cocks his head and then
      turns around. 

      Daniel stands there naked with his prison clothes held out
      for the Guard.  The Young Guard takes them and hands Daniel
      the new clothes then exits.  Daniel stares at the new clothes
      like they are a mirage.

      EXT. PRISON -- CONTINUOUS

      Just outside the prison walls, the circus of the PRESS CORP
      is setting up.  TALKING HEADS powdering their faces and
      warming up their mouths.  TECHNICIANS plugging in.  

      Daniel's Lawyer, JON STERN, early thirties, who works for
      the non-profit, JUSTICE ROW, is talking to a PRISON OFFICIAL.                                                                                         5.

                                    JON STERN
                          (to Prison Official)
                    First, I'll introduce Daniel and his
                    family--
                          (Jon's phone rings)
                    Excuse me, for a moment.
                          (answering phone)
                    Where are you?

      INT. HONDA CIVIC -- CONTINUOUS

                                      AMANTHA
                          (on phone to Jon)
                    Closer by the day.

    Jon and Amantha know each other very well from years of
      working together on Daniel's case.  

                                    JON STERN
                    If you don't get here soon, I may
                    have to recruit some people in the
                    crowd to play the family.

                                      AMANTHA
                    At least pick ones who are glad he's
                    still alive.

                                    JON STERN
                    Good idea.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Have you seen him?

                                    JON STERN
                    No.  Not yet.

                                      AMANTHA
                    But he got the suit?

                                    JON STERN
                    Yes.

                                      AMANTHA
                    I hope I don't fall apart.

                                    JON STERN
                    It's OK if you do.

                                      AMANTHA
                    It just doesn't seem real.

                                    JON STERN
                    I know.  To get released from death
                    row is a real miracle, Amantha.                                                                                          6.

                                      AMANTHA
                    I'm sure I should be grateful but it
                    just makes me madder that he was
                    there all this time.  For what?

      A Town Car pulls up.  

                                    JON STERN
                    Oh my God. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    What?

      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES gets out of the car.  The Media rush
      over to him.

                                    JON STERN
                    Roland Foulkes just showed up.

                                      AMANTHA
                    You're kidding me?  Why?

                                    JON STERN
                    Well, he didn't get to be Senator by
                    not looking out for his own interests.

                                      AMANTHA
                    No, he got to be Senator by
                      prosecuting my brother for a murder
                    he didn't commit.

                                    JON STERN
                          (in disbelief)
                    He's going to make a statement.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    That son of a bitch.

                                    JON STERN
                    Right here.  Wow.

    Jon Stern thought he'd seen it all.

      INT. DEATH ROW - FLASHBACK

      Close on WENDALL JELKS, a white man, masturbating.  Wendall
    was Daniel's Death Row Neighbor for nine years, five months
    and thirteen days.  

                                      WENDALL
                    Ahhhhhhh.  Ahhhhhh.  Ahhhhhh!

      Pleasure is etched on Wendall's face.  And then afterwards:

                                      WENDALL (CONT'D)
                    Hey Danny boy.  Top of the morning
                    to you.                                                                                         7.

      No answer.

                                      WENDALL (CONT'D)
                    I know you're awake, Danny.  You're
                    always awake.

      Daniel lies on his steel bed.  Eyes open.  The two men are
      in cells side by side.  They can't see each other.

                                      WENDALL (CONT'D)
                    Think you'd get tired of whacking
                    off to the same memories year after
                    year.  Ain't happened yet.

      Wendall cleans himself up.

                                      WENDALL (CONT'D)
                    OK, so if you didn't rape the girl,
                    slit her throat, and use her as fire
                    wood--and damn if I ain't beginning
                    to have my reasonable doubts, Dan. 
                    So what do you jack off to?  Memories
                    of ice cream?  The prom?

      Wendall cracks himself up.  After it dissipates, he says
      seriously.  Intimately.

                                      WENDALL (CONT'D)
                    Or maybe you just jack off to me
                    jacking off.  Maybe that's all you
                    got.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. HOLDING AREA -- PRESENT DAY

      Daniel stands there placidly, wearing the new suit and sipping
      the coke.  The Young Guard enters.

                                      YOUNG GUARD
                    They say it's pretty crazy out there.

      Daniel tries to imagine "out there".

                                      YOUNG GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Where's your tie?

                                      DANIEL
                    I.... uh... couldn't remember.

                                      YOUNG GUARD
                    Remember?

                                      DANIEL
                    How to... tie it.  It's a Windsor
                    knot, I think.  Or half-Windsor...                                                                                        8.

      Daniel tries to recall his lessons from childhood.

                                      YOUNG GUARD
                    I could tie it for you.

      Daniel looks up at him.

                                      YOUNG GUARD (CONT'D)
                    I don't know if it's a Windsor knot
                    but it's the kind I do on me.  You
                    know, for church.

      Daniel thinks about that.

                                      YOUNG GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Tie it on me then we transfer to
                    you.

                                      DANIEL
                    OK.

      Daniel pulls out the tie from his pocket.

      EXT. PRISON -- CONTINUOUS

      Senator Roland Foulkes speaks to the media.  

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Out of respect for the family of
                    Hanna Abbigail Dean, I felt it was
                    my obligation to make a statement
                    here and to make it today.  Almost
                    two decades ago, I prosecuted a case
                    where Miss Dean was brutally raped
                    and murdered.  New DNA testing is
                    not gonna change those facts nor
                    bring her back.  We must remember
                    that Hanna was only sixteen, a child
                    with her whole life in front of her. 
                    And that life was taken in the most
                    heinous manner I have personally
                    ever seen.    

      Jon's still on the phone with Amantha.

                                    JON STERN
                          (on phone)
                    The court of public opinion is in
                    session.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (on phone)
                    Couldn't he just let us have this
                    one day?

                                    JON STERN
                    No.                                                                                          9.

      INT. HOLDING AREA -- CONTINUOUS

      The Young Guard and Daniel stand face to face.  Daniel lowers
      his head as the Young Guard puts the tie on him.  

                                      YOUNG GUARD
                    I don't know who picked out your tie
                    but they got style.

      The Guard smiles.  The smallest of gestures but it's almost
      too much.  Daniel has to look away as the Guard completes
      the act.

      INT. GUARD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      A GROUP of GUARDS are focused on the television which is
      showing the Press Conference live. 

                                      REPORTER (V.O.)
                    Senator Foulkes, sources are saying
                    that Mr. Holden is still considered
                    a suspect in spite of the new DNA
                    evidence? 

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                          (on TV)
                    I can't make an official comment on
                    the case as that is the purview of
                    our current D.A.  But to clear up
                    any misinformation, it's important
                    to remember the DNA tests only
                    conclude that there was not a single
                      perpetrator as was first believed. 
                    That is, there is more than one sperm
                    sample and those tests couldn't
                    exclude Holden as a contributor.  

      The Young Guard escorts Daniel out of the holding cell and
      through the Guard Room.  Daniel stops at the TV and looks.  

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES (CONT'D)
                          (on TV)
                    Of course, there is still the other
                    solid evidence linking Holden to the
                    victim.  Hair, fibers.  Eye witnesses
                    to opportunity and so forth.  Even
                    now as an outside observer, I would
                    be shocked if Holden doesn't continue
                    to be a person of extreme interest.

      The Guards all look to Daniel who watches Senator Foulkes.

                                      DANIEL
                    He's aged.

      As Daniel starts to leave:                                                                                        10.

                                      LARGE GUARD 
                    Hey, Holden.

      Daniel stops and looks at the Large Guard.

                                      LARGE GUARD  (CONT'D)
                    You ain't fooling me for a minute.

      After a moment:

                                      DANIEL
                    No.  I'm not fooling you.

      The Young Guard takes Daniel through the door.

      EXT. PRISON -- LATER

      BELIEVERS of Daniel's innocence and BELIEVERS that he is a
      killer let their voices be heard.

      Jon Stern is leading Daniel's Family through the throng and
      toward the prison entrance.  Amantha is incensed.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Outside observer, my ass.

                                    JON STERN
                    The Senator is just being smart. 
                    Had he said that in your hometown, a
                    change of venue would have been
                    difficult to oppose.  Now he might
                    get to have his cake and eat it too.

                                      AMANTHA
                    And he sure does a fuck of a lot of
                      unofficial commenting.

                                    JON STERN
                    Laying the groundwork to re-indict
                    Daniel before he's even released. 
                    Plus now our press conference will
                    be tainted. 

      She sees the Senator speaking to a REPORTER.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Why don't I just walk over there and
                    kill him right now?  They can take
                    me straight to Death Row.  Skip the
                    middle man. 

      He takes her arm.

                                    JON STERN
                    Amantha, remember everything we do
                    is being watched and judged.                                                                                        11.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Can I at least flip him the bird?

                                    JON STERN
                    No.

      A PRISON OFFICIAL meets them at the Visitors' Gate and lets
      them inside the prison compound.

      INT. PRISON HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

      It's much quieter in here.  The Prison Official leads Janet,
      Amantha, Jon Stern, Ted Sr, Ted Jr, and Tawney toward a door.  

                                    JON STERN
                    Everyone can say their hellos to
                      Daniel--briefly-- and then we have
                    to go straight to the press
                      conference. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    Hellos and introductions, you mean. 
                    I don't know why these two are even
                    here.

      Meaning Ted JR and Tawney. 

                                    JON STERN
                    More family looks better.  Remember
                    just because he's getting out doesn't
                    mean this thing is over yet.  Already
                    events today would indicate we're
                    far from it.

      Amantha turns to Ted JR.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Just try and look like you give two
                    shits.

                                      JANET
                    Amantha, please.

      Ted JR shakes his head.  Amantha has never liked him.  From
      day one.

      Buttons are pushed and the steel door opens.  They walk
      through the threshold and there he is.  

      INT. PUBLIC ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      Daniel stands there in his new suit and holding his Coke. 
      No glass partition.  No door.  Nothing between them but air. 
      They all stop.  Speechless.

      And then Amantha rushes to Daniel and kisses him big on the
      cheek.  And then the other cheek.                                                                                          12.

      Her eyes are brimming with tears.  Her face stuck in a big
      grin. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    That suit fits you perfect.  Hot
                    damn.  I mean perfect.  And you are
                    perfect, brother.  You are so Goddamn
                    perfect. 

      She hugs him hard one last time and stands back to let her
      Mother come forward.

      Janet comes to her son.  She is composed.  Dignified.  She
      looks her son up and down.  She takes his hands.  Looks at
      them.  She hasn't touched him or been this close to him in
      years and years. 

                                      JANET
                    Hello, Daniel. 

      He smiles slightly and says kindly:

                                      DANIEL
                    Hello, Mama.

      She looks into his eyes.  Eyes just like hers.  And his slight
      smile.  Like hers.  And his reserve.  Just like hers.  And
      then suddenly from deep down in a hidden store of sorrow and
      grief comes gushing forth other worldly sounds that evolve
      into wails and sobs.   

                                      JANET
                    Ohhhhhh.  Ohhhhhh.  Ohhhhhh.  God. 
                    God.  God.  Goooddddddd!!!!  Oh! 
                    Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

      Janet's husband rushes to hold her up as her body heaves and
      retracts.  Amantha holds her too, softening her own years of
      resentment toward her mother as Janet's sobs and wails
      continue to grow in power.  

      Ted JR is dumbstruck at the sight.  He has never seen Janet
      lose control, even a little bit.  Tawney is so embarrassed
      that she looks at the floor.  But Jon Stern has seen this
      before.  Or something like this.  With other families.  He
        particularly watches a detached Daniel as he calmly pats his
      Mother's trembling hands while she weeps and weeps. 

                                                                                FADE OUT:

      EXT. PRISON -- LATER

      Jon Stern stands at a podium set up for the press conference. 
      Daniel stands beside him.  The family is behind them.  Janet 
      is in shock from her emotional outburst earlier.  She has a
      slight, pasted smile on her face.  Amantha holds her hand.                                                                                          13.

      Daniel looks behind him and sees Ted JR who smiles
      uncomfortably.

                                    TED JR
                    Pretty weird, huh?

                                      DANIEL
                    I would say so.

                                    TED JR
                    Hey look.  Sorry I never came for a
                    visit.  It's just... you know.

                                      DANIEL
                    I think I do know, Ted.

      Ted JR feels strangely revealed.  Daniel turns back around
      to the front as Jon Stern addresses the crowd.

                                    JON STERN
                    We are not here to play politics
                    today or to comment on the vulgar
                    theatrics earlier that I am still
                      absolutely agog over.  We are here
                    today because the State presented
                    evidence nearly two decades ago and
                    based on that evidence, Daniel Holden
                    was convicted of murder and sentenced
                    to death.  We are here today because
                    of the perverse miracle that Daniel
                    is still alive and because of the
                    outright fluke that crucial DNA
                    evidence was not thrown away or lost
                    or destroyed.

      During Jon Stern's speech, Daniel notices an OVERWEIGHT MAN
      in his thirties staring at him.  Daniel seems to recognize
      him.  The overweight man turns and walks away. 

                                    JON STERN (CONT'D)
                    We are here because after years of
                    fighting for the right to simply
                    test the DNA to establish if it was
                    Daniel's sperm or not, we finally
                      succeeded.  We are here because that
                    testing conclusively disputes that
                    there was a sole perpetrator or that
                    the sole perpetrator was Daniel Holden
                    as the State had claimed.  And
                    finally, we are here because justice
                    is, at least, temporarily being served
                    and Daniel Holden is going to be a
                    free man for the first time in nearly
                    twenty years.

      The majority of the crowd applauds.  There are some boos,
      too.                                                                                         14.

      Daniel looks up at the open sky, its ceiling so high.  Jon
      Stern gently touches him on the shoulder.  

                                    JON STERN (CONT'D)
                    Daniel?

      How long has Jon Stern been calling him?  Daniel looks at
      the microphone.  He steps forward.  He speaks quietly and
      humbly. 

                                      DANIEL
                    Hello.  Um... I'm not sure what to
                    think of this... drastic change of
                    course in my life.  I'm certainly
                    not against it.  Over the last two
                    decades, I have developed a strict
                    routine that I've followed
                      religiously, you might say.  A series
                    of mental and physical um... habits
                    or exercises that um... well...  A
                    way of living and thinking really,
                    or not thinking as was often the
                    point of the... well, the point.

      So many faces staring at him.  He looks at the ground.  

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    Um... this way of being didn't
                    encourage the contemplation that a
                    day like today could ever occur or a
                    tomorrow like tomorrow will, in fact,
                    be for me now.  I had convinced myself
                    over time that kind of optimism, or
                    what I regarded as fantasy really,
                    served no useful purpose in the world
                    where I existed.  Obviously, that
                    radical belief system was flawed,
                    and was, ironically, a kind of fantasy
                    itself... though it may have been
                    best to experience things that way
                    at the time.  I don't know now.  I
                    just don't know. 

      Daniel thinks about that for a moment and then:

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    At the least, I feel somewhat
                    confident those um... specific coping
                    skills were more suited for the life
                    there behind me.    

      Daniel looks behind him at the prison walls.  So odd to be
      on the outside looking in.  He turns back to all the people
      in front of him.                                                                                        15.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    And would not serve me so well for
                    the life in front of me.  So I will
                    need to seriously reconsider my world
                    view.

      Daniel starts snickering at the obviousness of his last
      statement.  Almost like an adolescent.  He catches himself
      and quits.  He then falls into a blank stare.  Jon Stern
      whispers into Daniel's ear.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                          (to Jon)
                    Yes.  Thank-you.
                          (to audience)
                    There are many people to thank.  My
                    mother and sister foremost for their
                    enduring love, devotion, and faith. 
                    All of my family and friends that...
                    I have.  My lawyer, Mr. Stern here
                    for his convictions and doggedness. 
                    Science obviously.  And not the least,
                    luck.  

      He looks to Jon Stern.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    That's all I have to say.

      Jon Stern steps forward.

                                    JON STERN
                    OK.  A few questions.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. PRISON -- DAY

      SHOT OF the Impala, Civic and the Land Cruiser driving out
      of the Prison grounds.  FLUME by Bon Iver quietly plays
      underneath as:

      INT. HONDA CIVIC -- CONTINUOUS

      Amantha drives Daniel home.  He watches things rush by him. 
      There is so much to take in.  Too much.  Daniel turns away
      from the window and stares at the floor board.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Are you getting car sick, Danny?

      He looks at her.  His sister.  Driving him home.  The last
      time he was in a car with her, she was twelve. 

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Danny?                                                                                        16.

                                      DANIEL
                    No.  I'm just sleepy.  I don't know
                    why.

                                      AMANTHA
                    You can sleep.  Why not?  I'll drive
                    with both hands.

      She made a joke.  He smiles at her.

                                      DANIEL
                    OK.

      He turns back toward the window trying to watch all that's
      passing by but his eyes grow too heavy.

      AERIAL SHOT OF:

      We track the tiny Civic through the countryside as Daniel
      sleeps and Amantha drives.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. TEBOW KITCHEN -- LATE AFTERNOON

      Janet and Amantha are preparing supper.  Amantha is gentle
      toward her mother now.  Janet, though still shaky, has
      regained most of her usual reserve.

                                      JANET
                    He slept the whole way? 

                                      AMANTHA
                    Like a rock.  All the way into the
                    garage.  

                                      JANET
                    So he didn't see the town?  Anything?

                                      AMANTHA
                    Not even the new Target.

      Janet thinks about Daniel's behavior.  What it means.  Or
      might mean.  It's too much for her right now. 

                                      JANET
                    Hand me the peas, dear.

      Amantha does.  She watches her mother washing the peas.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Mom?   

                                      JANET
                    Did you check the roast?                                                                                        17.

                                      AMANTHA
                    I did.

      Janet puts the peas in the pot.  

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Mom.

      Janet knows that tone.  She ignores her daughter.  

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    What happened to you today was OK. 
                    You know?

      Janet doesn't answer.  Just puts the pot on the stove.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    It was a long time coming, Mom.

      Janet doesn't want to discuss it.  Or think about it.  She
      checks the heat level.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    For God's sake, it was normal, Mom.

      Janet turns to her daughter.

                                      JANET
                    How is any of this normal?  How? 
                    You tell me that. 

      Her intensity surprises Amantha.

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                    Nothing about this has ever been
                    normal, Amantha.  It's not normal
                    now, and it never will be.  Never. 
                    And I'd just like to not talk about
                    it for a little while.  I would like
                    to simply make supper.

      Pause.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Sure, Mom.

      Janet goes to the refrigerator and pulls out the corn.  

                                    TED SR (O.S.)
                    Hello?  Anybody in here?

    We hear the front door closing.  Footsteps.

                                      JANET
                          (calling out)
                    Just us chickens.                                                                                        18.

      Ted SR walks into the kitchen.  He's followed by his and
      Janet's only child together:  JARED TEBOW, 14 years old with
      a definite resemblance to his half-brother, Daniel. 

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                    There's my buddy.

      Jared goes to his mother.  She kisses him and gives him a
      big hug.  He is her light.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Don't I get one?

      Jared mock-dutifully walks over to his half-sister.  She
      kisses him and holds him tight. 

                                    TED SR
                    Don't I get one?

                                      JANET
                    Go kiss your Dad.

                                      JARED
                    That's not what he means, Mom.

      Janet knew that.

                                      JANET
                    Oh.

      She kisses her husband.

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                    There's one for you, too.

                                    TED SR
                    Take what I can get.

      Ted SR looks over to Amantha and then back to Janet.  He
      senses the tension between them.

                                      JARED
                    Where is he?  He's in the house,
                    right?

      Jared's a little nervous about meeting his brother.

                                      AMANTHA
                    He is taking a hot bath, Jared.

                                      JARED
                    Oh.  That's cool.

      INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      Daniel lies in the bath tub.  With his big toe, he turns on
      the water.                                                                                          19.

      Daniel fiddles with it to get the water just right.  The water
      gushes out of the spigot.  Daniel closes his eyes.

                                      WHIMPERING INMATE (O.S.)
                    LET ME OUT OF HERE!  I CAN'T TAKE IT
                    ANYMORE!

      INT. DEATH ROW - FLASHBACK

      Daniel lies on his steel bed.  Eyes open.  Motionless.  It's
      the middle of the night. 

                                      WHIMPERING INMATE (O.S.)
                    OR KILL ME!  JUST KILL ME!

      It's not the first time this has played out.

                                      TOUGHER INMATE (O.S.)
                    I'll kill you, you little punk.  If
                    you don't shut the fuck up!

      The Inmate starts whimpering.

                                      WHIMPERING INMATE  (O.S.)
                    Oh Please!  I can't take it anymore!

      Another INMATE exactly mimics the WHIMPERING one.

                                      MIMICKING INMATE  (O.S.)
                          (exactly mimicking)
                    Oh Please!  I can't take it anymore!

                                      TOUGHER INMATE (O.S.)
                          (to mimicking inmate)
                    You better shut up, too, you punk!

                                      MIMICKING INMATE (O.S.)
                          (exactly mimicking)
                    You better shut up, too, you punk!

      Other inmates join in the screaming and yelling and banging.

                                      WENDALL
                    Hey Danny, boy.  Have you gone mad
                    yet?

      Daniel doesn't answer.

                                      WENDALL (CONT'D)
                    I can take the perverts and the kooks. 
                    It's the gorillas that try my
                    patience!

                                      TOUGHER INMATE (O.S.)
                          (to Wendall)
                    Shut up Wendall, you child murdering
                    chomo punk!                                                                                        20.

                          (calling back)
                    Oh great, a fucking ethicist on death
                    row. 

                                      TOUGHER INMATE (O.S.)
                          (to Wendall)
                    I'll kill you too, pervert!

                                      WENDALL
                    You're giving me doubts about
                      creationism, ape.  

                                      WHIMPERING INMATE (O.S.)
                    Please kill meeeeeee!  Pleassse!

                                      WENDALL
                    OK.  That's it.  Bananas for everyone!

      They are all in an UPROAR.  A frenzy.  Banging and screaming. 
      Wendall's laughter joins the CACOPHONY as underneath we hear:

                                    TED SR  (O.S.)
                    Dear Heavenly Father.  We thank you
                    for this most wonderful day.  

      INT. TEBOW DINING ROOM -- EVENING

      Janet, Amantha, Daniel and Jared sit at the dining table as
      Ted SR prays.  Everyone has their eyes closed but Daniel who
      is staring wide eyed at his younger brother.  It's like Daniel
      is seeing himself before the fall. 

                                    TED SR
                    We thank you for this miracle that
                    you have bestowed upon us.  

      Jared opens his eyes and finds Daniel fixed upon him.  It
      unnerves Jared and the 14 year old almost laughs.  He holds
      it in.  Barely.  Daniel just watches Jared with a benign
        fascination.  Unaware of his unnerving affect.

                                    TED SR (CONT'D)
                    We ask that you give us strength and
                    guidance as we begin the healing and
                    the rebuilding of this family.

      Jared doesn't understand Daniel's stare.  It scares him. 
      Finally he closes his eyes and bows his head again, still
      feeling the hot, hungry gape.  Daniel is utterly beguiled.

                                    TED SR (CONT'D)
                    We ask for wisdom as we go forward
                    into the uncertainty of the days
                    ahead.  

      CLOSE ON: Janet watching her oldest son watching her youngest.                                                                                        21.

                                    TED SR (CONT'D)
                    We ask you to bless this food to the
                      nourishment of our body.  And forgive
                    us of our sins.  In Jesus name we
                    pray.  A-men.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (raising head)
                    Very nice, Ted.

      Daniel looks over at Ted.  Almost mimicking Amantha.

                                      DANIEL
                    Very nice, Ted.

      Daniel said that too loud.  Everyone notices.

                                    TED SR
                    Thank you, Daniel.

      Daniel tries it again.  Quieter.  Almost to himself.

                                      DANIEL
                    Very nice, Ted.    

      There is an awkward pause.

                                      JANET
                    Well...

                                    TED SR
                    Everybody dig in.

      Everybody starts helping their plate but Daniel who is
      mesmerized by the food, the familial chatter, the delicate
      sound a silver serving spoon makes on china.     

                                    TED SR (CONT'D)
                    This sure looks good.  What do ya
                    think, buddy?

                                      JARED
                    Looks tasty, Mom. 

                                      JANET
                      Thank-you, Jared.

                                      JARED
                    You're welcome, Mom.

      For Daniel, the family gathering is a nearly intolerable
      contrast to the seven thousand solitary plastic dinners.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Can I help your plate, Danny?

      Daniel looks at his sister a little too long.                                                                                          22.

                                      DANIEL
                    Sure.  

      As Amantha helps his plate, Daniel sits there like an
      astronaut waiting for blastoff.

      INT. TED JR.'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      Ted JR and Tawney are in their king sized bed eating delivery
      pizza while watching the news on the big screen TV.

                                    TV REPORTER (O.S.)
                    Five times during his incarceration,
                    Mr. Holden had been scheduled to die
                    but each time his execution was stayed
                    through appeal.

      Ted JR pops open a beer.

                                    TED JR
                    I didn't remember it being five. 
                    Damn, that'll tighten your sphincter. 
                    Hand me another slice, baby.

      Tawney hands him a slice of pizza.

      EXT. PRISON -- NIGHT

      A TV Reporter stands outside the prison.  Intercut with Ted
      JR and Tawney.

                                    TV REPORTER
                    Holden seemed unnerved by all the
                      attention, sometimes losing his train
                    of thought, other times laughing, in
                    what has been characterized, as
                      inappropriate to the situation.   

                                    TED JR
                          (agreeing)
                    It was weird.

      Cut to a clip of Daniel answering questions.  The family is
      seen behind Daniel.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    There you are.  See?

      Tawney nods.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    God.  Mom--I mean, Janet freaked
                    out, didn't she?

                                      TAWNEY
                    Sssh.                                                                                        23.

      Ted JR looks at Tawney.  She stays focused on the TV.

                                    TV REPORTER
                          (on TV)
                    Daniel, you don't appear to be very
                    happy at being released. 

                                      DANIEL
                          (on TV)
                    Uh... there is a lot to process right
                    now.  I will probably be happier
                    later.

                                    TV REPORTER
                          (on TV)
                    But aren't you even angry that the
                    state took so much of your life from
                    you?  

                                      DANIEL
                          (on TV)
                    Well...

                                    TV REPORTER
                    If you didn't commit this crime,
                    then how can you not be enraged at
                    the injustice of your incarceration?

                                      DANIEL
                          (on TV)
                    Um... I'm not sure.  Perhaps I will
                    be angrier later as I will be happier.

      He meant that sincerely but some in the crowd laugh.  Daniel
      looks curiously at them.  

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                          (on TV)
                    I hope not at the same time though.

      More laughter. 

                                    TED JR
                    I hate to say this but it was almost
                    like he was playing for laughs
                      sometimes.

                                      TAWNEY
                    I don't think so.  He just sees things
                      differently.

                                    TED JR
                      Seriously, did you understand half
                    of what he said in that speech today? 

                                      TAWNEY
                    A lot of it.                                                                                        24.

                                    TED JR
                    Yeah right.

                                      TAWNEY
                    I did.

                                    TED JR
                    Let's watch something else.  This is
                    giving me the creeps.  

      Ted JR changes the channel.  Tawney looks at Ted JR.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    Just messing with you.

      He changes back.

      INT. NURSING HOME -- CONTINUOUS

      A sick, ancient WHITE MAN with tubes in his nose watches the
      same channel.  Milky blue eyes wide open. 

                                    TV REPORTER (O.S.)
                    The murder that tore a town apart
                    nearly twenty years ago will likely
                    do so again as this case is far from
                    over.  

      The Old Man wheezes with every breath.

                                    TV REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    There's even talk that little Hanna
                    may be exhumed from her resting place.

      The Old Man looks haunted.

      INT. TEBOW FAMILY ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      CLOSE ON: Daniel.

      He is watching the first LORD OF THE RINGS.  He looks
      bombarded.  Ted SR and Jared watch with him.

      INT. TEBOW KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

      Amantha and Janet are cleaning up the kitchen.  Amantha peeks
      into the Family Room at Daniel.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (quietly)
                    I hope that's not too over stimulating
                    for him.

                                      JANET
                    Might be a good distraction.

      Amantha's phone rings.                                                                                         25.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Mama, I got to get this.

                                      JANET
                    OK.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (walking away)
                    Hello?

      Amantha takes her purse with her and heads out of the house. 
      Daniel turns and watches her leave.

      EXT. TEBOW HOUSE -- NIGHT

                                      AMANTHA
                          (on phone)
                    No, I haven't seen anything tonight
                    but snatches of LORD OF THE RINGS.

      Amantha fumbles in her purse for a cigarette.

      INT. EXTENDED STAY MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

      Jon Stern lies on the bed with the TV on and the sound off.

                                    JON STERN
                    Well, ours was the big story of the
                    day especially with the Senator's
                      grandstanding.  

                                      AMANTHA
                          (lighting up)
                    Is it good for us to be the big story
                    of the day or not? 

                                    JON STERN
                    I could argue either side.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Of course.

      Amantha takes a long drag.  She's exhausted.  So is Jon Stern.

                                    JON STERN
                    Nancy Grace called.  Well, her people
                    did.

                                      AMANTHA
                    No.  No way.

                                    JON STERN
                    I know.  Just had to let you know.

                                      AMANTHA
                    You saw him today.  He's... He's
                      overloaded.                                                                                        26.

                                    JON STERN
                    Yeah.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Daniel needs some time alone.  Well
                    not alone but... but not with Nancy
                    Grace either.  God.

                                    JON STERN
                    How is he doing?

                                      AMANTHA
                    Staring at silverware like he hasn't
                    seen any in twenty years.  Staring
                    at his younger brother who he's never
                    seen, staring at me, and at bright
                    shiny things in general.

                                    JON STERN
                    I bet.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Why couldn't Ted Junior be wrongly
                    convicted and spend more than half
                    of his life on death row?  He'd
                    probably come out fine.

      That makes Jon laugh.

                                    JON STERN
                    That might be a little harsh. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    No it's not.

                                    JON STERN
                    I can't imagine you and Ted JR living
                    in the same house as adolescents.

                                      AMANTHA
                    We had to share a bathroom, too.  So
                    gross.

      Makes Jon laugh more.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    It's not funny.

                                    JON STERN
                    Of course not.

                                      AMANTHA
                    In hindsight maybe but I need therapy
                    just for those three years alone.

                                    JON STERN
                    Post traumatic Ted syndrome.                                                                                        27.

      She starts laughing too.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Yes.  And so under reported.

      It's a nice release for them after today.  The black humor
      and the laughter.  Daniel starts laughing too.  Behind her. 
      In the dark.  It startles Amantha.  

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Oh hey, Daniel.
                          (to Jon)
                    Gotta go.

      She disconnects.  Daniel is still laughing.  

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    I didn't hear you come out, honey.

      He sees she is unnerved.  He stops laughing.

                                      DANIEL
                    I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to... scare
                    you.

                                      AMANTHA
                    No.  It's OK.  You didn't scare me.

                                      DANIEL
                    I wasn't here long...  I just walked
                    out and saw you laughing and it made
                    me laugh.  I'm sorry.

                                      AMANTHA
                    No, it's OK.

      He looks at her with that look of his.  Like he's eating the
      sight of her up.  But she's so frazzled from it all, she
      looks away.

                                      DANIEL
                    You're tired, aren't you?

                                      AMANTHA
                    What?  No.  I'm good.

                                      DANIEL
                    I know you're good. 

      She smiles. 

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    Could you drive me around town?

                                      AMANTHA
                    Now?                                                                                        28.

                                      DANIEL
                    Just for a little while.  I don't
                    think I want to see it in the
                    daylight.  Not at first.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    Oh.  Of course.  Let's tell Mom.

      INT. TEBOW FAMILY ROOM -- NIGHT

      Janet is alone watching the news.  More of the day's events. 
      The sound is on real low.  A door opens.  She turns.  It's
      Jared.  She mutes the TV.

                                      JARED
                    Where'd they go?

                                      JANET
                    Just riding around.

      She changes the channel.

                                      JARED
                    Mom, I'm gonna see all this stuff. 
                    There's no way to avoid it.

                                      JANET
                    How about just for one night, you
                    don't see it?

                                      JARED
                    I feel he should have his room back,
                    Mom.

                                      JANET
                    No.  That's your room now. 

                                      JARED
                    But it was his before and it's not
                    like he went off to college.

                                      JANET
                    Jared, Daniel wanted you to have the
                    room.

                                      JARED
                    He told you that?

                                      JANET
                    Yes.  A long time ago.  It made him
                    very happy to know you were in there.

                                      JARED
                    He didn't hardly say anything to me
                    tonight.

      She turns off the TV.                                                                                        29.

                                      JANET
                    He doesn't know how to, honey.

                                      JARED
                    Yeah.  I kinda don't either.

                                      JANET
                    Nobody does.  We'll just all learn
                    together.  OK?

                                      JARED
                    OK.

      Pause.

                                      JANET
                    Want to sit in my lap for a little
                    bit?

                                      JARED
                    God, Mom.  I'm fourteen.

                                      JANET
                    Right.  Right.  I forgot.  How about
                    squeezing in beside me then?  For
                    old time's sake.  

      He is intrigued.

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                    Dad's chair is big enough.  Come on.

                                      JARED
                    OK.

      He squeezes in beside his mother in Ted SR's big chair.

      They sit there together.  The phone rings.  Jared starts to
      get up.

                                      JANET
                    Your Dad will get it.

      It rings again.  Janet stares into the past.  Remembering. 
      The ringing stops.

      INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

      THREE MEN sit in a conference room.  First term SHERIFF,
      CARL DAGGETT 46.  His dad, former Circuit Judge and current
      Mayor, JOHNNY DAGGETT 66, and former SHERIFF, CJ PICKENS,
      63.  All these men were involved in the original prosecution
      of Daniel.

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                    You see him talking today?  Never
                    once said, "I didn't do it."                                                                                        30.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    No.  Not once, Pop.

      The former Sheriff speaks up.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Yeah, but there's a little bit of a
                    hole in the case now, Mister Mayor. 
                    There was multiple semen samples on
                    that girl's panties.  

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                      I guarantee you one was Holden's.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    But that can't be proven for sure,
                    can it Sheriff Daggett?

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                    We know that, CJ, and nobody's
                    deciding anything tonight. 

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Deciding what?  Don't the new DA got
                    a say in this?

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                    She's gonna be brought in.  

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    But not tonight.

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                    No.

      CJ waits.

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT (CONT'D)
                    Look, Trey Warren said the girl slept
                    around a little bit. 

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    That Warren boy said a lot of things
                    back then depending on which way the
                    wind was blowing.

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                          (ignoring that)
                    It's reasonable to think a couple of
                    them other boys coulda had intercourse
                    with her.  Doesn't mean they killed
                    her.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Don't mean they didn't.                                                                                        31.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    The son of a bitch confessed, CJ.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    It was thrown out, Carl. 
                      Inadmissible.  Remember?

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    I don't give a shit.  Why would a
                    person confess to something they
                    didn't do?

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    You've had 19 years to think on that
                    and you ain't figured out an answer
                    other than "he did it" yet?

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    Meaning what?

      CJ doesn't answer.

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                    Look CJ, there's still a lot of
                    evidence pointing to Holden being
                    involved in the crime.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Evidence that your son here helped
                    gather.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    Under a lot of pressure from you to
                    find some.  And you was mighty damn
                    happy when we did.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    All I wanted from you was good, solid
                      investigative work.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    It's easy to say that now, ain't it?  

      CJ looks away.  It is easier to say that now.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Be honest, I got my doubts that Holden
                    boy was even involved now.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    I damn sure don't have any doubts
                    that he did it.  Alone or not.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES (O.S.)
                    I don't either.

      Roland Foulkes has arrived.                                                                                          32.

      INT. HONDA CIVIC -- NIGHT

      Amantha and Daniel are riding around the town of Paulie,
      GA., population 12,731.  Only a few businesses are open at
      this hour-9:30PM.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    The Dairy Queen's still here.  But
                    Hardee's closed down.  

      Daniel watches the buildings go by.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Not long after you got your license,
                    you took me to Hardee's.  Remember?

      He tries to remember.

                                      DANIEL
                    No, I don't.  I'm sorry.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (making light)
                    It wasn't very memorable.

      He looks over at a store called WILDCAT VIDEO.  Its lights
      are out.

                                      DANIEL
                    How long's the video store been here?

                                      AMANTHA
                    It was here about fifteen years.  

                                      DANIEL
                    Was?

                                      AMANTHA
                    It's been out of business for a year
                    or so.

      That's curious to Daniel.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    The highlight of the town now is the
                    new Target.

                                      DANIEL
                    What's a Target?

                                      AMANTHA
                    You are.

      Daniel stares at her.                                                                                        33.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I don't know
                    why I said that.  It just came out.

      Daniel smiles.  

                                      DANIEL
                    You're a funny sister.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Oh, thank God.  You got it. 

      A MAN walking down the sidewalk stops and stares at Daniel
      like he's a movie star.  Right here in Paulie.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    It's how I deal. 

                                      DANIEL
                    Gallows humor.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Exactly.  Of course, you would know
                    about that.  I mean... God, there I
                    go again.

                                      DANIEL
                    We call it a lethal injection of
                    humor.  It's more humane but not as
                    funny.

      It's delayed but Amantha starts laughing.  Daniel smiles at
      her.

      INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

      Roland is now seated with the rest of the men.

 SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Look CJ, we knew this day was coming
                    once the DNA results came back and
                    that it would have ramifications for
                    the entire community--especially us.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    That I clearly understand, Roland.

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                    We just want to know if Holden is re-
                    indicted by the new D.A based on the
                    evidence--

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    And who's gathering that evidence? 
                    The Sheriff's office?  Talk about
                    getting bit on the ass again.                                                                                        34.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    We're asking the State to come in to
                    oversee the investigation.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Are you handling that, Roland?

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    I'm not gonna dignify that with an
                    answer.

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                    We wanta get the right man or men. 
                    That's all.  Period.

      CJ thinks about all this.  It's damn complicated.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    So what do you want from me?  

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Just wanted to make sure you weren't
                    holding any ill will toward Carl--

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Why?  That he's now Sheriff, in large
                    part, because he hung his hat on one
                    damn case that's now falling apart?

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    And you didn't hang your hat on it
                    as Sheriff for all those years?

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    I guess not enough for one more term.

      There it is.  The Senator mediates.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Look CJ, maybe Carl shoulda waited
                    four more years before running. 
                    Nobody's arguing that.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    You think so?

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    But he didn't.  And what's done is
                    done.  

      The former Sheriff knows what they want.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    I'm not gonna interfere with things. 
                    I'm retired.  Remember?                                                                                          35.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    You might even have to testify at
                    some point.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    No kidding.

      Mayor Johnny looks to the Senator.

                                      MAYOR JOHNNY DAGGETT
                    Well, that's it then.  Just wanted
                    to clear the air, CJ. 

      CJ gets up to leave.  It's been a long day for him, too.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Where is Holden at anyway?

      Carl cuts an eye to his Dad.  And then:

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    At his Mama's.

                    He's not moving back here, is he?

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    We don't know.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Good God.

      CJ takes a breath.  Just a bad situation all the way around.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS (CONT'D)
                    Bit of advice from an old Sheriff.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    You bet, CJ.

                                      FORMER SHERIFF CJ PICKENS
                    Try and avoid arresting him for
                    anything.  Like rolling stops, jay-
                    walking, shit like that.  He's got a
                    whole new crowd repping him now. 
                    And they're playing to win.

      CJ leaves.  The men look at each other but don't say anything.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. JANET'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      Janet and Ted SR are in bed.  They are not asleep.

                                      JANET
                    Did the person say anything?                                                                                        36.

                                    TED SR
                    No, and the ID said "unknown caller".

      Janet thinks about that. 

                                    TED SR (CONT'D)
                    You know what they say, it's the
                    ones who don't call that you have to
                    worry about.

                                      JANET
                    I feel better now, Ted.  Thank-you.

      He pulls her close.

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                    You should have heard some of the
                    things people said the first time. 
                    Very creative.

                    We're gonna get through this, Jannie.

      She's not so sure.

                                      JANET
                    Let's just keep this between us for
                    now.  OK?

                                    TED SR
                    OK.

      EXT. PAULIE -- LATER

      The town is closed up.  No cars out except Amantha's Civic
      which moves slowly through town.

      INT. HONDA CIVIC -- CONTINUOUS

      Amantha's phone rings.  She answers quickly. 

                                      AMANTHA
                            (whispering)
                    Hello.

      INTERCUT

                                      JANET
                    It's after twelve.

                                      AMANTHA
                    I know. 

                                      JANET
                    What are y'all doing?                                                                                        37.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Driving around.

                                      JANET
                    Why are you whispering?

                                      AMANTHA
                    Daniel's asleep.

      Daniel is indeed asleep in the other seat.

                                      JANET
                    Are you gonna drive him around all
                    night?

                                      AMANTHA
                    Probably not.

                                      JANET
                    Well, I'm not gonna worry then.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    No.  Go on to sleep. 

      Amantha disconnects and drives on as her brother sleeps.

      Up ahead is a Sheriff's Car parked at the train depot.  An
      old fear grips Amantha.

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                          (quietly)
                    I'm not breaking the law, you asshole.

      She moves closer to the Sheriff's car, deliberately not
      looking over.

      INT. SHERIFF'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

      Sheriff Daggett watches a sleeping Daniel and a driving
      Amantha go past him.

      INT. HONDA CIVIC -- CONTINUOUS

      Amantha sees the Sheriff's car pull out and move in behind
      her.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (quietly)
                    You've gotta be kidding me? 

      If she gets pulled over, she doesn't know how Daniel will
      react.  He could freak the fuck out or sleep through it.

      EXT. PAULIE -- CONTINUOUS

      The Sheriff follows Amantha.  Not too close but just close
      enough.  Nice and easy.                                                                                        38.

      INT. HONDA CIVIC -- CONTINUOUS

      Amantha can't decide whether to wake Daniel up to prepare
      him or chance it that they won't get pulled over.  She looks
      over to him.  He looks so innocent.

      Suddenly the Sheriff's car stops.  Right in the middle of
      the road.

      INT. HONDA CIVIC -- CONTINUOUS

      Amantha looks in her rear view mirror as the Sheriff's car
      stays at a dead stop in the road while she keeps heading out
      of town.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    Fucking juvenile.

      Juvenile yes but it worked.  Amantha is shaken as she drives
      into the darkness beyond the town.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. ALAPAHA RIVER -- PRE-DAWN

      A red rim lays just behind the live oaks that overhang the
      primordial brown river.  The calm waters creep along as if
      the river itself is just waking.  Morning doves quietly call
      each other.  A fish rolls in the shallows exposing its white
      belly to the sun. 

      We PULL BACK to find Daniel standing on the sand bar of an
      old swimming hole.  A place where generations of kids have
      come to swim and to play.  To be kids.  His back is to us as
      his bare feet dig into the sand.

      The red glow grows to orange as the sun makes its inexorable
      daily rise.

      We are in front of Daniel now.  Pushing in.  His face is
      impassive.  Unreadable.  Unreachable.  As we push in closer
      and closer into his face, the sun breaks.  We can see it. 
      The golden sun rising.  Right there in his eyes.  But the
      spark we see is from the outside.  He remains opaque.

      EXT. HONDA CIVIC -- LATER

      The Civic is parked a ways back from the swimming hole. 
      Amantha has her seat in recline.  She is asleep with Daniel's
      jacket over her.  The sun hits her face.  She slowly wakes
      up.  Looks beside her.  Daniel's not there. 

                                      DANIEL (O.S.)
                    Good morning.

      Daniel is leaning on the car.  Watching the sun on the river. 
      His back is to her.                                                                                        39.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Good morning.  You like?

                                      DANIEL
                    Yes.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Your first day.  I thought this might
                    be the perfect place.

                                      DANIEL
                    Yes. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    I wanted it to be special for you,
                    honey.

      Pause.

                                      DANIEL
                    It is that.  Lotta um... texture.

      And then: 

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                      Thank-you, Amantha.  For everything. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    You're quite welcome, brother.  Any
                    time.

                                                                                FADE OUT:

      INT. PAULIE TIRE AND RIM COMPANY -- MORNING

      Ted SR is at the counter of a clean, well kept tire store. 
      There are both car and truck tires displayed.  The rims range
      from the huge ones used for truck boggin' to the kind that
      spin on the streets.  Serving both red and blue constituents. 

      The door opens.  It's Ted JR. 

                                    TED JR
                    Sorry, I'm late.

                                    TED SR
                    Yep.

                                    TED JR
                    Couldn't sleep last night.  Wound up
                    like a top.

                                    TED SR
                    Yep.

                                    TED JR
                    Then me and Tawney got in a big fight.                                                                                        40.

      Ted SR glances at his son grabbing a donut that's supposed
      to be for the customers.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    You see all that coverage?

                                    TED SR
                    Some of it.

                                    TED JR
                    Boy, it's controversial.

                                    TED SR
                    It's that.

      Ted JR looks at the day's schedule. 

                                    TED JR
                    When do you think he's gonna start
                    working here?

                                    TED SR
                    Whenever he wants to. 

      Ted JR looks at his father.

                                    TED JR
                    Dad, the minute he steps in this
                    store, at least half the people who
                    do business here will stop coming. 

      Ted SR doesn't respond.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    I just wanted you to be aware of
                    that. 

                                    TED SR
                    I am aware of that.

                                    TED JR
                    And a fifty percent cut in revenue
                    will not support two households.

                                    TED SR
                    I'm aware of that, too.

                                    TED JR
                    Much less three.

      Ted SR walks away.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    Look, maybe if we tell him the
                      situation--                                                                                        41.

                                    TED SR
                    No sir.

                                    TED JR
                    But Dad, he deserves to have all the
                      information to make an informed
                    decision. 

                                    TED SR
                      Absolutely not, Teddy.  This is his
                    family's business not ours.  We just
                    married into it.  If he wants to
                    come work here, that's his right. 
                    We can't put that kinda weight on
                    him.  Not with everything else he's
                    had to deal with in his life.

      Ted JR looks out the window.  

                                    TED JR
                    Well, I might as well start looking
                    for a job right now.

      Ted SR says nothing.

                                    TED JR (CONT'D)
                    Hell, you may have to start looking
                    for one, too.

      Ted SR looks at his son.

      INT. MARCY'S CAFE -- MORNING

      Sheriff Carl Daggett sits at a table in the back corner
      reading the Atlanta paper.  He looks up when he hears:

                                      PORTLY MAN (O.S.)
                    Saw your speech on TV, Senator.  Me
                    and the wife still believe in you.

      Roland speaks to a PORTLY MAN at the front of the Diner.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Preciate it, Sam.

      Roland moves on.  Joins Carl.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES (CONT'D)
                          (quietly)
                    One vote at a fucking time.  Every
                    time.  Where's your Daddy?

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    He's got belly problems.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Who ain't?                                                                                        42.

      MARCY, late 40's and on the tail end of cute, comes up with
      coffee.  Pours it.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES (CONT'D)
                    You're a sight for sore eyes, Marcy.

                                      MARCY
                    Whatcha gonna have, Sweetie?

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Everybody else calls me Senator. 
                    You call me Sweetie.

                                      MARCY
                    That's cause I've known you as Sweetie
                    a lot longer than I have known you
                    as Senator.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Now that's a fact.  Get me the Wildcat
                      Breakfast.  Extra Sausage.  

                                      MARCY
                    You got it, Senator Sweetie.

      She sashays off.  Carl watches Roland watching her.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    You ain't tapping that again, are
                    you?

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Naw, I'm on the wagon.
                          (calling out)
                    Extra biscuits too, Marcy!  

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    Thought you had belly problems.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                      Perception, Sheriff.  I'm gonna eat
                    like I don't have a care in the world.

      The Senator loads up his coffee with sugar.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                          (re/newspaper)
                    You seen the front page of the Atlanta
                    Journal?

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Two hours ago. 

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    Feelings hurt?                                                                                        43.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    Tickled pink.  Having the big city
                    paper attacking me is an asset not a
                      liability.

      And then quietly.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES (CONT'D)
                    Now tell me what you know about our
                    new D.A.

                                      SHERIFF CARL DAGGETT
                    Well, you'll probably want to fuck
                    her.

                                      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES
                    May be.  But I learned that lesson
                    the hard way.  Never shit where you
                    eat.

      WIDE SHOT OF:

      A Toyota Tundra moves down a country road.  The truck pulls
      off the road and down a one lane road.  

      INT. TUNDRA -- CONTINUOUS

      TREY WARREN, 36, is driving.  There is a clearing ahead. 
      Trey sees another man standing by a lone tree.  

      It's GEORGE MEDLOCK 34, overweight.  George is the man seen
      earlier at Daniel's press conference.  Trey pulls up to George
      and gets out. 

      EXT. CLEARING -- CONTINUOUS

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Funny place to have a reunion.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    Not so funny.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    How's Florida?

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    I don't care for it.  

      Trey looks around.  Perplexed.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Where's your car, Georgie?

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    I took the bus.  Make sure I wasn't
                    being followed.                                                                                        44.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    By who?

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    Now they know what they didn't know.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Yeah, it's kinda big news around
                    here.

      George looks at Trey.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    Did you kill her, Trey?

      Trey looks straight at George.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    No.  

      And then:

                                    TREY WARREN (CONT'D)
                    Did you, Georgie?  

      George looks away. 

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    No.

      The years haven't been kind to George. 

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK (CONT'D)
                    They're gonna want to talk to us
                    again.  Put us on the stand, I guess.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Oh yeah.  It's gonna be a real big
                    deal.  Just like before... except
                    they may go after more than one person
                    this time.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    I think about it a lot.  

                                    TREY WARREN
                    That's always been your problem.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    But I get stuff mixed up.  What they
                    told us.  What I remember.  What I
                    think I remember.  I don't know which
                    is which anymore.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    You'd better review then.                                                                                          45.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    We were just kids.  It wasn't real
                    then.  

      Trey is noncommittal.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes I think about what it would
                    be like to talk to him.  You know? 
                    Maybe even go fishing with him.  

                                    TREY WARREN
                    That's not how the world works.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    No.

      George looks at Trey.  Pain in his eyes.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK (CONT'D)
                    What are you gonna do, Trey?

                                    TREY WARREN
                    Tell the truth.

                                      GEORGE MEDLOCK
                    What is the truth?

      Trey doesn't blink.

                                    TREY WARREN
                    What I said before.  Change now at
                    your own peril. 

      Trey stands there unyielding.  George stands there weighed
      down.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      WIDE SHOT

      The Tundra drives away leaving George standing there all
      alone. 

      INT. EXTENDED STAY MOTEL -- DAY

      Jon talks through his phone ear piece as he packs.

                                    JON STERN
                    It's called "the unindicted co-
                      ejaculator theory".  

      EXT. TEBOW BACK YARD -- DAY

      Amantha is on the phone, furtively smoking a cigarette.                                                                                        46.

                                      AMANTHA
                    I'm sorry?

      INTERCUT WITH JON STERN

                                    JON STERN
                    Exactly.  The term was coined by
                      prosecutors trying to get around the
                    Pandora's Box of DNA.  Case in
                      Mississippi right now where a man
                    was freed on bond after fifteen years
                    on death row for a rape and murder
                      conviction when DNA testing showed
                    the sperm wasn't his. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    Hmmm.  Sounds familiar.

                                    JON STERN
                    Actually more cut and dry than our
                    case.  There was only one sperm sample--
                    not the condemned man's.  And yet,
                    he will be retried for that murder.

                                      AMANTHA
                    How thrilling.

      Jon goes to the cheap desk, digs through his papers.

                                    JON STERN
                    The D.A. said: 
                          (reading)
                    "Whether the defendant actually
                      penetrated that child or not,
                      functionally doesn't make any
                      difference if he was aiding,
                      assisting, and encouraging in her
                    death."

                                      AMANTHA
                    That's our ticket out.

                                    JON STERN
                    What is?  

                                      AMANTHA
                      "Encouraging in her death."  Daniel's
                    not a rah-rah kind of fella.

      Jon shakes his head.

                                    JON STERN
                    There are other evidentiary issues
                    I'm more concerned about.                                                                                        47.

                                      AMANTHA
                    Hanna had been Daniel's girlfriend,
                    Jon.  Of course, they found
                      evidentiary shit.

                                    JON STERN
                      I understand but--

                                      AMANTHA
                    What's your point?

                                    JON STERN
                    My point is, there's a hundred
                    different ways prosecution can
                    convince a jury that Daniel was still
                    a part of this no matter what the
                    DNA does or doesn't say.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    That's right.  Because they're in
                    the convincing business, Jon.  That's
                    what they do.  First, they convince
                      themselves, then they convince anybody
                    necessary by any means necessary
                    including sometimes the defendants
                      themselves.  All you have to do, Jon--
                    if it comes down to it--is to convince
                    one out of twelve people on a jury
                    that the prosecutors are full of
                    shit.  

      Amantha sits down.  

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have--

                                    JON STERN
                    No you're right.  I sometimes forget--

                                      AMANTHA
                    What?  That I'm just the sister?

                                    JON STERN
                    No, of course not.  It's just that...
                    I'm coming down tomorrow.

      That stops her momentum. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    Really?  Already?

                                    JON STERN
                          (and then)
                      Rutherford Gaines has lung cancer. 

                                      AMANTHA
                    Yeah, I heard the good news.                                                                                        48.

                                    JON STERN
                    I don't want to regret anything later
                    I could have asked him.

                                      AMANTHA
                    The only thing I regret was that he
                    was Daniel's lawyer in the first
                    place.  Talk about a chicken shit.

                                    JON STERN
                    I think he regrets it now, too.  

                                      AMANTHA
                    "Old man regrets."  Hollow and too
                    fucking late.

      Amantha softens.  A little...

                                      AMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Anyway, you can be here for Mom's
                    lame Welcome Home Party.

                                    JON STERN
                    Oh now.

                                      AMANTHA
                      Admittedly less lame with you
                      attending.

                                    JON STERN
                    Thanks, I think.

                                      AMANTHA
                          (sincerely)
                    I'm glad you're coming down, Jon. 
                    And real glad you're on our side.

                                    JON STERN
                    Me too, Amantha.

      INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      Daniel is in the tub soaking.  Watching the bubbles gather
      around his knees.

                                      DANIEL
                          (to self)
                    Of human bondage.

                                      VOICE
                    Of human bondage?!                                                                                        49.

      INT. DEATH ROW - FLASHBACK 

      KERWIN WHITMAN, an African-American man in his late twenties,
      is standing up in his cell on Death Row.  

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    You want me to read a book called OF
                    HUMAN BONDAGE?!  I'll pass.  Don't
                    want to know any more on that
                      particular subject.

      Daniel is reading Somerset Maugham's OF HUMAN BONDAGE.

                                      DANIEL
                    It's another kind of bondage.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    I would hope so.

                                      DANIEL
                    Or not.

      Kerwin walks around his cell some.  Daniel reads some more. 
      Conversations here don't keep a certain pace.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    I'll be glad when you get past your
                    dead white men writing about a lily
                    white Europe stage.  White on white. 
                    Day and night.

                                      DANIEL
                    I am kind of on a jag.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    You ought to sprinkle in a little
                      author-author brother-brother from
                    time to time.

                                      DANIEL
                    Sure.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    Got one I think you'll appreciate,
                    too.  It ain't modern either.  It's
                    about black folks owning slaves in
                    the South before the Civil War.  

                                      DANIEL
                    Curious.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    You know, when in Rome.

                                      DANIEL
                    I'm hooked already.                                                                                        50.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    OK.  Then I'll give your dead Somerset
                    Maugham a shot when you're done.

                                      DANIEL
                    It's yours.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    But if it don't-- But if it doesn't
                    grab me early, I'm setting it down.

                                      DANIEL
                    No rules in the club that's not a
                    club.

      Kerwin sits.  Contemplative. 

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    Daniel, I made up my mind.

      Daniel looks up from his book.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm waving the rest of my appeals. 
                      Shortening the exit.

      Daniel's silence feels like words.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN (CONT'D)
                    I can't do time like you do it.  I
                    tried, man.  It's unbearable being
                    in this tomb alive.  Day after day. 
                    Year after year.  For how long?  And
                    I did what they say I did.  That's
                    never gonna change so...

                                      DANIEL
                    Well...

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    I'm not looking for advice.  Just
                    telling you my plans.

      Daniel doesn't respond.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN (CONT'D)
                    I mean, you can say something.

                                      DANIEL
                    I don't really know what to say other
                    than I would miss you beyond words.

                                      KERWIN WHITMAN
                    I know, partner.  I know.                                                                                        51.

      INT. TEBOW KITCHEN -- DAY

      Janet sits at the kitchen table typing on her notebook
      computer.  Daniel walks in.  Hair still wet from the bath. 
      Stands in the middle of the kitchen. 

                                      JANET
                    Hungry?

                                      DANIEL
                    I think I'd like a beer.

      Janet hesitates.

                                      JANET
                    Oh... uh... Teddy should have one or
                    two in the frig.  Sometime's he stops
                    by for a visit.

                                      DANIEL
                    Would he mind?

                                      JANET
                    Of course not.

      Daniel gets one.  He walks over to Janet as she navigates on
      the computer.  

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                    I'm paying bills.

      He watches.

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                    Sit down if you'd like.

      He does.

                                      DANIEL
                    I don't think I want to become
                    computer literate. 

      He looks outside at Amantha talking on her phone and smoking
      like a chimney.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    Or mobile phone literate really.

                                      JANET
                    Might be a little much all at once.                                                                                        52.

                                      DANIEL
                    I'd like to get a TV with a movie
                    player though... a DVD player.

                                      JANET
                    We can do that.

                                      DANIEL
                    I'll pay you back when I start
                    working.

                                      JANET
                    Don't be silly.  

                                      DANIEL
                    OK.

                                      JANET
                    No.  I mean, we have one already.

                                      DANIEL
                    I see.

      She goes back to paying bills.  He takes a swallow of his
      beer.  Contemplates it then sets it down.  

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    We didn't have TVs on death row. 
                    Some state's death rows do, some
                    don't.  Luck of the draw, I guess.

      Janet looks up.  She doesn't know what to say.  

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    I think it worked out better for me. 
                    I liked to read.  Kinda tough on the
                    guys who didn't or couldn't.    

                                      JANET
                    What did you read?

                                      DANIEL
                    Um... Mostly novels of other times
                    and places.  I found it um...
                      unsettling when I read something in
                    the present day so I stopped doing
                    that a long time ago.

      She puts her hand on his.  He lets it lay there.  She finally
      pulls it away.  Goes back to her computer.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    I won't be here forever, you know.

                                      JANET
                    What do you mean?                                                                                        53.

                                      DANIEL
                    In your house.  And Ted's.

                                      JANET
                    This is your house too, Daniel.  You
                    can stay as long as you like.

                                      DANIEL
                    I can't really get a handle on time
                    yet.  There are moments where I feel
                    I have only been gone from here for
                    a few weeks and I'm still in high
                    school. 

      Janet looks at her first born. 

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    But mostly it seems I was always...
                    there.  Always there.

      Janet looks away from him.  Her grief is surfacing again.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    So you may need to tell me, Mother.

                                      JANET
                    Tell you?

                                      DANIEL
                    When it's time for me to leave.

      He gets up and walks away leaving the beer barely tasted.

      CLOSE ON: A HAND KNOCKING ON A DOOR.  The door opens revealing
      Daniel.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    Hello.

      INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

      Jared stands there with a TV at the threshold of the guest
      room where Daniel is staying.

                                      JARED
                    Um... This has a DVD player in it
                    and you can watch movies and stuff.

                                      DANIEL
                    Is it yours?

                                      JARED
                    Yeah, but I got an I-Pad so I just
                    stream mostly.    

      Pause.                                                                                        54.

                                      DANIEL
                    OK.  Thank-you, Jared.  

      Daniel takes the TV into the room.  Jared hovers outside.

                                      JARED
                    I could help you hook it up.  I mean,
                    you just plug it in but I know where
                    the plug is.

                                      DANIEL
                    OK.

      Jared walks in and takes the TV back.  Sets it on the desk. 
      Plugs it in.

                                      JARED
                    I'm guessing you don't have any DVDs
                    yet.

                                      DANIEL
                    No. 

                                      JARED
                    I didn't think so but I didn't want
                    to... you know...

                                      DANIEL
                    Presume.

                                      JARED
                    Yeah, exactly.  Presume.  Anyway,
                    I've got kinda a collection and I've
                    been thinking like if you haven't
                    really seen movies in a long time
                    which ones might be good to start
                    with and then work your way up.  

                                      DANIEL
                    I'd appreciate the guidance.

                                      JARED
                    OK.  Well, you can go a lot of ways
                    but one of my favorites--It's called
                    DAZED AND CONFUSED?

                                      DANIEL
                    I like the title.

                                      JARED
                    Yeah, I heard that.   

      Jared snickers like an adolescent.  He regroups. 

                                      JARED (CONT'D)
                    Anyway, it's a cool movie.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        55.

                                      JARED (CONT'D)
                    It's not heavy or anything like that
                    and I could even watch it with you...
                    or you might want to be by yourself...
                    I mean, it's all good.  

      Daniel thinks about it.

                                      DANIEL
                    I think I'd rather see it with you.

                                      JARED
                    Oh sure.  Cool.  

      Daniel sits down.  Waiting.

                                      JARED (CONT'D)
                    Right now?

                                      DANIEL
                    Oh.  Did you mean now?

                                      JARED
                    Uh... Yeah.  Sure.  I'll go get it.

      Jared exits.  Daniel sits there staring at the blank TV. 
      Staring at nothing.  Perfectly content or completely empty. 
      Simply waiting.  Waiting as: 

      CAT POWER's sweet-sad-beautiful song, THE GREATEST, begins
      and then plays under a SUCCESSION of SHOTS of:  

      JON STERN sits in his souless Motel Room.  Alone.  Thinking
      about the long road ahead.

      SENATOR ROLAND FOULKES, sifts through papers from the first
      trial of Daniel Holden.  Takes a slug of Pepto-Bismol.  Smooth
      facade gone, just a greedy face and fierce determination. 

      TED SR watches TED JR adroitly close a deal on a set of
      spinners to a KID with PARENTS.  Ted JR winks at his Dad.

      JANET stands just out of sight of the door where her two
      sons are watching DAZED AND CONFUSED, conflicted at their
      burgeoning relationship.  She walks away.

      DANIEL and JARED watch DAZED AND CONFUSED.  Daniel looks
      over at Jared.  Jared looks at Daniel.  Damn strange alright.  

      GEORGE MEDLOCK, still standing there under the tree in the
      clearing.  Hours later.  He starts walking. 

      AMANTHA sits outside alone as the sun goes low in the sky. 
      Out of fight for the day.  She looks up.  It's her mother. 
      JANET waves tentatively.  Amantha waves back.   

      GEORGE MEDLOCK.  Walking toward the red sky.  Haunted.                                                                                        56.

      PUSH IN on JANET now sitting by AMANTHA.  Neither saying
      anything.  Then Amantha starts crying.  Janet takes Amantha
      in her arms and pets her middle child.

      PUSH IN on JARED and DANIEL lost in the movie.  Jared is
      laughing his ass off.  And then Daniel breaks into a beautiful
      smile.  Forgetting all his troubles, if only for a time. 

      PUSH IN on GEORGE MEDLOCK now standing above a ravine, so
      terribly burdened by his troubles.  George slowly raises a
      gun to his head just as the sun drops from the sky.

      WIDE SHOT of the MUZZLE FLASH next to George's head and then
      George dropping off into the darkness.

                           THE END
