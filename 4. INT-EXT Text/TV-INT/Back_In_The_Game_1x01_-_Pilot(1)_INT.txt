          A slovenly bachelor s paradise.  Neon beer signs, poker 
          table/dining room table, dusty couch, old TV, and a 
          beaten up recliner stand out in this hardly-ever-cleaned 
          home.  On the walls are OLD FRAMED PHOTOS of The Cannon 
        when he played baseball - Photos of him in a Dodgers 
          uniform,  Photos of him in a Los Diablos Rojos of Mexico 
          uniform.  A photo of him in an Albuquerque Dukes uniform 
        with a framed article next to it with the headline, 
           TERRY  THE CANNON  GANNON TOSSES NO HITTER AS AAA DUKES 
        BEAT MUD HENS.  The Cannon sits in his recliner doing the 
          newspaper s CROSSWORD puzzle.  Terry passes through 
          wearing latex gloves and holding a scrub brush.

                        This place is a mess.

                        Feel free to leave...

                        Feel free to bathe.

        The Cannon holds up a empty beer can.

                                          THE CANNON
                        Empty... 

        As if out of habit, Terry veers for the kitchen.

                        I ll work on that.

          Terry hears a constant  thumping  against the wall.

                        Had a raccoon get stuck in the 
                        wall last month.  Might not be 
                        dead yet.

                        Who s Danny?

          Terry gives The Cannon a look and exits to the backyard.



          Terry enters.  The Cannon is hurriedly putting his coat 
        on and moving for the door.

                        Hey, someone had to say something.  
                        Did you see the way he throws?  
                        I ve seen better arms on boxes of 
                        baking soda.  I can teach him some 
                        things.  

                                            TERRY
                        He already knows how to color 
                        inside the lines.  No teaching, no 
                        talking.  No screwing him up like 
                        you did me.

                                          THE CANNON
                        You screwed yourself up when you 
                        got knocked up by that loser ex-
                        husband of yours, dropped out of 
                        school, and lost your scholarship.

                                            TERRY
                        Well, maybe if you had taught me 
                        the birds and the bees instead of 
                        an inside-out slider, I would have 
                        been better prepared.

                        I did the best I could.

                        You did the least you could.  Like 
                        when I was thirteen and got my 
                        first period, you told me to  walk 
                        it off.

                        Or when I left for college...? 
                        Remember what you said to me?

                        After that.  You promised me you 
                        would see every game I ever played 
                        in.  I would look up in the

                        I don t want Danny going through 
                        that.  He s smarter and better 
                        than us in every way.  The Gannon 
                        curse of being a minor leaguer in 
                        life can stop with him.  I have a   
                        responsibility to him to make sure 
                        nothing sidetracks him.

                        an idiot out there.

                        If I go get him and you break his

                        I ll apologize.  Go get him.

          Terry moves off.  A beat, then The Cannon flings the door 
        open and RUNS out of the house.

          Terry and Danny enter.  Danny still wears his glove and 
        has a ball in his hand.  Terry rushes to the open door...

                                            TERRY

                        Twenty bucks if you can nail him.

          Danny moves to the doorway and throws as hard as he can.

                                          THE CANNON (O.S.)

          Terry is dressed in a smart blue business suit.  She s 
          checking herself out in the mirror.  Perfect.  Then...

                                            TERRY
                        You can do this. 



          Terry, smiling confidently and holding her resume, turns 
        the corner into a WAITING ROOM where twenty-five other 
          WOMEN, ALL YOUNGER, wearing basically the same outfit and 
          holding their resumes, sit.  Terry s spirits fall. 



          Terry stands in front of a pimply-faced, teenage 
           MANAGER  who is looking over her resume. 

                                            MANAGER
                        We don t got nothin  right now but 
                        I ll keep your resume on file. 
                                (Then)
                        Wanna go out?



          Terry enters with Danny who now has a black eye.  The 
          Cannon moves to them.

                                          THE CANNON
                        Geezus, kid, what happened to you?

                        I kissed a boy.

                                          THE CANNON
                        Ah, Christ, you re not a Piccolo 
                        Player, are you? 

                                            DANNY
                        No, Cannon, I m not gay.  A bigger 
                        kid was picking on me so I thought 
                        kissing him would freak him out 
                        and throw him off his game.

                                          THE CANNON

                        You do?

                        Sure.  I once batted against Vida 
                        Blue with my Johnson hangin  out.
                        He walked me on four pitches.

                        Well, my kid punched me.

                        You should get a rock or a pipe 
                        and stand behind a wall at school 
                        and when that kid comes around the 
                        corner, you bash his head in.

                                            TERRY
                        No!  No rock!  No pipes!  What is 
                        wrong with you?

                              (To Danny, winking)
                        Think about it. 

          Terry s cell phone rings.  She moves off to answer it.  
        The Cannon grabs Danny by the chin and looks at his eye.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                        grab three cans of beer, and put 
                        one against your eye.

          Danny moves off.  Terry re-enters, upset.

                        That was the little league office.  
                        They said they had too many kids

                           cutbacks,  some kids weren t

                        So I guess the coaches noticed I 
                        couldn t run, throw, or catch...

                                          THE CANNON 
                        Not just the coaches.

                              (to The Cannon)
                        I wouldn t close your eyes 
                        tonight.

                                            DANNY
                        It s OK, mom... 

          Danny turns his back, does something with his hands and 
        then hands two beers to The Cannon.

                                            DANNY
                        I shook one of them really hard.

        The Cannon looks at his two beers.

                                            TERRY
                        I m really sorry, buddy.

                                            DANNY
                        This sucks.  I actually liked 
                        being out there.  Now how am I 
                        going to impress Vanessa?

                        and boyish good looks.

                                            DANNY
                        Yeah.  That s what makes eleven 
                        year old girls go wild.

          A saddened Danny exits. 

                                            TERRY
                        I feel bad for him.  

                                          THE CANNON
                        Who are you kidding?  You re 
                        relieved.  Now you don t have to 
                        be around that field or the game.  
                        The boy liked being out there.  
                        You should fix this for him.

                        Right now I have another job

                        have to wait.

                        Then maybe I ll fix it.  They got 
                        a league orientation meeting 
                        tonight.  Not that I checked their 
                        website to see if he was drafted 
                        or have an interest in the kid 
                        playing ball or anything.  I ll go 
                        down there and talk for Donny.

                        Danny.  And, no you won t.  I 
                        can t have people in the community 
                        knowing Danny s related to you.
                                (checks her watch.)
                        I have a little time before my 
                        interview... I ll go.

                        Have it your way...

        The Cannon pops one of his two beers.  The beer SPRAYS 
        all over him.  

                                          THE CANNON
                        On second thought, screw that 
                        kid...

        The Cannon goes to get a rag to wipe himself off.  

        WE HEAR A  THUMPING  SOUND. Terry moves to a WINDOW and 
          looks outside to see Danny throwing a ball against the 
        side of the house. 

                                            TERRY
                        Oh, Danny...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

          CONTINUED: (3)

        The Cannon re-enters wiping off his face and opens the 
           other beer.   It too explodes. 

                                          THE CANNON
                        Who shakes both beers?! 



        Gigi and Terry stand in a room full of PARENTS.

                                          GIGI
                        Thanks for calling me.  Michael is  
                        crushed he didn t make a team.  
                        When I left he was in his room 
                        crying and writing a letter to 
                        Lady Gaga.

                                            TERRY
                        I don t even know if there s 
                        anything we can do.

                                          GIGI
                        Well, we are way too hot to have 
                        not gotten our boys in.  I heard 
                        they took Jenn Weiner s kid and 
                        she s a pig.

        Dick Slingbaugh moves to the front podium.

                                          DICK
                        I understand we have some parents 
                        here whose sons didn t make the 
                        league - To that, I wish we could 
                        have taken every kid.  We just 
                        don t have the equipment, practice 
                        time, or a coach.  So, to all of 
                        you, better luck next year.  

        Gigi hip-checks Terry forward giving her a, say 
          something  look.  Terry moves toward Dick.

                        Hi... Uh, my son, Danny, was one 
                        of the kids left out this year and 
                        I just want to know who makes the 
                        final decision about which kids  
                        make the league?

                        And what qualifies you to evaluate 
                        these kids?

                        I only ask if you re qualified 
                        because in Googling you I found 
                        that you didn t even play high 
                        school baseball.

                        I hurt my knee the summer before

                        this.  Look, I m sorry your son

                        This is little league, not the 
                        majors, you maniac.  This is 
                        supposed to be the place where you 
                        learn to play the game.  And not 
                        just for some kids - every kid.

                        Well, we re different... And 
                        that s why we re better.  Anyway, 
                        as I ve already said - we don t 
                        have the equipment or a coach so 
                        this discussion is over.

                        Yeah, that s fine, but we still 
                        don t have a coach.  Any of you 
                        fathers out there have the time or 
                        the commitment it takes to coach a 
                        team in this league?

        No FATHERS come forward.  Dick smiles at Terry.

                        how  bout this...? You look like a 
                        betting man, Dick... You and me, 
                        on the field, I throw you one 
                        pitch.  You hit it, you ll never 
                        see me or my kid again.  But, you 
                        miss it... I get to coach my kid 
                        and all the other kids who aren t 
                        quite up to your standards.

          Terry opens the door and Dick Slingbaugh is there 
          carrying a LARGE BOX.  Dick has a BLACK EYE where Terry 
        hit him with the pitch.

                                          DICK
                        Sorry to bother you at home but I 
                        know your team has practice 
                        tomorrow and I wanted to get you 
                        your uniforms.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.

                                            TERRY
                        Oh... OK.  Come in.

        Dick enters and puts the box down on a table.

                                            TERRY
                        How s the eye?

                                          DICK
                        Doesn t hurt.  I didn t even ice 
                        it. 

                                            TERRY
                        Well, I m sorry I threw at you but 
                        you were literally a  Dick  to me.  

                                          DICK
                        It s OK, I get it.  It s like the 
                        girls in the schoolyard punching 
                        you in the arm cause they think 
                        you re hot. 

                                            TERRY
                        No it isn t...

                                          DICK
                        Sure it is.  And so you know, I 
                        want to keep what we got here 
                        strictly on the field.  I am not 
                        available. 

                                            TERRY
                        That won t be a problem because I 
                        find you repulsive. 

                                          DICK
                        No you don t.  Anyway, good luck 
                        to you and your kids.  You re 
                        gonna need it. 

        Dick exits.  Terry goes to the box and opens it up.  She 
          pulls out a little league jersey and instead of it 
          reading the  Angels  it reads the  ANGLES. 

                                            TERRY
                        The Angles?  That guy really is a 
                        dick.



          Terry moves into the garage where she finds Danny holding 
        the ball he threw.  Danny is in the middle of the garage 
        and surrounding him on all sides are WALLS OF VIDEOTAPES.

                                            DANNY
                        Mom, what are all these?

          Terry moves to the tapes and starts looking through them.  
        THEY ARE LABELED - JR. Vs Georgia, JR. Vs Alabama, etc...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

                        Videos of every game I played in 
                        college... That sonofabitch...

          Danny moves to a shelf where there are pictures of The 
          Cannon posing with his wife, Terry s mom, JANE.  The 
          Cannon looks youthful and happy beyond words.  Danny 
          grabs a picture of Jane, bat in her hand, with The Cannon 
          pressed tightly behind her, showing her how to hit.

                                            DANNY
                        Mom, is this The Cannon...?

          Terry moves to Danny and takes the picture.

                                            TERRY
                        Yeah... And my mom.  

                                            DANNY
                        She died when you were my age.

                                            TERRY
                        Yeah...

                                            DANNY
                        She s beautiful.  But this can t 
                        be The Cannon.  He looks like a 
                        completely different person.  
                        Almost as if he s... Happy. 

                                            TERRY
                        Back then he was.

          Terry sets the picture down next an old, framed, 
           BASEBALL DIGEST  MAGAZINE COVER.  WE SEE a young Cannon 
        on the cover with the caption:   COULD TERRY GANNON BE 
        THE NEXT KOUFAX? 

          Danny SEES a baseball sitting in an acrylic dome.

                                            DANNY
                        What kind of ball is this?

          Terry takes the ball and looks at it.  Written in faded 
        pen, WE SEE the words: Terry Jr. Perfect Game 6/22/1987

                                            TERRY
                          Unbelievable... It s my very first 
                        game ball.  The Cannon gave it to 
                        me after I pitched my first 
                        perfect game.  I can t believe 
                        he s kept it for 25 years.

                                            DANNY
                        What s a game ball?

                        baseball, do you?

                        Touche... Sometimes a coach will 
                        give a player a game ball if they 
                        play really well or if they 
                        sacrifice the most for the team.

                                            DANNY
                        And he s kept it all these years? 
                        That s pretty cool.

                                            TERRY
                        Yeah... Pretty cool...



          Tommy bops downstairs and into the KITCHEN.  He moves to 
        the fridge and grabs a soft drink CAN from it.  He opens 
        the can and it explodes all over him. 

        The Canon enters and does a sort of  gotcha  dance fist-
          pumping thing...

                                          THE CANNON
