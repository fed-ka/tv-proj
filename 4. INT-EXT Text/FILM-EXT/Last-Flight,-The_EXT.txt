On a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land,
surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle
RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment.
Abruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby
branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES
again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image
moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES
appear with every FIRING.
On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:
WAR MONTAGE
Nothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of:
Cannon firing in all directions.
Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night.
Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water
towering into the sky.
An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar
fire visible above them on the horizon.
Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their
muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling.
FASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC:
Mortar fire, explosions, smoke.
A machine gunner fires.
A soldier falls.
Infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze.
More machine gunning.
More soldiers go down.
A massive gun fires.
SMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA, blacking out the screen.
Infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles.
A bridge explodes. A building explodes. The ground explodes.
A bomb drops from an airplane.
Aerial view of an exploding building.
Anti-aircraft guns at work.
Planes in the air.
A machine gun fires skyward.
Planes circle, filling the air.
A single bi-plane.
The plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks
into a grin.
Shep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see:
Another plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the
gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them.
An enemy plane arrives.
The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns.
Bill and Francis' plane spins away.
Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to
Francis' amusement.
The planes circle in the air.
The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail
as Cary watches.
The enemy pilot returns fire.
The two planes tango in mid-air.
Shep FIRES.
The enemy pilot grins and FIRES.
Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane.
Cary warns Shep they've been hit.
From the enemy plane's POV, Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke.
The two planes. Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of
control.
Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him.
Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of
the red hot controls.
The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward.
Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry.
Above, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves.
Francis, though, doesn't look happy.
Shep twists in his seat and looks around.
Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit.
SHEP (o.s.)
Level off, Cary! Level off!
Despite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick.
From the plane's POV: The landscape rushes by.
The plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop.
Smoke. Flames.
Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to
clamber out.
CARY
Shep! Shep, are you all right?
SHEP
Can't make it, Cary. Can't make it.
CARY
Here, give me your arm! I'll get
you out of here! Hang on there,
Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight,
old fella.
Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two
of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious.
Flames consume the plane.
DISSOLVE TO:
A TEMPERATURE CHART
for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145.
Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by
a line on a graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle
continues to RUMBLE.
ANOTHER CHART
swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for
October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line
continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is
marked NORMAL.
DISSOLVE TO:
Shep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway. They've seen
something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of
its path. They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through
some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without acknowledgment, and
head into the hospital.
CUT TO:
The office window opens. The doctor -- no longer in white but wearing his
uniform -- and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a
little fresh air. The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and Cary.
AIDE
Why can't they go on with flying?
You know, the air mails or
something?
DOCTOR
I'm afraid they're unfit for further
service in that direction.
The aide looks at him, quizzically.
DOCTOR
They fell, you know -- six thousand
meters.
(shakes his head, sadly)
Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on
the pavement. Shattered both of them.
Their nervous systems are deranged,
disorganized, brittle.
AIDE
Spent bullets.
DOCTOR
Spent bullets. That's it.
(nods)
They're like projectiles, shaped
for war and hurled at the enemy.
(gestures with cigarette)
They've described a beautiful,
high-arching trajectory. And now
they've fallen back to earth.
Spent. Cooled off. Useless.
We slowly PULL BACK from the two men.
AIDE
Oh, well, if they take care of
themselves, they'll pull through
all right.
DOCTOR
Even if they do take care of
themselves, what good are they?
What can you expect of them?
(shakes his head)
I hate to think what may become
of them.
We have pulled back far enough and now we
CUT TO:
Two uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot Bill and reserved
gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital.
Bill, with his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs
and wave.
BILL
(Texas accent)
Hello, Cary!
FRANCIS
Hi, Cary!
At the top of the stairs, Shep and Cary wave back, pleased to see them.
CARY
Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!
SHEP
Hello, Bill! Francis!
Unexpectedly, Shep and Cary hurry down the stairs past them.
CARY
(friendly)
Well, I see you got yours.
BILL
(pleasantly)
Yup. We crashed.
Bill and Francis watch, surprised, as Shep and Cary hurry off.
BILL
(calls down, puzzled)
Hey! Where you going?
Shep and Cary, already seated in the back of a waiting automobile, grin like
kids.
CARY
Paris!
BILL (o.s.)
Paris?!
From the stairs, Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at Shep and Cary
uncertainly. But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles and waves his hat
at them.
BILL
See you in Paris!
FRANCIS
(waves his cigarette)
Yeah.
Smiling, Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off.
DISSOLVE TO:
A superimposed text reads:
PARIS -- 1919.
Traffic noise, taxi horns squeaking.
DISSOLVE TO:
Strolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our
heroes -- Bill, Shep, Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and dinner clothes.
Outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds. But:
Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye
twitching.
Cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands. His
personality is dark and dry, more subdued than Shep's, and he comes across as
the most levelheaded, rational member of the group -- its unacknowledged
leader.
Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically. A
narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on
the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk.
Only the athlete of the group, Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name is
William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape. But he is reckless,
restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and
forced exuberance.
CARY
How 'bout a cocktail?
SHEP
Not a bad idea at that.
As a group, they turn and head into a nearby building.
BRIEF DISSOLVE TO:
A GLOWING SIGN
made of light bulbs, outside the building. It spells out CLARIDGE'S -- a
popular Parisian drinking establishment for Anglo-Americans.
DISSOLVE TO:
A taxi cab -- filled with Bill, Francis, Shep, Nikki and Frink -- pulls up to
a restaurant. As it stops, Bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk
table.
BILL
Hey! There he is!
The others look.
SHEP
Where?
BILL
Come on!
The group cheers, spills out of the taxi and heads for:
THE SIDEWALK TABLE
where Cary sits reading a newspaper.
SHEP (o.s.)
Cary!
Cary looks up. He rises, a little startled, and politely removes his hat. The
others crowd around him.
BILL
Say, what are you tryin' to do,
disown us?
CARY
(genuinely polite)
Hello. Won't you sit down?
BILL
Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think
we'd do? Stand around?
They all take seats around the little table. During this, Frink brings a chair
for Nikki who grabs a seat of her own. When he tries to use it to sit next to
her, Bill commandeers it for himself.
BILL
(with a wave, to Frink)
Thank you.
A waiter joins them as they settle in.
SHEP
Hello, Cary.
CARY
Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will
you have to drink?
FRANCIS
Martini!
BILL
Martini!
SHEP
Martini!
FRINK
Martini!
WAITER
Quatre Martinis?
NIKKI
Uh, could I have champagne, please?
WAITER
Champagne? Oui.
The waiter departs. Off her order, Bill gives Nikki a look.
BILL
Boys, she's goin' to be a problem.
NIKKI
(explains, to Bill)
That's what I started on.
(to Cary)
It upsets me if I change over to
anything else.
CARY
(to Bill)
There's a lot of things wrong with
this one.
(to Nikki)
What were you doing at the bar at
Claridge's anyway?
SHEP
Yes. Don't you know you're not
supposed to be there?
FRANCIS
There's a sign on the wall says
ladies must sit at the back.
NIKKI
Can't read signs.
SHEP
Well, we'll just have to take care
of her, that's all.
BILL
Do you think she's good-lookin'
enough?
NIKKI
Oh, I know I'm not very good-
looking but--
CARY
But what?
NIKKI
But when I was a little girl, my
mother always said I had the nicest
hair-ribbon.
Shep laughs derisively. The others give him a look and he shuts up. The drinks
arrive. All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses. Bill removes the
toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole. He watches Nikki rubbing her
champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying
to start a fire.
BILL
Then there's her drinking.
NIKKI
What's the matter with my drinking?
BILL
You're a sissy drinker.
NIKKI
Well, maybe I can improve.
Meanwhile, Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink his Martini with one
unsteady hand. Bill inspects Nikki's mouth.
BILL
Then there's her teeth. Why, one of
'em is turned sideways.
NIKKI
(points)
You mean this one?
BILL
That's it.
CARY
Why don't you have it turned around?
NIKKI
I don't have it turned around on
account of it's a kind of help.
CARY
Well, in what respect does it kind
of help?
NIKKI
Well, you see, when anyone kisses me
too hard, it splits my lip. And you
could tell when anyone kissed me too
hard on account of my lip would
bleed. So now I don't let anyone
kiss me -- hard.
The men are amused. Nikki sips her champagne.
CARY
Well, we'll let that pass.
Bill chuckles. Shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
NIKKI
Where's he gone?
CARY
Shep went off to sharpen his skates.
BILL
Now, about your nose.
NIKKI
What about my nose?
BILL
It isn't straight. It kind of turns
up at the end.
NIKKI
Well, when I was a little girl, I
got bumped by a swing.
CARY
How'd you happen to get bumped?
NIKKI
I just walked through the gate. I
was only seven.
CARY
Oh, poor dear. Didn't you see it?
NIKKI
I can't see very far.
CARY
Did it hurt?
NIKKI
It made me dizzy all day.
CARY
Well, I guess we can't hold that
against her.
BILL
We all make mistakes.
CARY
That's right. Michelangelo painted
Adam with a navel.
Bill and Nikki laugh at this. Suddenly, Nikki grows thoughtful.
NIKKI
All the same, he'd look funny the
other way -- even in a painting.
They all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives. Frink
abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
NIKKI
Where's he gone?
BILL
He went off to shave a horse.
CARY
Have you got a husband or anything?
NIKKI
No husband.
CARY
A mother?
NIKKI
Mother, yes. But we haven't met in
quite a long time.
CARY
Why not in a long time?
NIKKI
Well, on account of my mother's name
was Beulah. Now, you can't have a
mother named Beulah. So I changed it
to Jane. And that's how it all began.
An odd CHIMING sound distracts them. They look off to see:
FRANCIS
the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown,
pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The
chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits.
AT THE TABLE
Nikki watches Francis' exit curiously. Bill waves her off before she can ask:
BILL
He's goin' off to tame an alligator.
NIKKI
Who is he, anyway?
CARY
Francis used to fly with us in the
94th. The best shot in the squadron.
Brought down twelve planes. Used to
call him "Sudden Death." He lost
interest after his teammate got
killed. He's lonesome is all.
NIKKI
I like him.
CARY
He carries a chiming watch on
account of he's always falling
asleep in the daytime.
NIKKI
What kind of chimes?
CARY
Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and
Whittington.
NIKKI
I'll take vanilla.
Cary puts a fist on his hip and gives Nikki an exasperated look. Taxi horns
squeak. Francis, Shep and Frink return from their various adventures and sit
down as Bill gives Nikki his opinion of Francis.
BILL
I think he's a washout.
SHEP
Well, just because you're a big
bombardier and an All-American--
NIKKI
(interrupts)
All-American what?
SHEP
Halfback.
FRINK
Where?
CARY
Oh, Montana State or somewhere.
Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle
Indians or something. Didn't you
never read about Bill? Bronko Bill
-- the Alabama Flash?
Bill grins as Nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette.
NIKKI
(skeptical)
I think it's a forgery.
Bill's face falls. He looks at Nikki.
BILL
Say! What do you want me to do?
Tackle a horse?
She nods. Shep is amused.
SHEP
Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse.
BILL
(with a dismissive wave)
All right, all right, I'll tackle a
horse.
Shep looks down the street.
SHEP
Here comes one now.
They all look to see:
A HORSE-DRAWN CAB
rolling down the street in their direction.
AT THE TABLE
Everyone watches as Bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab.
BILL
Look out, horse!
THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB
rolling along as Bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms
around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature.
ON THE SIDEWALK
Cary, horrified, stands and yells:
CARY
Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!
Cary runs off, toward Bill, leaving a thrilled Shep and a worried Francis with
a distressed Nikki. They all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of
pedestrians stops to watch the excitement.
NIKKI
(distraught)
Oh, Bill!
AT THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB
Cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins.
CARY
Hey! What's the idea -- runnin'
down my friend like that? Here!
Cary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand. The cabman protests in
French but takes the cash.
WIDER VIEW
of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill
tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver.
CARY
Never mind. Look where you're going
in the future now. You just watch out
where you're going!
ANOTHER VIEW
Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely
annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away.
Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as
Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in
petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.
CARY
(admonishes Bill)
Now listen, come on out here, you
old fool.
(to the shying horse)
Whoa, whoa.
BILL
Nice horsie.
CARY
(to Bill)
Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed
of yourself. You old fool! You know
what you'll do? You'll kill yourself
one of these days. Now, come on, get
out of here. Now, listen--
Satisfied with the outcome of all this, Bill heads back for the sidewalk.
CARY
(to the driver)
You all right now, brother?
The driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse.
CARY
All right. Now, you just keep your
horse, see? You got your money.
The cabbie salutes Cary but pays more attention to his horse.
BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE
The waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns. Bill happily
dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket. Cary, beside him, leads him to his
seat. They all sit down under the following:
CARY
Hey, listen, Bill, you're All-
American, see? You're TWO All-
Americans! The lady's convinced
you're the whole team. You don't
have to tackle any more horses.
How 'bout that? Drink your drink.
BILL
(pleased with himself)
Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill?
Nikki abruptly rises.
SHEP
Hey! Where are you going?
NIKKI
Would you all excuse me for a
moment?
CARY
Well, where are you going?
NIKKI
(a grave announcement)
To take a Chinese singing lesson.
Francis immediately understands that she's become one of them. He raises an
olive in the air and cheers:
FRANCIS
Hooray!
The men rise and all but Frink cheer her lustily as she departs:
MEN
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
NIKKI
walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer. A smiling maitre d'
directs her to the ladies' room.
BACK AT THE TABLE
Frink watches Nikki disappear from view and, after a glance at the others,
rises and follows her. Shep, Bill and Cary remain at the table, laughing and
drinking. Bill turns to Cary with a smile.
BILL
Hey. What kind of a girl do you
think Nikki is?
Cary glances in Nikki's direction and tells Bill confidentially:
CARY
I think she's the kind that sits
down on phonograph records.
Bill thinks about this and nods.
INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
As Nikki returns from her Chinese singing lesson, Frink puts his arm against a
wall, blocking her way.
FRINK
Say, Nikki, let's ditch these
drunks and go off somewhere by
ourselves. These crazy fools are
liable to do anything.
NIKKI
(hopeful)
Do you think so?
FRINK
Since the war, they don't care what
happens.
NIKKI
And do you?
FRINK
I'll say so. I've got more
important things to think of.
NIKKI
What more important things?
FRINK
Well, my work.
NIKKI
What kind of work?
FRINK
I'm the foreign correspondent for a
New York newspaper syndicate.
NIKKI
(genuinely)
How nice for you!
Nikki pushes his arm away and heads for the table. Frink watches her go, a
dark look on his face.
BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE
The men rise briefly as Nikki rejoins them and sits.
FRANCIS
Nikki? Are you the kind of girl that
sits down on phonograph records?
Nikki lowers her eyes.
NIKKI
(a bit defensively)
People shouldn't leave their records
lying about.
CARY
(to Francis)
What did I tell you?
NIKKI
(abruptly brightens)
Take me dancing?
BILL
What place you wanna go?
NIKKI
What places you got?
CARY
Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too
early. We've got Florida, Perroquet,
Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge,
Bal Tabarin.
NIKKI
I'll take vanilla.
Cary gives her a look. Bill clears his throat.
BILL
Somebody pay for the drinks!
Bill rises and claps his hands with enthusiasm.
BILL
We're off in a "billizzard" of
horse-radish!
Whatever that means. The men rise and retrieve their hats.
DISSOLVE TO:
The drinking hole in Nikki's hotel. A French woman noisily arranges dirty
drinking glasses as Bill, Francis and Shep enter -- horribly hungover, moaning
and yawning -- and line up at the bar. A bartender greets them to take their
order.
BARTENDER
Messieurs.
SHEP
Morning.
FRANCIS
Morning.
BILL
Um, prairie oyster.
SHEP
Prairie oyster.
Shep has to nudge Francis with an elbow.
FRANCIS
Prairie oyster.
BARTENDER
Prairie oyster for three.
Bartender moves off. Shep puts on his dark eyeglasses.
CARLTON BAR - ANOTHER VIEW
We start on a CLOSE SHOT of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a
raw egg into one. Beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover
remedy. We PAN OVER to the three men:
SHEP
Say, we'd better get back to our
hotel.
FRANCIS
There's no Nikki at our hotel.
BILL
That's right.
SHEP
And the bar doesn't open so early.
BILL
Say! Why don't we move in here?
FRANCIS
Sure. Let's stay here.
BILL
But - what about Cary?
FRANCIS
(to Shep)
What about Cary?
SHEP
(to Francis)
What ABOUT Cary?
Francis shakes his head, he has no idea.
BILL
We can move him in, too.
Francis nods in agreement. Shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive.
SHEP
Not a bad idea!
Shep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled "thank you." The three
men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one
at a time -- first Shep who exhales deeply, then Francis who takes it in
stride. Finally, Bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the
others out, their hangovers apparently remedied.
BILL
(cheerfully)
Well, come on, men. Let's go.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. A taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk
caf -- LA REGENCE, according to the awning that covers the little iron
tables. Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as Nikki hurries
under the awning. Cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ("Restez
ici."), looks at the rain.
CARY
(to Nikki)
Perhaps we'd better stay here a
while till it clears up.
NIKKI
Could we sit down here, do you
suppose?
CARY
I think so. Would you like something
to drink?
They move toward the caf. As Cary hangs up his hat, a waiter arrives.
NIKKI
What should I drink now, do you
suppose?
Cary orders the drinks as Nikki moves to sit at a table.
CARY
(to the waiter)
Deux picon citrons.
The waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his
bartender. Cary joins Nikki at the table and sits down. She removes her gloves
and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the
following:
NIKKI
Picon citrons?
CARY
Very refreshing. Make you laugh and
play.
NIKKI
(amused)
That's what you always promise.
(suddenly serious)
Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on
drinking so desperately?
CARY
Don't we all?
NIKKI
Not like Shep.
CARY
Well, Shep has that tic under his
eye, you know. Takes a lot of drinks
to keep that quiet.
NIKKI
But isn't there some kind of
treatment or something?
CARY
Shep could never stand a long course
of treatment. Drinking's the only
corrective so far as he's concerned.
He's found out the tic doesn't work
when he's tight. So he stays tight.
The waiter arrives with the drinks. As he spritzes seltzer water into their
glasses, Cary leans over to light a cigarette for Nikki. The waiter leaves and
they drink.
NIKKI
Seems such a pity. How did he get
the tic?
CARY
In the war.
NIKKI
I know. But how?
CARY
Well, it's not very romantic.
NIKKI
Well, don't tell me if you don't
want to.
CARY
Well, you see, a tic is a nervous
habit.
NIKKI
Yes?
CARY
Lice under his bandages.
NIKKI
Oh.
CARY
He had the devil of a time. He
nearly lost his mind. So you'll have
to excuse him a little.
NIKKI
I'm so sorry for Shep.
CARY
Well, don't let him know it.
NIKKI
Well, isn't he going home? Not ever?
CARY
Not ever. Not in his dark glasses
anyway.
NIKKI
Can't something be done for him?
CARY
He'll have to be - reborn.
NIKKI
How's he going to end?
CARY
Well, how are you going to end? How
am I going to end? How is ANYONE
going to end? How's your picon
citron go?
NIKKI
It goes fine. But doesn't ANYTHING
make any difference to you?
CARY
Not now. A long time ago, perhaps,
when I was a little boy.
NIKKI
Tell me, where were you little?
CARY
In Minnesota. On a farm.
NIKKI
Were you happy then, Cary?
CARY
I think so.
NIKKI
Tell me, what WAS there to be happy
about on a farm in Minnesota?
CARY
(lost in thought)
Ohhh, thorn-apple trees in blossom.
The smell of burning leaves in the
fall. The sound of horses' hoofs on
the road.
(looks at Nikki)
Did you ever dig up an Indian mound
or uncover a nest of baby field
mice? Or explore old trunks in an
attic? Listen to the moaning of the
telephone wires in the winter wind?
See a gypsy caravan?
NIKKI
(enthralled)
So THAT'S why you were happy. On
account of apple blossoms and field
mice and telephone wires and gypsy
caravans and old trunks and things?
CARY
That's right.
Nikki exhales, drinks, looks at Cary and shakes her head.
NIKKI
But aren't you going back? Not ever?
CARY
Would you like another picon citron
before you go? The rain is lifting.
Nikki finishes the last of her drink.
NIKKI
No. I'm ready now.
Cary leaves some money, Nikki gathers her things. They rise and walk off.
DISSOLVE TO:
Cary and Nikki stroll into view, arm in arm, and look around. The rain has
stopped. They are the only living people in the ancient cemetery.
NIKKI
Who all is buried here?
CARY
Oh, poets, painters, philosophers--
NIKKI
Cocoanut?
CARY
No cocoanut. Poets, painters,
philosophers, musicians.
They've paused. Cary looks around, points with his cane.
CARY
There's Chopin.
NIKKI
Oh, I practiced him.
He gives her a look and they move on.
CARY
And there's Balzac. And there's
Hlose and Ablard.
NIKKI
Oh, tell me about Ablise and
loard.
CARY
No, Nikki. Not Ablise and loard.
Hlose and Ablard.
NIKKI
I'm sorry. I really didn't do it on
purpose. It was on account of the
picon citron. Tell me about Hlose
and Ablard.
CARY
Well, they're buried here in the
same sepulchre side by side.
NIKKI
Why are they buried side by side?
They stop.
CARY
They were the world's most famous
lovers.
(looks off, points
with his cane)
There's the tomb.
They approach the large tomb which is fenced off by a low iron gate. Cary
removes his hat, Nikki peers at the double sepulchre through her lorgnette.
NIKKI
Tell me about the world's most
famous lovers.
CARY
Well, Ablard was a scholastic
philosopher--
NIKKI
Whatever that is.
CARY
Whatever that is. He gained a
footing in a certain household as
tutor to a maiden called Hlose.
And employed his unlimited
opportunities for the purpose of--
Well, betrayal. Not, however,
unmixed with real love. He carried
her off to Brittany.
NIKKI
Tell me more.
CARY
Well, her uncle was furious. He
blamed Ablard for the whole thing.
He conceived a terrible revenge.
NIKKI
(uneasy)
I'm afraid for Ablard.
CARY
He broke into Ablard's apartment
one night and perpetrated upon him
the most brutal punishment.
NIKKI
Oh, dear.
CARY
The lovers were forced to live
their lives apart. But when they
died, they were buried here side by
side.
(peers down at
the ground)
There's a story that little heart-
shaped stones are supposed to grow
around the tomb.
NIKKI
Heart-shaped stones?
CARY
And lovers come and find them and
exchange them with each other.
(looks at Nikki)
And, so long as you keep the stone
from the tomb of Hlose and Ablard,
no harm can come to your true love.
NIKKI
How perfectly beautiful.
CARY
Isn't that a quaint legend?
They crouch at the iron bars of the gate surrounding the tomb and take off
their gloves under the following:
NIKKI
Do you think I might find a heart-
shaped stone? You help me, Cary.
CARY
All right, Nikki. Only we have to
leave soon.
(looks off)
They close up the place.
NIKKI
Just as soon as we find our stones.
They reach through the gate to poke at the rocks and gravel surrounding the
tomb. After a moment, Nikki rises and walks off excitedly with a stone in her
hand.
NIKKI
I found one! Where's yours?
Cary, too, finds a stone and rises to join her.
NIKKI AND CARY'S HANDS
as the couple sits near the tomb. They show each other the stones in their
upturned hands. Nikki takes the heart-shaped stone from her palm and places it
in Cary's stiff, weathered hand. Then she transfers his stone to her hand.
NIKKI
And, now, you take mine. And I'll
take yours.
They close their hands over the stones as we PULL BACK to a WIDER VIEW of
Nikki and Cary smiling at one another.
NIKKI
Isn't that the way the story goes?
CARY
That's right, Nikki.
NIKKI
And, now, no harm can come to our
true love.
CARY
(amused)
And, now, we'll have to go.
He starts to rise but she puts a hand on his arm.
NIKKI
You were so nice to let me come
with you. I spoiled your whole day.
You were going to do something else,
weren't you?
CARY
(looks away)
Doesn't matter.
NIKKI
Well, what was it, Cary? Why did you
come here today?
CARY
(not looking at her)
To pay my respects to an old comrade.
NIKKI
Oh. And you wanted to be alone. I'm
sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry.
(begins to weep softly)
Don't pay any attention to me, Cary.
I can't help it. You MAKE me cry.
He stares at her, astonished, as she rambles on.
NIKKI
Oh, don't look so troubled, Cary.
I'm all right. I just want to cry
for a minute.
(puts a hand on
his shoulder)
On account of you're so nice. You're
so clean, Cary. And your teeth are
so white. You're so civilized. You
don't care about anything any more,
nor anybody. Nothing makes any
difference to you. Nothing can
touch you.
(realizes)
Why, you're lost. You're ALL lost.
You and Shep and the rest of you.
(takes his hand)
Oh, I want to do something for you.
I want to help you.
(looks at his wrist)
Let me wash your bracelet, Cary.
(points)
Why, see? The silver's all
tarnished. The silver's all
tarnished.
(removes his bracelet)
I'll take it with me and scrub it
when I get home. I'll polish it
with my nail-brush.
Nikki turns to put the bracelet in her purse. Thoroughly unnerved by this
emotional outburst, Cary looks around.
CARY
It's getting dark.
Cary rises, deeply uncomfortable. Nikki tries to make amends.
NIKKI
Well ...
(rises, cheerily)
Anyway, we found a name for my
turtles!
Cary turns and looks at her, amazed.
CARY
Hlose and Ablard? A name for
your turtles? So that's what you
were looking for. I might have
known how it would end.
He looks down at the heart-shaped stone held awkwardly in his stiff hand. His
thumb brushes the stone and it falls to the ground.
DISSOLVE TO:
A mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor. Nikki sits down
near Shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor.
NIKKI
Don't we have to go like anything?
The train leaves in twenty minutes.
Francis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage. Bill stands next to
him, smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to Nikki:
BILL
Are you SURE you have everything?
NIKKI
(misses the irony)
I - I think so.
Francis clicks his tongue as he regards the pile.
FRANCIS
(dryly)
Hardly seems enough.
Suddenly, Nikki gasps and rises.
NIKKI
Oh, my turtles! My turtles!
THE TURTLES
are plucked from the tub and placed in ...
... A BASKET
by Nikki's little Asian maid. The fancy beribboned wicker basket has an
oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier. Bill
secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the
bathroom, handing it grandly to Francis.
BILL
Here you are, Francis! You're the
custodian of the turtles! Now don't
fall down on the job.
Bill walks off. Francis calls after him, worried:
FRANCIS
Hey! I never tended turtles before.
Nikki arrives with a bottle of water and soaks her hand.
NIKKI
Now, all you have to do -
She gives Francis the bottle and sprinkles the turtles with water from her wet
hand.
NIKKI
- is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like
this.
FRANCIS
Oh, yeah. I see.
Some of the water ends up in Francis' eye which he wipes with the basket's
ribbon. Nikki walks off and Francis practices soaking his hand and sprinkling
the turtles.
IN THE BEDROOM
Five bellhops march in and, under the direction of Nikki and the men, proceed
to carry off the luggage, chattering in French.
NIKKI
Well, we're off.
(to a bellhop,
about the trunk)
Be careful of that one.
Burdened with luggage, the bellhops file out through the suite. Bill, suitcase
in hand, follows them out, beckoning to Francis behind him.
BILL
Uh, come on, Francis! Take those
turtles!
Francis hurries along carrying the basket, followed by Shep and Nikki.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
A whistle BLOWS. Their luggage already aboard, Francis, Nikki, Shep and Bill
walk down the platform, parallel to the train. Bill claps his hands
exuberantly.
BILL
There she is, boys! The Sud Express!
SHEP
Can you imagine Cary tryin' to run
away and leave us behind?
Bill laughs. Nikki peers at the train through her lorgnette.
NIKKI
Do you suppose he's really gonna
be here?
BILL
Sure he'll be here. He's never
missed a train in his life.
FRANCIS
Say, do you suppose the turtles'll
be all right with that porter?
Bill gives Francis a supportive pat on the back.
BILL
Aw, sure they'll be all right. All
you got to do is -
(gestures with his hand)
- sprinkle 'em!
Francis nods soberly. Bill laughs. Nikki points, excited.
NIKKI
There he is!
FARTHER DOWN THE PLATFORM
Cary buys a paper from a newsboy and steps onto his train.
BILL (o.s.)
Say, Cary!
On the train steps, Cary stops and turns as his friends arrive and gather
around him, grinning.
NIKKI
Hello, Cary.
CARY
(surprised)
Well, hello. What are you all doing
down here?
BILL
We just came down to see you off is
all.
CARY
Well, that's darn decent of you.
FRANCIS
Ya got a nice seat?
CARY
Yeah, right by a window.
NIKKI
Oh, how nice for you!
BILL
(with childlike desire)
Come on! Show us your seat by the
window!
SHEP
(cheerful, insistent)
Yeah, come on, Cary! We wanna SEE
that seat by the window.
Climbing the steps, Bill and Shep crowd a confused Cary and force him into the
train. Following the others, Francis helps Nikki up the steps.
FRANCIS
Come on, Nikki.
They all board the train and head for:
Crowded city street. A superimposed title reads: LISBON
DISSOLVE TO:
LISBON NIGHT MONTAGE
Cocktail shaker in the hands of an expert who shakes it rhythmically as
appropriate Latin MUSIC begins. This DISSOLVES TO a kaleidoscopic VIEW of our
protagonists enjoying the night life: Nikki's image dominates at the center,
surrounded by images of the men in dinner clothes. Everyone drinks, except
Frink who smokes a cigarette and stares, desirous and snakelike, presumably at
Nikki.
DISSOLVE TO Nikki and her war birds (minus Frink) seated at a bar in an
otherwise empty club late at night, wearing goofy party hats. They swallow a
last drink and start to leave -- laughing, talking, merrily blowing little
party horns, taking a bottle or two with them, and waving to an unseen
bartender as they go. Someone says, "Good night." We TRACK IN for a closer
look at the bar, covered with many empty glasses.
And the music and the montage end.
DISSOLVE TO:
A bugler blows his own horn, grandly, while standing before colorful bull-
fight posters that read: CORRIDA DE TOUROS
A crowd files in under an arched entranceway. Our little group enters, dressed
for a day at the fights.
BILL
Praca de Touros!
And, sure enough, the words over a decorated archway read: PRACA DE TOUROS
BILL
I wonder if there's a bar inside or
anything.
A friendly, English-speaking Portuguese man named Pedro overhears this and
joins them.
PEDRO
Sure, there IS a bar.
SHEP
Let's find the bar. We gotta get
organized for the bull-fight.
PEDRO
Right this way.
Pedro leads and they happily follow.
DISSOLVE TO
The crowd CHEERS and the band PLAYS as a parade of matadors, picadors and
banderilleros enters the ring.
Led by their guide, Pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the
trenches. They have to sit close down so Nikki can see things. The drunken old
man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next
to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row.
When Bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps
him affectionately on the shoulder. Bill turns and greets him pleasantly,
shaking his hand.
BILL
Well! My old pal!
The old man tips his hat to Bill and sits. Bill shakes his pant leg and gives
the old man a wry look before also sitting.
IN THE RING
The parade ends. A matador throws his montera (his black woolen hat) into the
crowd.
IN THE FRONT ROW
Cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight -- they shout "Hooray!"
Immediately, a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the railing before
them. Cary offers the hat to Nikki.
CARY
Nikki, here's a present for you.
NIKKI
Oh, a hat!
PEDRO
Oh, seor, no, no, no -- you must
not keep the hat. You must put a
little present in it and return it
to the matador after the fight.
CARY
What kind of present?
PEDRO
Well, eh - a little jewelry.
Something you have like the chain or
the watch or the - the - the
cigarette case or the cuff links or
- or the--
CARY
Vanilla?
PEDRO
Yes! Vanilla!
A trumpet FANFARE. The crowd CHEERS. Bill points, excited.
BILL
Look! Here he comes!
IN THE RING
A bull charges into view. Bull-fighter and bull face off. The bull makes ten
passes, faster and closer each time.
IN THE FRONT ROW
Bill sits next to Pedro.
PEDRO
Nice work! Good work.
BILL
What's so good about it?
PEDRO
He works close to the bull.
BILL
Is that so dangerous?
PEDRO
Sure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting
is very dangerous. It takes a lot of
courage to go into the bull ring.
Bill scoffs and waves dismissively. Cary leans in with a query.
CARY
Is it true the bull is blind when he
charges?
PEDRO
He sees only the cape -- perhaps.
IN THE RING
Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel. Finally, the bull gets the
advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull.
IN THE FRONT ROW
Bill is unimpressed.
BILL
Bet I could run that bull bow-legged.
You know, I should have BEEN a
bull-fighter.
PEDRO
You should have started at twelve
years of old.
BILL
I bet I could start right now.
CARY
(puts a hand on
Bill's shoulder)
Sit still and behave yourself.
PEDRO
Bull-fighting is not for Americans.
BILL
You think we haven't got the nerve
or something?
PEDRO
Why, listen, bull-fighting is just
for us, the Latins.
BILL
He thinks we're a-scared!
NIKKI
(helpfully)
He tackled a horse once.
PEDRO
(stares at Bill)
Tackle a horse?
Full of himself, Bill nods.
PEDRO
(turns away; flatly)
Is not the same!
Everyone suddenly stares in shock as:
IN THE RING
the bull knocks down the matador. Others rush in to distract the bull which
runs wild, out of control.
IN THE FRONT ROW
Frink nudges Francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring. Francis
glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds. Frink gives him a
look and nudges him to stop clapping. Francis simply goes back to sleep.
WILD BULL MONTAGE
The toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate.
The crowd watches intently. Bill takes off his own hat and picks up the
matador's cap that Cary had caught.
Toreros scramble and run for their lives. The bull chases them down, runs
across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden
barrier that circles the inside of the arena.
Bill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of
toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below
him.
BILL
Nice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe!
The toreros look up at Bill in surprise. One of them responds in Portuguese
with a gesture toward the ring, as if to ask "If it's so easy, why don't you
try it?" The other toreros laugh.
Bill stares into the ring, a savage look in his eyes. He puts a leg up on the
railing.
He jumps down into the ring.
CARY'S VOICE
Hey!
Cary rises, stunned.
CARY
Bill! Come back here!
But it is too late. Bill's coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as
he stalks after the bull.
The bull turns and sees him.
Bill moves toward it, waving his coat and grinning like a madman.
Shep is frozen. Beside him, Nikki screams and turns away.
The bull begins to charge.
Cary climbs over the railing.
The bull charges.
TRACK FAST TOWARD Bill who holds the coat before him -- big eyes, big grin.
The bull is on him. The bull roars.
Bill's face snaps backward in a blur, his coat follows.
The bull gores him through his coat. His face twists in pain.
CUT WIDE as the bull knocks Bill's body around the ring like a rag doll. He
hits the ground hard. Screams from the crowd.
Four toreros rush in.
They surround and distract the bull. Bill lies motionless.
Cary runs across the ring.
More toreros and others rush in, surrounding the bull, finally leading away.
In the front row, Shep, Nikki, Francis, Frink and Pedro watch with concern as
....
... toreros converge on Bill and try to move his body. Cary joins them.
CARY
Bill!
But Bill is unconscious. A torero says something to Cary in Portuguese. Cary
and the others lift Bill.
CARY
Take it easy! Take it easy!
They carry Bill off.
DISSOLVE TO:
Cary emerges and joins the group who are gathered glumly on some steps.
FRANCIS
How is he?
CARY
They've just put him to sleep.
Nikki, emotionally fragile, hands Cary his hat.
CARY
Why, thank you, Nikki. There's
nothing you can do. You'd better go
back to the hotel.
(to Francis)
Put Nikki in a taxi. We'll wait here.
As Frink and Francis exit with Nikki, Pedro approaches Cary with a couple of
journalists.
PEDRO
Seor, the reporters want to know
why your friend descend into the
bull ring.
Cary looks off and thinks for a moment.
CARY
Tell them -- that it seemed like a
good idea - at the time.
Pedro stares at Cary in astonishment. Cary joins Shep and the two of them
stand with their backs to the others as we
FADE OUT
The amusement park at Port Mayer. Crowds, carnival NOISES, a carousel with
appropriate MUSIC.
At a nearby refreshment stand, we find the group, minus Bill. Everyone is
unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes. Francis holds a mug upside-down.
Frink leers at Nikki who ignores him while she, Shep and Cary down their
drinks. They hear:
GUNSHOTS.
They look over to see:
A little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns to shoot various
colorful targets and win prizes.
CARY
Sounds like old times.
SHEP
Let's go and shoot.
CARY
Not a bad idea.
(to Nikki)
What say, Annie Oakley? Like to
fire off a gun at something?
NIKKI
No objection.
SHEP
(to their bartender)
We'll be right back. Hold
everything.
The group starts over to:
THE SHOOTING GALLERY
where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out. Cary and Shep
escort Nikki to the arsenal while Frink and Francis tag along behind. An
attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons.
SHEP
First one to miss pays for the drinks.
CARY
What'll we shoot at?
NIKKI
Shoot one of those pussycats and see
what happens.
SHEP
All right. Look out, pussycat.
Shep FIRES and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range
on an endless chain and disappear. But he hits a tinier target: a clay pipe
behind them.
Shep's eyes pop with surprise.
SHEP
Well, that's what I was aiming at,
a clay pipe.
(stares in amazement)
Whole thing's been misrepresented
to me.
Cary laughs at him.
NIKKI
Cary, let's see you shoot something.
Cary takes careful aim.
CARY
Look out, ball!
He FIRES and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water.
NIKKI
What'd YOU aim at?
CARY
Well, let's see you shoot something.
Nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder. The end of the
barrel describes uncertain circles in the air. A multiple exposure point-of-
view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too tipsy to be
handling a gun. Cary moves to help her.
CARY
Oh, no, no, no, Nikki.
NIKKI
How do you hold it still?
CARY
Listen, Nikki, on your right
shoulder. Now, put your hand out
there and hold up-- No, don't cover
up the site. No, no, no, that's
right. Now just hold it evenly--
Rapid GUNSHOTS. Cary looks up in surprise. He and Shep turn to watch in
amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole
row of pipes with split-second firing.
The others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an
astonished and, apparently, very drunk Frink. Cary takes this moment to
encourage Nikki.
CARY
You can do better than that. Show
him up.
She again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady. Amused, Frink picks
up a pistol and imitates her.
FRINK
What are you waving at, Nikki?
Cary sees Frink pointing his gun at Nikki and moves to intervene, grabbing
Frink's wrist with both hands.
CARY
(angry)
Look out! Why, you fool. Don't you
know better than that?
Shep and Francis move to shield Nikki.
FRINK
What's the idea?
CARY
Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki?
FRINK
Take your hands off me.
CARY
Put down that gun!
FRINK
Let go of my wrist!
Frink violently pulls free of Cary's grasp and, as he does, the gun goes off
with a BANG. Francis hurries Nikki to safety in the opposite direction. Shep
backs away, clutching his side -- for a moment, it looks very much as if he's
been hit. Cary pursues and confronts Frink.
CARY
Put down that gun!
Frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and, wielding the pistol, points it at
Cary. His face is tense, savage.
FRINK
Listen, you keep your hands off me!
I've had enough from you! You try
any more of your rough stuff on
me--!
A nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown.
CARY
Oh, so that's how it is. I thought
we taught you how to behave.
Frink, drunk and frustrated, starts to lose it completely.
FRINK
You taught ME how to behave?! Listen,
you'd better behave now or you'll
get hurt!
CARY
(calmly)
I don't think so. I'll give you
three to put down that gun. It'll be
just too bad if you don't.
FRINK
Too bad for who?!
Frink cocks the hammer.
CARY
One ...
Cary moves slowly toward Frink.
FRINK
Keep away from me! I'll shoot, I
tell ya! I'll shoot!
CARY
Two ...
Frink and Cary are less than a yard apart.
FRINK
I'll shoot! I'll shoot!
GUNSHOTS. Cary flinches. Frink drops the pistol, his face twisted in pain. He
starts to fall.
Nearby, Francis coolly FIRES his rifle, pumping seven bullets into Frink.
Members of the crowd SCREAM in terror. Instinctively, Shep (still clutching
his side) and Nikki each put a restraining hand on Francis' arm. Francis
lowers the rifle, staring in horror and amazement at what he's just done.
CARY'S VOICE
Francis?
Cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of Francis' hands.
CARY
Francis?
Francis snaps out of his trance as Cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the
gallery. Shep and Nikki watch, stunned, as Francis immediately moves to Cary
and shakes his hand.
FRANCIS
Goodbye, Cary.
Francis turns to Shep and Nikki for equally heartfelt handshakes, an odd look
on his face.
FRANCIS
Shep. Nikki.
They realize he is saying a final goodbye. The crowd presses in as Francis
glances back at Frink before turning and hurrying off.
As a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting gallery, Francis
threads his way through it in the opposite direction and, with only the
briefest glance backward, rounds a corner to disappear behind a building.
Cary stares at Frink's body as the gathering crowd streams into view, then
quickly starts to lead a shaken Shep and Nikki away from the shooting gallery.
CARY
We've got to get out of here. Come
on, Shep. Come on.
They slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast gathering in front
of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction as Francis who is
now:
BEHIND THE CARNIVAL BUILDINGS
on a dark, deserted street. Distant crowd NOISE and carnival MUSIC drifts in.
Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls
casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing
to glance backward. He sees ...
... Cary, Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little
breathless, to lean against a wall. Shep, his fist still at his side, slumps
weakly as Cary and Nikki stare at ...
... Francis who briefly makes eye contact and then, without a word, turns,
steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks
off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness.
Cary and Nikki stare after him, astonished.
CARY
That's the last of Francis, I'm
afraid. We'll never see him again.
NIKKI
Did you notice his eyes? That's the
first time I ever saw Francis really
happy. What'll happen to him, do you
suppose?
CARY
Don't worry about, Francis. He'll
take care of himself. Let's get out
of here. Let's walk.
Shep leans weakly against the wall, his eyes glassy.
SHEP
No. Don't want to walk. Let's take
a cab.
Cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby. Nikki rests a sympathetic
hand on Shep.
DISSOLVE TO
THE BACK SEAT OF THE TAXI CAB - MOMENTS LATER
As the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the crowded
carnival, the MUSIC continues. Cary and Shep sit on either side of Nikki. Cary
is as edgy as Shep is subdued.
CARY
Did you see the way Francis poured
lead into that fellow?
SHEP
Fast work.
CARY
Fast? Chain lightning!
SHEP
Nice shooting.
CARY
Those slugs went right past my ear.
If I'd've moved an inch, I would've
caught one of them myself.
SHEP
"Sudden Death," all right.
Nikki takes out a cigarette.
CARY
What's the matter with you, Shep?
I've never known you so quiet
before.
SHEP
That's right. I am kind of quiet.
NIKKI
(holds her unlit
cigarette)
Not smoking?
SHEP
No.
NIKKI
Your lighter working?
SHEP
Good ol', Nikki -- never has any
matches.
NIKKI
No.
As Shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette
lighter, a strange look crosses his face.
SHEP
Sure you want a light?
NIKKI
That's what I want, a light.
Shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on -- revealing bloodstains on his
white shirt. Nikki stares down at the blood in horror.
NIKKI
Shep. Shep!
Nikki jumps up and moves away from Shep, into a seat opposite.
CARY
What is it?
NIKKI
Shep's hurt!
Cary turns to Shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange
look of release and satisfaction on his face.
SHEP
It's a forgery.
Cary examines Shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound.
NIKKI
Do something for him, Cary! Oh,
Shepard!
CARY
He's been shot!
NIKKI
What can we do, Cary?! What can we
do?!
CARY
Shep, why didn't you say you were
hurt?
SHEP
Good old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may
not believe it but this is the best
thing that ever happened to me.
CARY
Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that.
You'll be all right. We'll get you
to a hospital.
Shep puts a hand on Cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the
street.
SHEP
No, no, Cary. Don't rush me anywheres.
Let's sit here for a while. The--
Hurts, the jolting.
Urgently, Cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the
cab driver.
CARY
Stop! Stop!
In front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop.
The carousel MUSIC drifts in. Shep hardly moves -- head back, blank eyes
staring, voice dreamy and weak. Cary puts his face close to Shep's, listening
intently.
SHEP
That's better. You know, Cary, I feel
- just like we're falling -- long
time ago. Do you remember? Spinning
... spinning ... spinning. Only you
brought me down safe. Oh, Cary. Good
old Cary.
(sighs)
Best flyer in the service.
Nikki, seated opposite, is distraught.
NIKKI
Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
CARY
(reassuring)
We're gonna make a safe landing
again, Shep.
SHEP
Not this time, Cary. Ol' Shep's
gonna crash.
(beat)
Say, but we're spinning fast. Level
off. Cary, level off.
Shep's head slumps down. His face presses against Cary's shoulder.
NIKKI'S VOICE
Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
Cary can't look at him. Eyes wide, Cary slowly presses his cheek to Shep's.
CARY
Shep? - Shep?! - Shep!
Cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears. And yet he cannot bring himself
to cry.
