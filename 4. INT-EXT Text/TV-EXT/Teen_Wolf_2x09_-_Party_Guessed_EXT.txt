      Lydia blinks, gazing on the crowd while completely alone in 
      the field. Peering down, she discovers she s now wearing her 
      WINTER FORMAL DRESS.

      The crowd CHEERS as if a goal had been scored despite Lydia 
      remaining the only one on the field.

      Amid the excited crowd, one TEENAGE GIRL can be seen 
      SHRIEKING. Silent, terrified screams. No one seems to pay any 
      attention, their smiling faces offering a bizarre contrast.

      Coach sits at the benches among his players. Helmets pulled 
      low, they sit like gladiators ready for the attack.

      Then, as if sensing another presence, Lydia begins to turn.

        A SILHOUETTE walks out from between the LIGHTS. With a steady 
      and purposeful gait, Peter Hale rapidly crosses the field 
      toward Lydia.

      Retreating back, she spins to run when a HAND grabs her. 
      Lydia opens her mouth to scream, but the crowd s CHEERS drown 
      her out.

      Fangs distended, Peter ruthlessly drags her to the ground. 
      She struggles forward, digging at the grass.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/122.

      In the bleachers, a spectator raises a SIGN that reads: We 
      Love You Lydia!

      Another SIGN rises next to it: Everyone Loves Lydia!

      Among them, the Teenage Girl continues her frantic, silent 
      SCREAMING, fingers clawing at her neck as if she were 
      literally on fire.

      Lydia struggles, trying to free herself from Peter s grasp 
      while the CHEERING is rapidly overtaken by horrifying SNARLS. 
      The snapping and thrashing of teeth. VICIOUS GROWLS rising to 
      an ear-shattering crescendo as--


      Allison s car glides to a stop at a curb underneath the glow 
      of a streetlight.


      Parking at the curb, Allison steps out of her car. Dressed 
      for the party and carrying a small, wrapped present, she 
      takes a breath, psyching herself up.

                                    ALLISON
                    For Lydia.

      Forcing a smile, she starts up the long driveway to the 
      Martin home. Her pace slows, however, under the eerie quiet.

      Set at the top of a hill, the house looms in front of her, 
      darkly ominous. Taking each step more and more slowly--

      LAUGHTER makes her jump. TWO GUESTS hurry past as Allison 
      breathes with relief. Hearing MUSIC from inside the now 
      normal looking home, she hurries up the driveway to join the 
      party.


      STEAM rises off a heated pool lined by Greek columns in front 
      of a large guest house. On a table sits an impressively 
      elaborate looking PUNCH BOWL positioned as the grand 
      centerpiece of the party.

      Stepping out from between the columns, Allison makes a wary 
      approach toward Scott and Stiles.

                    I ll be okay.

      Allison turns her attention back to Lydia who hands a drink 
      to the last of her party guests. She glances about to see who 
      else needs a drink. But there s no one.

      The sight of Lydia standing alone underneath an arch of 
      brightly colored balloons while trying to maintain her 
      faltering smile finally breaks Scott s resistance.

      The only ones not having fun appear to be Stiles, Scott and a 
      distant Allison who can t help glancing at them from across 
      the pool.

      Eyes on the rising MOON, Scott takes a deep, meditative 
      breath while Stiles sips from a cup of Lydia s punch.

                                  STILES
                    So you going to apologize to

                    Then you should definitely

                    didn t do anything wrong, he

      Stiles whips his gaze back to the main house to see Jackson 
      calmly entering the party alone, eyeing the crowd with a look 
      of pure malevolence.

      A tray of drinks rises toward him. He peers from it to a 
      smiling Lydia, who seems oddly back to her old, confident 
      self.

                                  LYDIA
                    Glad you could make it.

      Watching from across the pool, Scott and Stiles hold still, 
      waiting for the worst.

      But Jackson simply plucks one of the drinks from the tray and 
      takes a sip.

      Satisfied, Lydia turns away. She passes the elaborate glass 
      PUNCH BOWL centerpiece. Inside, the murky liquid swirls down 
      the wide neck of the bowl all the way to the bottom where 
      crushed and wrinkled FLOWER PETALS drift about.

      FADE IN:


      Lydia whirls through the crowd, smiling brilliantly while a 
      strange, bacchanalian atmosphere descends over the party. 
      People dancing close, couples making out. Everyone drinking 
      now, Lydia hands a cup to someone who hasn t tried the punch--

      Matt. 

      Raising the plastic cup to his lips, he pauses, finding 
      Allison. Catching his eye, she slips behind a group of 
      people, disappearing from view as fast as she can.

      Disappointed, Matt tosses the full drink into the trash and 
      moves into the crowd while--

      Scott steps back, eyes locked on Jackson standing near the 
      guest house, alone. 

      Breath tightening, Scott glances to his fingers. No claws 
      yet. Before he can lower his hand, a drink is placed inside 
      his open palm by a smiling Lydia.

      the door to the main house. Eyes darkening, Scott watches her 
      nod, acquiescing to some request of Matt s.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1229.

      As she follows Matt inside the main house, Scott raises the 
      cup, seeming to not even think about it. Lydia waiting 
      expectantly beside him, Scott finally drinks.

      With a few quick gulps, he finishes it.


      Scott takes a hard swallow, blinking as the bright lights 
      over the pool begin to halo and blur.

      Scott starts for the main house with Stiles following. But 
      Stiles pauses at the sound of a VOICE.

                    Why am I wearing black? What are 
                    you an idiot?

      Turning around, Stiles looks through the parting crowd to see 
      his father at the drinks table. He wears a black suit and 
      holds a bottle of whiskey in one hand while grabbing a KID in

      Stiles throws his arms up to shield his face. But nothing 
      hits him. Blinking in shock, he looks about the party.

      As steam rises into the air from the pool, Stiles slumps down 
      against a brick column, utterly shaken.


      The beat of the music slows, switching to a trance-like feel

      Jackson reaches up to grab them, but stops, strangely

      Mother and Father turn around to reveal their faces.

      Except they have no faces. No eyes, nose or mouth. Just a 
      complete blank.

      Jackson stumbles back as they seem to peer at him. And then 
      his own hand comes up to his face.

      Except now Jackson has no eyes, nose or mouth either. In a 
      sudden panic, his hands come up to tear the flat, featureless 
      skin from his skull as--

      Jackson yanks his hands away. Gasping, he looks up to 
      discover everything is back to normal. But not for

      he sees are the glossy eyes of drugged partiers, some 
      laughing, others gazing about in a dazed fear.

                                  SCOTT
                    Where s Lydia? Where s Lydia?


      Lights flicker and flash inside the Martin Home while Lydia 
      casually walks down the driveway. A pair of CAR KEYS twirling 
      in her hand, she wears an almost mischievous smile.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      Still slumped against a column by the pool, Stiles won t even 
      look at Scott who tries to force a bottle of water on him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Drink the water. Stiles, drink it. 
                      Something s happening and I need 
                    you to sober up right now. Stiles, 
                    come on.

      A girl named DANIELLE, who has been smart enough to stick 
      with soda, approaches.

                                  DANIELLE
                    What do you think you re doing? You 
                    want to sober him up fast? That s 
                    not the way to do it.

                                  SCOTT
                    You can do better?

                                  DANIELLE
                    I can do best.

      Danielle grabs Stiles, pulls him to his knees and dunks his 
      head right into the pool. She yanks him up wide-eyed and 
      spitting chlorinated water.

                                  DANIELLE (CONT D)
                    How do you feel?

                                  STILES
                    Like I might have to revisit my 
                    policy on hitting a girl.

                                  DANIELLE
                          (to Scott)
                    He s sober.


      In the drunken crowd, someone SCREAMS.  Scott whirls around. 
      But it s just a girl being pushed into the pool. Stiles 
      hurries to his side.

                                  STILES
                    I can t find her. And dude, 
                      everyone--anyone who drank that 
                    crap. They re freaking out.

                                  SCOTT
                    I can see that.

      MORE SHRIEKS amid splashes as people jump and push others 
      into the pool.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1241.

                                  STILES
                    What the hell do we do?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know, but--

      A PANICKED VOICE interrupts him, turning them both around.

                                  VOICE
                    Stop! Don t--don t--

      Scott and Stiles move to see someone get pushed in. The body 
      SPLASH is followed immediately by a desperate thrashing in 
      the water. It s Matt.

                                  MATT
                      I can t--I can t swim!

      The music fades. Scott and Stiles stare, paralyzed, as 
      Jackson calmly reaches a powerful hand into the pool to drag 
      Matt.

      Soaked shoes hitting the cement tile, Matt pulls himself up. 
      Shivering, teeth clenched in fury, he raises his eyes to face 
      the quiet stares.

      He moves slowly. Drops of pool water falling from his wet 
      clothes as he walks through the parting crowd.

      He turns only once to connect eyes with Stiles and Scott.

      A SOUND breaks the quiet. The SHORT BURST of a police siren, 
      followed by the RINGING of the doorbell.

                                  VOICE
                    Cops are here!

      And suddenly everyone is moving. Racing for the gated exits, 
      shoving into the house, taking Scott and Stiles with them as 
      both Matt and Jackson disappear in the rush.


      People pour into the street hurrying for their cars.

      Scott steps off the curb. Glancing among the retreating party 
      guests, his eyes fall on a figure standing at a distance from 
      the house.

      Dripping wet, Matt directs an ice-cold glare on Scott, a look 
      of pure hatred and rage.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 209" WHITE2/27/1242.

      THE KANIMA inches out from behind a car on all fours. It 
      settles beside Matt, TAIL snaking around his leg, like the 
      way a child would grasp at its mother s skirt.

      Scott peers at the two of them with his breath trapped in his 
      throat. Kanima and Master. Puppet and puppeteer.

      TEENAGERS rush past, obscuring his view. When he steps aside 
      to look again, Matt and the creature are gone.
