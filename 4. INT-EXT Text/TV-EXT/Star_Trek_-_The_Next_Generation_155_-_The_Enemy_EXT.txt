 
 A hellish environment bathed in a BLUE-HUED light. 
 Cold and dusty (it is always night), the planet is 
 whipped by gale force winds. Visibility is only a few 
 feet. Crackling blue ARCS of electricity slash across 
 the sky. RIKER, WORF and GEORDI MATERIALIZE. It is 
 an immediate struggle to see. Riker lays a marker down 
 on the ground where they beamed in.

   minutes, forty seconds. 
 
 Worf and Riker light their palm beacons... beams of 
 light shoot out... it doesn't help a lot. 
 
     RIKER 
   Your view any better, Geordi? 
 
     GEORDI 
    (adjusting his VISOR) 
   Not too bad, sir. A lot of 
   charged-particle precipitation, 
   but I can compensate. 
 
     WORF 
   Communicators are dysfunctional. 
 
     RIKER 
   Tricorders? 
 
     WORF 
   Readings only valid within five 
   meters. 
 
     GEORDI 
    (re: his tricorder) 
   I'm not so sure of that... I'm 
   reading Worf as an unintelligent 
   life form.

     RIKER 
   Good thing we didn't bring

   week... 
 
 As they move from the beam down position... Geordi

 Geordi takes the point...

   conductive objects. 
 
 Moving with them as they begin to encounter pieces of 
 wreckage from a small landing craft, badly destroyed... 
 Riker looks down at some, reacts as he sees familiar 
 markings. 
 
     RIKER 
   Recognize the markings, Worf? 
 
     WORF 
   Yessir. Romulan. 
 
     RIKER 
   I wonder what the hell they were 
   doing in a Federation sector. 
 
     GEORDI 
   I'm picking up traces of ultritium 
   residue with my VISOR, Commander. 
   An explosive device must've been 
   used to destroy the craft after 
   it crashed.

 follow --

 as the distance between them increases, there is no 
 longer visual contact... Geordi disappears into the 
 storm as Worf comes across a seriously hurt Romulan 
 (PATAHK). 
 
     WORF 
   Commander... 
 
 Riker is not visible... likely out of earshot in the 
 wind... Worf bends down, rolls the Romulan on his back. 
 Patahk is MOANING, delirious. 
 
     WORF 
   Commander Riker... 
 
 Patahk opens his eyes and sees Worf. He lunges up from 
 the ground, and tries to close his hands around Worf's 
 throat. Worf struggles with the Romulan and succeeds 
 easily in immobilizing the injured man. A moment 
 later, Riker appears, reacts to the sight of the 
 Romulan.

 Geordi pushes into a crevice offering slim protection 
 from the furious storm... rests out of breath... He 
 is cold and hungry... rubbing his hands together for 
 heat... sees some (basketball-sized) rocks on the 
 ground... leans down to pick one up... and misses it off 
 to the left. He reacts... 
 
     GEORDI 
   What the hell... ? 
 
 He tries it again, comes down wrong again. Geordi 
 removes his VISOR, presses a tiny button on the inside 
 of it. After a beat, the VISOR BEEPS softly. Geordi 
 shrugs, puts it back on. As he tries again, this time 
 he methodically adjusts...

 to heat them up... sits next to the rocks to get warm.

 FADE IN: 
 
 
 The wind is getting stronger. Geordi, dazed, gets to 
 his knees, shakes his head to clear it. As sense 
 returns, he instinctively reaches for his phaser. It's 
 gone -- as are his tricorder and communicator. Geordi 
 looks up: 
 
51   ON THE ROMULAN 
 
 BOCHRA is standing a few meters away, holding Geordi's 
 tricorder and insignia in one hand -- and training a 
 phaser on him with the other. The wind grows more 
 furious. The Romulan does not look entirely well. 
 
     BOCHRA 
   You are my prisoner. 
 
 Geordi looks at him -- big deal. 
 
     GEORDI 
   Right. Congratulations. 
   Certainly, a strategic triumph 
   for the Romulan Empire. 
 
 Geordi starts to stand. Bochra waves the phaser. 
 
     BOCHRA 
   Stay there. 
 
     GEORDI 
   My shoes are getting full of 
   sand... I just hate that, don't 
   you? You think we could just 
   maybe move outta the... 
 
     BOCHRA

   How many other Federation troops 
   are with you? 
 
 FLASH of lightning. Wind stronger still. Geordi will 
 not offer any "military" information, sidesteps the 
 question.

   Your name and rank.

   Lieutenant Commander Geordi La

   Uh, I really don't think that's

   Commodore...

   Yeah, see... we heard your message

   Get up. 
 
 The wind is swirling dangerously now. Bochra gestures 
 for Geordi to start walking toward a cave (where he 
 was hiding). Geordi stands, but doesn't move. 
 
     GEORDI 
   Seriously. There's only one way 
   out of here. Put that down and 
   I'll take you back to my ship as 
   soon as there's a window in the
