The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.
The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows,
dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and
concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its
aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and
kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready
to burst.
Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic
anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned --
long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.
On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from
their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch
over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the
Gotham night.
One of them is moving.
The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of
big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness.
Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
each other... with one conspicuous exception:
A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring
straight
ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the
main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks
over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and
now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in
the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.
MOM
For God's sake, Harold, can we
please just get a taxi??
DAD
I'm trying to get a --
(shouting)
TAXI!!
Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in
frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.
JIMMY
We're going the wrong way.
Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys
them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.
DAD
Put that away. We'll look like
tourists.
TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night
souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER.
The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.
JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks
him off down the street and glowers at DAD.
DAD (cont.)
We'll never get a cab here. Let's
cut over to Seventh.
JIMMY
Seventh is that way.
DAD
I know where we are!
A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of
stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath
and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.
VOICE
Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?
The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty,
acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm
uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'
MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then
move on -- pretending not to hear.
DERELICT
Mister. How about it. One dollar?
(standing up)
One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
English??
By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street.
Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.
They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE
in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand
brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.
DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick
wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across
the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's
already searching for DAD's wallet.
MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to
snap -- so
the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his
gun on JIMMY.
STREET PUNK
Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
scream.
The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her
face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to
shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.
The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle,
slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.
Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down
on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.
NICK
(emptying the wallet)
All right. The Gold Card.
(tossing the credit card
in EDDIE's face)
Don't leave home without it.
A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the
cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct
CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.
EDDIE
Let's beat it, man. I don't like
being up here.
NICK
What, scared of heights?
EDDIE
I dunno, man. After what happened to
Johnny Gobs --
NICK
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
walked off a roof, all right? No big
loss.
EDDIE
That ain't what I heard. That ain't
what I heard at all.
(beat)
I heard the bat got him.
NICK
Gimme a break, will you? Shut up...
EDDIE
Five stories, straight down. There
was no blood in the body.
NICK
No shit. It was all over the
pavement.
NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the
roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight
tingle at the base of his spine...
EDDIE
There was no blood, man.
(beat)
My brother says... all the bad things
you done... they come back and
haunt you...
NICK
Listen to this. How old are you?
There ain't no bat.
EDDIE
My brother's a priest, man.
NICK
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
Now shut up.
(conclusively)
There ain't no bat.
As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the
opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away...
where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is
dropping slowly, implacably, into frame...
EDDIE
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --
NICK
Do you want this money or don't
you? Now shut up! Shut up --
BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of
BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS
DROP.
Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a
BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.
EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his
throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK
FIGURE advances, spreading
its arms. Or rather, its WINGS:
GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.
NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.
And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate,
menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval
yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness...
NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure
is knocked bodily to the roof.
Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He
whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --
NICK (cont.)
I'm gettin' outta here.
-- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a
strange, pre-verbal squeal...
... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET,
NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.
Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters
out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of
the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches
for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to
the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.
EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face
drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes
out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --
-- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --
-- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a
brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken,
weightless puppet.
THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES
NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES
past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape...
A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches
forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming
now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming
figure of the BAT at his heels...
... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against
the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He
has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.
Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he
could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling
on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to
pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails...
THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with
supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.
NICK (cont.)
Don't kill me... don't kill me...
When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is
standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at
arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.
The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:
BATMAN
I won't kill you. I want you to do
me a favor.
NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.
He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where
BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own
stricken face.
BATMAN (cont.)
Tell your friends. Tell all your
friends.
NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves
him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually,
without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE
ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.
Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over...
finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.
NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow
globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:
BATMAN
CUT TO:
The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham
Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of
activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.
EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic.
Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE
MEDIC.
MEDIC
That one there won't say a word. The
other one's raving his head off.
ECKHARDT
Variety, huh? The spice of life.
At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
PATROLMAN.
PATROLMAN
They found him hugging a drainpipe.
He was scared to come off the roof.
KNOX
Great, but tell me: is this another
you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
the third one this week.
PATROLMAN
(testily)
I dunno. What's "what"?
KNOX
Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
for a commendation.
KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and
saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.
ECKHARDT
Oh Christ, it's Knox.
KNOX
Hiya, gents. This anything I should
know about?
ECKHARDT
Nothing out of the routine.
At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.
NICK
A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
He wanted me to do him a favor...!
KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade
disgusted looks.
KNOX
No offense, boys, but these guys are
seeing something up there.
ECKHARDT
No comment. Print what you like.
KNOX
Come on. One question. Is there a
six-foot bat in Gotham City?
KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts
in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:
KNOX (cont.)
If so, is he on the police payroll?
If so, what's he pulling down after
taxes?
We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street.
He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling
across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the
dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.
ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction.
He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the
block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered
up alongside him.
ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it
quickly in his coat.
JACK
You didn't show up.
ECKHARDT
We had another bat sighting.
JACK
I'm sure that was vitally important.
Listen: things are heating up.
Someone is leaking information to
Harvey Dent.
ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.
ECKHARDT
I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
problem --
JACK
Eckhardt... our problems are your
problems.
ECKHARDT
I'll work on it.
JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his
topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the
material between his fingers.
JACK
Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
ostentatious on a cop's salary,
don't you think?
ECKHARDT
(knocking his hands away)
I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
you.
JACK
You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
should be thinking about the future.
ECKHARDT laughs in his face.
ECKHARDT
Ambition.
(nodding his head)
Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
that organization.
JACK
And why's that?
ECKHARDT
You're a psycho, friend. You're an
A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
it.
JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The
fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.
JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back
full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an
all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.
By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows.
ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.
JACK
Here. Use mine.
JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in
ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT
to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the
stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.
ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one
crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.
JACK (cont.)
It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
here is a good cop. A real good cop.
(pause; smiling)
Inexpensive.
DISSOLVE TO:
A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a
team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.
A NEON SIGN reads: "ACE CHEMICAL. FOR A MODERN TOMORROW."
From the SIGN we pan over to a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping
TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.
UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights
off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing
out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.
The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.
ECKHARDT
Shoot to kill.
ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE
BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED
COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM.
ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.
ECKHARDT
What are you trying to do, blow the
collar?
GORDON
(to SWAT TEAM)
You men are dismissed. We'll take
over from here.
(to UNIFORMED COPS)
Any man who opens fire on Jack
Napier... will answer to me.
ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.
GORDON (cont.)
You. Stick around.
A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the
illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the
chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky
deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the
oily surface of the foul, polluted river.
As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck
swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER
-- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.
A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we
SHOCK CUT TO:
A CABIN CRUISER slices through the waves. In the distance,
closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.
BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE
FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs,
soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.
VICKI
Do you sail?
BRUCE
Too much work. I'm not really the
physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.
ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of
drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches
for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin
over braided telephone cables.
VICKI
You do a very convincing imitation.
(sipping her drink)
Mm, this is tasty. What's yours?
He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for
her to try a sip.
VICKI (cont.)
... Ginger ale?
BRUCE
Two drinks and I start swinging from
the rooftops.
(beat)
Tell me, Vicki. There's something
I'm very curious about. What took
you down to Corto Maltese?
VICKI
... I guess I needed a change.
BRUCE
You were one of the most successful
magazine photographers in the city.
Everyone wanted you.
VICKI
Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?
BRUCE
Not since the shooting started.
VICKI
We went there once when I was
little. I played on the beach. And
at nights -- they had a band -- I
danced with my father on the hotel
patio.
(shrugging)
That was Corto Maltese. When the war
broke out I had to go back. And I
promised myself that this time... I
wouldn't look away.
BRUCE
What did you see?
VICKI
... Terror.
The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends.
VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.
BRUCE
There's terror everywhere. Some
types are just more -- familiar
than others.
For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his
familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.
VICKI
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
know it all seems a million miles
away, out here on the water, with
all this --
BRUCE
Insulation?
VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she
can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.
VICKI
Bruce, really, when I say these
things I don't mean to criticize
you.
BRUCE
I think you see things very clearly.
VICKI
I'm happy to talk about something
else. I don't want to be depressing.
BRUCE
(smiling)
Do you assume that if I know you
better I won't like you as much?
VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but
if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.
VICKI
I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
you like this with the other women
you know? -- Because I just can't
seem to get a handle on this
conversation.
BRUCE
(taking her hand)
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
ambiguous, I think you should put
the most flattering possible
interpretation on it. Because even
if it doesn't sound that way...
that's how I'll mean it.
Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's
also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before
she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting.
CUT TO:
Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole
near the Gotham docks.
From a point high above we see JACK emerging into the
alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head.
We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH.
CUT TO:
LOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club
as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off.
KID
Nice hair, dude!
JACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he
gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER --
and strides deliberately across the street.
We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper,
arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW
spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.
A COSTUMED CLOWN with a wheeled cart, filling balloons from
a helium tank, passing them out to the kids. CRIMELORD #2
strolls past. The CLOWN offers him a balloon, which be
politely refuses.
THE CLOWN reaches into his cart for a RED METAL TANK. But,
as we quickly find out, it's not a helium tank -- it's a
FLAMETHROWER.
A sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate
skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many
nations. Amid the pedestrians we catch BRUCE and VICKI, all
smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.
VICKI
... To tell you the truth, I'd just
about given up waiting.
BRUCE
I said I'd call you the minute I got
free. And I did. -- And here we are.
VICKI
(teasing him)
Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.
He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.
BRUCE
Vicki. Do you want the whole truth?
All coyness aside?
(long pause)
I wish I had more time to give you.
Every day I don't see you, I miss
you.
(beat)
Now. Are you going to waste this
lovely afternoon being all mad at
me?
All this, of course, is delivered with devastating
sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.
VICKI
Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so
much like someone I used to...
(stopping suddenly)
Bruce? I know this is silly, but --
you're not married, are you?
He stops and laughs. She smiles crookedly, takes his arm.
ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PLAZA - THAT MOMENT
PHILLY RICORSO -- another CRIMELORD from the boardroom --
enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of PAID BODYGUARDS.
ON BRUCE AND VICKI
A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way
along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans.
VICKI
All street mimes should be executed.
BRUCE
... Looks like a convention.
And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging
on the center of the plaza.
RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a
skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the
passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.
A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME
reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.
SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.
VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's
HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.
SERIES OF SHOTS
BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT
with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:
-
TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY
and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding
the CROWD at bay;
-
A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully
imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;
-
PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as
OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses...
... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for
a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in
the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's
just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.
He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN,
CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's
practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible
anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.
A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.
ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS
BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.
ANGLE ON BRUCE
his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood
as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's
almost as if the bullets are striking him.
A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI
emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the
wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.
As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS --
with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks
up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so
desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.
VICKI
BRUCE!!
He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's
eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.
BRUCE
Oh my God... are you all right?
He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.
He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened,
pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her
face is full of bewilderment and doubt.
INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
ANCHORWOMAN
... live from Halliday Plaza, where a
gangland-style execution claimed the
life of racketeer Philly Ricorso.
Ricorso's death is the third in a
rash of underworld killings...
CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON.
ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
Commissioner, you've heard the
rumors. Are these murders the work
of the mysterious 'Batman'?
A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the
TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big
desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand.
JOKER
All reet! I think it's about time
we called another meeting, huh?
CUT TO:
THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before
him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH
DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.
JOKER (cont.)
-- and the world smiles with you!
Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --
He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as
he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.
SERIES OF SHOTS
Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react
to the JOKER's maniacal promo.
JOKER
I know what you're saying. Where can
I buy these fine, fine products?
Well, that's the gag, folks, you
never know. Chances are... you've
bought 'em already!!!
As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:
-
A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for
a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under
one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can,
suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?
-
A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable
as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then
FREEZE with their forks in midair.
-
A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked,
she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We
FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.
On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE.
Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal
GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.
From across the street we see VICKI headed down the
sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay
phone.
VOICE
She's outside the Fluegelheim.
VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET
into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.
BATMAN
GET IN THE CAR!
VICKI
WHICH CAR?
VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there
are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only
one BATMOBILE.
VICKI (cont.)
... Oh.
The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well,
indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the
passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning
array of electronic gadgetry.
BATMAN
Ignition!
As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the
dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny,
synthesized VOICE repeats the command:
COMPUTER
Ignition.
The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the
cockpit alongside VICKI.
Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the
Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE
FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of
the alley at ninety miles an hour.
THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.
JOKER
I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!
The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH
PLAYING CARDS."
Half his GOONS pile into the van behind
him, the other half into a second car nearby.
SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.
BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands,
dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.
BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining
on them; and then, from behind --
BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They
dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.
They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.
Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the
roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as
the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this
height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a
sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.
ANGLE ON GOONS
peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE
WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.
GOON I
Well?... Who is this guy?
GOON II
I dunno. You seen him before?
GOON III
Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.
GOON IV
Good idea. Let's check his wallet.
GOON I
We'll worry about it later. Plug
him.
(beat)
In the head.
GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A
FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.
Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.
GOON III
Goddam, it's the redhead!
ON VICKI
A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the
GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds
the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.
ON BRUCE
HIS EYES WINK OPEN.
ON VICKI
momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP
SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds
it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and
then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a
TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman...
ON THE THUGS
No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.
GOON II
Did you hit her?
GOON I
Who cares? Wax that freak.
They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes
out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL
and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas
pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.
In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body
THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage
can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.
GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the
way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.
Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the
alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at
BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.
BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.
Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised
on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH
GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.
ON VICKI
She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons
everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up,
grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet
her.
VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S
FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the
roll, then drops it down her blouse.
But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens
her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the
alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.
It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI
clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous
glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.
Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out
how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.
BATMAN
... Not even a 'thank you'?
VICKI
Well -- I think you might consider
thanking me. You were good as
dead.
BATMAN
That's because you lied about your
weight.
(a long pause)
Thank you.
VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.
BATMAN (cont.)
I'll have to ask you for that film.
VICKI
I just wanted to distract them. I
wasn't trying to get a picture of
you.
BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The
telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.
BATMAN
Please.
VICKI
I won't let you have it.
THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.
VICKI (cont.)
I know you can break my neck and
take it. But the Joker's on that
same roll. I --
BATMAN
The Joker is a murderer. And you
were as good as dead. So --
VICKI
Look, I appreciate what you did for
me. But this is my job. And I'm
keeping those pictures.
BATMAN
All right, here's a compromise. I'll
develop the photos. You keep the
Jokers and I'll keep the rest.
VICKI
How do I know you won't keep them
all?
BATMAN
Because I'll take you with me.
He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His
voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy
from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to
him.
Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands
over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.
BATMAN (cont.)
Thank you, Vicki.
VICKI
... Where are you going to take me?
No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her
closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand
delicately along the line of her cheek...
... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS
into BATMAN's arms.
CUT TO:
Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in
his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at
the BATMOBILE two blocks down.
The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact.
But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL
OVER the fearsome machine.
BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON
CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the
Batmobile.
He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.
BATMAN
Shields open.
TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From
within they hear the tinny computerized voice:
COMPUTER
Shields open.
The steel plates begin to retract.
BATMAN (V.O.)
(over radio)
Ignition.
COMPUTER
Ignition.
The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.
COP
There's somebody in there!
They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO
LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.
COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there
stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances
toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes
dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.
PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.
SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless
BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting,
dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of
COP CARS in hot pursuit.
BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and
approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms
and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING
HEADLIGHTS.
BATMAN
STOP!
BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN
and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.
SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible
behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's
powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL
THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.
DISSOLVE TO:
A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on
either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.
At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by
underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a
SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.
Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds
later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.
The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE:
liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless
cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays
underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters
emerge from the opening of a hit musical.
In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE,
his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son
BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep,
head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.
THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the
sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts
an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.
IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES
are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and
MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle
BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF
JOY. And then, without warning --
A HANDGUN enters frame.
The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps
protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet,
begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.
MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at
her throat.
The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But
MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.
The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.
The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The
pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward
the sidewalk.
A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.
THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek
we cannot hear --
-- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.
BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a
handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's
purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the
boy.
Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his
parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny
glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around
them.
He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the
GUNMAN turns and runs.
AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics
with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped
tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.
There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away
from us. We can't see his face.
And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's
hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name,
LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in
GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.
But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns.
Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death...
and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
violate this most private and terrible of moments.
At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the
sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN
is smiling prettily at BRUCE.
The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.
A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding
white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING
SOUND cuts through the silence.
CUT TO:
CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the
Globe, which carries the full-page banner headline:
WAR OF THE FREAKS
Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout
In the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past,
dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk.
"WAR OF THE FREAKS" has been relegated to the lower right-
hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing
news:
STOCK MARKET CRASHES
Product Scare Drops Dow to 1100
Biggest One-Day Decline in History
A tiny island in Gotham Harbor, homesite of LADY GOTHAM --
the huge, newly restored stone statue that welcomes
incoming ships. Her upper half is draped in a huge TARP
prior to the unveiling ceremony scheduled for this Sunday.
At the base of the statue, WORKMEN are assembling a big
wooden platform, complete with microphones, amplifiers and
spotlights. They raise a gigantic BANNER which reads:
"GOTHAM CITY -- 300TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION."
CUT TO:
A TAXI pulls away from the wrought-iron gate at the
entrance to the estate. KNOX ambles up to a stone pillar,
glances up at a VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the gate, and
hits a BUZZER.
ALFRED (V.O.)
(through loudspeaker)
Yes?
KNOX
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
ALFRED (V.O.)
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
KNOX
Actually, I wanted to talk to
Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne,
would you?
KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS.
Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.
The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and
Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE
CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in
everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits,
representing the King in progressive stages of
deterioration.
From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling
out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE.
He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL
LIGHT begins to flash.
BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the
BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's
BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.
The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual.
But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky,
staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.
Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow
belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the
intersection on a ROPE.
As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist.
His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just
about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING
MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands
directly behind him on the horse's back.
BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider.
The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through
the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.
BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones,
drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the
FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.
A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.
BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING
TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its
hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --
-- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE,
neatly tied in string.
BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick
salute -- and the BUG is gone.
THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET
ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around
the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.
CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the
FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:
EMCEE
-- the most spectacular, most death-
defying aerial stunt ever devised.
Tonight -- for the first time
anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!
He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying
side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.
ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS
ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the
twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING
GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled
red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other
in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.
PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the
crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.
On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He
lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly
against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN --
driving it off the access road down into the brush, where
it nearly topples over sideways.
ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS
GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair,
landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're
swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make
the return leap back to his own trapeze.
The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding
trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.
THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a
massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of
BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!
THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an
expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.
JOKER
I love fireworks!
ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS
LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past.
One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON
falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER
plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.
MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and
weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.
THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a
wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER
veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously
close to the tall buildings along the avenue.
The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the
chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF
A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.
ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists
his chrome spear over the windshield.
The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up
into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads
"DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken
off!
ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across
the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.
BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over
a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet,
ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm
around his waist.
DICK
LET ME GO! LET ME --
THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with
MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the
GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.
DICK (cont.)
YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--
DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his
hands full restraining the kid.
JOKER
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
hot.
(glowering at BATMAN)
Hands off the belt.
BATMAN
Take me. Let the boy go.
JOKER
Gosh, I could kill you, but then
you'd miss my party. And I'd be
real, real sad if you couldn't make
it.
BATMAN
What are you talking about?
JOKER
Batman! Don't you even recognize
your old pal Jack? After all...
(cackling insanely)
You made me what I am today.
BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS
BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the
crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the
night.
DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to
the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.
DICK
HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
MY --
BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into
his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE
under DICK's nose.
DISSOLVE TO:
INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment.
COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.
REPORTER
... on a tip attributed to the
mysterious Batman. The apartment was
booby-trapped with the Joker's
laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
dead.
(beat)
Also found dead at the scene was
Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of
BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other
screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.
We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION,
showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER
and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate
transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads
into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and,
as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.
Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE
CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.
And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head
in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
he would just as soon be dead.
The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long
driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.
The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage
point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out
the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up
the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights
off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's
forces.
The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR
and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and
taking half the chain-link fence with it.
In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the
BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A
ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the
factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole
in the door.
THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking
lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS.
For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --
All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble
and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.
CUT TO:
DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham
Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming
stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas,
ready to be unveiled.
THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of
Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-
talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the
Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as
the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's
just another part of the celebration.
At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a
microphone:
GOVERNOR GILROY
As Governor of this great state, it
is now my honor to unveil for you a
very special lady -- a lady who
stands tall for life and liberty --
America's favorite lady... LADY
GOTHAM!
The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY
GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's
Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair
of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon:
hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the
canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face...
... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!
Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE
SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS
ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic:
the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the
stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD
stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.
And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS
GOING DARK.
QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different
points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a
PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:
JOKER (V.O.)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
little token of my esteem. HAVE
FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!
INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S
HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!
SERIES OF SHOTS
ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to
earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS
try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another
in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT
DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb
out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.
DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED
COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS,
DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled
subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.
On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a
field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless
against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.
FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats
and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of
an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies...
only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a
SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.
In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild
street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.
KNOX
VICKI!
VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's
wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.
KNOX (cont.)
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
girl could get hurt this way.
VICKI
Yeah. Deja vu.
KNOX
What do you say? Let's head for the
lights.
In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS
are sweeping the sky.
Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.
On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the
street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if
nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block
intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS
BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical
figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.
The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN --
smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We
TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT...
... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily
at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like
some demented parade marshal.
CUT TO:
A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints
on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the
legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."
Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.
The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously
TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A
STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.
THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift,
sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS
EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to
release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.
The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the
reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and
wonder what to do next.
They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a
sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they
HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE
TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and
destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.
ANGLE ON BATMAN
in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the
wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham
skyline.
FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE
FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.
Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character
UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on
itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the
street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.
The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK
SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to
engulf the entire block!
Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from
the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He
flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.
It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in
party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that
current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.
As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy
out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And
DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.
Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT
TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.
KNOX
GIMME A HAND UP HERE!
VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of
the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel
assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM...
... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!
THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing
MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on
the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE
CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.
He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints
bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed
inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is
BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face...
... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM!
The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE
TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring
through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to
the ground!
JOKER
No... NOOOOO!!!
ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON
as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in
the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it
now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it
disperses harmlessly in the wind.
THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the
rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds
it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession;
hits a button repeatedly...
... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The
damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
fit of pique.
A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back
for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of
twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.
CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS
sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on
helplessly, in stunned disbelief.
As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON
THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.
JOKER
There. There. -- GET 'EM!!
ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK
A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX
throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the
spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.
KNOX
GET THE CAR!
The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the
Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps
off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of
rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.
GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.
In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.
THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue,
past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the
one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear
through a CONCEALED HATCH.
WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE
mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the
parade decorations. And one moment later...
A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!
The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips
through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and
BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.
The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full
speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either
side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The
REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO
FLAME!
The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the
tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps
the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF
THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of
the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.
And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as
the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE
OPEN!
The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A
hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and
pulls himself up to the street.
He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the
BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt
SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the
tunnel.
JOKER
You do him. I'm outta here.
The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They
sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the
Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN...
inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.
A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for
their guns, move in warily...
VOICE
Yo.
The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of
motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and
green --
-- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only
one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a
red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.
They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in
agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath
him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.
DICK
Now we're even, huh? Even up.
BATMAN
How did you...
DICK
I hitched. MOVE IT!
DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO
FLAME behind them.
BATMAN
The Joker. Is he --?
DICK
Forget it. Relax.
(beat)
... He's mine now.
DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.
BATMAN
DICK!
THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is
unendurable. His body has finally failed him.
He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as
DICK races off with murder in his eyes.
A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky,
piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is
scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old
abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.
JOKER
Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.
HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER
forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears,
hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.
The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a
windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD
LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.
A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves
-- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of
the old cathedral --
-- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air
like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in
blind uncomprehending fury --
It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly
silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies
splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the
churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in
the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE
FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.
Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars.
Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.
POV JOKER
Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks,
bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the
sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.
REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE
It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost
childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually,
though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins
to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness
sets in.
FADE THROUGH TO:
VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT
in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine
it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping
flowers.
VICKI
I loved you too.
As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she
gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.
The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."
A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the
distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling
finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at
the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.
A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his
RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN
SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through
the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a
BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.
We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN
vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new
adventures. MUSIC BUILDS and we
FADE OUT.
