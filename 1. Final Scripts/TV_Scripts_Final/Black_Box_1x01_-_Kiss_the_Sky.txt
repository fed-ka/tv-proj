      INT. DR. HARTRAMPH S OFFICE - DAY

      DR. HARTRAMPH faces her patient, DR. ELIZABETH BLACK.  
        Elizabeth wears dark jeans, a de-constructed T-shirt, 
      looks more like a rock star at the end of a bender than 
      what she is: a famous neurologist.  The office is bare 
        bones.  Two chairs, a desk, a computer.  Boxed 
        medications are stacked from floor to ceiling.  Hartramph 
      is a medicating psychiatrist, not a talk shrink.  She s 
        unsentimental, all business.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      How would you define normal, Elizabeth?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I don t know what normal means.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      You re a neuroscientist. I think you can 
                      handle this.

                                        ELIZABETH
                        Statistically, normal means average. 

                                        HARTRAMPH
                    So all extraordinary people are abnormal?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Yes.  Picasso wasn t normal. Einstein 
                      wasn t normal.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      And a normal person is mediocre?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I didn t say that.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      Let s talk about what happened Thursday 
                      night.  This is the message you left on 
                    my machine.
                                (reads from her note pad)
                     I freakin  nailed it.  Every man in the 
                      room wanted to sleep with me.  Every 
                      woman wanted to be me.  I have the cure 
                      for autism and schizophrenia.  Buy MERCK. 
                      We re in talks. 

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (unrepentant)
                    It was a classic manic episode.
                                        (MORE)                                                                                        2.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                      Sudden onset.  Pressured speech, 
                      delusions of grandeur, disordered 
                      thought, hallucinations...

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      And?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      A freakin  rocket ride, if you want to 
                      know the truth.  I ve never had a better 
                      time in my life.

        Hartramph is silent. Waits for the kicker.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                                (reluctantly)
                      Until, drum roll, I nearly killed myself.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      You nearly killed yourself.
                              (lets that sink in)
                      When I saw you last Wednesday, you were 
                      happy.  Thinking about changing your 
                      whole life.


      INT. WILL S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

        Elizabeth just finished making love with WILL VAN 
        RENSELLER.  He s a handsome, strong, imposing young black 
      man.  His hair is gathered in long braids that hang down 
      his muscled back.  He is kissing Elizabeth s neck.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I love you.

                                        WILL
                      And I love you.

      He reaches under a pillow, pulls out a diamond ring. She 
        stares a moment in disbelief. She pulls away, sits up.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      No, no, no.

                                         WILL
                      Yes.  It s time.  I have to know we have 
                      a future.  I swear I don t want to 
                      domesticate or tame you.  What I want is 
                    to wake up and find you in bed next to me 
                      every day for the rest of my life.

        Elizabeth is moved. She touches his face.                                                                                        3.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      Oh, baby.  I can t.  You think you know 
                      me, but you only see one side of me.  I 
                      can be a real bitch.

                                        WILL
                      And I can be a dick.  I don t expect, or 
                      even want, perfection.


      INT. HARTRAMPH S OFFICE - DAY

        Hartramph and Elizabeth, where we left them.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      You didn t refuse him.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      No.  I said I had to think about it.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      Then you left for San Francisco to give 
                      the keynote speech at American Society of
                        Neuroscientists.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Yeah.  A very big deal.  I d been working 
                    on that speech for weeks.

      We hear the approaching roar of a jet engine.


      EXT. LAX - DAY

      The plane SCREAMS towards camera, takes off, the wheels 
        passing just overhead.

                                        ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                      I started to panic when I reread it on 
                      the plane.


      INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

        Elizabeth sits in first class reading some pages. Not a 
      happy camper.

                                        HARTRAMPH (V.O.)
                    It wasn t up to your standards.

        A beeper goes off on Elizabeth s watch.  Mechanically, 
      she opens her purse, pulls out two bottles of 
        prescription medicine.                                                                                        4.


                                        HARTRAMPH (V.O.)
                      You needed a shot of  inspiration .

      She looks at the pills, pauses, and puts them away.

                                        HARTRAMPH (V.O.)
                    So you skipped your meds.

        Elizabeth signals the STEWARDESS she wants a drink.


      EXT. HYATT HOTEL SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

        Moving past the skyline to the hotel.  Helicopter shot 
        swoops up, up, in a dizzying flight to the balcony suite 
      on the 30th floor.


      INT. HYATT SAN FRANCISCO - BALCONY SUITE - NIGHT

        Elizabeth writes a moment, then balls up the paper and 
        throws it on the floor.  Still blocked.

                                        ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                      That night, I barely slept.


      INT. HYATT BALCONY SUITE - MORNING

        Elizabeth lies in bed, still wide awake, fully clothed.

                                        ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                    By the morning the medication was out of 
                    my system.  Finally, the fog lifted and 
                    my mind grew wings.

      She vaults out of bed.


      INT. HYATT SAN FRANCISCO - BALCONY SUITE - DAY

        Elizabeth sits at the desk writing so feverishly that her 
      pen literally flies across the paper.  Her concentration 
      is astonishing. Her output epic.  As she finishes each 
      page, she pushes it off to drop to the ground.  There s a 
      pile at her feet.  When the last page lands and she s out 
      of paper, she starts writing up her arm.


      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO HYATT - NIGHT

        Elizabeth comes out, dressed to kill in an outfit way too 
        trendy/sexual for a gathering of neuroscientists.                                                                                          5.


      As she gets in the limo, the driver, KASSIM, a muscular 
      young Middle Eastern man in a tight shirt, holds the 
      door.  Her skirt hikes as she slides into the back seat.  
      He watches, then his look then moves up and meets her 
      smile as we hear:

                                        MALE (V.O.)
                      I am honored tonight to introduce
                      the director of the highly acclaimed 
                        Neuroscience Research and Treatment 
                      Centre at USFD.


      INT. CONFERENCE HALL - NIGHT

      The DOCTOR doing the introduction stands beneath a banner 
      that says  American Society for Neuroscience .  The 
        audience is packed with egghead doctors who look 
        humorless and impossible to impress.

                                        DOCTOR
                        ....recently named by Newsweek one of the 
                      hundred most prominent people in 
                      medicine.

        Elizabeth is backstage waiting in the wings.  She adjusts 
      a bra strap, swallows a small mini bar bottle of gin.

                                        DOCTOR (CONT D)
                      Her articles and books documenting an 
                      array of bizarre cases have earned her 
                      the nickname, the Marco Polo of the 
                      brain.  Please welcome Dr. Elizabeth 
                      Black.

        Elizabeth strides on stage. She looks stunning. Like a 
      movie star. She is completely confident, wildly 
        charismatic and now arrogant, too.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Thank you. It s an honor to be here. I 
                      don t think I ve ever seen so much raw 
                      brainpower in one room.  I d like to 
                      begin by saying you don t know shit.  Any 
                    of you.

      The audience stirs, exchanges annoyed looks.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      About the brain, that is.  We study an 
                      organ so complex it s beyond human 
                        comprehension.  How do you make sense of 
                      a hundred billion neurons with a hundred 
                      trillion connections between them?  The
                                        (MORE)                                                                                        6.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      galaxy is simple in comparison.  I tackle 
                      the problem by taking the advice of a 
                       crazy  man.

        A huge image appears on the screen behind Elizabeth: Van 
        Gogh s Starry Night.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Vincent Van Gogh once said that to 
                      understand blue you must first
                      understand yellow and orange. In other 
                      words, to see anything, you have to 
                      understand it s opposite.  I study 
                      abnormal brains to learn about  normal  
                      ones.  And every day I grapple with the 
                      very definition of the word  normal .
                                (turning to the painting)
                       Starry Night  was completed by Van Gogh 
                      while he while he was a patient in a 
                      mental hospital.  Temporal lobe epilepsy 
                      allowed Saint Paul, Moses and Joan of Arc 
                    to hear the voice of God.  Hemmingway, 
                      Sylvia Plath, Art Buchwald, Billie 
                      Holiday, Winston Churchill, Teddy 
                      Roosevelt, Charles Dickens, Herman 
                      Melville: these are only a few of the 
                      great minds who suffered from  a fine 
                      madness .  Should they have been 
                      medicated into mediocrity?  My work is 
                      about respecting each individual brain
                      while I learn from my patients.  And as I 
                      study the disorders themselves, I make no 
                      attempt to distinguish them from an 
                      imaginary and ideal state of  normalcy .


      INT. HARTRAMPH S OFFICE - DAY

        Hartramph looks unimpressed.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      How was the speech received?


      INT. CONFERENCE HALL - NIGHT

      The doctors leap to a standing ovation. Voices call out: 
         Bravo!   She s incredible!   So brilliant!   And so 
        beautiful!                                                                                         7.

                      You were hallucinating.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Yes.  


      INT. LIMO - NIGHT

        Elizabeth has her window down, leans out, her hair 
        blowing.  She loosens the top of her dress, revealing 
      more cleavage.   

                                        ElIZABETH (V.O.)
                    On the ride home, I became hypersexual.

      Now she sees her handsome driver, Kassim, watching her 
        intently in the rear view mirror.  She smiles.  He smiles 
      back.


      INT. ELEVATOR - HYATT - NIGHT

        Elizabeth and Kassim are going up to the 30th floor 
        together, necking as the floors click by.  It s hot, 
        passionate, hungry kissing.  His hands slide down to her 
      ass.  She laughs.  And laughs.


      INT. LIVING ROOM SUITE - NIGHT

        Clothes scattered everywhere.  A lamp tipped over.  An 
      empty bottle of champagne lies on the sofa.  Sounds of 
      sex and water running.


      INT. BATHROOM BALCONY SUITE - NIGHT

        Kassim and Elizabeth can be seen in the steamy shower.  
      They are forms glimpsed partially in the steam, thrusting 
        madly.


      INT. BEDROOM SUITE - NIGHT

      It s later.  Much later.  A digital clock reads 4 a.m.   
        Elizabeth, now wearing a black satin teddy, her hair in 
        disarray, jumps on the king sized mattress, singing to 
      music blaring in her head.                                                                                        8.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      "Blackbird singing in the dead of
                      night.  Take these broken wings and
                      learn to fly.  You were only
                      waiting for this moment to arrive."

        Kassim can be seen in the next room, looking for 
        something.  He s fully dressed.  Elizabeth doesn t appear 
      to know he exists.  He finds her purse on the floor, 
      takes all the money from her wallet, exits.  

        Meanwhile, Elizabeth sings louder, jumps higher and 
        higher.  Until she is flying.  Then, like a dark Peter 
      Pan, she flies right out the balcony door. 


      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

        Elizabeth is superwoman, soaring far above the lights 
      along the harbor, doing barrel rolls like an F-16 fighter 
        pilot.  Stars streak by.  The Milky Way spins overhead.  

      CU ELIZABETH, crying tears of joy.  Then lightning 
        flashes.  Something wet hits her cheek.  Rain.  The world 
      goes dark and cold.  The stars disappear.  

      And now she s falling like a stone.  The harbor lights 
      blur as she drops towards the earth, hurtling towards the 
        pavement. She opens her mouth to scream and-


      EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - NIGHT

        Elizabeth is back in the real world, balancing on the 
        railing of the hotel balcony 30 floors up in her silk 
        underwear in the rain. Inches from death.  She wobbles, 
        nearly falls, barely catches herself, drops back to the 
        safety of the balcony where she edges back, curls into a 
      fetal position.  For the first time, scared.


      INT. HARTRAMPH S OFFICE - DAY

        Elizabeth is sobered now. But there s no self-pity.  It s 
      not in her nature.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I took four Ativan and crawled into
                      bed.  The next day, it was over. I
                      flew home.  Will met my plane.                                                                                        9.


      INT. AIRPORT BAGGAGE AREA - DAY

        A pale Elizabeth finds Will waiting for her. She moves 
        immediately into his arms, holds on.  


      INT. HARTRAMPH S OFFICE - DAY

        Hartramph takes a moment to let it all sink in.   Then...

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      Let s talk about some of the exceptional 
                      people you named in your speech.  
                      Hemmingway used a shotgun to blow his 
                      brains out.  Sylvia Plath was thirty when 
                      she stuck her head in an oven.  Billie
                      Holiday died of acute alcoholism after a 
                      lifetime of drug abuse. Van Gogh shot 
                      himself in a wheat field right after 
                      finishing a painting.  Normalizing does 
                      not doom you to mediocrity.  It allows 
                      you to live long enough to do your best 
                      work.  It gives you peace.   

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (soft, looking at her hands)
                      I get it.  This time, I get it.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                    Do you, Elizabeth?  Really?  Because it s 
                      important.  Your life is at stake.  
                      Here s the question I want you to ask 
                      yourself.
                                (beat)
                    Do you want to be  exceptional  and
                      dead?

      END TEASER                                                                                        10.


                                        ACT ONE


      INT. ELIZABETH S BATHROOM - MORNING

      High end, spare, clean.  Elizabeth is dressed, 
        alternative as always, but she s back to being carefully 
      put together.  This is the good Elizabeth, the sane 
        Elizabeth.  Her appearance and the neatness of her 
        surroundings will always be a tell of her state of mind. 
      She takes her medication.


      EXT. THE CUBE - DAY

      The Center for Neurological Research and Treatment, aka 
       The Cube  is a square structure made of smoky black 
        glass, attached by walkway to an older University 
        hospital.  The hospital is staid, ordinary, plain. The 
      cube is modern.  Elegant.  Impenetrable.


      INT. THE CUBE - DAY

        State-of-the art hallways are hung with prints by Goya, 
      Van Gogh, Pollack, Bosche: all artists with issues.  One 
        glance tells us this is a facility like no other. 
        Patients roam freely; most wear street clothes.  There 
      are no straight jackets, no restraints.  Nor is it the 
      least bit grim.  The  normal  staff mingle easily with 
      the patients.

      One WOMAN wearing a Chanel suit is facing a wall and 
        inching along, spanning it with her arms as if measuring 
      it and embracing it.  A MIDDLE-AGED man stares at a 
        mirror, speaks gently but firmly to his own reflection.

                                          MIDDLE-AGED MAN
                      Look, you seem like a nice guy.
                      But if you don t quit following me
                      I m calling the police.

        A dwarf runs by wearing an outfit straight out of Santa s 
        workshop.  Green tights.  Red cap.  Wide patent leather 
      belt.  Bells on his toes.  This is YOJO.  He tears ass, 
      does a controlled skid and ducks down a side hall just as 
      LUCY DACY, 60, appears.

      Lucy looks like she could be a school librarian, which is 
      what she was until she retired a few weeks ago.  She s 
        harried and unfit, seems exhausted from her exertions.

                                        LUCY
                      Yojo?  This isn t a game, dear.                                                                                        11.


      Lucy glances into several side rooms.  A male nurse, 
        JORGE, looks up from reception.

                                        JORGE
                      May I help you?

                                        LUCY
                      I m here with my friend, YoJo.  He has an 
                      appointment with Dr. Black.  He thinks 
                      he s one of Santa s elves.

      Lucy hears giggling from down the hall.  Yojo peeks out.  
      She takes off after him as we pick up Elizabeth going 
      into an examination room.


      INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

        Elizabeth enters and stops in her tracks.  ANTHONY 
        GUINESS, 18, uses colored markers to draw on the wall.  
      He s already got it covered with a stunningly intricate 
        mural.  ARTHUR and YVONNE GUINESS, Anthony s upper middle 
      class parents, rise to meet Elizabeth.

                                        ARTHUR
                      I m sorry.  We can t stop him.  We ll pay 
                    to have it repainted.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I wouldn t dream of it.  It s beautiful.

      She moves straight to Anthony, quickly notes his hair in 
        disarray, his shirt buttoned off kilter.  He wears 
        glasses covered with grime, as if he can t think clearly 
        enough to clean them.  Her face flashes with sympathy as 
      she gently touches his arm.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      You must be Anthony.  I m Dr. Black.

        Anthony sloughs her off.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    If you don t feel like talking,
                      that s okay. I m going to chat
                      with your parents.   

        Elizabeth speaks quietly, compassionately to Arthur and 
        Yvonne.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Tell me what s been going on.                                                                                        12.


                                        ARTHUR
                      Anthony has always been a wonderful son 
                      and an exceptional student.  He was 
                      headed to MIT this fall.

                                        YVONNE
                    To study physics, like his father.

                                        ARTHUR
                    He was never interested in art.

                                        YVONNE
                    He started drawing about three months 
                      ago.  First he drew all over the walls of 
                      his room.  Then his school suspended him 
                      for defacing the hallways.

                                        ARTHUR
                    We tried taking him to the doctor and he 
                      ran away.  He s over eighteen.  We 
                      couldn t make him come home.  

                                        YVONNE
                                (voice breaking)
                    He lived on the streets.

                                        ARTHUR
                      The police finally picked him up tagging 
                      the rear wall of the Museum of Fine Arts.  
                      When he drew all over the glass in the 
                      squad car, they took him to the hospital.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (reading the file)
                      The ER diagnosed schizophrenia.

                                        YVONNE
                      That s wrong. Our son is a scientist, not 
                    an artist.  Something happened to him. 
                      Something changed in his brain.

                                        ELIZABETH
                        Schizophrenia can be like that.  A 
                      perfectly normal childhood.  No warning, 
                      then a sudden onset of psychosis, often 
                    at about Anthony s age.  Did the ER put 
                      him on medication?

                                        ARTHUR
                      They tried.  He won t take the pills.    
                      I ve done all the research.  This 
                        place....the Center for Neurological....                                                                                        13.


                                        ELIZABETH
                        Neurological Research and Treatment. Just 
                      call it The Cube.  We all do.

                                        ARTHUR
                      It s the best.  And you...chief of staff.  
                    If anyone can help....

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (gently)
                        Schizophrenia should be managed by a 
                      medicating psychiatrist.  I m a 
                        neurologist.

                                        YVONNE
                      It s not schizophrenia.  We ve been on 
                      the internet.  There are a hundred other 
                      things that could cause this.  Heavy 
                      metal poisoning. A tumor. A B-12 
                      deficiency-

        Elizabeth is about to interrupt when she notices that 
        Anthony has stopped drawing and is standing as still as a 
        statue, as if he is frozen in time.

                                        ELIZABETH
                              (to Yvonne)
                      Has he done that before?

                                        YVONNE
                      Yes.

        Elizabeth crosses to Anthony, touches his arm.  No 
        reaction at all. He doesn t even pull back. Elizabeth 
      waves a hand in front is his face.  His eyes are 
        sightless, like dark marbles.  

      It only lasts a few seconds and then Anthony focuses 
        again.  He finds Elizabeth close beside him and darts to 
      the corner, crouching in terror.  He covers his ears, 
        rocking and chanting as if to block out all other noise. 
      And Elizabeth, because she s who she is, realizes what s 
      going on.  She remains completely calm, turns to 
        Anthony s parents.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Could you leave us alone for a moment?

        Arthur nods, leads his reluctant wife out.  Elizabeth 
      sits beside Anthony on the floor. She looks at him 
        intently and we hear what he hears.                                                                                        14.


                                        VOICES IN HIS HEAD (V.O.)
                      She s evil.  She s one of them.  She ll 
                      put a transmitter in your brain. 
                      Lobotomize you.  Run!  Get out of here!

        Elizabeth takes his hands from his ears and holds them.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Anthony, don t listen to the voices.  
                      They can t hurt you if you don t let 
                      them.  Listen to me.

        Anthony pauses.  He sees something.  Writing on 
        Elizabeth s arm.  She follows the look and pulls her 
        sleeve up farther.  More writing.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Sometimes, I can t stop.

        Anthony looks into her eyes and finds there the 
        understanding that only comes from shared experience.  
      The voices lower until they are nearly imperceptible.

                                        ANTHONY
                       Some are born to sweet Delight,
                      Some are born to Endless Night.
                    We are led to Believe a Lie... 

      He pauses.  It s a test.

                                        ELIZABETH
                       When we see not Thro' the Eye.   William 
                      Blake was a great poet and also an 
                      artist, like you.  He saw visions and 
                      heard voices.  Once he saw an angel in a 
                      tree.

      Now Anthony knows she s on his side.

                                        ANTHONY
                    No pills.  They make me stupid.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                        I understand.  We won t medicate you 
                      until we know what s going on. Do you 
                      ever have headaches?  Feel dizzy?  Or 
                      like you can t control your movements?

      The voices rise on the track again.

                                        VOICES (V.O.)
                      Don t tell her! It s our secret!  She s 
                      the enemy.  You can t trust her!                                                                                        15.


      This time Anthony doesn t listen.  He focuses on 
        Elizabeth with tears in his eyes.  

                                        ANTHONY
                      Headaches. Yes.  And the other things, 
                      too.


      INT. HALLWAYS - THE CUBE - DAY

        Elizabeth walks with DR. OWEN MORELY, Medical Director of 
      the hospital.  Owen is 55, a Harvard Don right down to 
      his tortoise shell glasses, pinstripes and bow tie.

                                        OWEN
                      Isn t this a waste of your time?
                        Schizophrenia is incurable. Drugs
                      are the only answer.  A medicating
                        psychiatrist-

                                        ELIZABETH
                      That s what I thought, too.  But Anthony 
                      had an absence seizure right in my 
                      office.  His parents may be right.  I ll 
                      start blood work to rule out any 
                      metabolic disturbances, check his renal 
                      function and LFTs.  We ll need an MRI and 
                      a CT to look for lesions, masses or 
                        abnormalities-

      They enter Owen s office which says MEDICAL DIRECTOR.


      INT. OWEN S OFFICE - DAY

      The space is not what you d expect. The walls are covered 
      with posters for ultra violent slasher films. Cabinets 
      hold displays of bizarre 19th century brain memorabilia 
        including terrifyingly primitive surgical tools.  On the 
      desk is a skull impaled through the eye by a sharp metal 
        spike.  Owen waves off her description of her process.

                                        OWEN
                      I won t second guess you. You surpassed 
                      your teacher long ago.  Do whatever you 
                      think best.

        Elizabeth checks up.  They aren t alone.  DR. MARC 
        BICKMAN rises from the sofa.  He s tall, handsome, 
        ripped.  Highly intelligent and intense.  Elizabeth is 
      taken aback by Bickman s physical presence.                                                                                        16.


                                        OWEN (CONT D)
                      Elizabeth, this is Dr. Marc Bickman, our 
                      new Chief of Neurosurgery.

                                        BICKMAN
                      Dr. Black.  I ve wanted to meet
                      you ever since I read your first book, 
                       Identity Theft. 

        Bickman leans in and takes Elizabeth s hand in both of 
      his as she stares into his cool, blue, unblinking eyes.   

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (smooth)
                      Nice to meet you, too.  You also have 
                      quite a reputation.

                                        OWEN
                      Everyone knows  Bick  has magic hands.

        Elizabeth glances down.  Those  magic hands  are still 
        holding onto hers.  She pulls back firmly as Owen turns 
      to Bickman.

                                        OWEN (CONT D)
                      Dr. Lark has some pre-op films ready for 
                      you.

                                        BICKMAN
                      I never keep a lady waiting.

      He exits.  Owen waits till they are alone, then...

                                        OWEN
                      So?  What do you think of our new
                      can opener?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      He s a sexual predator.   

                                        OWEN
                    So I hear. But only with willing 
                      partners.  The nurses at Mass General 
                      couldn t say enough good things about 
                      him.  They called him Dr. Big Man.

        Owen s door slams opens and Lucy, breathless and 
        stressed, appears.  She sees them, flushes.

                                        LUCY
                    So sorry.  Wrong door.  I m looking for 
                    my friend.  He has an appointment with 
                      Dr. Black.                                                                                        17.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      That s me.   


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      They walk several doors down to Elizabeth s office.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      What s your friend s name?

                                        LUCY
                      Yojo.  Yojo Grim.  He s a little person.  
                      Potty as a house plant.  Insisted on 
                      playing hide and seek when we got here 
                      and now he s disappeared.

                                        ELIZABETH
                    He can t have gone far.  Wait in my
                      office.  I ll get the nurses on it.  They 
                      will find him.

      She opens her office door.


      INT. ELIZABETH S OFFICE - DAY

      They enter and Lucy s face splits with a lovely grin.

                                        LUCY
                      You little rascal!  
                                (points)
                      There he is.

      From Lucy s POV we see Yojo behind Elizabeth s desk, 
        spinning in her chair and laughing with delight.

      CU ELIZABETH, puzzled.  

      From HER POV, the room is empty.  

      END ACT ONE                                                                                        18.


                                        ACT TWO




      EXT. CHARTER SCHOOL - ROXBURY - AFTERNOON

        Elizabeth enters the inner city brick building as we 
      hear:

                                        KIDS CHANTING (V.O.)
                      Radius is half across the circle. 
                      Diameter is all.


      INT. WILL S MATH CLASS - DAY

      Will stands in the middle of a group of chanting 8th 
      grade minority students.  He wears a suit and tie, his 
        braids falling neatly down his back.  Each line of the 
      math chant is punctuated by clapping.  The kids all wear 
      black T-shirts that say  MATH IS LIFE .

                                        WILL
                        Circumference is all around the circle.

                                        KIDS
                      The distance  round a ball.

                                        WILL
                      Finding circumference is no big deal. 
                      Give it a try!

                                        KIDS
                      Multiply diameter times 3.14.  Easy as 
                      Pi!

        A BELL RINGS. The kids clap, alive and energized.  

                                        WILL
                      Remember!  Quiz on Monday.  You have my e-
                      mail if you need any help.

      The kids file out revealing Elizabeth waiting out in the 
        hallway.  She smiles.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Want to carry my books home, Mr. Van 
                      Renseller?

      He pulls her inside the classroom, closes the door and 
        kisses her.                                                                                        19.


                                        WILL
                      Absolutely, Dr. Van Renseller.  Or will 
                      you keep your maiden name?

                                        ELIZABETH
                        Will....don t pressure me.

                                        WILL
                      Why?  You know your own mind.  Always 
                      have.  Always will.  I want an answer.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (kissing him, whispers)
                      Okay.  After the game.  Promise.


      EXT. NOBLE MIDDLE SCHOOL - DUSK

        A fancy private school outside Boston.  The scene is as 
        different from the previous one as it could be.  The 
        varsity girl s soccer team is fighting a close game.  
        Well-to-do parents from opposing teams line both sides. 
      The field is lit with kleig lights.  An ironic group of 
      white guys pretend to be cheerleaders, chant:

                                        CHEERLEADERS
                      Mirror, mirror on my locker
                      Pretty girls don't play soccer
                      Lets get ugly!!! Go Team!

      One young Apollo, DARIUS NEGROPONTE, calls to ESME BLACK, 
      15, a raven haired beauty with a strong resemblance to 
        Elizabeth, as she moves the ball down field.

                                        DARIUS
                      B-u-s-t, bust em. That s your custom!  Go 
                      Esme!

      Esme flips Darius a bird and a smile without missing a 
        stride. He laughs.

        A tight lipped, 43-year-old mother putting out half-time 
        refreshment sees it all and frowns.  This is REGAN BLACK, 
        Esme s mother.

        Elizabeth and Will stand near the goal with her brother, 
        JOSHUA BLACK, 40. Joshua is a thin, bearded, slightly 
        scruffy guy who looks out of place in a sea of yuppies. 
      He s sneaking a cigarette.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Don t let Regan catch you.                                                                                        20.


                                        JOSHUA
                      She s too busy being the food Nazi Mom. 
                      Wait till the team gets a load of her 
                      gluten-free arugula sandwiches.

        Elizabeth grimaces, then puts her fingers in her mouth 
      and whistles encouragement as Esme passes.  Will shouts.

                                        WILL
                      Take it home, Esme!

      Esme, hearing Will, shoots him a grin and goes into hyper 
        drive.  She takes off, dark hair flying, long legs eating 
      up the field, drills the ball around several defenders 
      and slams home a goal.  Will, Elizabeth and Joshua go 
      nuts.  

      The team leaps into high fives, then jog towards 
        refreshments.  Esme and one of her friends, a muscled, 
        Viking girl, JOHANNA, arrive first.

                                        JOHANNA
                      I m starving.  Haven t eaten since I 
                      barfed up my lunch.

      Esme grabs Fuji water.  Johanna takes a bite of sandwich 
      and spits it out.

                                        JOHANNA (CONT D)
                      What the hell?  Tastes like cow dung on 
                      cardboard!

      CASH, a feisty redhead, calls out.

                                        CASH
                      Heads up. Esme s mom made snacks!

      The team groans, turns away from the trays of food.  They 
        wander off to greet their parents.  Esme spins on Regan.

                                        ESME
                      I told you they want soda and chips!  Are 
                      you trying to embarrass me?

                                        REGAN
                    Me embarrass you?  I saw you use an
                      obscene gesture right in front of
                      the dean of students!

                                        ESME
                         Congratulations Esme! I m so proud of 
                      you.  You scored the winning goal!                                                                                         21.


      Esme tosses down the water bottle, huffs off as Joshua 
        approaches.  Regan turns on him.

                                        REGAN
                      How can you let her talk to me that way?  
                                (without missing a beat)
                      You ve been smoking.

        Meanwhile, Elizabeth finds Esme, circles her waist, lifts 
      her off the ground.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You were awesome!  You totally brought 
                      it.

                                        ESME
                      Help me, Auntie Liz.  Mom is psycho.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      No.  She s a great mom who is just doing 
                      her job.

      Will has the soccer ball and starts goofing with it.

                                        WILL
                      Esme!  Over here.

      Esme joins him and they pass it back and forth.  Joshua 
        crosses to Elizabeth.

                                        JOSHUA
                      Marry that guy.  He s the best.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Funny you should bring up the m word.  
                      Will proposed.

                                        JOSHUA
                      What?  This is huge.  Congratulations!

      He hugs her.  She pushes away gently.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Chill.  I m going to say no.

                                        JOSHUA
                      What?!  Why?   

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Because, Joshua, he s clueless about me. 
                    He thinks I m normal.                                                                                        22.


                                        JOSHUA
                                (incredulous)
                      Why haven t you told him?  Liz!  It s 
                      been a year!  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I don t want to lose him.

                                         JOSHUA
                    He can handle it.   
                                (after a moment)
                      All men aren t like Esme s dad.

        Elizabeth reacts, glances around to make sure no one 
        heard, says firmly.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You re Esme s dad.

                                        JOSHUA
                                (cocks an eyebrow)
                      Not going to tell him that, either?

      Esme comes running back and they fall silent.

                                        ESME
                      Come home with us for dinner, Auntie Liz? 
                      Pretty please?

                                        REGAN
                                (approaching)
                      Not on a school night.

      The tension between Regan and Elizabeth is apparent and 
        Elizabeth is not the one generating it.  As always, she 
        avoids throwing kerosene on the fire.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Your mom s right.  Great game, kiddo.

        Elizabeth hugs Esme briefly, then smiles a full, generous 
      smile at Regan as Will approaches.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Couldn t come anyway, I ve got a hot 
                      date.


      INT. WILL S CAR - NIGHT

      Will and Elizabeth drive off and she snuggles against 
      him.                                                                                        23.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      Where are we going?

                                        WILL
                      You tell me.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Somehow I don t think you want to hear 
                       Sushi sounds good.   

                                        WILL
                                (quieter)
                      Why the drama?  The suspense?  Is there 
                      some problem?  I love you.  You love me.

      She looks out at the passing neon lights.  It s time.  
      And so, characteristically, without drama, she speaks 
        simply.

                                         ELIZABETH
                      There s something you don t know about 
                      me.  If you knew, we wouldn t be having 
                      this conversation. 

      He looks over.

                                        WILL
                      Serious.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Very.

                                        WILL
                      Drop the dime.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I m bipolar.

        There s a moment of silence.

                                        WILL
                      I thought you said-

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I am.  Bipolar.  It s a form of mental 
                      illness.  Sometimes called manic 
                      depression.

      He pulls the car over. Turns to her.

                                        WILL
                      I know what it is.  You couldn t have 
                      hidden something like that.                                                                                         24.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      I could and I did.

      Cold silence.  Will is pissed.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      I m sorry.

                                        WILL
                      You re sorry?!

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I should have told you. Obviously.

                                        WILL
                    By the third date!  Why didn t you?  What 
                    do you think I am?  A monster?  My sister 
                      has diabetes.  Do I love her less?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      A physical illness.

                                        WILL
                      Mental illness is a physical illness. 
                      Just because the organ involved is the 
                      brain-

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Very PC of you. I ve used the line 
                      myself.  But diabetes isn t who your 
                      sister is.  I am bipolar.  With mental 
                      illness, it s not something you can cut 
                      out or cure.  It s hard wired in the 
                      brain.  Part of my identity, my 
                        personality.

                                        WILL
                      But it s treatable, just like diabetes.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Yes.  Bipolar is the most treatable form 
                    of mental illness.  When I take the 
                      medication, I m fine.

                                        WILL
                      Then we can deal with it. You have
                      been dealing with it, obviously, so-

                                        ELIZABETH
                      No.  Actually I have a history of non-
                      compliance.  A tendency to go off the 
                        reservation.  Way off the reservation.                                                                                            25.


                                        WILL
                      Not since we ve been together.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Yes.  In fact, it happened last week.

                                        WILL
                                (shocked)
                    In San Francisco?  And you didn t tell 
                      me?

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (mild)
                    Of course not.  I wasn t ever going to 
                      tell you.  Because I wanted to keep you.  

                                        WILL
                      Keep me?  I m not a pet.

        Elizabeth s phone beeps, interrupting.  She looks down, 
      has a text.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I have to go to the hospital.  It s an 
                      emergency. 

      He starts the car again, makes a U-turn, his jaw set.  

                                        WILL
                      Why in God s name would you ever  go off 
                      the reservation?  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Because it s an incredible high.  When 
                      I m ramping up, I do my best work.  Life 
                    is never more beautiful.  The sex is 
                      great.  I feel as if I could conquer the 
                      world and then after a while, sometimes, 
                      I do very bad things.  

        Elizabeth isn t prone to be apologetic or to feel guilty. 
      So now she s defensive.

                                        WILL
                      Like what?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I am not going to tell you.  But I will 
                      say this.  If you knew, you d never want 
                    to see me again.

        That s the hard truth.  It shocks him into silence.  He 
      wants to push for more information, and yet some part of 
      him is afraid to do ask.                                                                                          26.


                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      The hospital.

      He lost focus, was about to pass the entrance.  He turns 
      hard, pulls in.


      EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

        Elizabeth gets out of Will s car.  He gets out, too, but 
      keeps a distance between them.  She turns to him, her 
      eyes clear.  Her voice quiet.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      This is the end.  I understand that.  And 
                    it should be.  Find someone nice, 
                      darling.  Someone normal.  I love you too 
                      much to do this to you.   

      She walks off.  He watches.  And he doesn t follow.  He 
      gets back in the car, drives off.

      CLOSE ON ELIZABETH.....She turns and watches him drive 
      away.   

      Then the entire street MORPHS into a different place. A 
        different hospital.  And Elizabeth is suddenly 18 and 
        pregnant, standing outside the ER door.  She screams at 
        another car as it pulls away.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      No, Johnny!  Come back.  Don t leave me!  

      The car disappears into the night.  She s left sobbing, 
        alone.  She doubles over with labor pains.    

      BACK TO....

        Elizabeth present day. Composed.  No longer capable of 
      that kind of meltdown.  She squares her shoulders and 
      walks inside, taking refuge where she always takes 
        refuge.  With her patients.  Her medical life.


      INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS - NIGHT

        Elizabeth moves down the quiet halls, her heels echoing 
      in the silence.  There s no one at the nurse s station. 
        That s not good.  

        Something crashes behind a door up ahead.  She breaks 
      into a jog and then....there s a noise between a scream 
      and a growl.  Elizabeth starts to run.                                                                                        27.


      INT. ANTHONY S ROOM - NIGHT

        A very pretty nurse, CARLOTTA, gives Anthony an injection 
      as a SECURITY GUARD tries to put him in restraints. His 
      mouth is bleeding.  Two walls of his room are covered 
      with blood.  The slender kid is lashing out with 
        astonishing force making animal noises as Elizabeth 
        bursts in.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      What happened?

                                        CARLOTTA
                    He wouldn t stop drawing. I had to take 
                      away his pens.  So he bit his lip and 
                      started using his own blood to paint the 
                      walls.  I just gave him 50 milligrams 
                      Haldol IM.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Let him go.

        Carlotta and the guard release Anthony who backs into a 
        corner, panting.  He is whispering constantly, a stream 
      of nonsense words.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Leave me alone with him.  Go!

        Carlotta and the guard exit and Elizabeth moves closer to 
        Anthony.  There s something about the connection she 
      makes with her patients when they get in her tractor 
      beam.  We MOVE RAPIDLY in on Anthony s terrified face as 
      we...

      FLIP THE WORLD and now see the scene from his POV. 
        Looking through his fractured mind, we see the wall 
        behind Elizabeth, the only one Anthony hasn t marked, is 
      on fire.

      The voices rise on the track.  We told you not to trust 
      her! You will burn in hell consumed by the purifying 
      fire.  The minions of the damned will swallow you. 

                                        ANTHONY
                      You promised no meds!

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You hurt yourself, Anthony.  That s a 
                      game changer.

      She sees he s not looking at her, but behind her, fear in 
      his eyes.                                                                                        28.


                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      What s wrong? What do you see?

                                        ANTHONY
                      Fire.

        Elizabeth follows his look, rises and walks to the wall, 
        touches it with her bare hand.  From Anthony s POV, she 
      is engulfed in the flames and yet not consumed.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      There is no fire.  Come see for yourself.

        Anthony rises and approaches slowly, breathing fast, 
        shaking with fear.  As he gets closer, the flames get 
      lower and lower.  By the time he reaches Elizabeth, her 
        demeanor and the Haldol are having an effect.  He s 
        standing by a cool white wall.  We see him visibly relax.  
        Elizabeth leads him back to bed.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      The shot they gave you will make you 
                      sleep.  But I m going to have to order 
                      some other pills to clear your mind, 
                      okay?  You can still draw as much as you 
                      like, I promise.  Right now, I want you 
                    to rest.

      He lies back and the drug overcomes him.  His eyes close.

      INT. DR. INA LARK S OFFICE - NIGHT

        A tiny, bird-like woman with hair that sticks up in 
        strange dark tufts is playing Guitar Hero alone.  DR. INA 
      LARK is an androgynous teenager trapped in the body of a 
      28 year-old radiologic prodigy.  Her IQ is north of 200. 
      Her EQ, not so much.  Elizabeth enters.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Can t believe my luck.  You re here.

                                        INA
                      I m always here.


      INT. RADIOLOGY LAB - NIGHT

        Elizabeth stands with Ina as she switches on a light box 
      to display rows of images.

                                        INA
                      I m afraid I have bad news.  Anthony has 
                      a brain tumor.                                                                                        29.


        Elizabeth stares at the CT, lets out a whoop of joy.

                                        INA (CONT D) 
                      And I thought I was weird.  Since when is 
                      a mass in the head good? 

                                        ELIZABETH
                      It s in the temporo-limbic area!  It 
                      could explain all of his symptoms.  The 
                        compulsions.  Paranoia.  Hallucinations.
                    We thought he was schizo.  This is
                      fixable!   

                                        INA
                      You want to show these to our shiny new 
                      cutter, Dr. Bickman?  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      He s here?

                                        INA
                    He just got out of the OR.  Some kind of 
                      marathon, super cool ten hour 
                        neurosurgery, never performed here 
                      before.


      INT. SCRUB ROOM BY OR - NIGHT

        Anthony s films go up on the light box.  Bickman is still 
      in bloody scrubs.  He glances for a nanosecond at the 
      films and turns to Elizabeth.

                                        BICKMAN
                      I ll get it out.  No problem.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Could you please take a closer look?  I m 
                      worried the mass is in a delicate
                      spot.  Removing it could cause serious 
                        complications-

                                        BICKMAN
                      Not with me on deck.  I have incredible 
                      stats.  If I say no problem, there will 
                    be no problem.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (irritated)
                      But you barely checked the films.  This 
                    is a lovely, dear kid with his life on 
                      the line.  I don t want him to end up 
                      blind or paralyzed or God forbid, 
                      mentally impaired.                                                                                        30.


        Bickman glances over at her, mildly amused.  He takes her 
      by the arms, leans in as if he s going to kiss her and 
        whispers softly in her ear.

                                        BICKMAN
                    Do you always get so worked up in defense 
                    of your patients?  It s cute.  But take 
                    my advice.  Detach.  Emotions get in the 
                      way.  Of everything.  I told you, I ll 
                      fix it.  And I will.  

      He smiles at her, releases her as she flushes.  He goes 
      off whistling, leaving her pissed.


      INT. HALLWAY THE CUBE - NIGHT

        Elizabeth walks alone down the hall.  She reaches the 
      door.  Looks out and sees the taxi she called is waiting.  

                                        WILL (o.s.)
                      Liz.

      She turns.  Will rises from a waiting area.  He came 
      back.  Elizabeth is moved beyond anything she can 
        express.  In moments they are in each other s arms.

                                         WILL (CONT D)
                      I love you.  I don t want to lose you.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I don t want to lose you either.  

                                        WILL
                      There s a simple solution.  Stay on the 
                      meds.

      She nods, drops her head on his chest.  

      END ACT TWO                                                                                        31.


                                        ACT THREE


      INT. CHINA PEARL RESTAURANT - DAY

      Close on the engagement ring on Elizabeth s finger. 
        Another hand enters frame wearing one of those huge pink 
      rock candy rings favored by little girls. 

      Wider we see Esme and Elizabeth at lunch. Esme lifts her 
      candy ring and licks it.

                                        ESME
                      Mine is bigger, and it s delicious.

        Elizabeth laughs.

                                        ESME (CONT D)
                      Seriously.  This is cool.  Will is 
                      totally a ten.  Officially Esme endorsed.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Your Dad s happy about it, too.

                                        ESME
                      You know what Mom said when she heard? 
                       They aren t going to have children, are 
                      they? 

      That stung, but Elizabeth recovers and hides it with a 
        smile.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Yeah, well as usual, your mom is correct. 
                      Kids would be problematic.  Bipolar is 
                      heritable.  The most hereditary form of 
                      mental illness.

                                        ESME
                      But it s not a hundred percent.  Dad s 
                      fine.  And anyway, you re great.   

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I m lucky.  The meds work for me.  Your 
                      grandmother never found anything that 
                      gave her relief.  She suffered terribly.    

                                        ESME
                      Dad never talks about her.  I know she 
                      committed suicide. 
                                (beat, carefully)
                      Hold old were you when....                                                                                        32.


                                        ELIZABETH 
                      Fifteen.  Your Dad was seventeen.  

                                        ESME
                      Must have been awful.  
                              (more silence, then)
                      What was she like?

                                        ELIZABETH  
                      She could be wonderful.  Magnetic, 
                      charming, hilarious.  And brilliant.  She 
                      was always the smartest person in the 
                      room.  Part of me was in awe of her.  But 
                      part of me hated her.  She could be so 
                      cruel, too.  Irritable.  Prone to 
                      violent, drunken rages.  For months at a 
                      time, she d be so depressed she couldn t 
                      get out of bed.    

      Esme is moved, takes her hand.

                                        ESME
                      She drowned, right? 

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (nods)
                    It was Mother s Day.  Did you know that 
                      more women commit suicide on Mother s Day 
                      than any other day?

      Esme shakes her head.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      She was in a rage.  She told us that 
                      having children ruined her life.  We were 
                      ungrateful bastards who d driven our 
                      father away.  She warned us she didn t 
                      want to live any more.  But we didn t 
                      believe her.  We d heard it all a million 
                      times.  Then she took the car and drove 
                      away.  We learned later that she headed 
                      straight to the beach.  She lined the 
                      pockets of her mink coat with rocks and 
                      walked into the ocean.

      Esme sits in shocked silence.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      She was forty-three.  All my life I ve 
                      fought to be nothing like her.  She was a 
                      housewife.  So I work full time.  She 
                      married.  So I never have.                                                                                           33.


                                        ESME
                      You can get married and not be like
                      her.

                                        ELIZABETH
                              (as if convincing herself)
                      Let s hope.

        Elizabeth sits quietly, recovering from going over 
        territory she tries to never visit.

                                        ESME
                      Let s talk about something else.  The 
                      wedding.  Hey, let s go look at wedding 
                      dresses.  It will be a great bonding op 
                      and a major hoot.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Can t today.  I have to get back to work.  
                      But I do want to find a  dress for you.  
                      You want to be my maid of honor?

                                        ESME
                      Hella yes.


      INT. RADIOLOGY LAB - DAY

        Elizabeth is in with Dr. Ina Lark again. They have new 
        films.

                                        INA
                      Lucy Dacy.  Your LOL.  Went into the PET 
                      accompanied by Santa s helper, who 
                      curiously didn t show up on film.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (checking the films)
                      Her confusion and postural instability 
                      would fit with Alzheimer's or 
                        Parkinson s.  But it looks like the 
                      amyloid burden is higher than you see in 
                      either of them.

                                        INA
                      And, hello, she s hallucinating dwarfs.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (pained)
                      Lewey Body Dementia.                                                                                        34.


                                        INA
                      Yeah.  One year, maybe two, she ll be an 
                      eggplant in diapers.  Incurable.  Case 
                      closed.  Nothing you can do.


      INT. OUTSIDE LUCY S ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

      Lucy is sitting with Yojo.  They are watching  Elf  on 
      TV.  Elizabeth looks in with the male nurse, JORGE.

      From their POV, Lucy is talking to an empty room, 
        perfectly content and well taken care of.   It s the 
        opposite of a grim scene.  But Elizabeth can only see 
        Lucy s death sentence.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Start her on Rivistigmine for the
                      hallucinations.  At least we can get rid 
                    of Santa s elf.  Is there a relative 
                      listed on her intake forms?  She s going 
                    to need family.  Someone to look after 
                      her.

                                        JORGE
                      There s a sister in Chicago.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Let s track her down.  How s Anthony 
                      doing on Aripiprazole and Thorazine?

                                        JORGE
                      Much clearer.  Calmer.  He s with his 
                      parents.  They re waiting for you.


      INT. ANTHONY S ROOM - DAY

        Elizabeth sits with Anthony, Art and Yvonee.  Anthony is 
      now medicated and his affect is flat and subdued.  All 
      his fire and compulsions have been suppressed.  His art 
        supplies lie untouched on the table beside him.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Ironically, the brain tumor is great 
                      news.  Our neurosurgeon, Dr. Bickman, is 
                      sure it s operable.  Once it s out, we 
                      could have a total cure.

                                        YVONNE
                      Anthony, did you hear that, darling?

        Anthony looks up. He speaks with some difficulty, his 
      words slurred, his limbs stiff from the meds.                                                                                        35.


                                        ANTHONY
                      Will I still be able to draw? 

        Elizabeth pauses. She hears something like agony in his

        voice, and it s an agony she knows and shares.  He fears 
      what he may lose.

                                        ELIZABETH
                    Of course you will be able to draw.  But 
                      you may not want to.  The compulsion may 
                      disappear.

        Anthony looks torn.  

                                        ANTHONY
                      And if I don t have the surgery?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      The tumor will grow and the headaches, 
                      the pain you feel right now, will become 
                    so intense that no pain killer can touch 
                      it.  You will die in agony.  
                                (soft)
                      There is no choice here.

      Hold on Elizabeth, fully aware she just made similar 
        arguments to the ones Hartramph used on her.


      INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - DAY

        Elizabeth comes out of Anthony s room, sees Jorge.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Anthony and his family are ready to
                      meet with Dr. Bickman.

      Jorge goes to find Bickman.  Elizabeth heads to the 
        nurse s station to write an order.  A light comes on 
        indicating someone in room 307 needs help.  Elizabeth 
      looks around. No nurse in sight. She walks down to 307.


      INT. ROOM 307 - DAY

        Elizabeth enters and stops cold.  Sounds of sex come from 
        behind a room divider.  Elizabeth leans in, catches a 
        glimpse of Dr. Bickman banging Carlotta up against the 
      wall.  Her butt must be pressing against the switch 
        requesting help.

        Carlotta is moaning, eyes closed, oblivious and in 
        ecstasy.  Shocked, Elizabeth backs out.                                                                                        36.


      INT. HALLWAY - THE CUBE - DAY

        Elizabeth stands still, reacting, stunned, and despite 
        herself, massively turned on.


      EXT. SUBURBS - DAY

        Elizabeth gets out of her car, crosses to Will who waits 
      with a realtor, JODY FINE. They are standing in front of 
        a lovely family home with a two car garage and a white 
        picket fence. Elizabeth slows as she approaches. We see 
        something like fear in her face.  Will turns and she 
        forces a smile.

                                        WILL
                      What do you think?

                                        ELIZABETH
                    It has a white picket fence.

                                        WILL
                      Keep breathing. And keep an open mind.

                                        JODY
                      Hi, I m Jody Fine. I just started working 
                      with Will and this place popped up on the 
                      market. I really think you re going to 
                      love it.  Wait till you see the inside. 
                      And, here s the best part, there s a 
                      playground in walking distance and the 
                      school district is first rate.
                                (bright smile)
                      You couldn t find a better neighborhood 
                      for starting a family.

        Elizabeth shoots Will a panicked look, whispers.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I told you I don t want kids.

                                        WILL
                      Someday you may change your mind.


      EXT. BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON

        Elizabeth is parked looking out at the ocean. It s cold 
      and foggy. Quiet. Peaceful. This is a place she often 
      comes to think.  She looks down at the engagement ring on 
      her hand, seems troubled.  Tries to slip it off.  Can t. 
      It s too tight on her finger.                                                                                         37.


      She looks up. There s a woman walking on the beach. She 
      is wearing some kind of fur coat.  What the hell? 
        Elizabeth blinks and the vision is gone.  Is there really 
        someone there or were her eyes deceiving her?  

      She tries to open the car door.  It s locked.  She can t 
      get out. She struggles, slams her fist against the 
        window, getting increasingly panicked.    

      Then she stops.  She tries to breathe evenly, control her 
        anger. It works. She hits the right switch.  Gets out 
      with no problem.

      No sign of a woman in a fur coat. Elizabeth slips off her 
        shoes, walks towards the water.

      But then she SINKS up to her knees as if in quicksand! 
      She fights back and finally pulls her leg out.  Confused, 
      she backs away, then hears:

                                        O.S. WOMAN
                      Help!

        Elizabeth turns. There is a dark head just visible above 
      the waves!  Someone is in the water!  As Elizabeth 
        watches, the person goes under.  Elizabeth looks around. 
        There s no one else on the beach.

        A hand comes up, thrashes, and disappears again.  
        Elizabeth doesn t hesitate.  She runs to the water and 
      dives in, swims out, then down.

        Underwater.  Elizabeth goes deeper, deeper.  Finally she 
      sees streaming dark hair.  It s the woman in the coat, 
        sinking fast.  Elizabeth reaches out.  Gets closer. 
        Reaches out more.  Grabs the edge of the coat.  The 
        weight begins to pull her down, too!

      She kicks frantically, unwilling to drown to save this 
        person. She lets go of the coat and the drowning woman 
        reaches up and grabs her!  They ll die together.  The 
      woman is pulling her down.  She can t get away.

        Elizabeth opens her mouth to scream but nothing comes out 
        underwater.  At the same time she sees the woman who has 
      her in a death grip. It s her own face looking back at 
      her.

      INT. ELIZABETH S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Elizabeth sits bolt upright, pouring sweat. Will stirs 
        beside her, sits up too, concerned. It s 2 a.m.                                                                                        38.


                                        WILL
                      Baby?  You okay?  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Nightmare.

      He takes her in his arms.  After a moment they start to 
      kiss.  He s tender, gentle.  Most women would think it s 
        great.  But Elizabeth pushes him away.

                                        WILL
                      What s wrong?

                                        ElIZABETH
                      Nothing.  Just....nothing.  Go back to 
                      bed.  I ll be all right.

      She gets out of bed, slips on a robe and goes into the 
        bathroom.


      INT. ELIZABETH S BATHROOM - DAY

        Elizabeth closes the door.  Leans against it.  

      FLASH CUT...of Bickman and the nurse, up against the wall 
        having rough, nasty sex.  

        Elizabeth s eyes open.  She looks at her own face in the 
        mirror.  Steady.  A decision is made. She opens the 
        medicine cabinet, gets out her pills and opens the 
        bottles. Dumps the contents in the toilet and flushes.

      END ACT THREE                                                                                        39.


                                        ACT FOUR


      INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

      The door opens and Elizabeth enters followed by five 
        medical students.  Instantly we realize we re in an Alice 
      In Wonderland World.  Everything is completely askew.  
      The corners of the room go off at bizarre angles.  The 
        doorway is tiny and the students Lilliputian in size. 
        Elizabeth is gigantic.  She looks up into camera.

                                        ELIZABETH
                              (to the students, voice 
                                echoing)
                      This is Orson Peters.
                              (to Orson)
                      How are you feeling today?

                                        ORSON (O.S.)
                      Very Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

      The whole frame shakes as Orson chuckles. We are seeing 
        through his eyes. He holds out a hand, into frame, and 
      it s GIGANTIC.  Twice as big as Elizabeth who has 
        suddenly shrunk along with everyone else in response to 
      the fact the ceiling is descending. We now FLIP the scene 
      and see it as it appears in reality.

      ORSON PETERS, 35, is doubled over trying to keep below 
      the ceiling and maintain his balance in a room that keeps 
        moving. He is a long-haired guy, tattooed, very fit, a 
        surfer.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Mr. Peters has Alice in Wonderland
                      Syndrome, or AIWS, a neurological
                      condition which affects human perception. 
                      It s often associated with migraines. 
                      Sufferers may experience micropsia, 
                      macropsia and size distortion of other 
                      sensory modalities.

                                        STUDENT ONE
                      What s the prognosis?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      There is no treatment as yet for AIWS. 
                      The anti-migraine medication works for 
                      his pain but has only a minor effect on 
                      Mr. Peters  sensory symptoms.  Luckily, 
                      they only last for an hour or two.  Then 
                      he s back to normal.  Questions?                                                                                        40.


                                        STUDENT TWO
                              (to Orson)
                      What does it feel like?

                                        ORSON
                      Like LSD, without the brain damage. If I 
                      roll with it, it s totally cool.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Orson s case is a good illustration of 
                      how altered states of perception can be 
                      arbitrarily labeled  bad  when in fact, 
                      the patient isn t suffering.
                                (looks at her watch)
                      You re all due in the fourth floor OR to 
                      observe surgery on Anthony Guiness.  It s 
                      about to start.

      Jorge enters.

                                        JORGE
                      Dr. Black? Do you have a minute?  We re 
                      having a problem with Lucy Dacy.


      INT. THE CUBE - HALLWAYS - DAY

        Elizabeth comes out of the stairwell, returning to her 
        floor.  She seems energized and very up as she finds Lucy 
        wandering in a hospital gown.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Hey, Lucy. What are you doing here? You 
                      should be in your hospital room.

                                        LUCY
                      Just walking around.....exercise.

      Her voice trails off.  Her eyes search the halls.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Are you looking for someone?

                                        LUCY
                    My sister. I want to see my sister, 
                      Louise.  She ll take me home.  Why am I 
                      here?  I want to go home.

                                        ELIZABETH
                        I understand. I m trying to make that 
                      happen, okay?

        Elizabeth crosses to Jorge.                                                                                        41.


                                        JORGE
                      The Rivistigmine is working perfectly. 
                      She hasn t mentioned her little imaginary 
                      buddy once today.  She s not 
                        hallucinating any more.

                                        ELIZABETH
                    We have to find a place for her to go.  
                      What about the sister?

                                        JORGE
                    No help there.   We found her, she s in a 
                      nursing home.  Also has dementia, but 
                      more advanced.  Lucy is all alone in the 
                      world.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (heartbroken)
                      Okay.  Call social services.

      They look back and Lucy is now crying as she continues 
        wandering around. Elizabeth goes to her, puts her arm 
        around her.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Talk to me, honey. I can help. You re 
                      shaking. What are you afraid of?

                                        LUCY
                      I don t know.

      She starts to sob and Elizabeth sits her down, rocks her 
      and comforts her.  Gradually Lucy quiets, looks into 
        Elizabeth s eyes.  Chokes back another sob.  And 
        Elizabeth gets it in a flash.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You re lonely, aren t you?  You miss your 
                      friend.

                                        LUCY
                                (relieved)
                      Yes.  Where is Yojo?  Please, can t I see 
                      him?  I don t want to live without him.

        Elizabeth reacts, goes back to Jorge.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Stop the Rivistigmine immediately.

                                        JORGE
                      Why?                                                                                        42.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      How did taking away her hallucinations 
                      change her outcome?

                                        JORGE
                    It didn t, but she normalized.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (increasingly passionate)
                      Why does everyone assume that s a good 
                      thing?  When Lucy was  mad  she was 
                      happy.  Now she s miserable.  Her brain 
                      created exactly what she needed: a little 
                      person with his own harmless delusions. 
                      And like an idiot, I  fixed  her by 
                      taking away her only friend.

        Elizabeth walks off leaving Jorge unsettled by the 
        outburst.


      INT. OR. - DAY

      Owen and the students sit in stadium seating watching as 
        Anthony is brought in.  There are giant monitors and 
        amazing high tech equipment. Everyone whispers excitedly.


      INT. HALLWAYS HOSPITAL - DAY

        Elizabeth reaches the elevator, hits a button. She s too 
        impatient and edgy to wait.  She opens the stairwell 
      door, enters.  A sign indicates the OR is a floor up.  
      She ascends, and as she does, begins DANCING ON THE 
        STAIRS like someone in a Fred Astaire film.  

      She stops, laughs and pauses.  Hears someone below her 
      enter the stairwell.  The person below is moving 
        furtively. Elizabeth looks down.  It s Dr. Bickman.


      INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT - DAY

        Elizabeth comes out of the stairwell, sees Bickman at the 
      end of the hall. She pulls back and watches as he looks 
        either way, gets out a key and opens a locked door marked 
        PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLIES.


      INT. PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLIES - DAY

      The room is lined with pill boxes, syringes etc. Bickman                                                                                        43.


        searches until he finds something. He grabs a medication 
      and turns to go just as the door opens and Elizabeth 
        appears.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      What are you doing in here?

                                        BICKMAN
                      None of your business.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You re supposed to be scrubbing in.

      He tries to push past and she blocks him, reaches for his 
      hand which holds the pills.  He pushes her off hard.  She 
      looks into his eyes which now seem frighteningly cruel.

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    If you re high, you re not operating on 
                    my patient.

                                        BICKMAN
                      Don t ever presume to tell me what to do.

      He starts to push past again.  They struggle briefly.  
      She feels something, looks down at his crotch.  Can t 
        believe it.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You re turned on!  You re disgusting. You 
                        pathological creep!

                                        BICKMAN
                      You dominating bitch.

        Unexpectedly, he takes her hand and kisses it sensually. 
      She starts breathing hard.  He smiles.  He has her.  One 
      more beat and they start tearing their clothes off.


      INT. OR - DAY

        Anthony is on the table, his head in a metal brace, one 
      area now being shaved and prepped.  The atmosphere is 
      sober and professional.   


      INT. PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLIES - DAY

        Bickman puts Elizabeth on a counter, is about to enter 
      her.  Now they re both on fire.  But then suddenly 
        Elizabeth has one of her flash visions and it s Will, not 
        Bickman, in front of her, ready for sex.  She realizes 
      what she s doing and pulls up.                                                                                         44.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      Wait!  I m engaged.

      She pushes Bickman away.  He starts to laugh.

                                        BICKMAN
                      What has that got to do with anything?   

                                        ELIZABETH
                      What are the pills?

                                        Bickman
                      Provigil.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Oh. Cool.  All the surgeons take those.  
                    No big deal.

                                        BICKMAN
                      Fighter pilots too.  They re great. You 
                      ever try them?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Shut up.

      They tear at each other again.   


      INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

      Art and Yvonne Guiness hold hands and wait. 


      INT. SCRUB ROOM - DAY

      The nurses are waiting.  Everyone looks at the clock.  
        Finally Bickman enters, starts to get ready.  Totally 
        professional.  


      INt. HALLWAYS - DAY

        Elizabeth heads out.  Starts to run.  Jorge sees her.

                                        JORGE
                      Dr. Black? 

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (calls)
                      I m leaving.  Cancel my appointments.  

      She s gone.                                                                                        45.


      EXT. THE CUBE - DAY

        Elizabeth pulls out in her Audi.  Going fast.


      INT. ELIZABETH s CONDO - NIGHT

      Music is blaring.  Elizabeth comes out of the bathroom, 
        bottle of Scotch in hand.  Five inch heels.  Skin tight 
        skirt.  Low cut blouse.  Hair wild.  Her mouth is a red 
      slash of lipstick.  She takes a long pull on the Scotch.  
      Ready to roll.  


      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        Elizabeth s car passes everything in sight.


      INT. ELIZABETH S CAR - NIGHT

        Elizabeth s foot presses the accelerator to the floor.  
      The wind whips at her hair.  She may be sky high, but she 
      knows exactly what she s doing.


      EXT. WILL S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

        Historic brick buildings overlooking a river.  Tasteful.  
        Elizabeth s car roars up, jumps the curb and parks with 
      one tire off the street.     


      INT. WILL s APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Will opens the door in his chinos and button down shirt 
      to see Elizabeth holding the bottle of Scotch, now nearly 
        empty, her clothes askew, her hair wild.    

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Hey baby.  Party time!

      She pushes him inside and slams the door behind her.


      INT. WILL S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      With one rapid move, Elizabeth tears the shirt off Will s 
      back.  

                                        WILL
                      Elizabeth!  What are you-                                                                                        46.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      God, you re gorgeous.

                                        WILL
                      Stop.  You re not yourself.

                                        ELIZABETH
                    Oh yes I am. 

      She starts mauling him, pulling his skin.  The kissing 
      turns to biting.  

                                        WILL
                      Stop it.  That hurts!

      She keeps going and they struggle.  In moments they re on 
      the floor.  Not clear whether it s foreplay or fighting.  
        A little of both.  He wants to stop it, but on some 
        level, he s getting turned on.  She gets on top and 
        suddenly she SLAPS him hard.  Will grabs her hand, 
        appalled.  She dives down on him, kissing and biting.  

                                        WILL (CONT D)
                      No, Elizabeth, no!  

      He flips her and gets on top, pinning her arms.  

                                        WILL (CONT D)
                      I don t want to hurt you.  You have to 
                      stop.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Hurt me, yes hurt me.

      He releases her, pulls back, actually looks scared,.  She 
        crawls towards him on hands and knees.  

                                        ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                      Meow.

      She backs him into a chair.  

                                        WILL
                    My God.  What are you doing?! 

      She grabs him.  We see her nails dig into his skin. 


      INT. WILL S BEDROOM - LATER

      Will is on the four poster bed, his wrists tied with his 
      own silk ties, a sheet discretely covering his lower 
      half.   He looks spent and in shock.  The room is a 
        complete mess.                                                                                          47.


        Elizabeth comes out of the bathroom wearing a pair of 
        Will s sweats.  She pulls off the engagement ring, puts 
      it on the table by the bed.

                                        WILL
                      Where are you going?  Hey.   

      She s gone.


      EXT. BRIDGE  - NIGHT 

      Under a full moon.  Elizabeth runs.  And runs.  And runs.


      EXT. CITY SQUARE - NIGHT

      Still going, covered with sweat, she enters a subway 
        station.


      INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

        Elizabeth gets in the car, swings around the pole several 
        times, starts laughing.  There are only a few other 
        passengers.  They stare.  Suddenly she becomes aware of 
        music.  It s  Blackbird .  She stops.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I hear music.  None of you hear it.  Only 
                      I can.  Because I am  incredibly special 
                    to God and you poor jerks are nobodies.

        A teenager looks up.

                                        TEENAGER
                      It s your cell, douche bag. 

      He s right.  Elizabeth pulls out her phone, flips it 
      open.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Starship Enterprise.


      INT. ESME S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      The typical room of a clean-cut teen girl.  Soccer 
        posters.  The most current music.  Esme is on her cell 
        phone.

                                        ESME
                      Auntie Liz?  It s me.                                                                                        48.


      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        Elizabeth grins. 

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Awesome, baby.  I want to see you.  I 
                      have this incredible idea.  I want to buy 
                      you a parrot.  Would you like a parrot?  
                    Or maybe a puppy?  Or does your uptight 
                      mom say no pets, like she says no to 
                      everything else?
                                (singing)
                      How much is that puppy in the window?


      INT. ESME S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Esme puts her hand over the phone.  Curiously, she is not 
        surprised.  She goes to her door and calls.

                                        ESME
                      Dad!


      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        Joshua struggles with Elizabeth, trying to get her into 
      his car.

                                        JOSHUA
                      Elizabeth, you have to come with me.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I don t have to do jack!  I am the mother 
                      suckin  shore patrol, mother sucker.  
                      Watch.  I have magical powers.  I can 
                      stop cars!

      She runs into traffic.  Tires screech.  Joshua dials 911.


      INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

        Joshua rides with Elizabeth, now strapped to a gurney and 
        struggling.  He talks calmly to the PARAMEDICS.  He s 
      done this many times before.

                                        JOSHUA
                      She s bipolar.  She needs IV Haldol or 
                      Ativan.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Wahoo!  Make it a double!                                                                                        49.


      EXT. INNERCITY HOSPITAL - DAWN

        A very different place than the one where she works.  Not 
      nice.


      INT. ER - MORNING

        Elizabeth wakes up strapped to a gurney in a hall filled 
      with gurneys.  She s the only person there who isn t dirt 
      poor or homeless, except for Joshua who is asleep on a 
      metal chair nearby.  

        Elizabeth closes her eyes.  Christ.  


      INT. ELIZABETH S APARTMENT - DAY

        Elizabeth sits in a robe, curled on her sofa, 
        recuperating.  Joshua brings her coffee.  He s exhausted.  
        Rumpled.  Unshaven.  She looks beautiful, and curiously 
        ethereal, as if she just died and came back.

                                        JOSHUA
                      I called work, told them you had food 
                      poisoning.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Thanks.  Esme?

                                        JOSHUA
                      She s okay.  She understands.  Regan is 
                    on the warpath, as you can imagine.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Please tell her it will never happen 
                      again.

                                        JOSHUA
                      Lizzy, dear, that s a promise you can t 
                      make.   

      She winces.  He s right.  He crosses.  They hug.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I m so sorry.

                                        JOSHUE
                    It could have been me, you know.  You 
                      were unlucky.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Thanks.                                                                                           50.


      INT. HARTRAMPH S OFFICE - DAY

        Elizabeth sits across from Hartramph, who is totally 
        impassive.  Clinical.  Interested in how it all unfolded.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                    So going off the meds was a willful act.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Yes.  

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      Why do you think you did it?

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (shrugs)
                      I wanted it to end?  

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      That s not how I read it.  I think you 
                      wanted Will to love you for who you are, 
                      and so you showed him the worst you have 
                    to offer.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Well, if that was the plan, it definitely 
                      didn t work.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      You don t know that.  Talk to him.  Call 
                      him.

        Elizabeth shakes her head.  

                                        HARTRAMPH (CONT D)
                      Elizabeth, I m worried about you cycling 
                      into depression.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I ll be okay.  I will.  You see, I still 
                      have the thing that matters most to me in 
                      the world.


      EXT. JOSHUA S HOUSE - DAY

        Elizabeth knocks at the front door.  Regan opens.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I came to apologize, to you and to Esme.

      Regan steps outside with Elizabeth, closes the door 
        behind her.  Not good.                                                                                        51.


                                        REGAN
                      Esme s fine.  She s used to this.  How 
                      does that make you feel?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Worse than you can ever imagine.  Can I 
                      see her?  

                                        REGAN
                      No.  You and Esme are going to take a 
                      break.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Please, Regan.  I ll do anything.  Don t 
                      take Esme away from me.

                                        REGAN
                      It s all about you all the time.  God, 
                      you re exhausting.  And the worst of it 
                      is, she still loves you.  More than me.  
                      You can t have missed the way she s been 
                      treating me.   

                                        ELIZABETH
                      She s a teenager.  It s normal.

                                        REGAN
                      No, it s not.  She s transferring the 
                      affection she always had for me to you.  
                      I m the boring housewife who waits on her 
                      hand and foot.  You re her exotic, 
                      successful, crazy aunt who does exactly 
                      what she pleases, no matter who she 
                      hurts, and always gets away with it.  Not 
                      this time.

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (suddenly desperate)
                      Please, Regan.  I have to see her.  She s 
                      all I ve got.

                                        REGAN
                      Not until she realizes who her real 
                      family is.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I am her real family.

                                        REGAN
                      Say that one more time and you ll never 
                      see her again.  You made a deal.  You 
                      know perfectly well I hold the cards.  
                      This is my decision.  So learn to live 
                      with it.                                                                                         52.


        Instantly, Elizabeth regrets her words.  But it s too 
      late.  Regan goes inside and locks the door.  Elizabeth 
      leans on the doorbell.  Nothing.  Starts to 
        hyperventilate.  She returns to her car and looks up at 
      the house.

      Esme stands her upstairs window like a princess in a 
        tower.  She waves once to Elizabeth and disappears.


      EXT. BEACH - DUSK

        Elizabeth sits in her car, looking out at the water.  
      It s the same place we saw in her dream.  A real place.  
      It may, in fact, be where her mother died.  Elizabeth 
      pulls out her cell phone and dials.  


      INT. HARTRAMPH S OFFICE - DAY

        Hartramph sits with a pockmarked teenage boy and his 
        mother.  Her cell rings.  She looks down.

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      I m sorry.  I have to take this.  I only 
                      get calls on this line if it s an 
                      emergency.  

      She steps into the next room, a small private office.  

                                        HARTRAMPH (CONT D)
                      Hello?

        INTERCUT WITH ELIZABETH AT WILL.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Give me a reason to go on living.

        Hartramph knows instantly how important this is.  She 
        remains  magnificently calm. 

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      Your work.  What I do for you is nothing 
                      compared to what you do for your 
                      patients.  If you re gone, there s a void 
                      that can t be filled.  Dr. Elizabeth 
                      Black is needed, valued, and loved.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Not for who I really am.  

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      The best part of you is who you really 
                      are.  The rest is a disease.                                                                                        53.


                                        ELIZABETH
                      I alienated Will forever.  I can t see my 
                      daughter.  I came within an inch of 
                      exposing myself at work.  If Owen had 
                      seen me.  If Bickman finds out-   

                                        HARTRAMPH
                      Don t catastrophize.  No one found out 
                      anything.  Esme will come back.  Regan 
                      can t keep her from you forever.  And 
                      your work is waiting for you.  Nothing 
                      matters more than that.   


      INT. ANTHONY S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

        Anthony is packing to leave.  His drawings still cover 
      the walls.  Elizabeth enters, still feeling down, but she 
        smiles when she sees Anthony.  His head is bandaged and 
      he s pale, but he is cheerful and upbeat.

                                        ANTHONY
                              (big grin)
                      Hi, Dr. Black.

      She sits on the edge of the bed.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      How are you feeling?

                                        ANTHONY
                      Great.  My old self again.  Checking out 
                      today.  I m almost ready to go.

      He starts to put a book from his bedside table into his 
        suitcase.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      What s that?

      He hands it to her.

                                        ElIZABETH (CONT D)
                       The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.    

                                        ANTHONY
                      It s incredible stuff.  All about the 
                      brain.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      I know it well.                                                                                           54.


                                        ANTHONY
                      I can identify with all the stories, you 
                      know?   
                              (he gestures to the wall)
                      I can t believe I did that.  It s like I 
                      was someone else.  This whole experience, 
                      it s been pretty major.  I don t want to 
                    be a physicist anymore.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You don t?

                                        ANTHONY
                      No.  Neuroscience is so amazing.   The 
                      brain is the ultimate mystery.  No one 
                      really understands it at all.  I think 
                      now I want to be a neuroscientist, like 
                      you.  You saved my life, Dr. Black.

      He looks at Elizabeth with huge admiration and she smiles  
      like the whole world just came back into its orbit.  


      EXT. THE CUBE - DAY

        Establishing.  A board and care van is by the front door.


      INT. THE CUBE - DAY

        Elizabeth walks down the hall pushing Lucy in a 
        wheelchair with Yojo in her lap.  

                                        LUCY
                    So Yojo can go with me?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      He ll never leave you.

                                        LUCY
                      And this place is nice?

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Very nice.  They will take good care of 
                      both of you.  

        A NURSE is waiting. 

                                        BOARD AND CARE NURSE
                      Hello, Lucy.  I m Amelia.  I m going to 
                      take you to your new home.  Can you 
                      introduce me to Yojo?                                                                                        55.


                                        LUCY
                                (soft)
                      He s a little shy.

      The nurse takes the wheelchair from Elizabeth.

                                        HOSPICE NURSE
                      I ll win him over.  Wait till he tries my 
                      chocolate chip cookies. 

      And they re out the door.  Hold on Elizabeth, feeling 
        better and better.


      INT. EXAM ROOM - THE CUBE - LATER

        Elizabeth walks back towards her office, passes the first 
      exam room where she saw Anthony and his parents.  
        Painters are going in, preparing to repaint the wall.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Wait, what are you doing?  

                                        PAINTER ONE
                                (hands her a work order)
                      Cleaning this place up.  We ll have it 
                      back to normal in a few hours.

      She enters, looks at the beautiful, nonsensical drawing 
        Anthony did the first day.  She takes the work order and 
      tears it up.

                                        ELIZABETH
                      Take a long lunch instead.

      They go and Elizabeth remains in the presence of the 
        strange art work.  She looks at it, now at peace.


      EXT. RIVER PARK - DAY

        Elizabeth sits on a bench having take out lunch.  Will 
      slips into frame and sits beside her.  She looks over, 
        surprised to see him.  Doesn t know what to say.  

                                        WILL
                      I should have called. 

                                        ELIZABETH
                                (casual)
                      It s okay.  I understand.                                                                                           56.


                                        WILL
                      You were a stranger.  A creature.  Not 
                      the woman I thought I knew.  

                                        ELIZABETH
                      You don t have to explain.  You re a 
                      kind, intelligent, normal guy. Why should 
                      put up with this?  

      She gets up to go and he reaches out and grabs her hand.  

                                        WILL
                      Maybe I m not as  normal  as you think.  
                      What you did to me.  That night?  
                                (beat)
                      I liked it.  And I want to do it again.

        Elizabeth doesn t know what to say.  Hold on the two of 
      them as we....

      FADE OUT.
