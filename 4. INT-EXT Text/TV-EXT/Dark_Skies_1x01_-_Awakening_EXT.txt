        Miles above the Earth, a black object rockets straight
        toward us.  As it passes, we realize it is an unmarked jet,
        built for speed, currently in pursuit of another glowing
        craft.  A SUPER reads:

      As the U-2 blasts after the bogey, we get a better look at
      it.

      It is OVAL, seemingly STRUCTURAL, with ROTATING LIGHT
        sources.

                        best planes we build, but whatever
                        this guy's got, I want one, too.

        Suddenly, the craft simply SHOOTS STRAIGHT UP!

      As it does, its structure seems to give way and it becomes
        nothing more than a FLASH OF LIGHT!


      The "bogey" has been replaced by the MOTHER SHIP!

      It is ENORMOUS -- the size of ten football fields.

        Worse, it is DROPPING DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH of the U-2! As
      it does, it begins to PULSE WITH ENERGY.

        PICK UP a '57 Chevy convertible with California plates as it
        drives by the recognizable monuments and buildings.  It is
        stuffed with the worldly possessions of JOHN LOENGARD
      and KIMBERLY SAYERS.  Together, they are fresh out of
        UCLA, sweethearts, and part of the wave of idealism sweeping
        over America in the giddy opening days of Camelot.

        Over this, we hear the middle-aged voice of a man the world
        will come to know as LOENGARD.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        My name is John Loengard.  This
                        program is being presented as
                        fiction to protect those people
                        fighting in the Resistance.  But I
                        will tell you the truth now if
                        you will listen.

      The Chevy approaches the White House.


        Loengard and Sayers seem thrilled to be on a grand adventure
      as they climb the stairs.  Before them looms an imposing
        view of the Capitol Building.  The voice-over continues:

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        When Kimberly and I came to
                          Washington during the first summer
                        of the 'New Frontier' , I landed my
                        first real job as an assistant on
                        Capitol Hill.  I thought I knew
                          everything.  I found out I knew
                        nothing.

        Loengard recruits a passer-by to snap a photo of the two.

        FLASH!  The final picture shows two smiling young lovers.
      The voice-over concludes:

        Loengard bounds up the steps, carrying a tray of coffees and
        a bag of donuts.


        Sayers works in the courtyard area on a picnic table with
        several neighborhood pre-schoolers, AD-LIBBING instructions
        while carving Halloween pumpkins.

        Loengard pulls up in his Chevy and parks across the street.
      He watches a beat, smiles, then jogs up to Sayers.

                                        SAYERS

                        Oh, I wish you'd called.  I just
                        made grilled cheese sandwiches for
                        the kids.

                        to do.

                        They're sending me to Ohio
                          tomorrow.  I get to check out
                        'Project Blue Book.'

                                        SAYERS
                        I never heard of that.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Okay, don't laugh, but it's flying
                        saucers.  The Air Force has a whole
                        division set up to investigate

                        Sounds like a big waste of money.

                        That's what they're paying me to
                        find out.

                        Thanks.  Hey, nice Jack-O-Lanterns.

        Sayers nods, but his compliment only stirs the discontent
        brewing beneath her smile.  After a moment she admits:

                        Look, I understand not wanting to
                        use your dad's connections.  So let
                        me talk to somebody on the Hill.  I
                        see people all the time, maybe --

                                        SAYERS
                        The whole point is, I want to do
                        this on my own.
                                  (sighs)
                        I know.  I'm whining.

        Loengard pulls her close, gives her a re-assuring hug.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You do it your way, Kim.  But just
                        know I'm here if you need me.

      She kisses him, appreciative of his support.  But their kiss
      is cut short when one of the kids accidentally knocks his
        pumpkin off the table.  Sayers attends to the situation.

        Loengard sees her mood, grabs up two pencils used for
        marking the Jack-O-Lanterns and stabs them into the pumpkin
        head as antennae.  He hides his own head inside his shirt
      and holds the pumpkin above it.

                        Take me to you leader.

      The kids giggle.  Even Sayers has to smile at his silliness.

      As he exits his car, Loengard pulls his coat tight around
      him to protect against the chill, takes his briefcase and
      the cake, walks up to the door and knocks.  BETTY HILL, a
        social worker by profession, answers.

                        Mrs. Hill?  Hi.  I'm John Loengard.
                        We talked on the phone.  I just
                        came from Pease Air Force Base

                        If you feel like talking, my
                          girlfriend baked this fruit cake
                        for us.

        Loengard hands the cake to Betty.  A black man appears
        behind her.  This is BARNEY HILL, her husband.  They are an
          inter-racial couple.

                        No sir.  I was just telling your
                        wife there's new information about
                        the sighting you reported.

                        Well, sir, that's good point.
                        Probably was a pretty dumb idea.
                        But I'll be honest with you.  I was
                        sent out to prove the Air Force
                          investigation is a waste of money.
                        But right now, let's just say I've
                        got an open mind.

        telephone pole and into a parked bread truck on the road

        Driving through the dark countryside, Loengard finds himself
        gripping the steering wheel.  He looks outside the car
        window at the night sky.  Almost a full moon.

        Trying to break up the mood, Loengard turns on the radio.
        It's Del Shannon's tune, "RUNAWAY."  As Loengard drives,
        something catches his eye.  It's a LIGHT, visible from the
        rear-view window.  Loengard turns the radio OFF, tries to
        crane his neck around the see if the light is still there.
      Now it's gone.  He shakes his head as if to clear the
        confusion, tries to relax.

      He turns the radio back ON, but this time the song is barely
        audible, obscured by STATIC.  Suddenly --

        A BLACK FLYING MACHINE

        Crests the horizon in front of him.  It's very dangerous
        looking, and it's heading RIGHT AT HIM!

        LOENGARD

        Panics, slams on his brakes, swerving to the side of the
        road.  He tries to re-start the engine but it's flooded, or
        dead.

        Loengard throws the door to the Chevy open and runs from the
        car.  The object is on fast approach.  Loengard flees for
      the cover of the trees off the side of the road.


        Loengard runs wildly into the thick brush.  Frantic, he is
        being tracked by a SEARCHLIGHT from the craft above.
        Loengard bursts into a clearing.

      As the craft lowers to the ground in front of him, Loengard
      is blinded by the BRIGHT LIGHT.  As he stands in the
        clearing, the WIND WHIPS wildly past him and there is a
        DEAFENING ROAR from the object.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT21.

        LOENGARD'S POV - THE LIGHT

      As four ALL-BLACK CREATURES emerge from it.  As the shapes
        move closer, we discern their human form.

        LOENGARD

        Reacts in panic as several men, dressed in non-descript
        black suits, take chase after him.

        Loengard is tackled from behind.  He struggles, but one of
        these MIB forcefully backhands him, knocking him to the
        ground.  This effectively ends Loengard's struggle.

        While Loengard recovers, the MIB leader steps in front of
        him, offers a hand to pull him up.  We recognize this leader
      as Frank Bach, the man who gave Francis Gary Powers
      the permission to overfly Soviet airspace.

                                        BACH
                        Very impressive work, Mister
                          Loengard.  You have a real talent.

                                        LOENGARD
                        How do you know who I am?

        Bach ignores Loengard, turns to one of the MIB and orders:

                                        BACH
                        Get his tape.

      One of the MIB dashes off through the clearing, back towards
        Loengard's car.  Bach turns back to Loengard.

                        enough to be worth his attention.

        Loengard nods, scared out of his wits.  The MIB returns with
        Loengard's reel of tape, showing it off to Bach.

                                        MIB #1
                        Got it, Captain!        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT22.

                                        MIB #2
                        You want me to put him to bed?

        Bach motions for MIB #2 to lean closer and whispers to him.
        Loengard is hysterically frightened as MIB #2 moves closer
      and BOLTS HIS GUN outside his ear.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What?!  What are you doing?! I
                        HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING!!

        Loengard has been reduced to sheer animal fright. MIB #2
        aims his weapon.  The GUN CLICKS.

        Loengard's knees give out and the MIB holding him supports
      his limp body.  Bach moves closer.

                                        BACH
                        Keep your nose out of our business,
                        Mister Loengard.  Or next time, we
                        make a house call.  And Kimberly
                        can join us.

        Bach moves away but MIB #2 lingers.

                                        MIB #2
                        Lucky for you, college boy, the man
                        says you get to stay up late this
                        time.

      MIB #2 clearly enjoys punching Loengard in the stomach,
        knocking the wind out of him, leaving him on his knees,
        gasping for breath.

      The MIB load into the aircraft, which we now see is ominous
        indeed, but of earthly origin.  It is an ALL-BLACK
        HELICOPTER!  With no markings whatsoever.

        Loengard, filled with terror at what he has stumbled into,
      can only watch helplessly, as the helicopter lifts off and
      we:


                                                                                  FADE OUT.

        FADE IN:


      To ESTABLISH winter.  People bundled up, trudging through
      the snow.  Loengard watches them pensively, afraid to go
        inside.  His attention is drawn to:

      AN OVERHEAD HELICOPTER

        It's a normal chopper, unlike the black one we encountered
        last night.

        LOENGARD

        Filled with dread, he joins the other workers and heads up
      the stairs.


        Loengard and Simonson cut a path through the columns,
        talking animatedly.  A SUPER reads:

                        Look, If you want, I can go over to
                        the Library of Congress and see

                                        LOENGARD
                          I haven't had time to watch a lot
                        of TV lately.

                                        SIMONSON
                        You can't trust Casey.  You know he
                        wants that other doctor, Maggie,
                        but he won't make a move on her.
                        Now why is that?

                                        LOENGARD
                        I don't know.  He's probably got a
                        lot on his mind.

                                        SIMONSON
                        I'm going back to 'Kildare.'

        During Simonson's response, Loengard sees MIB #5 tailing
      the two of them.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        From a distance, it must have
                        appeared as though nothing had
                        changed.  Bach insisted I keep my
                        day job, but he made it clear I was
                        on call to 'Majestic.'

                                        LOENGARD
                        Uh, Mark, I'm gonna take care of
                        that research right now.  I'll see
                        you back at the office.

        Loengard peels off.  Simonson shrugs, continues on.  From a
        distance, Simonson observes Loengard and the MIB talking.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT39.

        BEHIND THE COLUMN

      MIB #5 pulls a plane ticket from his coat, hands it to
        Loengard.

                                        LOENGARD
                        This is only one way.  When am I
                        coming back?

                                        MIB #5
                                  (ignoring him)
                        At the airport, bring a Washington
                        paper and read the sports page.

      MIB #5 then turns and walks away.

                                        LOENGARD
                        What am I doing!?  What's the job!?

      No answers.  Loengard is left staring apprehensively at the
        ticket.


        Loengard descends the steps of a small commuter plane
        directly onto the tarmac.  He and a handful of travelers
        hurry for the warmth of the terminal.  A sign informs us we
      are at "Boise Air Terminal."


        Loengard is seated in the rear of the chopper with three
        MIB, including Steele.  No one talks.  Loengard takes out a
        stick of gum and starts chewing.  He offers the pack to the
      MIB but gets no takers.  It's clear they regard Loengard
        with great suspicion.  From the cockpit area, Bach climbs
        back to speak to the others.

                                        BACH
                        Outside!  Nine o'clock!

        Loengard and the MIB push against the window and stare down
      at:

        Nearly a mile below, covering sections of a wheat fIeld and
      the dirt road bisecting it, is a massive otherworldly

        something made by Nother Nature.

        Loengard is chilled by this eerie image.

                        He'll fold when the pressure's on.

        Bach smiles, turns calmly to Loengard.

                                        BACH
                        John, tell Mister Steele two things
                        from your personal life.  Make one
                        of them a lie.

        Loengard, caught off-guard, sees that Bach is not joking.
      He turns away for a moment, then turns back to MIB #2/Steele
      and says, without blinking:

                                        LOENGARD
                        I was a starter on the football
                        team my junior year of high school.
                        That same year I kissed a black
                        girl at a party.

      MIB #2/Steele keeps his unblinking gaze drilling back into
        Loengard.

        Loengard takes another look outside at the eerie pictogram.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Have we ever seen one of these
                        before?

        Bach and the MIB trade knowing glances.  MIB #2/Steele
        flicks a spent cigarette butt in his direction.

                        I still say he's not ready, Frank.

        Bach unwinds the string around a clasp on an envelope marked
        "Above Top Secret."  He slides out a photo.

                                        BACH
                        This is a piece of the broken I-
                        beam from the Roswell crash.

        Bach hands the photo to Loengard.  The I-beam has a series
      of pictogram's running along it.  One of them is a dead
        match for the pictogram in the wheat field.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        We've seen it before.  We just
                        haven't seen it for a long time.


        Loengard stands in a pay phone, looking at a wallet-size
        photo of Sayers.

                        Thanks for the update, John, but
                        I've got to go.

        Loengard hangs up, terribly conflicted as he slowly moves to
        join Bach and the MIB.


        Loengard stands at the front door knocking, gets no answer.
      He wanders over to the nearby ramshackle red barn, where a
        pickup truck, hood up, is parked inside.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hello!?  Anybody home!?


        Grantham's pick up truck putters down a dirt road, cresting
      at the top of a small valley.  Down below we see the crop
        marking.

      The truck stops and Loengard hops out.  He takes a look at
      the discolored dirt on the road, then wanders over to a wire
        fence.  Following the line of the marking, matching sections
      of the barbed wire have virtually disappeared.

        BACK TO SCENE

      As Loengard trudges further out into the wheat field,
        Grantham watches on from inside the cab, answering questions

                        This thing is huge ...

        Loengard kneels down and inspects the uniformly matted wheat
        stalks.  He plucks one from the ground.  It's darker, almost
        discolored on the side facing up.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        Mister Grantham, do you remember
                        the first time you saw this?

                                        GRANTHAM
                        Last week maybe.  It's winter
                        wheat, Mister Graber.  You don't do
                        much this time of year 'cept let it
                        grow.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Why didn't you report it?

                                        GRANTHAM
                        No law says I got to.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You see any strange lights in the
                        sky over the last month or two?

                                        GRANTHAM
                        Why?  You seen some?

      But Loengard isn't answering.  He's out in the middle of the
        formation now.  He bends down on one knee to inspect it.

                                        LOENGARD
                                  (sotto; into mic)
                        The stalks are laid down perfectly.
                        Not even broken.

        Loengard now wanders further out.  He's about fifty yards
        away from the truck when he steps on something.  Kicking the
        wheat away, Loengard exposes a small, triangular metal plate.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        I found something!

        Down on his hands and knees, Loengard whisks away the dirt
      to reveal a pictogram which is a derivation of the larger
        crop circle design itself.

        Loengard holds it up for inspection.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT50.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        It's that picture again.  And this
                        thing's made of gold!

      The sound of Grantham's TRUCK STARTING diverts Loengard's
        attention.  He looks up to see Grantham gunning the engine,
        barreling toward him.  Loengard runs, dives into the full
        wheat field.


        Grantham takes another run at Loengard.  He sees the sedan
        approaching fast.  SHOTS are fired at him.  Grantham's pick-
      up heads off down another dirt road.

      The sedan is hot on Grantham's tail.  When the car gets
        close enough, MIB #2/STEELE leans out the passenger side
        window, pistol trained with both hands -- BLAM! BLAM!

        GRANTHAN'S REAR TIRE BLOWS!

        Grantham's truck lists onto the road's dirt shoulder and
        fishtails out of control.  Then it traverses unexpectedly
        back across the road, cutting off the SKIDDING sedan.
        Finally:

      THE TRUCK CRASHES HEADFIRST INTO A TREE!

        Bach and the MIB climb from the sedan and cautiously
        approach the smashed pick up.  Bach takes a long look inside
      the cracked driver's window, then reholsters his gun.  It's
        over.

        Loengard stares at his reflection in the water.  He sucks in
      air hard, trying to breathe to free himself.  But he can't.
      The knowledge is terrible.  It changes everything.  He
        cannot escape its searing reality.

        Then a STREAK OF LIGHT across the water catches his eye.  He
        looks up at the black sky above.  Gone.

        Loengard puts his head in his hands and cries at his tragic
          predicament.


        Sayers stands in the courtyard area staring at the stars,
        crying tears of frustration.  A beat, then she is aware of
      the presence of a little girl standing nearby watching her.
        Sayers looks up and their eyes meet.

                                        VOICE (O.S.)
                        Lauren, come here!

      The little girl moves away.  We now become aware of the
        nearby sound of JOHN KENNEDY'S VOICE, amplified over some
        kind of loudspeaker.  Sayers moves numbly in that direction.

        AROUND THE CORNER

        A crowd of onlookers stand in front of the ground floor
        television appliance store.  They are watching President
        Kennedy on TV.

                                        KENNEDY (T.V.)
                        ... aggressive conduct if allowed
                        to go unchallenged, ultimately
                        leads to war.  The greatest danger
                        is to do nothing ...

        Sayers watches, seemingly uncomprehending what she's seeing.
      The rest of the crowd seems to get it all too well.  The
        world is on the verge of nuclear armageddon.

      THE CHEVY

        Parks at the curb.  Loengard exits, moves toward the
        apartment only to stop in front of the window himself.  He
        sees Sayers, eyes puffy from crying.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, what's going on?

                                        SAYERS
                        I don't know.  Doesn't make any
                        sense ...

        Before Loengard can really understand, the MAN next to him
        interjects:

                                        MAN
                        Looks like we're goin' to war.
                        Russians got missiles in Cuba.

                                        LOENGARD
                        My God ...

                                        SAYERS
                        What's happening, John?

                                        LOENGARD
                        I don't know, but I'm going to find
                        out.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT78.


        Bethesda, Maryland.  Normally, a typical suburban
        neighborhood.  Tonight, however, there are neighbors packing
        cars, shouting about bomb shelters, listening to the RADIO
        NEWS.  Loengard exits his Chevy, approaches the door to one
        house and knocks.  Bach answers.  He is not happy.  From
        inside, WE HEAR:

                                        MRS. BACH (O.S.)
                        Honey, who is it?

                                        BACH
                                  (yelling back inside)
                        I've got it.

        Bach moves onto the porch, closing the door behind him,
        lighting a cigarette.

                                        BACH (CONT'D)
                        There is no reason good enough to
                        explain your being here.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Well, since the world seems to be
                        going up in smoke, I thought we
                        could bend the rules a little.

                                        BACH
                                  (impatient)
                        What do you want, John?

                                        LOENGARD
                        I know it's always changing with
                        you, but what I want is the truth
                        about this Cuba thing.

                                        BACH
                        I'm under no obligation to discuss
                        this with you.

                                        LOENGARD
                        That's what I'm talking about.  Who
                        exactly are you obligated to
                        discuss this with?  Because while
                        I'm watching the TV -- maybe I'm
                        naive -- but I'm asking myself
                        whether Kennedy has told Khrushchev
                        about 'Patient Zero?'  Because if
                        he did, I don't see how they could
                        threaten each other like this.

                                        BACH
                        Go home.  Be with Kimberly.  She's
                        probably scared.

                                        LOENGARD
                        We're all scared.  You're the only
                        one who's not.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT79.

                                        BACH
                        They'll work it out.  They have to.

                                        LOENGARD
                          President Kennedy doesn't know
                        about 'Majestic,' does he?

        Bach stares at Loengard, shakes his head.

                                        BACH
                        I took a chance bringing you
                        inside, John.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So I should be eternally grateful?
                        Forget it.  Not if I'm being lied
                        to.  It's a simple question, Frank.
                        Does he know?  Yes or no?

        Bach takes a long drag on his cigarette, then, as he
        exhales:

                                        BACH
                        The President knows exactly what he
                        needs to know.

        Loengard reels against the car, stunned by the confirmation
      of his suspicion.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I knew it.  I knew it.
                                  (beat)
                        Just tell me this: who appointed
                        you God?

                                        BACH
                        Ike.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Ike?!

                                        BACH
                        He never trusted Kennedy. After
                        Nixon lost, Ike gave us the
                          authority to decide which future
                          presidents get told.  It's all
                          perfectly legal.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Who cares?!  Kennedy could tell the
                        people.  He's a great leader.

                                        BACH
                        That will not happen on my watch.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Frank, you can't keep the President
                        of the United States in the dark
                        about this.  That's wrong.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT80.

                                        BACH
                        Look at the panic this Cuba thing's
                        caused.  You take God and
                          Government out of the eguation, all
                        you have left is chaos.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You know, Frank, if you're going to
                        fight for Humanity, then at least
                        have a little faith in us.

      And with that, Loengard turns on his heel, leaving Bach
        standing alone.


        Loengard's Chevy pulls up and parks.  He exits.  WE SEE
        people on the street, highly anxious, packing cars with
        their possessions, discussing their plans with neighbors.
        Loengard enters the apartment building.


        Where, in a shower of glass, Pratt falls to the cement
        below.  Blood begins to come from his ears and nose.
        Someone SCREAMS.  As he dies, his body convulses in a death
        shudder, punctuated by HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.

        While a small group of onlookers gather, a teenager steps up
        next to Pratt's body.  He surveys the corpse with no sign of
        emotion.  Then he alone looks up at the window.


        Loengard's Chevy screeches up in front of a row of
        brownstone apartments.  He jumps out, leaving the car
        illegally parked, and rushes up to a door.  Loengard starts
        hammering on it with his fist.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Doctor Hertzog!  It's me!
                          Loengard!

        Loengard begins to pull at the door, trying to force it
        open.  A beat, then Hertzog appears in a bathrobe, fumbling
        with his eyeglasses.

                                        HERTZOG
                        John!  What is it?

                        The aliens.  Somehow they got to my
                          girlfriend.  She's in the car.  We
                        have to take her to 'Majestic.' You
                        have to do your A.R.T. on her.

                                        HERTZOG
                        John, that's impossible.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Let's go, Doctor.  Now!

                                        HERTZOG
                        No.  You've seen the protocol. The
                          directive prioritizes the
                          collection of 'live' specimens. If
                        we take her in, I will be forced to
                        perform a cerebral eviction instead.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Cut it out?  If you do that, she'll
                        die.

                                        HERTZOG
                        I will have no choice.

        Loengard stumbles back, the cruel reality sinking in.  Then,
      in desperation:

                                        LOENGARD
                        Can you help me do an A.R.T. out
                        here?

                                        HERTZOG
                        John, please.  Don't put me in this
                          position.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT85.

        Loengard picks Hertzog up by the robe and gets in his face.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Then you tell me what I need to do.
                        And you make it quick.


        A "For Sale" sign is posted outside.  The Chevy pulls to the
        curb.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT86.


      An OLD MAN reading the evening paper cocks his head,
        reacting to something strange.  We are in his POV now.
      We hear a PULSING SOUND.  He hurries from the house, leaving
      his baffled wife standing on the front stoop.

      BACK AT THE VACANT HOUSE

        Loengard watches Sayers' unconscious body, stroking her
        forehead gently.  He has restrained her with several
        extension cords.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT87.

        Suddenly, her body stiffens, scaring Loengard, and she goes
        through a convulsive shaking spell.  She begins to mutter
      the INDECIPHERABLE FOUR-WORD PHRASE.  After a beat, Loengard
        slaps her face.  Sayers' eyes flutter open.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, it's me.  You're going to be
                        okay.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, you have to let me go.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Not yet.

                                        SAYERS
                        I'm okay.  Really.  It worked.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Not yet, Kim.  I am so sorry.  I
                        just can't --

                                        SAYERS
                                  (suddenly furious)
                        JOHN, I HATE YOU!  LET ME GO!

                                        LOENGARD
                        That's not you talking, Kim.  You
                        have to keep fighting it.

        Abruptly, Sayers' fury turns to a whimpering, tearful plea.

                                        SAYERS
                        Honey, please.  I want to go home.
                        Please just take me home.
                        Please  ... please ...

        Loengard has to cover his ears.  The guilt is overwhelming.
      But Sayers persists.  Really bawling now.  Forcing Loengard
      to grit his teeth and turn away to see:

        A FACE

        Appears in the sliding glass door.  It's the Old Man, armed
        with a shovel.

        LOENGARD

        Freaks out.  He gestures to the Old Man.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Listen.  It's not what it looks
                        like.  I can explain this --

      The Old Man unexpectedly takes the shovel and swings it into
      the glass door, shattering it, sending shards everywhere!        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT88.

      The Old Man comes after Loengard with the shovel.  Loengard
      has to dodge wild swings.  During this, Loengard is further
        alarmed to see THE TEENAGER (seen earlier at Pratt's body)
        entering, carrying a golf club.

        While Loengard keeps the Old Man at bay, the Teenager
        catches Loengard in the head with a roundhouse swing and
        knocks him out cold.  Before the Old Man can deliver the
        death blow with his shovel:

        Sayers emits a PRIMAL SCREAM.  She stiffens again and begins
        violently gagging.  Her face constricts and her eyes roll
        back in her head.

        Then, with a scary suddenness, she coughs up:

        A GANGLION

        Twitching and incipient, clearly not as developed as the one
        taken from Grantham earlier.

      THE ATTACKERS

        Stop what they are doing and move to gently cradle the alien
        organism.

        LOENGARD

        Struggles for consciousness.  He sees what is going on and
        crawls toward the shovel.  With all his strength, he grabs
      it and rises and begins his own attack.

        A few strong hits and both the Old Man and the Teenager have
        been knocked out.

      THE GANGLION

        Falls to the floor and skitters into the shadows.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Loengard stalks about, looking for it.  When he tracks the
        creature down, he smashes it with his shovel.


        Carrying an unconscious Sayers in his arms, Loengard returns
      to his Chevy, where he gently lays his girlfriend into the
        backseat.  As he hurries around to the driver's door:

        HEADLIGHTS

        Shine on Loengard.  There is blood running down his head.
        From a car parked directly in front of the Chevy (on the
        wrong side of the street), four silhouetted figures emerge
        from the bright light.  We recognize them as Bach, MIB
        #2/Steele, MIB #3 and Hertzog.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT89.

                                        LOENGARD
                                (to Hertzog; angry)
                        So you couldn't help me, but you
                        went running to them?

                                        HERTZOG
                        Please, John.  It's my job. I know
                        how you feel but --

                                        LOENGARD
                                (to Bach)
                        -- And if you're going to follow
                        me, you could at least lend a hand.

                                        BACH
                        We just got here, John.  We had to
                        clean up the mess you left at your
                          apartment.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I'll bet you knew about Pratt,
                        didn't you?

                                        BACH
                        We suspected.

                                        LOENGARD
                        But I didn't need to know, is that
                        it?

                                        BACH
                        You proved our case.  That's all
                        hat matters.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You go to hell, Frank.

        Loengard turns back toward his car.

                                        BACH
                        We need Kimberly now, John.  Don't
                        let her death be in vain.

        Loengard gets a little laugh out of this.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You guys are like vultures.  The
                        only problem is, she's not dead!


        Loengard, dressed in a black suit and shades, stands next to
        Sayers at the back of the March on Washington crowd.  Sayers
        takes pictures with her Brownie Hawkeye.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        For Kimberly and me, it was just
                        the opposite.  Bach gave us a month
                        in Miami, all expenses paid.  But
                        while we were gone, he also bugged
                        the apartment.  The only time we
                        were alone was in the middle of a
                        crowd.

      The crowd ROARS with approval as King orates. Loengard  has
      to shout to be heard.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Listen to that.  What if all these
                        people knew who the real enemy
                        was?  That would definitely be a
                        force to be reckoned with.

                                        SAYERS
                        Martin Luther King is not going
                        to start talking about you-know-
                        what.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Not King.  Kennedy.  He's the only
                        one who could tell the world what's
                        really happening and get them to
                        fight instead of panic.  See, Bach
                        doesn't get it.  He wants the same
                        thing they do -- keep it a
                        secret.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT92.

                                        SAYERS
                        John, you don't just tell the
                          President of the United States
                        there are aliens here on Earth.
                        Even if you could, you'd look like
                        a fool.

                                        SIMONSON (O.S.)
                        Hey, Loengard.

        From the crowd, Loengard and Sayers see Simonson
          approaching.

                                        LOENGARD
                          Simonson!  Kim, you remember Mark
                        Simonson from Congressman Pratt's
                        office.

        Sayers and Simonson AD-LIB greetings.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Shame about Pratt, isn't it?

                                        SAYERS
                        To be honest, I never liked him.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Me neither.  I just mean, getting
                        mugged right on the streets.
                          Washington sure isn't as safe as it
                        used to be.

                                        LOENGARD
                        So what are you up to now?

                                        SIMONSON
                        I'm moving the family down to
                        Alabama.  I signed up with Doctor
                        King to help out with voter
                          registration.
                                (off Loengard's look)
                        Hey, it's better than starting over
                        again with some other lunatic
                          Congressman.

                                        LOENGARD
                        No, it sounds great. Wish I could
                        join you.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Listen, Loengard, can I ask you
                          something?  In private?

        Loengard looks to Sayers, who takes her cue and returns to
        photographing the rally.

                                        SIMONSON (CONT'D)
                        I've thought about it.  I do want
                        to know what you found out.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT93.

                                        LOENGARD
                        No, you don't.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Come on.  You at least owe me that.

        Loengard stares at him, looks around, leans close.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Look, I can tell you this.  Flying
                        saucers are not man-made.

        A long beat while Simonson holds Loengard's dead-eye
        stare ... then busts up laughing.

                                        SIMONSON
                        Damn, Loengard, you really had me
                        going there for a second.
                                  (beat)
                        You two ever get down South, give a
                        visit.

        Loengard shakes Simonson's hand, then watches him disappear
        back into the crowd.  Loengard returns to Sayers' side.

                                        SAYERS
                        Did you tell him?

                                        LOENGARD
                        Yeah.  But he thought it was all a
                        big joke.

                                        SAYERS
                        That's what I'm trying to tell you.
                        Think how crazy it sounds, John.
                        You have to have proof.  Which
                        you're never going to get out of
                          Majestic.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You're right.  But everybody has a
                          weakness.  Even Bach.

        Sayers looks at Loengard, wondering what he has planned.


      The Chevy is parked discretely down the street.


        Loengard has climbed up a tree along the side of the house.
        He's got a vantage point on an upstairs window.  A beat,
        then he waves at Sayers in the car.


        Sayers sits on a bench, picking at a sack lunch.  After a
        moment, Loengard appears carrying an envelope.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Okay.  It's got the signed
                          affidavit.  The material is in the
                        specimen bag.  Everything's here.

                                        LOENGARD
                        You know, you don't have to do
                        this.

                                        SAYERS
                        Of course I do.  We both know it.

        Sayers takes the envelope, kisses Loengard.

                                        SAYERS (CONT'D)
                        Wish me luck.

        Loengard takes a look at Sayers, standing before him.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Hey ... you know what I love best
                        about you?

                          Everything.

        Sayers flashes him a quick smile, then musters her
        determination and heads for the White House.


        A black limousine pulls into the circular driveway.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        Finally the news came down that the
                          President's brother, Attorney
                        General Robert Kennedy, wanted to
                        meet me.  As I was being driven to
                        his house, I realized that he and I
                        now had something in common.  We
                        knew a secret that would bond our
                        lives together as long as we both
                        lived.

        Loengard exits, escorted by a Secret Service agent.  An AIDE
        approaches, asks the agent:

                                        AIDE
                        Were you followed?

      The agent shakes his head.  The aide turns to Loengard.

                                        AIDE (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for coming.  This way.

      The aide takes off and Loengard follows.


        Loengard, nervous but determined, is escorted by the aide.

                                        AIDE
                        Wait here.  I'll get him.

      The aide disappears inside.  Loengard looks around at his
        surroundings, sees a weathered football.  He tosses it in
      his hands until he is startled by:

                                        RFK
                        Mister Loengard.

        It's the aide with BOBBY (RFK) KENNEDY.  As the aide fades
        back, Loengard puts the football back where he found it.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Sir.  It's an honor.

                                        RFK
                        The honor's mine.  If what I'm
                          beginning to understand is true,
                        you've put a lot on the line to get
                        here.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT 99.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Well, sir, there's a lot at stake.

                                        RFK
                        Let's take a walk.

      RFK begins to lead Loengard away, futher guaranteeing their
        privacy.

        ANOTHER ANGLE

                        We had the sample analyzed.  It's
                        as advertised.  We've checked out
                        certain elements of your story --
                          discretely, of course -- and it
                        seems to hold together.  I must
                        tell you, it has made it rather
                        hard to concentrate on such mundane

                        What is the President going to do?

                                        RFK
                        John, the President has less than a
                        year in his term. He's got to get
                          re-elected if he's going to do
                          anything.  The second term.  That's
                        when we get this out.

                                        LOENGARD
                        I can't stay in Majestic, can I?

                                        RFK
                        You have to.  The President feels
                        he needs someone like you on the
                        inside.  You'll be contacted from
                        time to time until then.  Will you
                        do that for us?

        MYSTERY POV - LOENGARD & RFK

        Still talking.  Seen from across the river as Loengard nods
      his agreement.


        Loengard and Sayers run to the Chevy, jump inside and peel
      out into the street.


      An entirely non-descript, non-chain establishment in the
        Georgia countryside.  The Chevy is parked outside.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT102.


        Driving in silence, Loengard and Sayers speed down a country
        highway.  Loengard grips the wheel while Sayers stares out
      the window, face red and puffy, but crying no more tears.

                                        OLD LOENGARD (V.O.)
                        Bach told us we were in a war, that
                        people died in wars.  Well, the
                        first shots had just been fired.

                                        SAYERS
                        We killed the President, John.

        Loengard continues staring straipht ahead.  His reply is
        hard and emphatic.

                                        LOENGARD
                        No.

                                        SAYERS
                        We told him and now he's dead.

                                        LOENGARD
                        Kim, you can't know what we know
                        and do nothing.

                                        SAYERS
                        They can't win, John.  We can't let
                        them.

        Loengard looks over at Sayers, appreciating her courage.

                                        LOENGARD
                        We have the thing they fear the
                        most, you know.

        Sayers looks over to Loengard who stares hard at the future
        ahead.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        The truth.

      As they look at each other, Sayers gives a shiver.

                                        LOENGARD (CONT'D)
                        Are you cold?  You want my jacket?

                                        SAYERS
                        Just put your arm around me.

        Loengard places his arm around Sayers, pulls her close.        DARK SKIESWRITER'S DRAFT104.


      As the Chevy moves through the countryside, we hear the Dark
        Skies Theme -- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH (written by Stephen
        Stills, performed for this series by Chris Isaak) -- as it
        foreshadows the music and the times ahead for the series.

                        There's something happening here.
