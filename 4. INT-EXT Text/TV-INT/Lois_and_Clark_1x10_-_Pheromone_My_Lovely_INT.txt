
	Clark is deep in Morpheus' arms until the piercing RING of
	his alarm clock jerks him awake. Instinctively he reaches
	over to pound the SNOOZE button, but instead FLATTENS THE
	ALARM CLOCK INTO A PANCAKE.  Clark looks at his
	handiwork, shakes his head, then jumps out of bed and
	into his closet, exiting moment's later, fully dressed
	for work.



	Clark makes himself a super breakfast. First, he takes
	two eggs, cracks them open, throws them on a plate and
	FRIES THEM WITH HIS HEAT VISION.  Next, he reaches in
	the fridge, takes out a full gallon of milk, downs it,
	then tosses it out of the window above his sink.



	Clark finishes his breakfast, hears the sound of GARBAGE
	TRUCKS in the distance, then a look of horror comes over
	his face as he remembers... what has he done?  He MOVES
	INTO HYPER-SPEED OUT THE DOOR.



	The usual suspects convene at the early morning staff
	meeting.  All are tired grumpy, badly in need of
	caffeine.  PERRY takes that first important sip, winces as
	he swallows.

	The newsroom has been transformed into a veritable

	As the models move in and out of the crowd, they spray

	everywhere, snapping pictures.  Lois, Clark and Jimmy
	huddle outside Perry's office.  Lois philosophizes, while

	Suddenly, without warning, a Woman, dressed in a "peasant"

	starts singing.  "I'm just a hunka hunka burning love..."
	It's not long before other apartment doors start opening

	She continues to wander.  Suddenly, she sees something,

	Takes a pair of scissors from her drawer, cuts out the

	From it she removes a large bottle filled with liquid.
	There are lots of these bottles.  The label reads:

	and begins filling it from the bottles.  Daru wanders by,
	licks at a drip on the floor, and MEOWS.

		Not now, Daru.

	She picks the cat up, locks her in her cage.  She then

	metal breaking, and a CRASH of shattered glass.  Miranda
	looks...

	The usual suspects convene for the staff meeting.  Things
