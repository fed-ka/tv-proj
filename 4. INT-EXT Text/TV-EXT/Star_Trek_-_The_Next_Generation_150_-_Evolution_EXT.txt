     star. 
 
 
     something in advanced genetics... lying flat on a lab 
     tabletop. The camera moves slowly along the table to 
     see the paraphernalia of a long night of studying -- 
     containers, microscope, some half-eaten new generation 
     pizza and an almost finished glass of milk... finding a 
     still hand... and moving up the arm to find WESLEY; 
     face flat on the table, eyes closed... and for a beat 
     we may wonder what's happened to him... but then -- 
 
         RIKER'S COM VOICE 
       Commander Riker to Ensign Crusher. 
 
     Wesley's eyes jerk open... head turns -- where am I, 
     omigod, I fell asleep.... 
 
         WESLEY 
        (hoarse) 
       Go ahead.... 
 
             INTERCUT: 
 
 
     hurtles toward the fire arc across space and... 
 
             FADE OUT.

     As before, the ship is flying out of control. 
 
 
     The engines reverse. The ship stabilizes.

     The guard hears... moves to the door... but it doesn't 
     open... and as the yelling continues... the guard 
     forces the door open and Stubbs staggers out, falls 
     unconscious.

       his influence to arrange the 
       designation of planet Kavis-Alpha-Four 
       as the new home of the Nanite
