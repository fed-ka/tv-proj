               Barbrady is driving in his car as a COPS film crew shoots 
               him. Everything is shot in COPS style. A TITLE at the bottom 
               reads 'Officer Barbrady South Park P.D.'

                         Well, being an officer of the peace 
                         means a lot of things. It's a hard 
                         job, but then again, I'm a hard man. 
                         A lot of people think that in a small 
                         town there isn't a lot for the law 
                         to do, well, they're wrong.

               Barbrady throws on his lights and speeds away.

                         There! You see! This could be a bank 
                         robbery! Or possibly even a MURDER!

                                     BARBRADY
                         God dammit!


               We see his point of view as he looks at the note found on 
               the ground.

               It is written in Greek.

               Barbrady sighs deeply, then crumples up the note and speeds 
               off.


                                     BARBRADY

                                     BARBRADY
                         Well, nobody can say for sure. No 
                         motive has yet been established.

                         ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! I CAN'T READ!!!

               Silence. Barbrady's voice reverberates for a second. Everyone 
               else stands in shock.

                         you happy now? You pushed and you 
                         pushed and now you all know my

               Barbrady storms off Silence. Nobody says anything.

               Garrison stands at the head of the class.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Now children, we have a new student

                         Officer Barbrady.

               Barbrady is sitting in the middle of the kids, sticking out 
               like a sore thumb.

                         Okay, now since our focus has been 
                         on reading, let's review some of the 
                         basics.

               Barbrady raises his hand.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Yes, what is it?

                         I need to go poopies.

               Garrison thinks.

                         Officer Barbrady, in school we go to 
                         the bathroom before and after class.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?!

                                     GARRISON
                         Now, does anyone have any suggestions 
                         where we should begin with Officer 
                         Barbrady?

                         How about a brain transplant?

                                     GARRISON
                         Now Kyle, let's be supportive of our 
                         new student give him the nurturing 
                         environment he needs to thrive. Now, 
                         I'm going to write a sentence, and I 
                         want us all to help Officer Barbrady 
                         read it.

               Garrison writes a sentence on the blackboard; 'Oprah Winfrey 
               has huge knockers.'

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Uh... O... O...

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         BZZZT!!! WRONG!! Try again, dumbass!!

               Garrison slaps his knee and laughs.

                                     GARRISON
                              (drying his eyes)
                         Okay, okay... Maybe we should try 
                         something a little easier. We can 
                         work our way up to the hard ones --

               He writes 'The hat is red.' on the board.

                                     GARRISON
                         Go ahead, Barbrady. Don't be scared.

                                     BARBRADY
                         Uh....... O.....

                                     GARRISON
                         BZZZZZ!!!!! DER!! DID YOU HEAR THAT 
                         MR. HAT?!!!

               Garrison laughs so hard he falls on the floor. He just laughs 
               and laughs and laughs.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Did you kids actually learn how to 
                         read this way?

                         No, we just fake it to shut him up.

               Garrison is up at the front, still laughing and tearing up.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, okay, I'm sorry... I'm 
                         sorry..Let's try again...


               The kids and Barbrady sit in their desks.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Now children, I hope you all had a 
                         good time reading your books, and

               Cartman looks around nervously.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Eric, why don't you go first.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ooh...

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         What's the matter, Eric? Are you not 
                         prepared again?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm prepared!

               Cartman storms to the front.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Hands behind back)
                         For my book report, I read 'The Lion 
                         The Witch and the Wardrobe'. It was 
                         very very good. Have you read it Mr. 
                         Garrison?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         No, I can't say that I have.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Lighting up)
                         Oh, good!
                              (Happily)
                         In 'The Lion, The Witch and the 
                         Wardrobe', a bunch of, uh, hippies 
                         walk around and paint stuff. They 
                         eat lunch, and then they find a 
                         magical... camel, which they have to 
                         eat to stay alive. And that's pretty 
                         much it, I give it a B minus.

               Cartman smiles broadly.

                         And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit 
                         down.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Aw, DAMMIT!

               The kids all laugh merrily.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't 
                         you give us your book report?

               Barbrady walks up to the front.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         I have just finished reading the 
                         heart warming novel 'Go Dog Go'. I 
                         found it a compelling and disturbing 
                         look at the canine psyche'. If I may 
                         read a passage:

               Barbrady pulls out the book.

                              (Reading)
                         Big dog..... Little dog..... A red 
                         dog..... On a.....

               The kids blink.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Well, anyway, I don't want to give 
                         away the ending, but I will say that 
                         it spirals toward an incredible twist 
                         turn that parallels my own life.

               Barbrady heads back to his desk.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Thank you, Officer Barbrady, that 
                         was a very good book report, indeed. 
                         I'll give you an A.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Hooray!!

                         Aw, just give us the damn book, 
                         fruitcake!

               The driver hands over the book. Barbrady opens it.

                                     KYLE
                         What's it say?

                                     BARBRADY
                         It says 'Mah... Mah...' Uh, what's 
                         this word?

                         A pond. Hey, maybe that means Stark's 
                         Pond.

                                     BARBRADY
                         That's quick thinking, deputy! Let's 
                         get to Stark's pond immediately!


               Barbrady is alone at a large desk with a huge book in front 
               of him.

                                     BARBRADY

                         Oh, God damn reading is lame!

               Stan and Kyle walk up.

                                     KYLE
                         How's it going, dude?

                                     BARBRADY
                         Terrible. I give up. I'm not fit to 
                         be a cop!!

               Barbrady breaks down crying.

                                     STAN
                         Come on dude, it's not that hard!

                                     BARBRADY
                         IT IS TOO!!

                                     KYLE
                         Just read the sentence.

                         Pet... Wait a minute...

               A flashback balloon of Mr. Garrison pops up.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Conjugate the verb... Conjugate the

                         Yes, conjucate the verb.

               DRAMATIC MUSIC! Barbrady stands up.
