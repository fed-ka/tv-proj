CLOSE ON -- A Molotov cocktail SPINNING mid-air in slow 
motion... Almost beautiful the way it lights the night sky... 
Until it CRASHES into a POLICE VAN... EXPLODING in a ball of 
fire...   

An Illinois field becomes a BATTLEGROUND.  Reeking of manure 
and burnt gunpowder.      

A line of NATIONAL GUARDSMEN stand in riot gear.  Weapons 
readied.  Freezing.  Panting.  Marinating in blood and sweat.  
But holding their ground.   

Through a CLOUD OF TEAR GAS -- A wave of CREATURES stampede 
towards them.  They are men, yet not men.  These are the 
Orions.  Otherworldly.  Scattering in every direction.    

The LEAD GUARDSMAN gives his men a nod and a HAILSTORM OF 
BULLETS STRIKE THE ORIONS.  We track one ORION, who is hit in 
the forehead.  He falls hard with a sickening THUD.  Eyes 
wide open.  Staring right at us.  And as blood drips down his 
face we see ONE SMALL BLACK DOT UNDER EACH OF HIS EYES.  And 
STRANGE MARKS, like tattoos, around his NECK and FACE... 

The guardsmen work to quickly reload their weapons -- But 
 too late for them.  As the Orions continue to charge, it s
COLLIDING with the guardsmen, CRUSHING them in the charge... 

But the Orions are soon met by a greater foe -- TANKER 
TRUCKS.  DELIVERING ROUND AFTER ROUND OF FIRE -- One by one 
the Orions begin to drop -- OUTMATCHED...

WHEN ACROSS THE FIELD -- we zero in on TWO WIDE EYES, peeking 
out from behind a tree.  This is ROMAN (6).  An Orion.  But 
an innocent.  A lost puppy.  He spots a clearing and rushes 
across the field and into the night air... as we CUT TO:   


A curious Emery exits the house, walking with a flashlight...


This is SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD EMERY.  Out for a morning jog.  Ear-
buds in, pushing herself HARD.  Like she s being chased.  As 
she PASSES through a peaceful suburban neighborhood we hear: 

REPORTER (V.O.)

outside of Chicago not long after

permitted outside its walls without 
authorization and they were forced 
to obey a mandatory curfew...

Emery exits her house.  Takes a deep breath as she closes the

Strong, but uncomfortable with the media spotlight.

DEENA STILES
Principal Weston, I see in addition 
to your own security, ORC has called

security, tries to smile through his frustration...

SAUL
Safety is key.  But I will not let 
 it interfere with the students

And Saul is suddenly cut off by an angry PROTESTOR, who jumps 
in front of the camera, waving a black flag decorated with a 
RED HAWK -- the symbol of the anti-Orion movement.     

PROTESTOR
They belong with their own kind!

We pick up Lukas and Emery, mid-conversation --

The ROAR OF THE CROWD begins to rise as GUARDS struggle to 
hold the protestors back.  One HECKLER breaks through and 
tries to JUMP in front of the bus, forcing it to SLAM on the 
breaks.  Guards TACKLE the heckler as he desperately fights 
to break free... As he is carried away, the back door  
opens...

One by one, the Orion Nine file out of the bus.  Stone-faced 
and silent, they do not acknowledge the protestors.  

Roman makes his way towards the entrance to school, followed 
by his sweet, younger sister SOPHIA (15).  He eyes the 
RAUCOUS CROWD.  Some fearful, others enraged.  When he 
catches a QUICK GLIMPSE of someone walking just beyond the

As they disappear behind the camp wall --


A club fair.  Dozens of tables are set up in the courtyard, 
each for a different club or sport.  Emery sits at a table 
with a sign that reads HEARTS & CRAFTS.  Lukas approaches.

gets up to retrieve it.  As she reaches for the pen, another

Lukas pulls up in his car in front of the hospital, where 
Emery and Julia wait.  He rolls down his window.

GATE, the full weight of this bold and potentially dangerous 
move now hits Emery.  She turns to Julia. 

EMERY (CONT D)

looks like?  

Julia nods.  Emery inserts her father s ID card and the gate 
swings open.  MOTION SENSOR LIGHTS fill the DAMP, EMPTY

SHIPPING CONTAINER BUILDINGS.  SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are 
 not quite the Warsaw Ghetto, perched on every corner.  It s

bicycles rebuilt from salvaged parts... 

LAUGHTER turns their heads sharply -- An ORION WOMAN with 
sexy curves chatting up a GUARD at the bottom of a stairwell. 
Emery and Julia keep their heads bowed as they walk quickly 
to avoid the guard, who clearly has other things on his mind.  
They turn a corner, hurrying along to another part of camp...

But as Julia reaches into her pocket and pulls out CASH, a 
CROWD OF CURIOUS ORIONS flock to the girls, eager to make a

Emery and Julia trade a look.  Julia goes for it --    

JULIA

The Shifty Orion eyes them.  Finally shrugs, a sale s a sale:

The Shifty Orion leads the girls to another booth, but the 
Elderly Orion steps in, threatens --

ELDERLY ORION
Ghaj en klor!     

The Elderly Orion CLAWS at him.  He retaliates, SHOVING her 
 table.  The COMMOTION has invited back into a GRUFF ORION S
attention from other ORIONS, who now surround the group --

When a BLARING SIREN is heard, the Gruff Orion calls out --

GRUFF ORION 
REVSOLO!

ORIONS SCATTER in every direction and the girls know what 
this means -- The guards are coming!

Now panicked and full of dread, Emery and Julia attempt to 
make their way out of this chaos, as as HAND grabs Emery  -- 
Roman, pushing his way through the crowd --

Emery smiles wide.  Julia clocks her excitement.  Warns...  

JULIA (CONT D)
Just be careful.  You left your 
dragon at home...  

As Julia climbs inside the car, Emery turns back, taking one 
last look back at the camp.  Filled with anticipation.  
Longing.  But for an Orion?... As we CUT TO:


Drake meets with Teri and a few other MALE ORIONS.

ROMAN

Nox smiles at his son.  Later, we find --


 words still Roman walking toward his house, his father s
ringing in his ear, when Teri approaches.  

ROMAN
Not now, Teri.

attacked by those guards?  When we 
arrived here?    oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        48.


ROMAN
Of course I remember.  They left me 
a permanent scar as a parting gift.

TERI
It took you six months to learn how 
to walk again.  Three months to 
speak.  And even then your voice was 
barely above a whisper.  Me and 
Drake found this junky old 
wheelbarrow.  We d carry you around 
in it, race each other through camp.

You loved that.

Teri, turning serious now... 

TERI
I saw you last night.  With that 
girl, Emery.  

ROMAN
I was keeping her out of trouble.  

TERI
You really wanna keep her safe?  
Then stay away.  Because if the 
guards catch you together, this time 
 not going to be as your punishment s
much fun as a six-month stint in a 
dirty wheelbarrow...

defeated.  She catches up with him... 

TERI (CONT D)

making connections with humans.  If 
all goes according to plan... Soon 
they re going to be the ones behind 
these walls.   

Roman stops walking...

ROMAN
What are you talking about?

TERI

rest of the Gwans talk about in 
their Monday meetings.  I listen in.  oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        49.


ROMAN
No offense, Teri, but your father is 
an idiot.  They found him hiding in 
a Porta-Potty on Arrival Day. 

TERI

prick.

And she walks away.  But turns back for: 

TERI (CONT D)
Oh, and by the way:  Drake and them 
went after that kid, Eric.  

ROMAN
What do you mean?

TERI
 going after him hard at some They re
party tonight.

Off Roman s panicked expression, we CUT TO --


Roman hustling through a sketchy area of camp.  Abandoned, 
boarded-up BUILDINGS.  FIGURES in the shadows.  Roman keeps 
his head down, careful to avoid the surveillance cameras... 

At the end of the street: A LANTERN hangs outside a DOOR.  A 
sign on the door reads: HOUSE OF CARDS.  Roman enters --


Roman climbing the ladder UP TO GROUND LEVEL, now on the 
 wall.  He is past the point of no other side of the camp s
return, resigned to his decision.  As the PULSING BEAT OF 
ELECTRONIC MUSIC takes us to --   


A TWO-STORY ABANDONED FARMHOUSE in the middle of a field.  No 
other homes or lights for miles.  


 CRONIES has been STRIPPED DOWN and TIED to a One of Eric s
scarecrow pole, his BRIEFS stuffed inside his mouth, his eyes 
wide with fear.  Eric and the stunned partygoers file out.

ERIC
Who did this?

When DRAKE and a few of the other ORIONS step out of the 
cornfields.  GASPS.  WHISPERS.  A few KIDS just turn and run.  

DRAKE
We just want to have a talk with 
Eric. 

Eric steps up to Drake.  Unafraid.  The two boys stare each 
other down.  Close.  Very close.   

ERIC
This ends tonight.

DRAKE
For once we agree.   oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        52.


Suddenly DRAKE HEAD BUTTS ERIC -- sending him FLYING 
BACKWARDS. As Drake hovers over Eric, prepared to pounce, TWO 
ARMS WRAP AROUND DRAKE FROM BEHIND -- 

As Roman YANKS him back and away -- 

DRAKE (CONT D)
What are you doing here, Roman?  

ROMAN

you for breaking curfew?  

The humans are watching them argue... Roman spots Emery... 
Sees Grayson take her arm... 

But then - in the distance we hear POLICE SIRENS -- SHIT. 

TAYLOR

COPS!

And it s a SUDDEN MAD SCRAMBLE -- PARTYGOERS bolting in every 
direction.  In the melee, Emery gets KNOCKED over.  Almost 
trampled.  When a HAND reaches out for her... It s Roman.

Grayson finds Emery...

Emery follows Grayson to his Jeep.  Roman hesitates, but 
decides not to follow her... 

As Grayson, Emery, Eric and Taylor climb in... Emery can see 
Roman, eyeing the SCRAMBLING TEENS as they bail.  He is the 
only one left, as everyone else has jumped into cars and 
peeled off.  Roman scans the field -- Which way should he go?

Emery calls out, waving him over --

TAYLOR
Are you nuts?

Hurry up, Rochelle!

Rochelle rushes up to the Jeep, climbing in the back.

EMERY
But do you know what the cops will 
do to him? 

ERIC
His problem.  Not ours.   

An appalled Emery looks to Grayson -- but he knows he s been 
overruled...

Emery considers her options - Should she choose the safety 
and comfort of her new friends?  Or be bold and stand up for 
what she believes is right?  The SIRENS are getting closer...

 about to take off, she makes her choice, And as they re
JUMPING OUT OF THE BACK OF THE JEEP --

But Emery is racing for Roman... Eric shouts to Grayson:

ACT SIX


Emery and Roman RUSH through the cornfield, breathless...

EMERY
We should be fine here. 

They slow down.  Roman eyes Emery as she catches her breath.
