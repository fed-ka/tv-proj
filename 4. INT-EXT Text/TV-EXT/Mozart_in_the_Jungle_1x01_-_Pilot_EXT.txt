      The pouring rain.  Taxis honk and swerve around double-parked 
      town cars.

      Musicians litter the alley, smoking cigarettes, and taking  
      swigs from shared flasks. 

      Cynthia walks up to an older man, BRUNO, who is holding a 
      large upright bass as he manages to flag a taxi.

                                    CYNTHIA
                    Hey sexy, you going downtown?

                                  BRUNO
                    Sorry, I m going up, Cyn. 

                                    CYNTHIA
                    Shit, I gotta be in Times Square in 
                    20 minutes.

                                  BRUNO
                      Two-a-nights.  Ouch!  Here, you 
                    take this one.

      Cynthia gives Bruno a kiss and a hug, then hops in the taxi.

      Bruno admires her perfect body as she hikes up her black 
      evening gown a bit to step into the back with her instrument.

      PAN TO REVEAL Thomas who is also taking a moment to watch 
      Cynthia s sexy ass.  

      Sharon stands impassively behind, holding an umbrella over 
      him.

                                  THOMAS
                    Bruno, she played you beautifully.                                                                                      9.


                                  BRUNO
                            (smiling)
                      Bravissima.

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Thomas, darling--over here!

      But Thomas doesn t notice--he is still staring at Cynthia.  

      Sharon taps Thomas on the shoulder.

                                  SHARON
                    Sir, your wife is trying to get 
                    your attention.

      A matronly woman, 60s, waves a bejewelled hand out the window 
      of a Town Car.  Thomas  face tightens as he gets into the 
      car.  A Chauffeur shuts the door.

      Sharon raps on the tinted window.  Thomas rolls it down.

                                  SHARON (CONT D)
                          (holding out the papers)
                    Mr. Pembridge.  Please.  They will 
                    need a quote from you.

      Thomas snatches it.  The car pulls away, gets about ten feet, 
      screeches to a halt.  He rolls down the window.

                                  THOMAS
                    What s this?!

                                  SHARON
                    The press release is going out 
                    tonight.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The Imperial Theater marquee glows with: 

       STYX s Oedipus Rocks!  

                                                                            Cut to:



      Hailey approaches an industrial looking building in a sketchy 
      neighborhood.



      Hailey, drunk and embarrassed, sits outside on the fire 
      escape.  Lizzie comes out and joins her.                                                                                    24.


                                  LIZZIE
                          (urgently)
                    OMG.  How do I look?  Tranny 
                      trainwreck?

                                  HAILEY
                    You look fine. Totally fine. Why?

                                  LIZZIE
                    Those dancers are here!  One of 
                      them--Joshua Merriweather--my 
                    friend says he s the hottest thing 
                    at Juilliard. 
                          (beat) 
                    I m going to seduce him.

      A knock on the window.  The two girls turn to find Joshua 
      poking his head out the window.  

                                  LIZZIE (CONT D)
                          (trying to cover)
                    ...so yeah, I was like,  It s been 
                    totes hard since my ex-boyfriend 
                    died... 

                                  JOSHUA
                    Mind if I join you?

      Joshua climbs out onto the fire escape.

                                  LIZZIE
                          (seductive)
                    Heya.  I m Lizzie, this is my 
                    place.  That s my roommate...

                                  JOSHUA
                    Hailey.  We met.

      Lizzie, taken aback, is instantly jealous.  

      Just then a drunk boy sticks his head out the window.

                                  DRUNK BOY
                    Lizzie.  You better get in here...
                          (shameful pause)
                    Um, it s kind of an emergency. 
                    Vomit in your victrola.

                                  LIZZIE
                    Fuck, that s an antique!
                          (to Joshua, all flirty)
                    The duties of the host beckon... I 
                    won t be long.                                                                                    25.


      Joshua smiles, watching her go and rolls his eyes to Hailey.  
      He removes a one-hitter from his coat and takes a deep hit.

                                  JOSHUA
                          (exhaling)
                    Want some?

                                  HAILEY
                    No thanks.  Smoke is the enemy.

      Hailey shivers.  Joshua wafts it away.  

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)
                    It s freezing.

                                  JOSHUA
                    Here.

      He unwraps the scarf from his neck and puts it around Hailey.

                                  JOSHUA (CONT D)
                    You play amazingly well.

                                  HAILEY
                    Thanks. 

      Awkward pause. 

                                  JOSHUA
                     North Carolina, huh?

      Hailey nods.  

                                  JOSHUA (CONT D)
                    I m from Nashville.  Kind of close. 
                          (beat)
                    Pretty overwhelming place, huh?

      Hailey looks up.  A kindred spirit.

                                  HAILEY
                          (gently)
                    Totally. I feel like all I do is 
                    spend my time doing is figuring out 
                    how to make money, how to be a good 
                    roommate, a good daughter, a good 
                      girlfriend-- 
                          (a moment between them)
                    Like none of it s about the art. 
                    When I m successful--

      She drifts off.                                                                                    26.


                                  JOSHUA
                    You think it will be easier?

      A beat.  Hailey considers this darkly.

                                  HAILEY
                    It better be.

                                  JOSHUA 
                          (meaningfully)
                    I always wondered, do your lips 
                    hurt after playing like that?

      Hailey is uneasy.  He is clearly hitting on her, but in a 
      very sweet way.  He moves in closer and puts his fingers on 
      her lips.

                                  HAILEY 
                    They used to.  Now they are kind of 
                    used to being used I guess.

      Joshua leans in and kisses Hailey softly.  Then, interrupting 
      the moment, Lizzie sticks her out head the window.  

      Joshua and Hailey pull apart.  Hailey is very embarrassed.

                                  LIZZIE
                          (still jealous)
                    Sorry to break that up, but Hailey,  
                    I think Hank had an accident on 
                    your bed as well. 
                          (to Joshua)
                    My couch.  

      Hailey stands up quickly and bumps her head on the fire 
      escape.

                                  HAILEY
                    Shit!

      She hurriedly gives Joshua back his scarf and goes inside. 
      Lizzie comes out and casually sits next to Joshua.  Close.

                                  LIZZIE 
                          (forced flirtation)
                    It s cold outside of my apartment 
                    huh?
                          (re: the scarf)
                    Mind if I borrow that?

                                                                            CUT TO:
      BLACK

      The sound of a ringtone: Pachalbel s Canon.                                                                                    27.



      Hailey races up the steps--two at a clip.  She passes a 
      HOMELESS MUSICIAN playing the violin. The sight stops Hailey 
      for a moment dead in her tracks.  She shakes her head in 
      dismay.

      Then ducks under a canopy and through the stage door.

                                                                            Cut to:
