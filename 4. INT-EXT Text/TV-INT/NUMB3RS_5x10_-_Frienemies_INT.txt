      A high-end LAPTOP COMPUTER on a desk in the dark.  A 
       Southwestern Charter High  screensaver bounces across the 
      screen.

      BEYOND -- LAPTOPS in standby or screensaver mode. Cabled to 
      desks and tables.  A brand new and well-funded computer lab.

      SOUND of a lock breaking.  Metal on metal.  A door knob HITS 
      the floor. SNEAKERS scuffle in.  Loud WHISPERS.  A CABLE-
      CUTTER in gloved hands. SNAP.  A laptop is yanked from its 
      cords.  Another and another.  Stuffed into backpacks. 

      CLACK.  Sudden, bright, blinding LIGHT.  Like someone turned 
      on the sun.  Beaming straight into our eyes.

      FIVE TEEN BOYS (Latino, black, white) scurry to escape. DARK 
      FIGURES behind the light.  A megaphone VOICE booms --.

                                  VOICE
                    GET ON THE GROUND.  DO NOT MOVE.

      But the ROBBERS scramble to get out of the room.


      The ROBBERS escape into a dark corridor, met by BOOMING 
      EXPLOSIONS.  Flash-bangs.  Light, smoke.  They flee around a 
      corner, run into more EXPLOSIONS. They run for an OPEN DOOR. 


      The ROBBERS scurry into a vast dark space, hear the DOOR SLAM 
      behind them.  They realize too late they ve been trapped. 

      More BRIGHT LIGHTS in their eyes. Again an amplified VOICE:



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     2. 

      CONTINUED:33

                                  VOICE
                    GET ON THE FLOOR.  NOW.

      The ROBBERS reluctantly fall to the floor.

                                  VOICE (cont d)
                    HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEADS.

      The Robbers comply -- quickly DARK FIGURES move among them 
      and zip their hands and feet into plastic restraints. DUCT 
      TAPE is applied to their mouths.  ROBBER #1 cranes his head -- 
      catches a glimpse of a T-Shirt with a symbol: a circle with 
      an arrow pointing up. 

                                  ROBBER #1
                          (angry/scared)
                    You ain t cops!

      The figure in the T-shirt (CLAYTON CASWELL) answers.  

                                    VOICE/CLAYTON
                    No.  We re not cops.

                                  ROBBER #1
                    What the hell you doing?

      Clayton bends down to speak into his ear.

                                    VOICE/CLAYTON
                      Protecting the innocent.  Punishing 
                    the guilty.

      The Robbers are terrified, expecting the worst. But the DARK 
      FIGURES leave. Lights go OFF, doors slam -- locks CLACK.


      DON walks with DAVID into the gymnasium. ROBBERS still on the 
      floor, tape and restraints removed. LAPD OFFICERS stand over 
      them. A Crime Scene TECH takes a photo of a SPRAY-PAINTED 
      MESSAGE:  Crime Prevention By Vanguard.  A painted version of 
      the symbol seen on the T-shirt: circle with the arrow.

                                  DAVID
                    Now this -- I haven t seen before.

      NIKKI steps away from an LAPD officer to meet Don.

                                  DON
                    What s up?  Your friends at LAPD 
                    need help with a simple B and E?

                    B and Es they can handle just fine.  
                    But they do need help tracking down 
                    a group of vigilantes.

                                  DAVID
                      Vigilantes -- that explains the

                                  NIKKI
                    The vigilantes ambushed them. High-

                                  DAVID
                    Maybe one of the vigilantes  -- or

                                  DON
                    Or a student s.

      David peers at the phone -- then over at the ROBBERS.

                                  DAVID
                    If they can t tell us anything, 
                    this might. 


      FBI TECH MATT LI examines the insides of the SMART PHONE.

                                  MATT
                    Someone scraped out the MIN and the ESN.

                                  COLBY
                      Translation.

                                  MATT
                    The MIN is the phone number, the ESN 
                    is the electronic serial number.

                                  COLBY
                    So this wasn t dropped on the floor 
                    by a student.

                                  MATT
                    Getting rid of the phone number is 
                    easy.  Getting rid of the ESN -- is 
                    supposed to be impossible.

                                  COLBY
                    Better put a call into the FBI s 
                    favorite mathematician.


      David stands over TWO ROBBERS.

                                  DAVID
                    You guys know math?  You can add 
                    right?  Add up the cost of the 
                    equipment you were trying to steal, 
                    it s grand larceny.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     5.

                                  DAVID
                    Oh yeah?  Who told you that?

      No response.
                                  DAVID (cont d)
                    I m looking at you guys, I don t 
                    see masterminds.  But you knew 
                    where the computers were, you knew 
                    how to get past the alarm.  I m 
                    thinking someone helped you out. 

      Robber #2 gives him a quick furtive glance.

                                  ROBBER #1
                    Keep your mouth shut.

                    Third round with these guys.  Never 
                    figured the FBI couldn t get a

      CLOSE ON SMART PHONE:  AMITA locates the SIM CHIP inside.

                                    CHARLIE
                    It s also known as a  cold ghosting 
                    attack  or  iceman attack.   

                                  AMITA
                    When I shut off this phone and remove 
                    the memory chip, all the data stored 
                    on it will be lost instantly.

      Amita turns off the phone -- grabs a can of COMPRESSED AIR, 
      holds it upside down and sprays the CHIP. 

                                  AMITA (cont d)
                    But if I cool the chip first, like this, 
                    the data remains readable -- sometimes 
                    for as long as several minutes. 

      Amita extracts the SIM card with a pair of tweezers -- then 
      quickly inserts the SIM card into a CARD READER that is 
      connected to her COMPUTER.  The PHONE DATA jumps on screen. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    You got it.

      Charlie scans the data for the MIN number.

                    Wow.  That actually worked.

                                  AMITA
                    Of course.

      Charlie writes the MIN number on a post-it.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Have the FBI match that number with 
                    a cell carrier s ESN and --

                    -- we get the name and address of 
                    the owner, and then we go get him.    


      A CUSTOMER leaves. A YOUNG CHINESE MAN at the counter.  He s 
      distracted by movement outside, catches sight of a GUN.  He 
      reaches beneath the counter, pulls up a bat -- just as David 
      and Nikki burst in with TWO FBI OFFICERS.  David takes a 
      quick bead on him.

                    Need to find the rest of these guys

                    Vic Tooner.  Suspected of dozens of 
                    crimes, including murder. LAPD

                    crazy. Murdered one of his own 
                      lieutenants for driving the same

                    He uses kids because if they get 
                    caught, they re back on the streets 
                    in a few weeks.

      MARSHALL PENFIELD in front of a large group of graduate 
      students -- lecturing.  Charlie quietly slips in the back.

                                  MARSHALL
                    From set theory's inception, some  
                    have argued it s a game that 
                    includes elements of fantasy. 
                      Wittgenstein questioned how 
                      Zermelo Fraenkel set theory handled 
                      infinities. Errett Bishop dismissed 
                    it as "God's mathematics, which we 
                    should leave for God to do."

      Marshall spies Charlie in the back.

                    So maybe something got overlooked.   

      Something on a photo catches Nikki s attention.

                    Good thinking, Granger.  They did 
                    miss something.

      Colby turns to see Nikki holding a photo for him to see -- 

      ON THE PHOTO -- on a wall, what looks like gang graffiti.

                                  COLBY
                    What am I looking at? Gang signs?  

                                  NIKKI
                    Idaho, I spent a year on a LAPD 
                    gang task force. And I ve never 
                    seen anything like this.

      OFF the GRAFFITI -- which is remarkably complex and abstract.


      CLOSE ON:  PHOTO of GRAFFITI.

                    That mean anything to you?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Not immediately.  But it could be a 
                    subset within the superset.

      Charlie drops the PHOTO on his desk near Penfield -- who s 
      lazily leafing through a FBI FILE.

                                  NIKKI
                    And for those of us who don t speak math?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m talking about Set Theory.  

      Charlie draws to OVERLAPPING CIRCLES on the chalkboard.

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    Say this circle represents objects 
                    visible in the night sky, this one 
                    is objects that generate light. 
                    Where they overlap is a subset -- 
                    objects visible in the night sky 
                    that generate light, like a star.

                    own show on PBS?

                                    CHARLIE
                    The big question in this case is:  
                    How do the vigilantes know where 
                    the robbery crews will strike?  For 
                    this to happen there must be a 
                    hidden set common to both groups.

      Charlie draws a DOTTED-LINE CIRCLE within the two circles.

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    That s where Marshall s Deep 
                    Current theory comes in -- it looks 
                    for sets that are undetected.  
                    Think of patterns in crowds --

      As Charlie is talking and drawing on the board -- we PUSH IN -

      Enter Audience Vision:

      His drawing morphs into a shifting shape, which morphs into a 
      large crowd in a public place. (This can be quite abstract.)  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont d)
                    Crowds move in general patterns, 
                    but relatively minor events in 
                    specific areas --

      A BARRICADE appears in one area, people go around it, or turn 
      back. Making new patterns through the entire crowd.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont d)
                    -- can change the overall patterns 
                    for everyone.  Even if most never  
                    see what created the change.

                    An accurate assessment, Marshall?

                    Amita, can you find the name of the 
                    person who wrote the code?  He 
                    might be the leader of Vanguard.  

      OFF Amita --


      Charlie and Larry talk.  Math on the boards.

                    Why do I let Marshall get to me?

                    Everyone has rivals.  Who they are

                    What does Marshall hating me say 
                    about me?

                                  LARRY
                    He doesn t hate you. What s that 
                    word Amita uses?

                                    CHARLIE
                       Frienemy. 

                                  LARRY
                    Yes, colleagues as well as rivals. 
                    You remind each other of a time in 
                    your careers when you felt less 
                    secure in your reputations.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What about you? Who sets you off?

                                  LARRY
                    This guy in my car club, Al McNabb. He 
                    covets my Ford. Says the leather s not 
                    restored to period standard, and the 
                    paint s wrong. Jealous bastard.  

                                    CHARLIE
                    You know who doesn t have a rival -- 
                    Don. Never heard him talk about 
                    anybody that way.

                                  LARRY
                    I think your brother s rival is of 
                      a different variety.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Meaning -- ?

                                  LARRY
                    He questions and challenges himself -- 
                    he is his own  frienemy,  so to speak. 
                    Perhaps that s why he s going to temple. 
                    As Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel said, 
                     The primary task of philosophy of 
                    religion is to discover the questions to 
                    which religion is an answer. 

      Charlie stares at Larry a beat.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Did my dad tell you that? About Don 
                    going to temple?

      Charlie s puzzled, just a little perturbed. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Gimme a break -- he told you, but

      Colby and David walk through the stacks of an engineering 
      library.  Grim looks on their faces.

                                  COLBY
                    What did Nikki say about Tooner? 
                    Smart, but crazy.  

      They come around a corner to an open STUDY ROOM where a 
      CAMPUS SECURITY MAN stands with a MAINTENANCE MAN. A partial 
      view of a HANGING BODY.  Wearing a Vanguard logo t-shirt. 

      A scrawled note pinned to the shirt. 

      On a table, a Ipod set up with tiny speakers playing softly.

      David and Colby stare, then look to each other. It s the 
      scene Tooner described.

                                  DAVID
                    Looks like the crazy part.

                    Mason Spellman, 19, physics major. 
                    ME estimates he was dead about 10 
                    hours before he was found.

                    In the engineering library. Pretty 
                    much like Tooner said, in general 
                    terms.

                      Especially since Spellman had a 
                    history of depression. There s no

                    This might scare the rest of

                    Tooner will kill them anyway.

                                  NIKKI
                    We d have found it. Tooner d make 
                    sure of that.

                    Enough of the  I don t know names 
                    crap.  You know Clayton Caswell.

                    He s gonna die. The rest of Vanguard with 
                    him.  Tooner s found a way to get to them.

                    Clayton can handle it --

                                  COLBY
                    This was all about a girl who died. 
                    I get why Clayton wants revenge

                    But what about the rest of you?  

                                  OLIVER
                    Clayton s the kind of guy -- when

                    makes you feel like you can make a 
                      difference, like you re part of

                    Yeah. Don t you?


      Charlie and Marshall. Charlie s got a grid written up on one 
      marker board.  Marshall s finished an expression on another.

      A computer screen flashes along, displaying a shifting grid 
      of data, then flashing to grid maps and overlays --

      (Math and graphics relates to a Hidden Set analysis of all 
      activities of the Vanguard and Tooner s crews.)

                    Would you like answers one through

                    on movement of merchandise -- and 
                    Vanguard mines Tooner s cell matrix 
                    subset.  If we set up derivatives --

                                    CHARLIE
                    We narrow the data set. It s

                    What else would you call this? 

                                  MARSHALL
                    Well then you started it.

                    Did too --  

      BEEP. An alarm from the computer. 

                                  MARSHALL (cont d)
                    What was that?

                    Ongoing analysis of the robberies 
                    and possible past targets.

      They go to stare at the screen.  A flashing segment on a map.

                                    MASHALL
                    It s a computer repair shop -- 
                      Vanguard s data said Tooner hit it. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    But no report of a break-in.  
                    That s an anomaly.  

                                  MARSHALL
                    Maybe it wasn t reported. We need 
                    to know for the data grid. Maybe 
                    Vanguard left its graffiti symbol.

      Don gets out his cell.


      On the back seat, Charlie s cell phone vibrates silently.

      IN THE FRONT SEAT

      Charlie and Marshall look out at the front of a COMPUTER 
      SALES AND REPAIR store.  The lights are on.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Looks open.

      He reaches back, grabs his cell. They get out.


      Charlie and Marshall push through the front door. A BELL 
      tinkles, but nobody s there. SOUNDS from the back.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Hello?  Anybody here?

      They walk to the back area -- TWO TEENS appear, take 
      computers and start to carry them out a back door. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Excuse us, we re looking for the

                    That would be me.

      They turn. They re face to face with Vic Tooner. He smiles.

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    How can I help you?

                                        ACT FOUR


      Charlie and Marshall stare at Vic Tooner.

                                  TOONER
                    You re here about a computer?

      He s acting the part of store manager.  Charlie goes with it.  
      As they talk, TEENS who are clearly part of Tooner s crew 
      continue to walk in and out taking computers.

                                    CHARLIE
                    We were expecting a call today 
                    about when we could pick up our 
                    system.  It s a -- compact 
                      supercomputer, very valuable. 

                                  TOONER
                      Supercomputer?

                                  MARSHALL
                    Yeah, yeah.  Eight serial CPUs, 
                      vector-processing --

                                  MARSHALL
                    It s our baby.  It can calculate 
                    the path of sub-atomic particles --

                    Or play 300 versions of Halo -- at 
                    the same time.

                                  MARSHALL
                    So when we didn t get the call, we 
                    came by to see what s up.

      IN CHARLIE S HAND -- his cellphone. He subtly moves a finger 
      over its face -- PUSHES A BUTTON.

                                  TOONER
                    Yeah, think I remember that one.

      Tooner pretends to scan the shelves. 

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    My partner processed that work

      Don s listening to his phone -- puzzled. 

                                  DON
                    Hello?  Charlie, are you there?

                    We can find it faster, if you don t 
                    know what you re looking for. 

                                  TOONER (V.O.)
                    Feel free to look around.  After 
                    all, it s your supercomputer.

      Don reacts, recognizing the voice.  He runs for the door. 
      Alan and Amita watch, startled --


                                  TOONER
                    As they say, mi casa es su casa.

      Charlie and Marshall try to stay casual. They re terrified.


      Don driving, speaks into the vehicle s radio.

                                  DON
                    Colby, Charlie s on my cell.  Get a 
                    location on his phone -- tell me 
                    where.  Meet me there with LAPD.

                          (over radio)
                    What s up?

                                  DON
                    He s run into Tooner.


      Charlie and Marshall pretend to look around. Behind them, 
      Tooner checks his watch. Motions to the kids.

                                  TOONER
                    We re done.  Get out.

      The kids head out. Tooner turns to Charlie and Marshall.

                    Guys, sorry I can t wait around for 
                    you to find your computer.

                    We ll come back in the morning.

      Tooner s voice goes hard.

                                  TOONER
                    Don t you want to wait around for 
                    your brother?  Professor Eppes?

      Charlie and Marshall realize Tooner s been playing them. 
      Suddenly he steps right up to Charlie --

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    Here s a math problem for you.    
                    Take the number of people who ve 
                    seen me at crime scenes.  Subtract 
                    the number who ve testified.   

      He gives Charlie a hard look -- then abruptly walks off.

      David and Colby look at the War Room, where Charlie and 
      Marshall talking intensely over expressions on a clear board.

                    He said he ll kill me, in so many 
                    words.  No wonder the Vanguard kids 
                    hate him -- he s very hate-able. 

      Colby comes in, listening.

                    Guy like that killed a friend of 
                    mine -- I d go after him. 

      Charlie gets an idea --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Clayton Caswell and Tooner -- they 
                    hate each other.  They want 
                      confrontation. That creates a 
                    classic game-theory scenario --

                                  MARSHALL
                    Right on, Johnny Von Neumann. It s 
                    the old three-man gun fight.    

                                  COLBY
                    I assume that s one of your game-
                    theory scenarios? 

      Marshall makes a pretend gun with his finger and thumb. 

      ENTER AUDIENCE VISION -- a stylized practical version of the 
      scene. We see the characters, but with wire-frame overlays 
        illustrating what Marshall s saying.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Imagine a duel between three 
                    people. I m the worst shot, I hit 
                    the target one out of three tries.  
                    One of my opponents --

      He indicates Charlie, who also makes a finger-gun.

                                  MARSHALL (cont d)
                    -- is better, hits the target two 
                    out of three shots. The third guy  
                    is a dead shot -- he never misses.  

      He looks to Colby.  Who looks back.

                                  MARSHALL (cont d)
                    Come on.

      Colby gives a wry smile, but makes a finger-gun. 

                                  MARSHALL (cont d)
                    Each gets one shot. As the worst, I 
                    go first. Then Charlie. Then Colby. 
                    Who do I aim for with my one shot? 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     51.

                    Me, because I m the biggest danger. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Though I ve got more motive.

                                  MARSHALL
                    I shoot Eppsy, but not for the 
                    obvious reason. Chances are two to 
                    one that I ll miss.    

      He  shoots  Charlie, missing. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    It s my turn, logic says I shoot 
                    Colby. 

      He  shoots  Colby. 

                                  COLBY
                    Right, because if I m left standing, 
                    I ll shoot you, and I won t miss.  

                                    CHARLIE
                    Exactly.

                                  MARSHALL
                    As the worst, I use the better  
                    shooters against each other.

      RESUME SCENE:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Tooner and Vanguard know their 
                      communications systems better than we 
                    do. We can use that against them. 

                                  MARSHALL
                    We insert info into their systems, 
                    and make it work for us.   


      Charlie explains to Colby as Marshall works at a computer.  
      (Creating a fake website for a shipping company.)

                                    CHARLIE
                    We re creating a target that Tooner 
                    can t resist. And making sure 
                    Vanguard knows about it.

                    A set up -- won t that be obvious?

                                  MARSHALL
                    Not the way we re doing it. They ll 
                    both think they ve got data the 
                    other side doesn t know they have. 

                                  COLBY
                    They re gonna come ready for war. 
                    We d better gear up for this one.

      Colby walks out.

                                  MARSHALL
                    We re using their hate against each 
                    other.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Kinda ironic.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Hey, I don t hate you. You hate me?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Only when you call me  Eppsy.    

                                  MARSHALL
                    I guess -- it s been a way of 
                    dealing with who you are.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What do you mean,  who I am ?

                                  MARSHALL
                    Charles Eppes, that guy everybody 
                    talks about. You know, you re a 
                    pretty intimidating person. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Second time today I ve gotten that.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Only the second?   

                                    CHARLIE
                    You re fairly challenging yourself. 
                    Everytime I come up with something 
                    new, in the back of my mind I m 
                    thinking,  Penfield s gonna tear 
                    this apart.

                    How  bout we call a truce.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Is this some game theory trick? 

                                    CHARLIE
                    If it were, I d have used a fourth-
                    level false-altruism ploy.   

                                  MARSHALL
                    Truce it is.


      Amita, Larry, Alan and Marshall mill around the dining room  
      opening pizza boxes. Charlie puts down a tray of drinks.

                    So Marshall, how do you like your

                    when we met the psychotic killer 
                      face-to-face.  

                                    CHARLIE
                    That wasn t optimal.

                    You two don t seem to be fighting 
                    so much.

      Charlie throws Marshall a wry smile.

                                  ALAN
                    Is that on purpose, or did you just 
                    get tired of it?

                                  MARSHALL
                    Oh, it s on purpose. I never get

                    Marshall and I find we can actually

                    I should have stopped calling you 
                    Eppsy years ago.

                    Yeah, well I ve been called worse --

      The door opens, in comes Don, with two more boxes of pizza.
