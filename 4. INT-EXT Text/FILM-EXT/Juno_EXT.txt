JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript
subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen
years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces
and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object
of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned
curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking
leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless
latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.
JUNO (V.O.)
It started with a chair.
A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality.
JUNO
Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob
for a second, okay?
We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away
from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again.
JUNO (V.O.)
This is the most magnificent discarded
living room set I've ever seen.
She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and
wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.
BEGIN ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE:
Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a
jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of
juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly
on a mission.
Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the
main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.
The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed
serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container
over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS
with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.
She enters the DRUGSTORE.
Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house,
gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super
Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to
fashion a noose.
Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of
prairie grass and wild flowers.
Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well
manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team.
LEAH
Heavy lifting can only help you at
this point.
JUNO
That is sick, man.
Leah busts a gut laughing. It's a stunningly accurate
portrayal of Bleeker's parents.
LEAH
So, you were bored? Is that how this
blessed miracle came to be?
JUNO
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The
sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
LEAH
When did you decide you were going
to do Bleeker?
JUNO
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
LEAH
Aha! You love him.
JUNO
It's extremely complicated, and I'd
rather not talk about it in my fragile
state.
She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She's wearing
her father's LIFTING BELT.
LEAH
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's
bony bod?
JUNO
It was magnificent, man!
PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for
early morning track practice. He wears a cross country uniform
that reads "DANCING ELK CONDORS." He is eating some kind of
microwaved snack gimmick.
Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting
for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the
front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe
officiously.
JUNO
Hey Bleek.
BLEEKER
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
JUNO
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
BLEEKER
Cool.
JUNO
Your shorts are looking especially
gold today.
BLEEKER
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
JUNO
Go Carole.
(a beat)
So, guess what?
BLEEKER
(shrugs)
I don't know...
JUNO
I'm pregnant.
Stunned silence. Juno pops up the footrest of the recliner
and leans back comfortably.
BLEEKER
I guess so.
(fidgeting)
What are you going to do?
The Dancing Elk Prep cross country team runs past Bleeker's
house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of
warm-ups. Their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves.
They wave and holler at Bleeker and Juno.
JUNO (V.O.)
When I see them all running like
that, with their things bouncing
around in their shorts, I always
picture them naked, even if I don't
want to. I have intrusive thoughts
all the time.
BLEEKER
I'm supposed to be running.
JUNO
I know.
There's an awkward silence.
BLEEKER
So, what do you think we should do?
JUNO
I thought I might, you know, nip it
in the bud before it gets worse.
Because I heard in health class that
pregnancy often results in an infant.
BLEEKER
Yeah, typically. That's what happens
when our moms and teachers get
pregnant.
JUNO
So that's cool with you, then?
BLEEKER
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do
what you think is right.
JUNO
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I
know it wasn't your idea.
BLEEKER
Whose idea was it?
JUNO
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off.
BLEEKER
(to nobody in
particular)
Whose idea was it?
Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a
lock around it. In the background, a group of 3 NERDS play a
live-action RPG.
NERD
You did not! You don't have the armor.
That Orc Armor you bought from the
wizard doesn't have the power level
to parry my hit!
Bren's nail salon in all its glory.
JUNO (V.O.)
...owns a nail salon called Bren's
Tens...
Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There
is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent
holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "NO BABIES LIKE
MURDERING."
LONE PROTESTER
(chanting in extremely
shy, accented voice)
All babies want to get borned! All
babies want to get borned!
Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers.
JUNO
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
SU-CHIN
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
JUNO
Good. I'm good.
(pause)
Did you finish that paper for Worth's
class yet?
SU-CHIN
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a
little last night, but I'm having
trouble concentrating.
JUNO
You should try Adderall.
SU-CHIN
No thanks. I'm off pills.
JUNO
Wise move. I know this girl who had
a huge crazy freakout because she
took too many behavioral meds at
once. She took off her clothes and
jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale
Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah!
I'm a kraken from the sea!"
SU-CHIN
I heard that was you.
JUNO
Well, it was nice seeing you.
She continues on toward the clinic entrance.
SU-CHIN
(calling out)
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating
heart, you know. It can feel pain.
And it has fingernails.
JUNO
Really? Fingernails?
She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.
Leah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless Juno
standing sheepishly on the porch. Leah sighs.
LEAH
What are you doing here, dumbass? I
thought I was supposed to pick you
up at four.
JUNO
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled
like a dentist in there. They had
these really horrible magazines,
with, like, spritz cookie recipes
and bad fiction and water stains,
like someone read them in the tub.
And the receptionist tried to give
me these weird condoms that looked
like grape suckers, and she told me
about her boyfriend's pie balls, and
Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told
me the baby had fingernails.
Fingernails!
LEAH
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's
claws could scratch your vag on the
way out?
JUNO
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
LEAH
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's
around here somewhere. She doesn't
know we're sexually active.
JUNO
What does that even mean? Anyway, I
got to thinking on the way over. I
was thinking maybe I could give the
baby to somebody who actually likes
that kind of thing. You know, like a
woman with a bum ovary or something.
Or some nice lesbos.
LEAH
But then you'll get huge. Your chest
is going to milktate. And you have
to tell everyone you're pregnant.
JUNO
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me
for being so selfless.
LEAH
Maybe they'll totally shit and be
super mad at you and not let you
graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for
spring break.
JUNO
Bleeker and I were going to go to
Gettysburg for spring break.
Leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend.
LEAH
Well, maybe you could look at one of
those adoption ads. I see them all
the time in the Penny Saver.
JUNO
There are ads? For parents?
LEAH
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn."
They're right by the ads for like,
iguanas and terriers and used fitness
equipment. It's totally legit.
JUNO
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out
wannabe parents in the Penny Saver!
That's tacky. That's like buying
clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Juno and Leah are sitting at a bench in a park. They slurp
giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of Penny Savers.
Juno has her pipe with her.
JUNO
The Penny Saver sucks.
LEAH
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
They turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and
teeth are Windex-blue.
LEAH
Look at this one "Wholesome,
spiritually wealthy couple have found
true love with each other."
(checks to see that
Juno is paying
attention)
"All that's missing is your bastard."
JUNO
(reading a different
page)
There's a guy in here who's giving
away a piano. Free for the hauling!
We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
LEAH
You're not listening to me.
JUNO
No, I heard you. I just can't give
the baby to people who describe
themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking
for something a little edgier.
LEAH
What did you have in mind, a family
of disturbed loners who are into
gunplay and incest?
JUNO
I was thinking a graphic designer,
mid-thirties, and his cool Asian
wife who dresses awesome and plays
bass. But I'm trying to not be too
particular.
LEAH
All right, how about this one?
"Healthy, educated couple seeking
infant to join our family of five.
You will be compensated. Help us
complete the circle of love."
JUNO
Yeesh, they sound like a cult.
Besides, they're greedy bitches.
They already have three kids!
LEAH
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno
scans the ad silently.
We see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple
with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. It reads "Educated,
successful couple wishes to..."
JUNO (V.O.)
They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,
and they were beautiful even in black
and white.
We see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish
curtains -- and the light on inside.
The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated
community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.
Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic
McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses
the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both
look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.
VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in
her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.
VANESSA
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno
and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
JUNO
Vanessa, right?
MAC
Hello. Thank you for having me and
my irresponsible child over to your
home.
VANESSA
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
It is now WINTER. The TRACK TEAM jogs in formation, leaving
tracks in the snow. Those bastards never stop running.
Bleeker is running alone on the track. His exhalations are
icy puffs in the air. Bleeker's friend VIJAY jogs up alongside
him. Vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like Bleeker.
VIJAY
Hey man.
BLEEKER
Oh, hey Vijay.
VIJAY
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
BLEEKER
Yup.
VIJAY
Just like our moms and teachers!
BLEEKER
Yup.
VIJAY
Did you hear it's yours?
BLEEKER
Yup.
VIJAY
What a trip, man.
BLEEKER
I don't really know anything about
it.
VIJAY
You should grow a moustache. You're
a real man now.
BLEEKER
I can't grow a moustache. It never
comes in evenly.
VIJAY
Me neither. But I'm going to stop
wearing underpants in order to raise
my sperm count. See you.
VIJAY jogs off. Bleeker STOPS and wipes away his sweat.
The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's
exclusive community. A sign on the gate reads "Glacial
Valley."
Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold.
MARK answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.
MARK
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see
you here.
JUNO
I've got something really cool to
show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
MARK
No, she's working late tonight. She's
trying to accrue some extra time off
for when, you know...
He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly.
JUNO
Right. I hear they can be kind of a
time-suck.
MARK
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
JUNO
Sure. What is it with you rich people
and your herb-infused juices?
MARK
I don't know. Something to do with
the four-packs...
(adding)
...They're not bad.
Juno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters.
Juno parks her PREVIA on the street. She walks up to the
house and rings the doorbell.
BLEEKER'S MOM answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down
to Juno's middle.
JUNO (V.O.)
Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive
once. But now she looks a hobbit.
The fat one that was in The Goonies.
BLEEKER'S MOM
Hi Juno. What can I do for you?
JUNO
I borrowed Paulie's physics notes in
school today. I'm pretty sure he
needs them back, or his grade could
plummet to an A minus.
BLEEKER'S MOM
Fine. Come in.
She steals another glance at Juno's belly.
The house is covered in fresh snow.
The streets are covered in muddy, slushy snow. The mud is
instantly TRAMPLED underfoot by the collective feet of the
Dancing Elk Track Team on their morning run.
Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine,
then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She
produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview
mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some
Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway.
Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys,
but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.
The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the
shoulder.
Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future.
We push in close... when she gets an idea.
She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she
finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and
pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?
It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting
alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of
wine.
Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting
on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the
van.
Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute
because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." He
holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back.
MARK
It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.
Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over,
examining it.
VANESSA
It's for me.
Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's
been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.
JUNO (V.O.)
I never realize how much I like being
home unless I've been somewhere really
different for a while.
She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch
and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly
with it. Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.
Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning
run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the
stoop: "BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL."
He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch
on the mailbox.
At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come
pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the
driveway. Bleeker smiles.
Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team,
ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches.
They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching
and jogs up to the chainlink fence.
BLEEKER
Did you put like a hundred things of
Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
JUNO
Yeah. That was me.
BLEEKER
Why?
JUNO
(blushes)
Because they're your fave. And you
can never have too much of your
favorite one-calorie breath mint.
BLEEKER
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty
much set until college on the Tic
Tac front.
JUNO
You know, I've been thinking. I'm
really sorry I was such a huge bitch
to you. You didn't deserve that. You
never deserve any of the poo I unload
on you.
BLEEKER
You know it's okay.
JUNO
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
BLEEKER
What, you mean as friends?
JUNO
No, for real. I think you are the
coolest person I've ever met. And
you don't even have to try.
BLEEKER
I try really hard, actually...
JUNO
No, you're naturally smart. You always
think of the funniest things to do.
Remember when you passed me that
postcard during Spanish class, and
it was addressed like, "Junebug
MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the
Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having
fun in Barcelona -- wish you were
here"? That was hilarious.
BLEEKER
I was just bored. I only think school
is awesome like, 80% of the time.
JUNO
Plus, you're the only person who
doesn't stare at my stomach all the
fucking time. You actually look at
my face. And every time I look at
you, the baby starts kicking me super
hard.
BLEEKER
It does?
Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly.
BLEEKER
Wizard!
JUNO
I think it's because my heart starts
pounding when I see you.
BLEEKER
Mine too.
JUNO
Basically, I'm completely smitten
with you, and I don't care if I'm
making an ass out of myself right
now, because you've seen me make an
ass out of myself a million times,
and you still want to be my friend.
BLEEKER
Well, yeah. You're the best friend
I've ever had, even when you're being
kind of evil.
JUNO
That's all I need from you. That's
more than I could ever ask for. You're
just golden, dude.
BLEEKER
Can we make out now?
JUNO
Okay.
Bleeker and Juno KISS, oblivious to the gawking track team
guys in the background.
In the distance, near the school entrance, we see STEVE
RENDAZO (the kid who always TORMENTS Juno) regarding the
makeout session with a sad, envious expression.
LEAH passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the
fence, rolling her eyes.
LEAH
(disgusted)
You know, you can go into early labor
sucking face like that!
Juno gives her the FINGER, not breaking the clinch with
Bleeker.
Mac, Bren and Liberty Bell rush out of the house. They pile
into the Previa at breakneck speed. Juno waddles behind them,
protesting.
Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him
on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the
bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate
Vijay looks on. Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding
a video camera.
JUNO (V.O.)
I decided to not call Bleeker to
tell him that I was having the baby.
He had a big meet against Manteno
and I didn't want him to get all
worried about me and choke.
Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. The fifteen or so
people in attendance cheer.
VIJAY
(admiringly)
His legs are as swift as his seed.
MRS. BLEEKER
What did you say?
Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat.
ANNOUNCER
P. Bleeker has just broken a district
record in the 400.
Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno.
She's not there.
JUNO (V.O.)
But he figured it out anyway.
Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without
stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused.
It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle
out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who
is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost
as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.
Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar
is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not
pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.
JUNO (V.O.)
As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is
totally boss. He is the cheese to my
macaroni. I know people are supposed
to fall in love before they reproduce,
but normalcy's not really our style.
As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she
passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in
outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.
Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning
his guitar.
Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles
and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and
pulls the pick out of the strings.
JUNO
Ready?
Bleeker nods.
Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else
But You," by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first
their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.
BLEEKER
You're a part time lover and a
fulltime friend. The monkey on your
back is the latest trend. I don't
see what anyone can see, in anyone
else but you.
JUNO
Here is the church and here is the
steeple. We sure are cute for two
ugly people. I don't see what anyone
can see, in anyone else but you.
BLEEKER
We both have shiny happy fits of
rage. You want more fans, I want
more stage. I don't see what anyone
can see, in anyone else but you.
JUNO
You are always trying to keep it
real. I'm in love with how you feel.
I don't see what anyone can see, in
anyone else but you.
BLEEKER
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow
of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed,
my body's swinging from side to side.
I don't see what anyone can see, in
anyone else but you.
JUNO
The pebbles forgive me, the trees
forgive me. So why can't you forgive
me? I don't see what anyone can see,
in anyone else but you.
JUNO AND BLEEKER TOGETHER
Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du
du du dudu. I don't see what anyone
can see, in anyone else but you.
She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile
ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.
Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with
life and summer activity.
FADE TO BLACK
THE END
