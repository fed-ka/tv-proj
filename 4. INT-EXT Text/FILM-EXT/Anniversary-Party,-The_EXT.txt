We're in the middle of a yoga lesson.
Joe and Sally stand on
their mats.
Steven, their instructor, wanders around the
couple issuing soft-spoken instructions.
A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge
fireplace.
The dining room on one side, living room on the
other.
Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch
garden pool... The house is classic Neutra.
All GLASS and
SMOOTH LINES.
The calm is broken by the telephone.
Joe and Sally ignore it
until the answering machine picks up.
They break their yoga
poses and listen.
The CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.
LUCY (O.S.)
(over answering machine; sweet,
British, slightly desperate)
Joe, it's Lucy.
Remember me?
It's the
black sheep here.
Bah...not funny.
Haven't heard from you, need you, call
me.
Love you madly.
Hi, Sally.
Joe,
I'd love to talk to you before I go...
JOE
Go where?
LUCY (O.S.)
(over answering machine)
It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big
brother.
Sorry I drone on.
I miss you.
I lo--
The machine cuts her off.
NEW ANGLE
Joe and Sally have resumed their positions.
This wasn't the
call they were waiting for.
WIDE SHOT
AMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of
the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come
through the sliding glass door...
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM
Through the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two
unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the
dining room table.
They speak quietly to each other in
Spanish.
JOE
America, could you just...
America closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the
dining room, giving the couple their privacy.
JOE (CONT'D)
(calls out)
Thank you, America!
STEVEN
Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let
your ribs expand and relax.
And reach up
and into downward dog.
Otis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard
pillow, stirs, stretches and groans.
JOE AND SALLY
Good boy, Otis.
The phone RINGS again.
VOICE (O.S.)
(over answering machine)
Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for
Sally Therrian.
Sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the
phone, all angles.
SALLY
Hello, hi, hi...and?
Thank God.
Sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe.
Joe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the
teacher waiting a sign.
Sally returns to the lesson.
They
do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the
front door.
SALLY
No luck.
JOE
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again.
Sound like a plan?
Sally nods, she and Joe, at Steven's instructions, come out
of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched
relax, facing one another.
SALLY
Happy anniversary, baby.
JOE
Happy anniversary.
They smile.
STEVEN
And change sides...
America slides open the dining room doors.
The dining table
is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers.
Rosa is
singing in Spanish.
AMERICA
(with the authority of long
years of service)
Mr. Joe, we have to have the house.
If
you please now...
JOE
It's yours.
The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and
candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation,
tumbling on the lawn, and the like.
Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply
leaning on a shelf.
It's clear that at least a handful are
by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and
beautiful.
There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy,
documenting their relationship from childhood.
There's an
ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed
somewhere.
JERRY
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk,
Chelsea, London, England.
No small
doing.
SALLY
I love you, you're a genius.
Behind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly.
JERRY
I suppose.
Sally, that's quite a gift.
I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
SALLY
I adore him.
JERRY
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the
morning.
The house had to go on the
market to insure the loan on the London
flat.
SALLY
I know.
I know that.
Don't spoil it.
JERRY
What you earn has to double in order to
cover expenses in London, it's an
outrageously expensive city.
SALLY
We've only been over this how many times?
JERRY
You only made half your quote this year.
SALLY
Well, you're a tower of support.
JERRY
I worry because you don't.
It's my job.
I'm feeling guilty.
I would've liked it
if you waited until the two of you were
on more solid ground.
SALLY
(direct, simple)
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
JERRY
Whatever you say.
Listen, I love you.
Otis is barking.
JOE (O.S.)
Otis!
No barking!
SALLY
(touched)
And Joe's huge in Europe.
He's like a
rock star in London.
His novels sell
millions.
JERRY
Not millions.
SALLY
He's directing now.
JERRY
They're paying him scale.
The CAMERA catches sight of Joe behind them.
He moves
through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of
glasses and Judy in tow.
SALLY
He gets huge advances on his novels.
He's going back to that.
You know how he
hates it here.
JERRY
There's still time to undo this.
SALLY
(kisses his cheek)
We'll be fine.
JERRY
(re: barking dog)
Did you invite them?
SALLY
The Roses?
And of course they said yes.
JERRY
That was the plan.
And you're thrilled
to have them.
SALLY
Whatever you say.
JERRY
Did you tell Joe to behave?
SALLY
Yes.
JERRY
Did he promise?
SALLY
Scout's honor.
JERRY
Before I forget.
(pulls a novel from his
briefcase)
Put it on the bookshelf.
She flips the book -- on the back is a full page picture of
RYAN ROSE.
SALLY
You're out of your mind.
JERRY
Just do what I say, alright?
SALLY
How much bowing and scraping do you want
us to do?
JERRY
Beats a lawsuit.
Mac and Cal sit on the porch sharing a joint.
Cal is maybe
the only living complete works of Shakespeare and pulls out
his most arcane quotes on occasion.
CAL
Are those our dailies?
You're totally
outrageous.
It's their anniversary.
Is
nothing sacred!
Well...so...how am I?
MAC
(laughing)
Oh man, you are so fucking funny in the
kitchen scene.
CAL
I liked the third take, the accidental
disaster with the silverware.
MAC
Nothing you do is accidental...
MEDIUM FULL SHOT
The CAMERA spots GINA TAYLOR through moving bodies.
Tall,
beautiful, centered grace.
She's got a Leica around her
neck... drops her two large camera bags on the floor.
Several of the other guests greet her, Mac among them.
TIGHT CLOSE
Joe sweeps her up to his arms.
It's an intimate,
appreciative embrace.
Theirs was a mid-30s relationship,
certainly pre-Sally.
Maybe his first important love.
GINA
(re: the cameras)
I'm the hired help.
JOE
(affectionate)
Fuck you.
GINA
I never put myself in harm's way.
JOE
Anymore.
GINA
No, not anymore.
Happy anniversary,
scout.
NEW ANGLE
Sophia bursts from the kitchen.
SOPHIA
Oh my God!
America told me your
neighbors are coming?
SALLY
And here they are!
SOPHIA
And she was saying how happy you were to
finally have them over.
Because you're
both, so, what - introspective?
And you
should have done it ages ago.
I'm Sophia
Gold.
(rescuing Sally)
Come meet my husband, Cal.
MONICA
Cal Gold?
SOPHIA
The very one.
And you are...
SALLY
Monica and Ryan.
RYAN
Rose.
SOPHIA
Sorry?
RYAN
Ryan Rose.
SOPHIA
Yes.
She shakes his hand.
He's amazed at the solid grip.
SALLY
He's a novelist.
SOPHIA
Ah.
SALLY
Like Joe.
SOPHIA
Hmm.
(to Sally)
Where are my kids?
SALLY
In the guest room.
I've laid out a paint
table for them.
SOPHIA
I hope they're watercolors!
SALLY
Nevermind.
SOPHIA
(to Monica)
Would you like to meet my husband?
It's all Monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her
chest.
MONICA
I'd be thrilled.
SOPHIA
Then he'll be thrilled.
She ushers them toward the living room.
JOE
(re: Sophia, appreciative)
She's such pure evil.
Sally approaches, gives Gina a warm kiss on the chest.
SALLY
Thanks for coming.
GINA
Happy anniversary.
You're a good match,
you two.
(to Joe)
Can you help me with this stuff?
JOE
(re: one of her bags)
That for us?
GINA
What a nose.
You missed your calling.
JOE
Can I open it?
GINA
(defers)
Sally?
JOE
Please?
SALLY
He's impossible.
Go on then.
Joe rips open the gift.
It's a framed black and white of
Joe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch.
It's clear which
photos in the house are Gina's.
It's a breathtaking print,
an amazing caught moment.
All light and shadow.
A touching
study.
SALLY (CONT'D)
(respectful of the talent)
It's beautiful, thank you so much.
Joe, moved somehow, hugs Gina to him.
Kisses her.
JOE
I love you,
Gina Taylor.
Sally's uncomfortable, a little jealous... feels intrusive.
Aware that Gina got there first.
Knew him when.
And always
captures something naked and vulnerable in his face.
CUT TO:
Judy Adams lost herself a little, steps outside, sits
alone...
JUDY
(smiles over at Ryan)
Hi.
RYAN
Hi.
A little close in there.
JUDY
Yup.
Evie and Jake run along the side of the house.
Behind the
glass walls the CAMERA catches adults moving through the
living room and into the dining room.
The drug has begun to take effect.
The party is now in full
swing.
Music is playing, and Sophia and Clair are dancing.
People are swimming, some naked, some in swimsuits.
Judy
floats around the pool on an inflatable dog.
Sally and Skye cuddle together on one of the benches round
the pool, chatting; a friendly, feely touchy conversation.
Joe passes around bottles of water and chewing gum to
everyone, emceeing the event.
Everyone is relaxed and open, except Ryan, who sits beside
Monica at the edge of the garden, separated from the others.
MONICA
I love it here.
Don't you love it here,
Ryan?
I love it here.
And I love
tonight.
And I love these people.
And
this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.
(touches her own cheek, ever so
lightly; shivers against the
sensation)
Utterly fantastic.
RYAN
You know what Sally Therrian was saying
about your spine and your brain?
She
didn't pull that out of thin air.
It
causes brain damage.
You'd better drink
a lot of water.
MONICA
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
RYAN
Yes.
MONICA
I think you should then.
You should look
in on Sheila.
RYAN
I'm not going to leave you alone.
MONICA
They're really nice people, Ryan.
They're like us...
RYAN
They're nothing like us.
MONICA
I think you need to speak for yourself,
Ryan.
But I think you're really nice
people...
She puts arms around him, kisses his cheek.
He stiffens.
RYAN
Are you making an ass of yourself?
MONICA
There's only you, Ryan.
You know what,
Ryan?
You're beautiful.
I love you so
much... You need...
RYAN
I don't need a drug.
MONICA
You need a good review and you'll be
fine.
The whole color of the world will
change, mark my words.
She gets up.
RYAN
Ready to go?
MONICA
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.
I do
know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you
mustn't worry.
(turns back)
Ryan, you're a great man.
The CAMERA follows Monica along the side of the pool.
She
passes Sophia and a very exuberant Clair.
The CAMERA stays at the pool.
Clair tears off Sally's
Galiano, flings it to the ground and dives topless into the
pool.
CLAIR
This water is great!
JERRY
(swimming past her)
Wanna dive for a baton?
MEDIUM CLOSE UP - JUDY
She stands at the side of the pool.
JUDY
Okay, I'm about to throw five colored
batons in the water.
Then I'm going to
count to three, and then you may start
diving.
I'm playing too.
The red one is
ten extra points.
Ready?
(she throws batons in)
One, two, three, go!!
There is a melee of diving and screaming.
CUT TO:
It's at the end of a bridge, overlooking the pool.
Voices
drift up from below.
Mac and Joe walk in circles pacing
around one another.
MAC
You got your DP?
JOE
What?
Oh yeah, the camera man?
They
gave me a list.
MAC
And you got Skye Davidson.
Pretty big
leagues for a first timer.
Do you even
like movies?
JOE
Not particularly.
Weird, isn't it?
God
I'm rally up.
Do you feel anything yet,
Mac?
MAC
Kind of.
Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver
Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're
friends.
And great DP's I could give
them a call for you.
JOE
Thanks, Mac.
(regards him)
And thanks for being so supportive about
all this.
(throws arm around him, hugs
him close)
I really love you, you know.
MAC
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.
Anything
I can do.
JOE
(lets go of Mac)
God, I really need to jump about a bit.
(begins jumping)
How's your film going?
CAL
It's going.
It's going.
JOE
And how's the diva doing?
MAC
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
JOE
I meant Sally.
MAC
I meant Sally.
JOE
(stops jumping, studies him)
Oh.
You're serious.
MAC
(throws and arm around him)
No.
No.
(a beat)
Let me tell you something.
Directing's
the best preparation possible for
fatherhood.
The sleep depravation alone.
JOE
Oh don't.
Everyone says that.
Joe and Cal sit by the edge of the pool watching Skye dance
by herself at the far end.
Joe has his hand on Cal's chest.
Cal is stroking Joe's hair.
JOE
Isn't Skye amazing?
CAL
She's got great tits.
JOE
She's a constant surprise.
CAL
And you've only just met.
JOE
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty
seven and...
(taps his head)
The wisdom.
She's an old soul.
She knew
that Shostakovich thing.
Did you notice?
CAL
Absolutely.
And she's got great tits.
JOE
Yeah, God she really does have great
tits, great tits.
i can't wait to work
with her.
CAL
The camera loves her.
A great actress.
JOE
With great tits.
I'm going to ask her if
I can touch them.
He gets up to go towards Skye, is stopped by...
Clair is climbing up the pool steps.
CLAIR
Has anyone seen Mac?
JOE
(pointing further up the
property)
I saw him wandering over there, I think.
How're you feeling, Clair?
CLAIR
I'm so good.
She kisses Joe and Cal, and goes off to find her husband.
CAL
Poor Mac.
It's been a bit of a struggle.
I'm sure Sally's told you.
JOE
No, what?
CAL
The movie.
JOE
Oh, she's really enjoying it.
I think.
Is Mac okay?
CAL
I don't know what's going on.
I don't
care to guess.
Mac's really unhappy.
She isn't there, that's all.
She's no
idea what she's playing, not a clue.
JOE
Who, Sally?
CAL
And, you know it isn't rocket science,
this script.
She can barely get the
lines out.
There was a scene last week -
she sobbed, through every take.
I know
crying's easy for her but it's a fucking
comedy, Joe.
Something's gone.
You
know, that thing that was Sally - that
always surprised you.
It's gone.
I
think she's scared.
And that's death.
JOE
I still think she sails above the rest.
I mean not like her early films.
But
those were all such great directors.
CAL
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.
He's
a woman's director.
And nothing's
happening.
Course he won't fire her,
because of the friendship... But it was
discussed.
He had to battle his studio
to get her in the first place.
JOE
What?
CAL
Hey, listen, I love her.
She's Sophia's
best friend.
(to Joe's stare)
I never said any of this, alright.
I'll
deny it on the stand...
(into the silence)
You guys are gonna have kids.
That is so
great.
Maybe that's what this is all
about.
Maybe she doesn't want to do this
anymore.
You know adults don't do this
for a living.
You guys are gonna have
your kids, you'll be directing -- one
asshole in the family is enough.
Sophia
knew that intuitively.
Look at Clair.
Clair's a mess.
(throws an arm around him)
Make sure she gets the epidural.
Forget
that natural childbirth shit.
Everything's going to be what it's
supposed to be.
"Life is but a walking
shadow.
A poor player who struts and
frets his hour upon the stage and then is
heard no more..." And speaking of me, the
role of Leo in your film?
JOE
(stares at him)
Leo?
CAL
Any thoughts on casting yet?
JOE
(regards him)
Leo?
It was out to Jude Law.
Jude
passed.
CAL
Well, I can't make any promises, and of
course I haven't read the script but I
loved the novel...when are you shooting?
JOE
October-ish.
CAL
I have a small window of time.
JOE
Leo.
Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
CAL
Scratch the two, write in a four.
JOE
Scratch the two, write in a four.
CAL
You've got a lot of fucking gall.
Thirty
nine.
JOE
Five years ago, I was at the party,
remember?
Joe looks up and sees Sally standing in the sun room.
He
blows her a kiss.
She kisses her finger tips and puts her
hand flat against the window pane.
Monica sits on the steps of the pool.
She looks frightened,
uncomfortable.
JOE
Are you okay?
MONICA
I don't think so.
I feel.
I feel a bit
funny.
JOE
Let's go for a walk.
He puts his arm around her and leads her away from the pool.
MONICA
I've never done this before.
JOE
Oh?
It's easy.
You just put one foot in
front of the other... That's a good girl.
MONICA
I'm a little in the puke zone.
JOE
(giving her some water)
Here, drink this.
Drink lots of water.
(puts the bottle in her hand)
Hold on to this.
Take deep breaths.
Nice and slow.
(sits her down; produces a
lollipop)
Would you like a lolly?
MONICA
What am I, five?
JOE
You're never too old for a lolly.
I'm
having one.
MONICA
(a grin)
Okay.
He pulls out another one.
JOE
Lemon or raspberry?
MONICA
Lemon.
JOE
Lemon it is.
The two suck on their lollipops for a moment.
MONICA
(finally)
Ryan's really angry with me.
JOE
I think he's really angry with me too.
MONICA
(laughs)
It's really not the same thing.
(a moment)
He was really nicer when he drank.
JOE
I'm sorry.
MONICA
Eight years, though.
That's quite an
accomplishment.
JOE
That's a lot of those.
MONICA
Medallions.
JOE
A lot of cakes.
MONICA
Yes.
JOE
And he doesn't smoke?
MONICA
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that
used to be almost impossible, you know?
It's gotten much better.
JOE
How long have you been married?
MONICA
Nine...nine, yes?
Nine years, just
about.
JOE
You must have been a baby.
MONICA
Oh yes.
Nineteen...just.
(a moment)
I'm cold.
JOE
Come here.
Joe holds Monica.
MONICA
(a moment)
That's very nice.
JOE
I like you.
MONICA
I'm so glad.
You know, I recognize that
passage in your book.
The bit about us
running into each other in the movie
theatre.
JOE
Sorry?
MONICA
I know you changed it to a bookstore.
And the color of my hair.
But the moment
was exactly the same.
The same, you
know, dynamic.
And almost verbatim,
wasn't it?
JOE
(humors her)
Yeah, it was.
For a writer nothing's
sacred.
(thinks a moment)
No, nothing at all.
MONICA
I think it's great that I made an
impression at all, you know.
Joe regards the open trusting face, is touched by it.
Leans
in, kisses her lips very lightly... and again.
Her arms
can't make up her mind, whether to come up around him or not.
Finally do.
SALLY (O.S.)
Otis!!
Otis, come!
Oh fuck!
She appears beside them.
SALLY (CONT'D)
Someone left the goddamn gate open.
Otis
got out.
Skye and I, well the... I came
out of the house and the fucking gate was
wide open.
JOE
Oh for fuck's sake.
Nobody uses that
gate.
MONICA
(horrified)
I'm sorry.
SALLY
(raging)
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
MONICA
I'm so sorry.
SALLY
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
MONICA
(at a loss)
I...
SALLY
How long ago was it?
JOE
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
MONICA
I'm so sorry.
JOE
It was a mistake.
This isn't a plot to
do in Otis.
SALLY
Don't be so sure.
JOE
Listen to yourself...
(to Monica)
Don't worry, it's alright.
We'll find
him.
(to Sally)
What's wrong with you?
SALLY
(re: Monica)
She left the fucking gate open.
JOE
Well he can't have gone far.
SALLY
Can't have gone far?
He's like a
greyhound.
He could be miles away.
JOE
He'll find his way back.
SALLY
There are fucking coyotes out there.
JOE
(calming)
Sally, calm down.
We're not going to
find him any quicker by you being
hysterical.
Monica retreats, backs off a step or two.
SALLY
Fuck you.
JOE
Or shitty!!
Otis!!
CUT TO:
Panes and Skye search the canyon for Otis.
They both carry
lanterns.
PANES
Otis!!
Shostakovich identified with the
Jew.
He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed
under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
SKYE
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis,
come!!
PANES
Andre Zhdanov?
How the hell do you know
about Andre Zhdanov?
SKYE
Who doesn't know about the infamous
composer's conference of 1948 where
Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet
Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and
Myaskovsky.
PANES
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute
girls don't know.
SKYE
Do Peter Sellers again.
PANES
(a la Sellers)
Otis you crazy dog!
Otis are you in this
God forsaken Canyon?
My people are very
hungry.
SKYE
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I
played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who
gets shot in the head, and they used
Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
PANES
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
SKYE
Exactly!
So I dug it, and I did a lot of
research.
PANES
Do you really, you really, like
Shostakovich?
SKYE
Yeah.
PANES
Would you, like, marry him?
SKYE
If he were still alive, maybe.
PANES
How about someone who really really liked
Shostakovich?
SKYE
(smiling)
Are you asking me to marry you?
PANES
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply
perverted and impulsive you are.
SKYE
(laughing)
Very.
PANES
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really
twenty-two?
SKYE
Who told you that?
No.
I'm twenty...
(lops off two years)
Five.
Sally and Joe have lanterns.
Panes and Skye are up ahead.
We hear them calling for Otis.
SALLY
Otis!!!!
JOE
(on her heels)
Otis!!!!
SALLY
Otis, good boy, come here.
Oh my god, oh
my god, oh my god.
JOE
This is a nightmare.
We should have kept
him upstairs.
SALLY
It was done.
When Sophia put the kids to
bed, America brought Otis in the room and
closed the door.
It was done.
JOE
Well someone clearly let him out before
Monica opened the gate.
SALLY
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're
at it.
But I guess that's what I
interrupted.
JOE
Jesus, Sally.
You are a medical miracle.
The only person who's ever taken ecstacy
and become angrier.
SALLY
Yeah, let's talk about that.
You seem to
be rather an expert.
I don't remember in
the last five months of counselling your
ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage
parties.
JOE
Rave parties?!
That's so typical - you
would think it was called rage.
Perfect!
SALLY
What else don't I know about, Joe?
Let's
get really clear here.
JOE
Sally, so I took a few pills.
I went out
dancing.
I tried to forget how upset I
was about splitting up with you.
I
haven't lied to you.
I told you about
the people I've slept with.
I just
didn't mention the few occasions I took
drugs because you're so fucking
judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end
of it, and you have so little faith and
so little trust in me.
Sally, we're
back, I love you.
Trust that.
Please
let's not do this.
SALLY
Otis!
Come!
Good boy!
Come!
JOE
Otis!
SALLY
I'm not sure we understand that word in
the same way.
JOE
Love?
SALLY
You walked out on a five year marriage.
JOE
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do
with love.
It's whether we can live
together... like this!
All the time.
SALLY
It's not like this all the time.
JOE
DO I want anyone else?
No.
Do I want to
be with you for the rest of my natural
life?
I'm trying.
SALLY
And how hard it hit?
JOE
Just stop right there, Sally.
We've been
through this.
SALLY
You've been through it.
That's how you
love people.
When it's easy for you,
when it's convenient for you.
JOE
Sally, first of all, you're talking
bullshit.
And second...
SALLY
You want to talk about bullshit?
Lucy
called you three times this week.
She's
a fucking mess, Joe.
Your sister is a
fucking mess.
She needs you.
I talk to
her more than you do.
JOE
That is not true.
SALLY
It is true.
You know how you love, Joe?
You dedicate a book to someone.
JOE
Every novel I've had published in every
language I've dedicated to Lucy.
SALLY
Right.
And when was the last time you
spoke to her?
Joe is silent.
SALLY (CONT'D)
And how fucking dare you cast Skye
Davidson in that part?
Have you any idea
how humiliating that is for me?
I'm an
actress!
It's about our marriage for
fuck's sake.
Everybody knows that...
JOE
It's a novel.
SALLY
About me!
JOE
Who the fuck do you think you are?
The
part of Genna is not just about you.
It's about every woman I've ever loved in
my entire life.
Including my mother.
The character is also clearly in her
early twenties, Sally.
SALLY
What are you saying?
JOE
Hello?
Last birthday was?
SALLY
I don't look my age, Joe.
JOE
Sally, I have never considered you for
this part because you are too old to play
it.
And you are out of touch with
reality if you think differently.
SALLY
It's a shit novel anyway.
JOE
Well there you go.
I let you off the
hook.
You're one goddamn lucky actress.
SALLY
Not really.
I mean your books have
always been pop, but this is the
shallowest of the bunch.
That's what all
our friends think, anyway.
JOE
Okay.
If we could've, by some miracle,
stripped ten years off your face, still
couldn't have got the thing made.
Because I don't mean anything as a
director, and your name doesn't mean fuck
all anymore.
And the people that can
hire you are afraid to, because they
think you're phoning it in.
That you
don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
SALLY
Who?
Who?
Who thinks that?
JOE
Your director and your co-star of your
current movie.
Don't dish if you can't
take it, Sally.
SALLY
Mac?
Mac says it?
Cal?
Joe doesn't respond.
SALLY (CONT'D)
Cal, too?
JOE
Sally, for Christ's sake.
SALLY
Anyone else?
JOE
This is insanity.
(moves toward her)
Sally...
SALLY
Don't.
JOE
Don't push me away.
SALLY
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
JOE
Don't do this.
SALLY
I found out I was pregnant and it scared
the shit out of me.
JOE
(threatens)
Don't do this!
SALLY
I told you when we met I never wanted
children.
I don't want kids in my life.
We talked about it.
You weren't
listening.
JOE
You changed your mind.
SALLY
I wanted you back.
Joe slaps her hard across the face.
SALLY (CONT'D)
You think this was to hurt you?!
My God,
Joe.
It isn't about you.
JOE
What?!
You aborted our child?!
SALLY
I'm a monster.
Exactly.
JOE
You're not ready.
SALLY
Don't make allowances.
I'll never be
ready.
Some people just shouldn't have
children.
I'd be a terrible fucking
mother, Joe.
I did want it for us.
But
I couldn't do it.
I don't really think I
can do it.
JOE
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was
I?
I wasn't part of that decision.
Did
I occur to you at all?
It's a fucking
farce.
It's a fucking farce.
How long
did you think you could keep it going.
You're amazing.
Do you have any idea
what you've done to us?
SALLY
Yes.
JOE
I'll never forgive you.
SALLY
I know.
JOE
I have no idea who you are.
They stand their in silence.
Joe is devastated.
We hear
Skye and Panes up ahead calling for Otis.
Jerry pulls Mac to the surface.
Clair and Judy are out of
the pool.
Jerry drags the limp body from the pool, pumps
Mac's chest - it's clear he knows what he's doing.
Mac
coughs up a load of water.
CLAIR
Oh my God.
Honey???
There's a moment.
Mac begins to sob.
JERRY
He's okay, Clair.
You wanna give him a
little room?
MAC
(his face against concrete)
Man, I must really be stoned.
(wipes tears from his face with
his hand)
Thanks, buddy.
CLAIR
Honey?
Mac raises his hand, arrests her from coming nearer.
MAC
I'm fine, babe.
JERRY
Give him a minute, Clair.
MAC
(humiliated)
Hey.
(looks over at Jerry)
Thanks, buddy.
JERRY
Anytime, sport.
MAC
(wants to say "don't call me
sport")
Yeah, thanks pal.
CLAIR
(helpless)
Honey?
They all stand around watching him.
Mac gets up.
MAC
I'm fine, babe.
I'm gonna take a little
walk.
I need a minute.
Let's forget it.
My life didn't pass in front of my eyes.
So, it probably wasn't that close.
JERRY
Probably not.
MAC
(to Jerry)
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
JUDY
There's a test, you know.
JERRY
(embarrassed)
Forget it, Judy.
CLAIR
(still scared)
Honey?
MAC
I'll be fine.
Really babe.
Give me a
minute.
The CAMERA stays on Mac as he walks around the side of the
house, down the steps through the basement.
Jerry and Judy are making out.
JUDY
Are you my big brave boy?
Are you my
brave hero?
JERRY
You're crazy baby.
I love you.
JUDY
Are you my big hard hero?
JERRY
Do you want me to save you?
Do you want
me to save you?
JUDY
Oh yeah...
JERRY
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
JUDY
Oh yeah?
JERRY
Let me heal you, baby.
JUDY
(mantra)
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Grunts, groans, a scream, a peel of giggles.
JERRY
Oh yeah.
Cal and Sophia lie cuddled on a lounge chair, blissed out,
counting the windows of the house.
SOPHIA
...no, no, start again.
CAL AND SOPHIA
One, two, three, four...
Clair wanders up.
She's changed into her own clothes.
CLAIR
I've lost my husband and my beeper.
Have
either of you seen either of them?
Jerry and Judy lie alongside each other, hands propping
heads.
They aren't privy to anything that's happened.
JERRY
I call that a perfect day.
JUDY
A perfect night.
JERRY
Damn near.
(long moment)
And a damn near perfect drug.
JUDY
Hm.
We should do it again.
JERRY
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
JUDY
Hm.
(a long moment)
You think we should ask them for their
landscaper?
JERRY
Hm.
Do you like fucking out of doors?
JUDY
Not as a rule.
JERRY
(a long moment)
They didn't sign their goddamn tax
returns!
Sally stands at the threshold, watches Cal and Sophia load
their kids into the car.
Monica and Ryan return from their unsuccessful search.
They
come through the gate with it's sight: KEEP GATE CLOSED.
Monica and Ryan start for the kitchen entrance.
We see Judy and Jerry bounding around the side of the house.
Jerry has his briefcase in his hand.
They are laughing.
They enter the kitchen.
The camera stays outside.
We see
them brought up short by the gloom, but hear nothing.
A taxi pulls up.
Joe gets in with his bags.
The cab backs
out...
The "FOR SALE" sign is hammered into the ground.
DISSOLVE TO:
Otis wanders along the street, up the driveway and disappears
through the flap in the kitchen door.
FADE OUT.
