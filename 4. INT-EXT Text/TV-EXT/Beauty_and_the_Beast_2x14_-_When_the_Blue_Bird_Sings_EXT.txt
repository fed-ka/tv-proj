A sunny spring day. The Village streets bustle with their
own unique life.


      Vincent reverently leafs through the gold-tipped pages of
    the Tennyson.

                          VINCENT
                    Tennyson.. a first edition...
                    it looks almost new. -

                    They made books to last then.
                    The bookseller said this one was
                    waiting.

                          VINCENT
                            (amused)
                    Waiting.. . yes...

15 ANGLE PAST CATHY ON VINCENT 15

    as reads a random passage from the book.


                          VINCENT
                    But in her web she still delights/
                    To weave the mirror s magic
                    sights/ For often through the
                    silent nights/ A funeral, with
                    plumes and lights,/ And music,
                    went to Camelot:

      They both REACT as an unseen voice finishes the poem.

                            KRISTOPHER (O.S.)
                    Or when the moon was overhead!
                    Came two young lovers lately wed/
                     I am half sick of shadows  said/
                    The Lady of Shalott..                                                                                  13.

16 RESUME16


we hear a faint RUSTLING of bushes as someone approaches.
Vincent instinctively draws back toward the shadows, then
hesitates and looks at Cathy. She urges him on.

                          CATHY
                      (urgently)
            Go... before you re seen...

A brief hesitation... then Vincent whirls and vanishes
inside the tunnel, almost simultaneous with Kristopher s
stepping out of the darkness. Cathy STEPS BETWEEN THEM, to
make sure Kristopher cannot see Vincent.

                          CATHY
                      (exasperated, ready of
                    kill)

FADE IN:


Vincent is gone. Kristopher stares off after him.


                            KRISTOPHER
            You didn t have to send him away.

                          CATHY
              Kristopher, what the hell do you
            think you re doing here?

                            KRISTOPHER
                      (oblivious)
            He reads beautifully...

                          CATHY
            I want you to stop following me!
            Do you understand that?

                            KRISTOPHER
            You think he d sit for me?

                          CATHY
                      (exasperated)
            Who are you talking about?

                            KRISTOPHER
            What century did he walk out of,
            Cathy? What storybook?

                          CATHY
              I don t what you think you saw,
            but - -

Kristopher closes his eyes, concentrates, quotes from memory.

                            KRISTOPHER
            ... and over our heads floats the
            blue bird, singing of beautiful
            and impossible things, of things
            that are lovely and...

Frustrated beyond endurance, Cathy SEIZES Kristopher by
the arm and drags him away from the tunnel entrance.
He comes along docilely.

                          CATHY
            That s it. C mon.

            Are you taking me to Vincent?

                          CATHY
            I m taking you home.

                            KRISTOPHER
                      (meekly)
            Oh. Okay.
                      (beat)
            Does that mean you want to pose
            for me?

Cathy makes a sound as if she d gladly strangle him, and
yanks him at harder. They move off across the park
together, Kristopher stumbling along beside her.

                                                          CUT TO:



The streets shine, dark and wet, but there s still plenty
of foot traffic as Cathy and Kristopher walk through the
Village, back toward the artist s usual haunts. Kristopher
is several steps in front, walking backwards so he faces
Cathy, almost skipping, and gesturing widely with his hands
as he talks. Other pedestrians have to detour to avoid
him, but he s almost oblivious.

                            KRISTOPHER
            You re still mad, aren t you?

                          CATHY
            You could even say furious.

            ... would you be here with me now?
            Would I have seen him?

                          CATHY
              I don t who you think you saw,
            but--

            Oh, yes you do. When are you
            going to tell me about him?

                          CATHY
            You are being very trying,
              Kristopher.

                            KRISTOPHER
              I can t help it. I m an - -

                          CATHY
            - - artist, yes, I know. Since
            when is invasion of privacy part
            of the creative process?

                            KRISTOPHER
            I had to follow my heart...

            Next time you may follow it right
            past the Louvre into city jail.

As they pass in front of the CAFE ARPEGGIO, a Village
coffee house, a SPRY OLD WOMAN in a beret exits.
Kristopher grabs her by the shoulders and dances her around
happily in a circle..

                            KRISTOPHER
            Did you hear that? She said next
            time! She s forgiven me!

The old woman breaks free and staggers away, looking at him
as if he s mad.

                            KRISTOPHER
            It s all right, I ve got artistic
            license. We re allowed to be peculiar...

                    (drily)
            Don t worry, we ll have him
              committed soon.

The old woman backs away quickly, shaking her head at both
of them. Cathy can t help smiling.

                            KRISTOPHER
            She s smiling. Yes, that s
            definitely a smile...

                            CATHY
              I thought you were shy.

                            KRISTOPHER
            I am large, I contain multitudes.
            Do you like expresso?

              Kristopher.

                            KRISTOPHER
              Cappuccino? Cafe au lait?
              Canoli? They have a zabaglione
            in here that will break your heart.

                            CATHY
                      (wearily)
              Kristopher...

                            KRISTOPHER
            Just an hour, that s all I want.
            Well, maybe two... I won t ever
            say a word about Vincent or bother
            you again.

Cathy gives him a long dubious glance and starts to shake
her head no. Kristopher grins his most child-like
disarming grin. Despite herself, Cathy begins to weaken.
As she begins to smile, we

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:                                                                              19.



Cathy looks a little dreamy as she doodles idly across the
pad. Joe s approach snaps her out of her reverie.


                            JOE
            Done with the Ketter breakdown?

                            CATHY
            I m about half way through. Give
            me a couple more hours...

                            JOE
              I thought you were going to finish
            it at home last night.

                            CATHY
                    Something came up...

                            JOE
            This something didn t have
            anything to do with that so-called
              artist, did it?

It did, of course; Cathy s reaction gives that away. Joe
Maxwell hesitates a moment, then continues awkwardly.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                26.

                    Ah, look, Cath... I don t know
                    how to say this, but... well...
                    I d stay clear of that guy, if
                    I were you. He s running some kind
                    of scam on you, Radcliffe.

                            CATHY
                    I don t know what you re talking
                    about. Kristopher s an artist.

                            JOE
                    Con artist, you mean. Look, he
                    told you he was Kristopher
                    Gentian, right?
                        (she nods)
                    Well, he can t be...

                            CATHY
                    What does that mean?

Joe looks a little embarrassed, but plunges on.

                            JOE
                    I had Escobar run a little check
                    on him...

                        (sheepish)
                    I know, I know, it s none of my
                    business, but... well... I was
                    worried.

Cathy doesn t know whether to be flattered, amused, or mad.
Joe rushes on before she can make up her mind.

                            JOE
                    You ought to be glad I made it
                    my business.
                        (beat)
                    Kristopher Gentian died almost
                    two years ago.

                                      ACT III

FADE IN


OPEN TIGHT on an old rusted PADLOCK, very formidable,
securing several HEAVY CHAINS across a set of doors.
Painted on the doors, in faded gilt turn-of-the-century
lettering, is CORRIGAN MOVING AND STORAGE, but a bright
yellow printed notice has been slapped across the name,
advising of a BANKRUPTCY SALE JULY 18 1987.

Catherine s hand ENTERS FRAME, touches the lock, tugs at it
in helpless frustration.. The chains rattle.

We PULL BACK to find her on a deserted street in front of
the warehouse. The windows are broken and boarded up.
Cathy s CAR is parked at the curb.

Cathy looks up and down, searching for a way inside the
warehouse. There s nothing; no way in. Frustrated, she
tries the chains once again for want of anything better to
do, but the padlock shows no sign of budging. At her wit s
end, Cathy returns to her car.

She opens the door, slides into the driver s seat, and is
just putting the key into the ignition when we HEAR the
metallic CLICK of the padlock opening. Cathy freezes and
looks over.                                                                              39.
40 CATHY S POV - THE DOOR 40

The padlock is wide open. As we watch, it slides OFF the
chain and hits the ground. The doors SWING OPEN a few
inches, in dead silence, and hang ajar. Within is nothing
but darkness and dust.

41 RESUME41

Cathy turns off the car and gets out. Slowly, warily, she
moves across the pavement, up the steps. She pushes at
the door.. It swings all the way open, revealing only dust
and darkness. Cathy stops, calls out.

                            CATHY
            Hello?

There s no answer.. She steps inside.


Jenny s desk is covered with manuscripts and galley proofs
of books in progress. A mug of coffee sits on top of one
manuscript while Jenny talks on her phone.

                            JENNY
            If he doesn t get the revisions
            in this week, we won t make the
            fall list. You tell him...

            him, okay? Later.

            Yes? Who? Of course she can come
            in...

Jenny starts to get up, looking pleased but curious, as
Cathy enters her office.

                            JENNY
            Hello stranger...

                            CATHY
            Sorry to pop in unannounced.

                            JENNY
            Are you kidding? I love it when
            you pop in unannounced... it
              doesn t happen often enough these
            days. Want some coffee?

                            CATHY
            No coffee... just help...
                        (off her curious look)
            All those art books you ve
              edited... you must know a few
              gallery owners.

                            JENNY
                        (laughs)
            Some of them a lot better than
            I ever wanted to..

                            CATHY
            I want to arrange a show. Can
            you help set it up?

                            JENNY
            Well, sure, I ve got a couple
            people owe me favors...
                        (beat, gets it)
            Is this for that guy? The one
            who wanted you to pose?

            Kristopher Geritian...

                            JENNY
            Did you do it? My god, you did
            it... you have to tell me
              everything... Is he any good?
            And how s his painting? What
            should I tell the galleries?

                            CATHY
                        (wry)
            Tell them he s better than good.
            He s dead...

OFF Jenny Aronson s baffled reaction, we

Jenny and Cathy are the last to leave. They say their
goodbyes on the sidewalk in front of the gallery as the
lights begin to go off behind them.

                            JENNY -
            It went great. Don t you think
            it went great? I didn t know they
            made artists like Kristopher any
            more.

                            CATHY
            They don t...

Jenny hails a TAXI. It brakes to a stop.

                            JENNY
            Want to share?
                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                  50.

                            CATHY
            No. I feel like walking. The
              night s so lovely...
                        (hugs goodbye)
            Thanks for everything..

                            JENNY
            You take care now.

Jenny climbs into the cab. Cathy watches her drive off,
then starts down the street with a dreamy smile on her
face. But she hasn t gotten more than a few feet when the
gallery owner pops out of the front door, carrying a large
painting carefully wrapped in cloth..

                                GALLERY OWNER
            Oh, Cathy darling, I was so afraid
            you d gone... here...

He thrusts the painting at her. She s baffled.

                            CATHY
            What s this?

                            GALLERY OWNER
            Well, I couldn t say for certain,
            but whatever it is, it s yours.
            It turned up when  we were rooting
            about in that dreadful
              warehouse... way in back, all
            sealed up, but it has your name
            on it, see?
                          (he shows her)
            I put it aside for you.

                            GALLERY OWNER (Cont d)
            Did you know the artist when he
            was alive? Oh, well, you must
            have, of course, never mind.
            Enjoy.

He hurries back inside the gallery and leaves Cathy
standing on under a streetlight, holding the canvas. Off
her mystified expression, we

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:                                                                              51.
