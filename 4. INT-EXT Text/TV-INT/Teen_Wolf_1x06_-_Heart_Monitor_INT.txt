      Scott drags plastic bags full of groceries into a dimly lit 
      parking garage. But after a moment of walking the rows, he 
      pauses. With several confused glances it becomes obvious: he 
      can t remember where he parked.

                                  SCOTT
                    Crap.

      Hurrying forward, he looks from car to car. Then comes to a 
      halt, still lost. He starts back the other way when--

      He stops again. Putting the bags down, he pulls out his 
      mother s car keys. He holds them up, clicking the alarm 
      button. 

      While listening for the BEEP, a plastic bottle of MILK rolls 
      out of one of the bags. Scott moves to grab it but it slips 
      under a car. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Dammit.

      He kneels down to reach under, feeling blindly beneath the 
      car. Then something odd happens...

      The bottle rolls back.

      Milk SPURTS onto the pavement from PUNCTURED HOLES in its 
      side. Scott stares at the bottle as it drifts to a stop.

      Visibly trembling now, he slowly rises to a standing 
      position, turns and--

      RUNS FOR IT. 

      Pounding the pavement, he shoots a terrified glance back to 
      see A DARK SHAPE HURTLE OUT from behind a parked car. Loping 
      on all fours, it s coming right for him.

      Scott tears around the next corner. Diving into the shadows 
      between columns, he holds still.             TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/112.

      When he peers out, he sees nothing but parked cars. The 
      garage lies silent except for his own POUNDING HEART. He 
      gazes down at his chest all too aware of the THUMPING. 

      Closing his eyes, he tries to calm his breathing. But his 
      heart just won t settle. Then he hears something else...

      A low animal GROWL. An ominous rumble that stops him 
      breathing. The source coming closer, moving between cars, 
      hurtling forward as--

      Scott darts of out of the shadows just ahead. Taking another 
      corner, he glances about, an idea forming.

      He leaps onto the hood of a car, bouncing up and off it. The 
      ALARM starts blaring. He bumps another car, ricocheting off 
      it and into--

      AN SUV, its alarm howling now as well. Scott keeps hitting 
      cars, a CACOPHONY of BEEPS and WAILING ALARMS filling the lot 
      and masking his pounding heart.

      He pulls in between two vehicles, listening. He can t hear 
      anything now but HORNS AND SIRENS. It s working.

      Until he hears a RINGING in his jacket. Scott pulls out his 
      phone just as--

      SOMETHING YANKS HIM UP right into the air, twisting him up 
      and SLAMMING HIM ONTO THE PAVEMENT.

      It s Derek. Scowling down at him with disappointment.

                                  DEREK
                    You re dead.

      An angry Scott follows Derek through the garage.

                                  SCOTT
                    What the hell was that?

                                  DEREK
                    I said I was going to teach you. I 
                    didn t say when.

                                  SCOTT
                    You scared the crap out of me.

      Derek turns to him and takes a whiff of the air.

                                  DEREK
                    Not yet.

                    just stop? Please?

                    were bitten. Teaching someone who 
                    was bitten takes time. I m not even

      Derek grabs him, pulling his PHONE out of his coat pocket. He 
      turns it around to show the display: MISSED CALL: ALLISON.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    This is why I caught you. You want

      Derek lifts the phone up to throw it--

                    Woah, wait, wait--

      Too late. Derek hurls the phone. Scott flinches, eyes 
      squeezing shut as he HEARS the smash and crunch of plastic 
      hitting cement. He turns to Derek with a furious glare.

                                  DEREK
                    Getting angry? That s your first 
                    lesson. You want to learn how to 
                    control this? How to shift? You do 
                    it through anger. By tapping into a 
                    primal, animal rage. You can t do 
                    that with her around.

                    I can get angry.

                                  DEREK
                    Not angry enough. This is the only 
                    way I can teach you. Can you stay 
                    away from her at least until after 
                    the full moon?

      Scott and Allison fall onto her bed, kissing and touching 
      each other with every imaginable ounce of teenage desire. As 
      she puts her lips to his neck, his hand reaches up the back 
      of her shirt, fingers finding their way underneath her black

                    Okay, then you first.

      She stops him, pulling his shirt up. Almost hyperventilating 
      in anticipation Scott helps her lift the shirt over his head. 
      Her fingers draw lightly down his chest making him tremble. 
      Tracing the lines of his stomach she grasps his belt, pulling 
      him back down to her and into a kiss. 

      Then slipping on top of him, she draws his hands up her lower 
      back and underneath her shirt to her bra clasp.

      But he fumbles with it, trying to unhook the clasp under her 
      shirt as she goes at his ear. And then HIS CLAWS slip right 
      through the soft fabric. Scott stares at them in horror.

      He yanks his hand out and Allison s bra with it. But his 
      fingers are back to normal now.

      Then, bringing his lips to hers, he slides his now human 
      fingers over her skin and up her shirt when--

      SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.

      Panicked, Allison darts up and off the bed.

                    Just a second.

      Moving quickly, she pulls Scott up, tossing his shirt right 
      into his face. She motions for him to get in the closet. As 
      she shuts the door on him--            TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/116.

      drawing something in the moisture.

      Scott watches, staring through the window as the hand pulls 
      back into the darkness. A moment later the Alpha is gone,

      FADE IN:


      Scott hurries into his room, slams the door shut and locks 
      it. Then goes to each window, locking them as well. He pulls 
      the shades. Breathing hard, he turns around and--

      SCREAMS. Derek stands right in front of him.

                                  SCOTT
                    You seriously need to stop doing 
                    that.

                                  DEREK
                    What happened? Did he talk to you?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah, we had a nice conversation 
                    about the weather.

      Derek stares at him, unmoving, unblinking.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    No. He didn t talk.

                                  DEREK
                    Did you get anything off him? An 
                      impression?

                                  SCOTT
                    What do you mean?

                                  DEREK
                    Focused on you?

                                  SCOTT
                    Not me. But definitely anger. I 
                    could feel it. Especially when he 
                    drew the spiral.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1111.

                    He drew a spiral onto my car 
                    window. In the condensation. What? 
                    You have this look like you know 
                    what it means.

                                  DEREK
                    It s nothing.

      Derek goes for the door, opening it.

                                  SCOTT
                    Whoa, wait a second. You can t do 
                    that. You can t ask me to trust you 
                    and then just keep things to 
                    yourself.

                                  DEREK
                    It doesn t mean anything.

                                  SCOTT
                    You buried your sister under a 
                    spiral. What does it mean?

      Derek pauses, looking as if he might actually tell him.

                                  DEREK
                    You don t want to know.

      Now he leaves. This time Scott lets him go. Alone again, he 
      sits down on his bed, slowly falling back onto the sheets. 
      Exhausted, he closes his eyes--


      And blinks them open in the busy corridor of the school.

                                  SCOTT
                          (whispering to himself)
                    Stay away from Allison. Stay away 
                    from Allison.

      He starts to turn a corner when he spots Allison coming right 
      toward him. Scott whirls around, going back the other way.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)

      Jackson comes out of a classroom, heading toward him. Scott 
      spins back again.

                    Hey, Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    Oh, come on!


      Scott slips inside a classroom with a relieved breath. 
      Glancing around, he sees Stiles. But as soon as Stiles sees 
      him, he looks away.

                                  SCOTT
                    You still not talking to me?

      Stiles ignores Scott as he takes the seat behind him. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Can you at least tell me if your 
                    Dad is okay? It was just a bruise,

                    Okay, what if I told you that I m 
                    trying to figure this out? And that 
                    I went to Derek for help.

                                  STILES
                    If I was talking to you, I d tell 
                    you that you re an idiot for 
                    trusting him. But obviously I m not 
                    talking to you.

      The room settles for the beginning of class. Stiles opens his 
      notebook, pen poised for note taking. Then, unable to stand 
      it, he whips his head around.

      drawing to Lydia. The Beast stands enshrouded in mist, a 
      powerful monster peering out of the darkness with red eyes 
      and sharp claws. Bodies of women and children lie at its 
      feet, looks of pure terror frozen onto their dead faces.

      Lydia stares at the macabre drawing. Gazing at it, as if

                    I mean it smells like something s 
                    rotting. Or dying...

      As Scott follows Stiles out, a pale Jackson steps from 
      between the lockers, watching them go. Circles under his 
      eyes, lips dry and cracked, the usually handsome young man 
      looks frighteningly sick.

      Alone, he approaches the mirrors and twists around to try to 
      view the back of his neck.

      Pulling his shirt off to get a better look, he brings a hand 
      up to the bandage. He feels at it with his fingertips. The 
      gauze has turned a SICKENING YELLOW.

      The bandage peels off and he lets it slip to the sink.

      He touches the marks, fingers coming back with a strange pus 
      on the tips. Overcome by nausea, Jackson gags, eyes squeezing 
      shut.

      Then, gripping the sink with both hands, he begins to retch, 
      mouth opening as if to vomit. And then...

      SOMETHING STARTS TO COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

      A clawed finger. Then two and three. Like the claws of a 
      crab, grasping at the air, trying to find something to hold 
      onto while seeking their way out of Jackson s mouth as-- 

      He whips his head up to his reflection and suddenly 
      everything is normal again. Breathing hard and harsh gasps, 
      Jackson looks at himself.

      He feels at the nape of his neck, wiping away the excess 
      peroxide. All he sees in the mirror now is his own face. 

      The frightened eyes of a teenage boy.


      Books piled beside her, Allison sits under her locker in the 
      corridor while reading. A few remaining students amble their 
      way down the hall in between periods.

      Allison remains transfixed by her book when one person slowly 
      approaches and stops to look down at her.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1123.

                    Oh, hey. Just stuff for a history

      He drops his bag and sits next to her under the lockers. 
      Uncomfortably close to her.

                    like I ve been a jerk. To you. And

                    serious. But I m not so sure you re 
                    being sincere.

      Allison turns back to her book. Jackson takes the seat beside 
      her, not letting it go.

                    Whoever he is, he s an Alpha now. 
                    But one without a pack. Which means 
                    he s not as strong. I can take him. 
                    But I have to find him first. Give 
                    me a sign if you know anything. Is 
                    it one of us? Did someone else 
                    survive the fire?

      Still no response. No movement of any kind.

                    If you know anything, just blink. 
                    Raise a finger. Anything...

      He waits. But his uncle simply stares.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Say something!

      The words thunder out of Derek as he grips his uncles hands 
      practically trying to shake a response out of him.

      Derek whips his head around to see his uncle s nurse, 
      Jennifer, standing in the door.        TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1132A.

                    yelling at him is going to get a

      Scott and Stiles sit in the otherwise empty classroom while 
      Mr. Harris reads the paper. Pulling a wad of tissues away 
      from his nose, Scott turns to Harris.

                                  SCOTT
                    Excuse me, sir, I know it s

                    get fired.

      Harris ignores him. Scott sits quietly with Stiles. Then 
      turns to whisper to him.

                    You have something, Scott. Whether

                    things other people can t. That

                    I know. And I will.

      Harris eyes them over his newspaper. Then puts it down.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    All right. Both of you. Out of

      Looking over paperwork, Deaton hears the CHIMES on his door

      He looks up to see not Scott, but Derek entering.

                    Three months ago. The deer...

      He unfolds the piece of paper left on his windshield. It s a 
      report and photograph of a dead deer with A SPIRAL carved 
      into its side.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    See that mark. You remember that?

                    Ah, yes. It was just a deer. And I 
                    didn t find it. They called me 
                    because they wanted to know if I d 
                    seen anything like it.

                                  DEREK

                    I told them no.

      Derek turns his head ever-so-slightly.

                                  DEREK
                    Did you hear that?

                    It s the sound of you lying.

      Derek moves like a bolt of lightning, hands grabbing Deaton 
      by the coat and dragging him forward.


      Deaton blinks his eyes open. There is a bruise and cut now 
      under his eye. He glances around to find himself bound to a 
      rolling chair.

                                  DEATON
                    Oh God...

      Derek comes out of the shadows.

                    Are you protecting someone?

                                  DEATON
                    Okay, all right. The key to the 
                    drug locker is in my pocket.

                                  DEREK
                    I don t want drugs. I want to know 
                    why you re lying.

                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about--

      Derek reaches out, grabbing him by the jacket. He lifts 
      Deaton up, chair still attached to him. With his feet 
      dangling below him. Derek brings him up to view Deaton s 
      face, bruise under his eye. 

                                  DEREK
                    You re not healing.

      CLAWED HAND grabs him by the wrist. Whipping his head around, 
      Derek looks at Scott-- 

      FULLY TRANSFORMED.

      With a vise-like grip on Derek s wrist, Scott opens his mouth 
      wide, baring his fangs and letting LOOSE a VICIOUS SNARL.

      Derek actually blinks in surprise. Scott lets him go. Then, 
      with an extraordinary display of control, he transforms 
      back... 

      The claws retract into his fingers. His teeth withdraw, 
      changing shape and returning to normal. The yellow GLOW in
