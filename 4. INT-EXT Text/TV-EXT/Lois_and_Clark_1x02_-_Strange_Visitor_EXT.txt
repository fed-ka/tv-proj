
	Lois and Clark walk down the steps.  Lois checks Clark out.
	He looks dazed.  Clark really wants to follow up the Small-
	ville connection.  Lois really wants to work the story by
	herself.  What they say is:

				CLARK
		You know, Lois, I'm not feeling
		that great.  Maybe I should go
		home and lie down.

				LOIS
			(overly sincere)
		Sometimes you have to put yourself
		above the story.

				CLARK
		I don't want to leave you in the
		lurch.

				LOIS
		You're not.  It's not like we're
		a team or anything.  Do you want
		a ride?

				CLARK
		I'll walk.  Maybe the fresh air
		will help.

	Lois indicates a nearby phone booth.

				LOIS
		I think I'll make some calls.

				CLARK
		I'll meet you back at the paper.

				LOIS
		Sure.  Feel better.

	Clark takes off.  Lois moves to the phone.  As soon as they
	think the other is no longer watching, they both walk faster.
	Lois gets to the phone booth, begins punching out a number.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		Jimmy?  Lois.  I want you to pull
		everything on a George Thompson.

	She notices Thompson exiting, going to a waiting sedan.
	Lois hangs up, moves into the street to hail a cab in
	order to follow. As she does, there's a growing commotion
	on the street and people point and shout.

				VARIOUS
		Look! What is that? It's
		Superman. You're kidding. It's
		him all right.

	Lois looks up into the sky, sees the red and blue costume
	streaking across Metropolis. She says quietly:

				LOIS
		Be careful up there.

					CUT TO:


	16

	SUPERMAN, in full costume, STREAKS ACROSS THE SKY. As we
	pick him up in flight, he's moving with the speed of a
	light plane.

	He's in a hurry, however, and he stretches his arms out fully
	in front of him, and begins to pick up speed... as fast as
	a commercial airline ... then a jet aircraft... and finally,
	he disappears into a point of light, arcing across the
	horizon.


	17

	A sign on the building proclaims, "Bessolo Discount Used
	Office Furniture." The sedan stops in front of the building
	and Thompson exits.  A cab pulls up, drops Lois off.

	Under the light of the full moon, Clark, Jonathan and
	Martha stand at the crash site. Jonathan paces from a tree
	with a pioneer wagon wheel leaned up against it, putting
	one foot after another in front of him.

				JONATHAN
		68 paces due north.  Thirteen
		paces West.

	Clark and Martha stand together, watching.

				MARTHA
		Are you sure this is the right
		place?

				JONATHAN
		That's the wagon wheel.  Hasn't
		moved in over twenty-five years.

	Martha sees Clark's worried face.

				MARTHA
		Are you okay, son?  I know this
		must be hard on you.

				CLARK
		What's hard is not knowing.  My	*
		parents had to give me up.  Why?	*
		Where are they?	*

	Martha looks away, hurt in her eyes.  Clark tries to cover.

				CLARK (Cont'd)
		You and Dad are my parents.  You
		know that.  Nobody will ever
		replace you.

				MARTHA
		Oh, we know, Clark.  You wouldn't
		be human if you didn't have
		questions.

				CLARK
		Mom, what if I'm not human?

				MARTHA
		Maybe we shouldn't have told you
		about being adopted.

				CLARK
		That would've been hard after I
		started bench pressing cars.

	Clark smiles at Martha and she smiles back.  Jonathan
	finishes the last few steps.  Points at the ground.

				JONATHAN
		Six feet down.

	Clark takes off his jacket, hands it to Martha.  He moves
	to where Jonathan stands, indicates his father should step
	back.  Clark begins to SPIN LIKE A TOP, faster and faster.
	As he does, the dirt flies away and a hole is quickly formed.
	From the bottom, we hear:

				CLARK (O.S.)
		Dad, you sure about this?

				JONATHAN
		Hundred percent.  Right there.

	Clark LEVITATES out of the hole.  Clark, Martha and Jonathan
	stare over the edge into the deep hole.  Completely empty.

				JONATHAN (Cont'd)
		You don't forget something like
		this.  It was here!

	Clark lowers his glasses and scans the area with his x-ray
	vision.

				CLARK
		Not anymore.

	And, off the eerie realization that the spacecraft has been
	stolen, we:

					FADE OUT.

		And the General thought this was

	In free fall. Her face is scrunched up in telepathic
	concentration.

				LOIS
			(muttering).
		Superman, if you can hear me,
		drop everything and get over
		here.
			(then)
		Superman!!!! Help!!!

	Also in free fall. Clark, however, has more maneuver-

	Suddenly appearing from the other side of the cloud bank!
	Pauses momentarily in midflight to get his bearings, sees
	Lois, and zooms toward her.

	A guided missile fires off from the jet. Target: Superman.

					CUT TO:


	Lois continues to hurtle earthward.

				LOIS
		Superman... Superman... Superman
		... Superman... Superman...

	In the distance, she sees Superman, closing fast.
	Intersects her and scoops her in his arms.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		You do read minds.

				SUPERMAN
		Not really. But I do have pretty
		good hearing.

		Don't worry. I'll go back for him.

	57

	Superman deposits Lois on the rooftop. She looks shell-
	shocked.

				SUPERMAN
		You'll be all right?

	Lois can't speak, but her eyes are wide-wide.

				SUPERMAN (Cont'd)
		Lois?

	Lois can't speak, just points skyward. Superman turns
	around and sees:


58	GUIDED MISSILE				
	58

	Currently being guided after Superman, who's on the roof of
	the Planet.


59	SUPERMAN

	Superman shoots off the roof, toward an intersection with
	the missile.

					CUT TO:

	A crowd of onlookers all have their eyes on the sky, AD
	LIBBING expressions of concern. Jimmy is on his way in,
	stops and looks up to:

	Lois watches this.  Closes her eyes.  She knows nothing of
	invulnerability and auras.  All she knows is a man she has
	begun to care about, a man who saved her life, a good man,
	may be gone.
