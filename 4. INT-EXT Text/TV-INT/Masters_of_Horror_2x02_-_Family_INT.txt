      The music is a little louder here, but still somewhat muted.  
      The first floor of the house is immaculately clean and 
      tastefully decorated.  All the blinds are open, flooding the 
      big living room with sunlight.  Back behind the living room 
      there is a big spacious kitchen where pots and pans hang over 
      an island stove.  Next to the big shiny silver refrigerator 
      there is a closed door with a key lock on it.  The music 
      seems to be coming from the other side of the door.


      The music is much louder in here, no longer muted.  It is 
      also much darker in here.  Somewhere unseen, a man whistles 
      along with the music.  The basement is huge.  Across from a 
      small flight of wooden stairs there are a few small windows 
      at the top of the wall, all hidden behind thick black 
      curtains.  There are two light fixtures on the low ceiling, 
      spaced about fifteen feet apart, though neither puts off much 
      light.

      Below the covered windows sits a long wooden workbench where 
      a radio with a cassette player sits, playing the classical 
      music.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                      "Family"  2.

        CONTINUED:33

      The workbench goes all the way down to the far wall of the 
      basement and wraps around in a sort of backwards L shape.  
      Beyond the end of the L there is another large room where a 
      man in his early-fifties, HAROLD THOMPSON, sits in a wooden 
      chair in front of a large steel tub.  He wears a long black 
        rubber-apron and long black rubber-gloves that go all the way 
      up to his elbows.

      He whistles along with the music as he pours something from a 
      big metal bottle into the tub.  There is a small hiss as the 
      liquid hits something, and little tendrils of smoke rise from 
      the tub.  Harold empties the bottle, then gets up and goes to 
      the workbench where there are dozens more of the metal 
      bottles.

      In the steel tub lies the naked dead body of an old man, his 
      face half-decomposed from the acid that Harold has just 
      poured on him.

      Harold returns with another bottle and pours it on the rest 
      of the old man's face, burning the skin away and exposing 
      little patches of the white bone underneath.  A small alarm 
      clock on the workbench goes off.  Harold looks over at it.  
      It reads: 1:00.  He pours the rest of the acid into the tub, 
      then smiles down at the old man.

                                  HAROLD
                    Time for lunch, Dad.

      He puts the empty bottle down and begins taking off his 
      gloves and apron.


      Harold looks through his mail as he walks to the kitchen 
      where a pot of soup is boiling on the stove.                                                                      "Family"  3.




      Harold carries a wooden tray with his food and drink on it 
      out of the kitchen and down a short hallway where there is a 
      back stairwell.


      Harold comes off the top stair to the landing of the second 
      floor where there is a long dark hallway.  He walks down it, 
      past closed doors on both sides, and enters a second living 
      room where a woman with long brown hair, JANE THOMPSON, sits 
      in a chair next to a standing lamp, reading a magazine, her 
      back to him.  All the windows are covered by heavy black 
      curtains in this part of the house.

                                  HAROLD
                          (carrying his tray)
                    Looks like we've got some new 
                    neighbors at the Harper's old 
                    place.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    Oh yeah?  That's good.  Maybe 
                    they'll be quieter than the Harpers 
                    were.

      Harold puts his tray down on the coffee-table in front of the 
      couch.

                                  JANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Coming and going at all hours of 
                    the night.

      Harold sits on the couch and looks to the opposite side of 
      the room where there is a little girl with blonde hair, SARAH 
      THOMPSON, in a little green dress, sitting on the floor in 
      front of the television, her back to him.

                                  HAROLD
                    You're sitting too close to the 
                      television again, Sarah.  Move 
                    back.

      Sarah doesn't move or respond to him.  He sighs and gets up 
      and walks over to her.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Come on, honey.  You know that's 
                    bad for your eyes.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                      "Family"  4.

        CONTINUED:77


      He reaches down and drags her back a few feet, then walks 
      around her and grabs the remote control from the top of the 
      television.

                                  SARAH (O.S.)
                    When is Grandpa going to get here?

      He turns to her, and we see her face for the first time:  
      Underneath that blonde hair there is no face, only a small 
      human skull.  He smiles at her.

                                  HAROLD
                    Oh in the next day or so.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    So soon?

      Harold looks over at Jane, and we see her for the first time:  
      Underneath her brown hair there is also a skull.  Her hands 
      are just skeletal bones wired together, holding the magazine 
      in place.

                                  HAROLD
                          (walking to the couch)
                    It's not going to take as long as I 
                    thought it would.

      He sits down on the couch and begins to eat his soup.

                                                              CUT TO:


      There are boxes everywhere, and the furniture is stacked and 
      pushed up against the walls.  Celia, her hair in a ponytail, 
      stands in the kitchen, unloading glasses and putting them 
      into a cabinet next to the sink.  David comes in carrying a 
      box, a frown on his face.

                                  DAVID
                    I found another kitchen box in the 
                    bedroom.

                                  CELIA
                    So much for labeling everything for 
                    the movers.

                                  DAVID
                          (angry)
                    I fucking hate moving!

      Celia looks over at him.

                                  CELIA
                    Why are you so uptight?

                                  DAVID
                    I don't know.
                          (sighs)
                    I thought this would be...I don't 
                    know.

      Celia puts down the glass in her hand and goes to him.

                                  CELIA
                    What is it?

                                  DAVID
                    I thought I would feel different 
                    now that we've moved here.  But I 
                    don't.  I'm 
                          still...unsure...scared...I don't 
                    know.

      She takes his face in her hands.

                                  CELIA
                    This is going to be a new start for 
                    us.  A new beginning.

                                  DAVID
                    I know.

      She kisses him.

                                  DAVID (CONT'D)
                    I just can't stop thinking that 
                    this could all be a huge mistake.

      She frowns, but turns it quickly into a smile.

                                  CELIA
                    You're just tired.  Why don't we 
                    stop for awhile and go get 
                    something to eat?

                                  DAVID
                    A drink sounds better.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                      "Family"  6.

                          (smiles at him)
                    How about both?

      He nods and forces a smile.


      It is completely dark outside as David drives.  Celia sits in 
      the passenger seat, her eyes closed.  Celia stirs and looks 
      over at him.

                                  CELIA
                          (yawns)
                    Where are we?

                                  DAVID
                          (a slight slur in his 
                            speech)
                    We're almost home.  Those two 
                    glasses of wine really put you 
                    down.

                                  CELIA
                    I'm not usually such a lightweight.

                                  DAVID
                    The move's been hard on you.

                                  CELIA
                    You were sure sucking down those 
                    martinis.

                                  DAVID
                    Liquid courage.

      She reaches out and caresses his face.

                                  CELIA
                    It's all going to be all right.  
                    You'll see.

      He takes her hand and kisses it.  She closes her eyes again.


      David looks over at Celia.

                                  DAVID
                    Are you all right?

                                  CELIA
                    I think so.  Are you?

      David nods and opens his car door.


      Celia and David sit in the living room, looking around at the 
      tastefully decorated room as Harold comes in from the kitchen 
      carrying a tray of coffee.

                                  CELIA
                    I love your house.  Did your wife 
                    decorate it herself?

      Harold smiles as he puts the tray down.

                                  HAROLD
                    No, I'm afraid I'm just an old 
                    bachelor.
                          (looks around proudly)
                    I did the whole house myself.

                                  CELIA
                          (follows his gaze)
                      Impressive.

      Harold pours a cup and hands it to Celia.

                                  DAVID
                    If I had to decorate our place by 
                    myself, it'd look like squatters 
                    had moved in.

      Harold pours another cup and hands it to David.

                                  HAROLD
                          (to both of them)

                                  CELIA
                    No thank you.

      David shakes his head no.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                          (to Harold)
                    So what line of work are you in?

      Harold pours himself a cup.

                                  HAROLD
                    A type of independent salesman.  
                    It's a little hard to understand.
                          (pours some cream into his 
                            cup)
                    I make hunting and fishing 
                    licenses.

                                  DAVID
                    I love to hunt.  Maybe you could 
                    help me get a license.

                                  HAROLD
                          (stirs his coffee)
                    Well, I don't actually make or sell 
                    them.  I develop these exotic 
                    plastic films that the licenses are 
                    made on.

      Celia and David both look a little confused.  He reads their 
      look and smiles.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    It's a pretty specific line of 
                    work.  Not many people quite get 
                    it.  I like it though.  It allows 
                    me to work out of the house, which 
                    is nice.

      Harold takes a sip of his coffee.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  12.

                    That sounds like a fascinating job.

                                  CELIA
                    Kind of boring work to be honest, 
                    but sometimes it has its rewards.

                                  DAVID
                    I'm an ER doctor.

                                  HAROLD
                          (clearly impressed)
                    You must have started school young.

      David chuckles.

                                  DAVID
                    I'm older than I look.

                                  HAROLD
                    Are you already working here?

                                  DAVID
                    No, not yet.  I'm taking a little 
                    time off to get settled in before I 
                    start over at Westphal.

                                  HAROLD
                    That's a really good hospital.  Is 
                    that what brought you two all the 
                    way from California?

                                  DAVID
                    That and a few other things.

                                  HAROLD
                    Do you have any family here?

                                  DAVID
                          (shakes his head no)
                    Both our parents passed away a long 
                    time ago.

                                  CELIA
                    We figured this would be a nice 
                    place to start a family of our own.

      David looks uncomfortable and places his cup on the coffee-
      table.  Harold and Celia both notice.  There is an awkward 
      pause, and then Celia looks to Harold and breaks it...

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                    How did you know we came from 
                      California?

                                  HAROLD
                          (smiles)
                    You can certainly tell you're a 
                    reporter.

                                  CELIA
                    I'm sorry, I...

      Harold shakes his head with a smile and waves her off.

                                  HAROLD
                    I saw your license plate.  I used 
                    to live in California myself.  The 
                    L.A. area.

      Harold picks up the coffee pot and tops his cup off.

                                  CELIA (O.S.)
                    I'm not very satisfied sexually or 
                      emotionally.

      He looks up from his coffee to her.

                                  HAROLD
                          (startled)
                    I'm sorry...what did you say?

                                  CELIA
                    I said, where did you live in L.A.?

                                  HAROLD
                    Burbank.

      David and Celia look to each other and smile.

                                  CELIA
                    That's crazy.  We lived right down 
                    the road in Studio City.

                                  HAROLD
                          (smiles)
                    It guess it really is a small 
                    world.

                                  DAVID
                    I tell you though, we are so glad 
                    to be out of there.  Just too much 
                    crime.  Too much traffic.  Wasn't 
                    safe anywhere.

      Harold nods in agreement and looks to Celia, his eyes glazed 
      over in thought.  Her lips move, but they don't match the 
      words she is saying.

                                  CELIA (O.S.)
                    David has a really small penis.  I 
                    bet yours is big though.  Thick and 
                    long.  Isn't it?

      Celia has finished talking, and is looking at Harold 
        expectantly.

                                  CELIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    I'll suck your cock until you come 
                    so good.

      Harold's eyes widen a little.  Celia looks confused by his 
      expression.

                                  HAROLD
                          (snaps out of it)
                    I'm sorry.  I'm afraid I'm a little 
                    deaf in this ear.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  15.

                                  CELIA
                          (a little louder)
                    I was just saying how sorry we are 
                    about your mailbox.

                                  DAVID
                          (nods)
                    You've been very nice about it.

                                  HAROLD
                    Oh, it's nothing.  Gave me 
                    something to do.

                                  CELIA
                    We were very impressed that you 
                    fixed it so quickly.

      David looks to Celia and gives a little nod to the door when 
      Harold isn't looking.

                                  HAROLD
                          (shrugs)
                    I get up early and I had a bunch of 
                    bricks and mortar out back since 
                    I've been doing a little 
                      landscaping out there in my free 
                    time.

                                  DAVID
                    I'd feel better about it if you'd 
                    let me write you a check.

                                  HAROLD
                      I wouldn't hear of it.  Accidents 
                    happen.  The mailboxes are too 
                    close to the curb anyway, if you 
                    ask me.

      Celia puts her coffee cup down and stands.

                                  CELIA
                          (to David)
                    We should go.
                          (to Harold)
                    We've got a million things to do.

                                  HAROLD
                          (stands)
                    I bet you do.

      David stands and they all start to walk toward the front 
      door.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  16.

                                  DAVID
                          (to Harold)
                    You sure I can't give you...

                                  HAROLD
                          (waves him off)
                    Forget it.

      They reach the door and David opens it. Celia turns to 
      Harold.

                                  CELIA
                    How about we have you over for 
                    dinner when we're a little more 
                    settled?

                                  HAROLD
                          (smiles wide)
                    I would really like that.

      David and Celia smile back at him.

                                                              CUT TO:


      Harold stands over the big steel tub, wearing his long black 
      rubber-gloves.  The classical music plays from the little 
      radio.  The tub is full of reddish black goo.  He reaches 
      down into it with one arm and pulls out a Femur bone.  He 
      puts it into a steel pan and then sticks his arm back in the 
      goo, reaching around, then pulls out another bone, a Tibia.


      Harold stands at a big steel sink next to the workbench, 
      washing the bones off with a little hose and a scouring pad.


      The bones boil in several big metal pots sitting on several 
      big bunson-burners in the corner of the basement.


      Harold stands at his workbench, unspooling a ream of wire.  
      On the long workbench sits all the clean white bones of the 
      old man, all laid out.  Next to the bones there sits a pile 
      of neatly folded clothes and a grey wig.  He cuts a long 
      piece of wire off with a pair of wire-cutters.                                                                    "Family"  17.




      A perfect human skeleton lays. Harold finishes wiring it 
      together.


      Harold wires the skeleton to a big black metal stand.


      Harold takes the small pile of clothes from the workbench and 
      begins to dress the skeleton.


      Harold comes into dimly lit living room, a little out of 
      breath, carrying the skeleton of the old man, which is now on 
      a stand and fully dressed and wearing a grey wig.  The Jane 
      skeleton still sits next to the lamp in her chair, holding 
      her magazine, and the Sarah skeleton in the little green 
      dress still sits at her place in front of the television, 
      though it is now turned on.  Harold puts the old man's 
      skeleton down to the side of the entrance to the living room.

                                  HAROLD
                          (excited)
                    Hey everybody, guess who's here!?

                                  SARAH (O.S.)
                    Grandpa!  Grandpa!

                                  HAROLD
                          (laughs)
                    That's right!  Come give him a hug!

      Harold turns and suddenly Sarah gets up from the television, 
      now alive and a pretty little girl with long blonde hair.

                                  JANE
                    Grandpa!

      She runs past Jane, now also alive, and a very attractive 
      woman with long brown hair.  Jane stands and looks to Sarah 
      as she runs to Grandpa, now a real man with grey hair, and 
      hugs his legs.

                                    GRANDPA
                    Hey there, cutie.  Did you miss me?

      She looks up at him and nods excitedly.  He picks her up in 
      his arms and hugs her to him as she giggles.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  18.

      CONTINUED:2525

      Jane walks to Harold and puts an arm around him.  Harold 
      looks from Jane to Grandpa and Sarah, and smiles happily.

                                  HAROLD
                    Come on in and make yourself at 
                    home, Dad.  We've been waiting for 
                    you.


      Harold sits on the couch, reading a newspaper.  Grandpa sits 
      in the chair in the corner reading a book to Sarah as she 
      sits in his lap.  Jane flips through her magazine in the 
      other chair.

                                  JANE
                    You sure seemed to get along well 
                    with the new neighbors.

                                  HAROLD
                    The husband is a waste of skin, but 
                    I really like her.  Celia.  Pretty 
                    name, don't you think?

      Jane lowers her magazine and looks at him with a frown.

                                  JANE
                    I know what you're thinking and I 
                    would just stop this instant if I 
                    were you.

                                  HAROLD
                          (grins)
                    What?

                                  JANE
                    You know what.  We don't need 
                    anymore family members.  We have 
                    enough.

                                  HAROLD
                    I agree.

      Sarah looks up from the book Grandpa is holding in front of 
      her.

                                  SARAH
                    But Daddy, you said Grandma was 
                    going to come soon.

                                  HAROLD
                    She is honey, don't worry.  We're 
                    talking about something else.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  19.

      Sarah goes back to the book with Grandpa.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                          (to Jane)
                    You sound jealous.  It's not that 
                    I'm attracted to her.

                                  JANE
                    Yes you are.

                                  HAROLD
                    No, I'm not.

      Jane's frown deepens.

                                  JANE
                    It's too close to home, Harold.  
                    It's too risky.

      Harold thinks about it for a moment.

                                  HAROLD
                    I think the husband saw the bones.

                                  JANE
                    You want to think he saw the bones. 
                    You know he didn't.

                                  HAROLD
                    I don't see how he could have 
                    missed them.

                                  JANE
                    It was dark, he was probably drunk.  
                    You saw how bloodshot his eyes were 
                    when they came over here.

      Harold frowns and folds his paper.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    And if he did, they wouldn't have 
                    come over here to have coffee with 
                    you.  He would have gone to the 
                    police.  All that crap about crime 
                    in L.A.

                                  HAROLD
                    L.A.'s not so bad.  After all 
                    that's where we met.

                                  JANE
                    You should be careful with him.  
                    There's something brewing behind 
                    those eyes.  He could be dangerous 
                    to you.

                                  HAROLD
                    Oh, you worry too much.  I can take 
                    care of myself.

      Harold opens his paper and begins to read.

                                  JANE
                          (sighs)
                    You're going to do it anyway, 
                    aren't you?

                                  HAROLD
                          (behind his paper)
                    Do what?

                                  JANE
                    Harold.

                                  HAROLD
                          (annoyed)
                    That's enough, Jane.

                                  JANE
                    You need to really thi...

      Harold lowers his paper and looks at her.

                                  HAROLD
                          (darkly)
                    Drop it.

      Jane frowns and goes back to flipping through her magazine.

                                                              CUT TO:


      Harold, wearing a nice suit and tie, kills the engine, and 
      looks out his window at the mall entrance.  Beside him is a 
      nice leather briefcase.                                                                    "Family"  21.




      It is dark out now as Harold drives, lost in thought.  The 
      old woman lays on the back-seat with a blanket over her.  
      Outside the city lights go by.  Suddenly there are flashing 
      lights behind him.  He looks in the rear-view mirror and sees 
      a police car following him.  He looks at the speedometer.

                                  OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                    You weren't paying attention.  You 
                    were speeding.

      Harold eyes the police car in the rear-view mirror, worried.

                                  HAROLD
                    Oh my God.

      Harold slowly reaches over and opens the glove compartment, 
      where there is a revolver.  He takes the gun out and puts it 
      in his lap.  Behind him the police car blasts its siren.

                                  OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                    He doesn't know what you've done.  
                    I look asleep back here.

      Harold pulls his car over and stops on the side of the road.  
      He watches in the rear-view as the police car pulls over 
      behind him and stops.

                                  OLD WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    You can get out of this.

      Harold raises the gun in front of him and puts it under his 
      chin.  In the rear-view, the POLICE OFFICER gets out of his 
      car, carrying a flashlight.

                                  HAROLD
                    All I wanted was my own family.

      Harold's finger lingers on the trigger.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  24.

                                  OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                    You've got to think of them, 
                    Harold.  What would they do without 
                    you?

      Harold watches the Officer walk toward his car, and then 
      quickly lowers the gun and hides it underneath his seat.  
      Harold rolls down his window as the Officer walks up and 
      shines his flashlight on Harold's face.

                                    OFFICER
                    License and registration.

      As Harold leans over to the glove compartment, the Officer 
      shines his flashlight into the back of the car where the old 
      woman lays: she does look like she is sleeping.

                                  HAROLD
                    I'm sorry if I was speeding 
                    Officer.  I was trying to get my 
                    mother home.

      Harold hands out his registration paper to the Officer.  The 
      Officer takes it and shines his light on it.  Harold fishes 
      his wallet out of his coat pocket.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    We had a family reunion out in 
                    Thurman today.  The drive back 
                    really put her out.  She's just 
                      exhausted.

      Harold hands the Officer his license.  The Officer looks at 
      it and then looks at Harold.

                                    OFFICER
                    Your mother sure is a heavy 
                    sleeper.

                                  HAROLD
                    It's been a really long day for 
                    her, lots of excitement at the 
                    reunion.

      The Officer looks back at her and then looks to Harold and 
      smiles.

                                    OFFICER
                    You go ahead and get her home Mr. 
                    Thompson.

      He hands Harold his license and registration.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  25.

                                    OFFICER (CONT'D)
                    Just watch your speed.

                                  HAROLD
                    Yes sir.

      The Officer walks away as Harold rolls his window up.

                                  OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                    You did good, son.


      The house looks a little more lived in now, and almost all 
      the boxes are gone.  The furniture is all arranged in the 
      living room and in the dining room, and a few pictures hang 
      on the walls here and there.

      David sits in the floor of the hallway bathroom, attaching a 
      new toilet seat to the commode.  He finishes screwing it in 
      and then tests it by opening and closing it.  The old toilet 
      seat sits on the bathroom counter.

                                  CELIA (O.S.)
                          (calls to him)
                    David.

                                  DAVID
                          (getting up)
                    Yeah?

                                  CELIA (O.S.)
                    You coming to bed?

      He picks up the old toilet seat and puts it in a trash bag.

                                  DAVID
                    Just about.  I'm almost done.

      He turns on the faucet and starts to wash his hands.


      David enters.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  26.

                                  DAVID
                    Well, all the toilet seats are 
                    repla...

      He walks into the bedroom and sees Celia laying on the bed 
      dressed in sexy black lingerie.  She looks at him 
        seductively.

                                  CELIA
                    Come here, handsome.

      He frowns.

                                  DAVID
                    I need to take a shower.  That was 
                    kind of disgusting work.

                                  CELIA
                          (sits up)
                    Come here.  I like you dirty.

                                  DAVID
                    Not now, Celia.

      David walks toward the bathroom.

                                  CELIA
                          (softly)
                    David, please come here.

      He looks to her, and then walks over to the bed and sits down 
      next to her.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                    What's wrong?

                                  DAVID
                    I'm not ready for this, not yet.

                                  CELIA
                    Why not?

      He looks at her for a long moment, and then sighs.

                                  DAVID
                    I'm not sure I'm really ready to 
                    have another child.

                                  CELIA
                    But you said you were.  You even 
                    told me to stop taking my pills.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  27.

                          (he shakes his head)
                    Not yet.

                            (frustrated)
                    David, I need you to fully commit 
                    to this.  To all of it.

      He looks away from her, but she takes his face in her hands, 
      and makes him look at her.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                    You can't back out on me now.  Not 
                    now.  We've planned all this for 
                    years.

                                  DAVID
                    I know.  I just need a little more 
                    time.

      She lets go of his face and lays back on the bed, looking at 
      the ceiling, clearly upset.  He tries to touch her arm, but 
      she pulls away and turns over.  He frowns and rubs his face.


      Harold, wearing his rubber-gloves and apron, kneels beside 
      the steel tub, pouring acid into it.  The radio on the 
      workbench plays classical music.

                                    GRANDMA (O.S.)
                    I am so happy to finally be here, 
                    Harold.

      Harold smiles down at the tub and the old woman with silver 
      hair looks up from inside the tub, and smiles back at him.

                                  HAROLD
                    I know you are, Mom.

      Instead of the bottle of acid, Harold's hands now hold a bar 
      of soap and a washrag as he washes her back with them.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  28.

                    I'm going to be such a good mother 
                    to you.  Better than that lousy 
                    whore that gave birth to you ever 
                    was.

                                  HAROLD
                    You shouldn't talk that way, Mom.  
                    It's not dignified.

                                    GRANDMA
                    I know honey, I just get so angry 
                    when I think about...

      The doorbell rings faintly beneath the music.  Harold looks 
      up, looks back to the dead and decomposing body of the old 
      woman, then gets up and puts the bottle of acid down.  The 
      doorbell rings again.  Harold begins to remove his gloves.


      Harold turns angrily from the door and yells out...

                                  HAROLD
                    Damn it Jane, don't you ever 
                    embarrass me like that again!

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                            (sarcastically)
                    Oh, I wouldn't want to embarrass 
                    you in front of your new 
                      girlfriend.

                                  HAROLD
                    She's not my girlfriend.

      He walks off angrily back toward the basement door, but the 
      voice follows him though the house as though it is right 
      behind him.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                          (mocking him)
                    That would be love-ly.

                                  HAROLD
                    Shut-up.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    You're going to get caught this 
                    time.

                                  HAROLD
                    Just shut-up!

      He storms into the basement and slams the door shut behind 
      him.

                                                              CUT TO:


      David opens the door to a smiling Harold.

                                  DAVID
                          (shakes his hand)
                    Come on in.

      Harold comes in the door, carrying a bottle of wine.

                                  HAROLD
                    I brought you a little housewarming 
                    present.

      He hands the bottle to David as Celia comes in from the 
      kitchen.

                                  CELIA
                    Welcome to our home.  Sorry if it 
                    is still a little unfurnished.  Our 
                    last house was much smaller.

                                  HAROLD
                    No, no, it looks fine.

      David looks at the bottle of wine.

                                  DAVID
                    This is a really nice bottle, 
                    Harold.  Thank you.  You mind if I 
                    open it now?

                                  HAROLD
                    Go right ahead.
                          (looks around)
                    This is a very nice house.  I've 
                    never actually been in here before.

                                  DAVID
                          (to Celia)
                    Honey, why don't you give him the 
                    tour while I open this?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  31.

      CONTINUED:4040


                                  CELIA
                          (nods)
                    Don't forget to stir the sauce.

      David nods and walks off toward the kitchen.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                          (to Harold)
                    Ready for the grand tour?


      Celia walks into the room and flips on the light.

                                  CELIA
                    This is the master bedroom.

      Harold follows her into the room.

                                  HAROLD
                    Very nice.

      He looks around the room, and sees that blinds are open on 
      the large window across from the bed.  Celia walks to the 
      bathroom, and he follows her.


      Celia walks into the kitchen with Harold following behind her 
      to find David stirring the sauce on the stove.

                                  CELIA
                    And this is, of course, the 
                    kitchen, where my wonderful husband 
                    is making one of the best spaghetti 
                    sauces you'll ever taste.

                                  DAVID
                          (smiles)
                    Suck up.

                                  CELIA
                    And that concludes our tour.

      Harold looks around, appreciatively.

                                  HAROLD
                    You certainly have a beautiful 
                    home.

      David walks over to the counter, where the bottle of wine and 
      three wine glasses sit.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  32.

      CONTINUED:4242


                                  DAVID
                    We've got another ten or fifteen 
                    minutes before dinner is ready.  
                    Would anyone like some wine?

      Celia and Harold both nod.  David pours the wine.  Harold 
      eyes the door next to the open pantry.

                                  HAROLD
                          (nods toward it)
                    Is that to the basement?

      David and Celia follow his gaze to the door.

                                  DAVID
                    Yeah.  We haven't been down there 
                    much yet.  It's a little funky.

      Harold walks toward the door.

                                  HAROLD
                    Mind if I take a look?  I'd like to 
                    compare it to mine.

                                  DAVID
                    Sorry, but the lights are all out.  
                    I just haven't had time to replace 
                    the bulbs yet.

      Harold looks a little disappointed, but neither Celia nor 
      David notice.

                                  CELIA
                          (to David)
                    We need to add a light bulb to our 
                    list before we go to Home Depot 
                    tomorrow.

      David hands Celia a glass of wine and then hands one to 
      Harold.  David picks up his glass and raises it toward 
      Harold.

                                  DAVID
                    Here's to our new neighbor.

      Harold smiles, and they all three clink their glasses 
      together.                                                                    "Family"  33.




      Soft jazz plays from the living room as David and Celia and 
      Harold all sit at the dining room table, laughing and 
      drinking, their empty dinner plates in front of them.

                                  DAVID
                    So we're driving down Sunset 
                    Boulevard one day...

      Celia is clearly a little drunk.

                                  CELIA
                    Just a few days after we moved 
                    there.

                                  DAVID
                          (nods)
                    And I'm looking around as I drive, 
                    not really paying attention, when 
                    suddenly Celia screams...

                                  CELIA
                    I didn't scream.  I yelled out.

                                  DAVID
                          (rolls his eyes)
                    She yells out, okay?  And I look up 
                    to see this woman walking right out 
                    into the street in front of me.  I 
                    wasn't going very fast, maybe 
                    thirty, thirty-five, but I have to 
                    slam on the breaks...

                                  CELIA
                    We screech to a halt, and this 
                    woman, she's standing in front of 
                    our car, maybe a foot or less in 
                    front of us, and she's looking 
                    right at us...

                                  DAVID
                    And it's Zsa Zsa Gabor.

      Celia and David both laugh.

                                  HAROLD
                    Zsa Zsa Gabor?

      They both nod.

      CONTINUED:4343


                                  DAVID
                    Celia and I were both just 
                      dumbstruck.  I mean we almost 
                    creamed this woman, and on top of 
                    that, it's this person we both 
                      recognize.  So we're just staring 
                    at her, right?  Well, she looks 
                    back at us for a moment and then 
                    she raises her hand...

                                  CELIA
                    And flips us off.

      They all three laugh.

                                  DAVID
                    I tell you, only in L.A.

                                  HAROLD
                    That's hilarious.
                          (takes a drink)
                    The only celebrity I ever saw the 
                    whole time I lived there was Jay 
                    Leno once at the supermarket.  But 
                    he didn't give me the finger.

      David chuckles.  Celia lights a cigarette.  She notices a 
      look of distaste on Harold's face.

                                  CELIA
                    Is the smoke going to bother you?

                                  HAROLD
                    No, no it's fine.

                                  CELIA
                          (exhales)
                    So how long did you live there?

                                  HAROLD
                    Oh just a couple of years.  I 
                    followed a woman out there...but it 
                    didn't work out.

      Celia pours herself some more wine.  David watches her with a 
      small frown.

                                  CELIA
                    Why did you leave L.A?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  35.

                          (grins)
                    Following another woman?

                                  HAROLD
                    No, no.  I'm originally from here, 
                    and it just seemed to make sense.

      She offers the bottle to David, who shakes his head no.

                                  CELIA
                    How long ago did you move here?

      She offers the bottle to Harold.

                                  HAROLD
                          (nods)
                    Just a little more, thanks.

      She pours some more wine into his glass.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Oh, about four years ago I suppose.

      Harold takes a drink from his glass.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    I love it here.  So quiet and 
                    peaceful.  Perfect place for 
                    children.

                                  CELIA
                    Isn't it?  That's the whole reason 
                    we moved here, really.  To have 
                    little babies.

      David frowns at Celia.  She sees him frown and takes a big 
      swig of her wine.

                                  HAROLD
                    So you two are planning on starting 
                    a family soon?

                                  CELIA
                    We already started a family, but it 
                    got stopped.

      David's frown deepens, but Celia doesn't look at him.  Harold 
      looks a little confused.  She crushes her cigarette out.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  36.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                    We had a child, a daughter, but 
                    she...
                          (looks a little sad)
                    Died.

      Celia drains the rest of her glass.  David looks away from 
      her to Harold.

                                  DAVID
                    Cancer.

                                  HAROLD
                    I'm so sorry...that's awful.

      There is an awkward silence.  Celia reaches for the bottle.  
      David stands up from the table.

                                  DAVID
                    I think it's time for dessert.


      Harold comes up the stairs and walks into the dim living 
      room.  Jane looks up at him from her chair.  Harold sees that 
      she has a glass of wine in her hand, and that there is a near 
      empty bottle sitting on the coffee-table.

                                  HAROLD
                          (groans)
                    Perfect.

      Jane lifts her glass to him.

                                  JANE
                    The great and powerful Harold has 
                    returned.

                                  HAROLD
                          (sighs)
                    Do we have to do this tonight?

                                  JANE
                    You know we do.

      He goes to the coffee-table, picks up the bottle of wine, and 
      pours himself a drink.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (clearly drunk)
                    So did you have a good time with 
                    your little whore tonight?

                                  HAROLD
                          (sharply)
                    Don't you dare talk about her like 
                    that.

      Jane lunges off of her chair and gets right in his face.

                                  JANE
                    Or what!?

      Harold gives her a dark look.  She laughs in his face.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  38.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    You couldn't live without me!  I 
                    was your first!

                                  HAROLD
                    You know you were not my first.

      He grips the wine bottle by the neck.  Jane steps back.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                          (darkly)
                    You also know what happened to my 
                    first, don't you?

                                  JANE
                          (with a little nod)
                    It was her bones that you hid in 
                    the mailbox.

                                  HAROLD
                    That's right.

      Harold moves slowly toward her with the bottle.  She watches 
      him, and suddenly looks sad.

                                  JANE
                    But I was the one you started this 
                    family with.

      Harold raises the bottle like a club, a few drops of red wine 
      spilling down his arm like blood.

                                  SARAH (O.S.)
                    Daddy?

      Harold stops and looks over at Sarah, still wearing the 
      little green dress, rubbing her eyes sleepily.

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Why are you and Mommy fighting?

      Harold lowers the bottle.

                                  JANE
                    Because your Daddy doesn't love me 
                    anymore.

      Harold walks over and scoops Sarah up into his arms.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    He's going to replace me!




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  39.

                                  HAROLD
                          (holding Sarah)
                    Stop it, Jane.  Just stop it.

                                  JANE
                    He's going to replace all of us!

                                  HAROLD
                    I can't take this anymore.  You're 
                    nuts, you know that?  Fucking nuts.

      Jane laughs wildly.  Harold walks out with Sarah and takes 
      her down the hallway.


      The room is painted a light pink and is filled with all sorts 
      of toys and stuffed animals.  Harold carries Sarah to her 
      bed, and lays her down.  She looks up at him.

                                  SARAH
                    I'm scared, Daddy.

      He lays down next to her and puts his arm around her.

                                  HAROLD
                    There's nothing to be scared of 
                      sweet-pea.

                                  SARAH
                    You're not going to replace me, are 
                    you Daddy?

      Harold hugs her tightly to him.

                                  HAROLD
                    I could never replace you, Sarah.  
                    Never in a million years.  I love 
                    you more than anything in this 
                    world.

                                  SARAH
                    I love you too, Daddy.

      He kisses her on top of her head.

                                  HAROLD
                    Now come on, it's time to go to 
                    sleep.

      She looks up at him.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  40.

                                  SARAH
                    Daddy, can I have a sister?

      Harold thinks about it for a moment then smiles at her.

                                  HAROLD
                    How about an older sister?

      Sarah smiles and nods enthusiastically.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    I'll get you one as soon as I can.  
                    Now, you go ahead and close your 
                    eyes.  It's night night time.

      She snuggles into him and closes her eyes.

      Harold lays in bed next to the little skeleton of Sarah, 
      holding her to him, staring blankly at the ceiling.

                                                              CUT TO:


      Harold drives, watching the Plain Girl through his 
      windshield.  He hears her speaking to him as he drives.

                                  PLAIN GIRL (O.S.)
                    I'll be a good big sister to Sarah.  
                    I know what it's like to be lonely.  
                      I probably won't even scream.

      To his right a station wagon backs out of its driveway, but 
      Harold's eyes are on the Plain Girl.

                                  PLAIN GIRL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    I'll be grateful.  I'll have 
                    someone to love me.  Someone to 
                      finally...

      The station wagon slams into the side of Harold's car and 
      everything goes black.


      Harold comes to.  There is blood running down his face from a 
      cut on his forehead.  He looks over to his left and sees a 
      HOUSEWIFE looking at him through the window, saying 
      something.


      Harold sits in the emergency room, holding a compress to his 
      forehead, filling out a form.

                                  DAVID (O.S.)
                    Harold?

      Harold looks up and sees David walking toward him.

                                  DAVID (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing here?
                          (sees Harold's forehead)
                    What happened?

                                  HAROLD
                    Car accident.  No big deal, just a 
                    fender bender.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  43.

                                  DAVID
                    Come with me, I'll take care of 
                    you.

                                  HAROLD
                    But I haven't finished filling out 
                    my form.

                                  DAVID
                    I can't let you sit here and bleed 
                    to death.  Celia would never 
                    forgive me.  Come on.

      Harold gets up and follows David.


      Harold sits on the little hospital table as David shines a 
      little light in Harold's eyes, and then clicks it off.

                                  DAVID
                    No signs of a concussion.

      David inspects the wound on Harold's forehead.

                                  DAVID (CONT'D)
                    That's a nasty cut, but it isn't as 
                    bad as it looks.  You're not even 
                    going to need stitches.  You really 
                    lucked out on this one.

      David goes over to the medical counter in the corner.

                                  HAROLD
                    I've always been lucky with things 
                    like this.  I've never been 
                    seriously hurt or sick, never even 
                    spent the night in a hospital.

                                  DAVID
                    Take it from me, luck like that 
                      eventually runs out.

      David rummages through a drawer and pulls out a bandage.

                                  HAROLD
                    So how are you and Celia doing?

      David looks over at him, sharply.

                                  DAVID
                    Excuse me?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  44.

                                  HAROLD
                    I mean, are you settled in yet?

      David walks back to him with the bandage.

                                  DAVID
                    Pretty much.  Since I've gone back 
                    to work, Celia's been dealing with 
                    the house.

                                  HAROLD
                    You're really the lucky one, to 
                    have a wife like her.

                                  DAVID
                          (smiles)
                    You don't know the half of it.

      He puts the bandage on Harold's forehead.

                                  DAVID (CONT'D)
                    We're all done here, Harold.  Good 
                    as new.

                                  HAROLD
                    I really appreciate this.  I'd 
                    still be out there in the waiting 
                    room if it wasn't for you.

                                  DAVID
                    It's nothing.  Besides, like I 
                    said, Celia would never forgive me 
                    if I let anything happen to you.

      Harold smiles.

                                                              CUT TO:


      David lays wide awake in the dark as Celia lays next to him 
      sleeping.  He rolls over and turns on the lamp.  Celia stirs, 
      but doesn't wake up.

                                  DAVID

                    Wake up, baby.  I need to tell you 
                      something.

      Celia turns over and looks at him.

                                  CELIA
                          (still groggy)
                    What?  What's wrong?

      David looks at her for a long moment.

                                  DAVID
                    I've been thinking.  You're right.  
                    I'm not going to fight it anymore.

      Celia sits up.

                                  DAVID (CONT'D)
                    I'm ready to do it.  All of it.

                                  CELIA
                    Are you sure?

                                  DAVID
                    I am.

      She smiles and leans in and kisses him.  He takes her into 
      his arms and kisses her passionately as he rolls on top of 
      her, and they begin to make love.
      Omit 


      Harold sits at a window upstairs, looking out, watching David 
      get his mail.  Behind Harold is the skeleton of Grandma, 
      posed in a rocking chair, a book in her skeletal hands.

                                  HAROLD
                          (looking out the window)
                    He doesn't deserve her.

                                    GRANDMA (O.S.)
                    It's you that can give her the 
                    family she wants.

                                  HAROLD
                    I know.
                          (sighs)
                    Jane is right though.  It's too 
                    risky so close to home.

                    You shouldn't listen to Jane.  You 
                    should listen to your heart, son.

      Harold stares out the window at David, his face dark.

                                                              CUT TO:


      Harold drives down his street and sees a police car parked in 
      front of David and Celia's house.  The Fuller s car is not in 
      the driveway.  He pulls his car into his garage and the door 
      closes.


      Harold sits in a chair in the living room.  Celia sits across 
      from him on the couch.

                                  HAROLD
                    How long has he been gone?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  47.

                                  CELIA
                          (pained)
                    Since yesterday morning.

                                  HAROLD
                    What did the police say?

                                  CELIA
                    They took the report, but they 
                    don't believe he's missing.  They 
                    think he left me.  I mean we have 
                    been fighting a lot lately...
                          (tearfully)
                    But he wouldn't do that.  He 
                    wouldn't.  Something's happened to 
                    him.

      She breaks down into sobs.  Harold goes to her awkwardly and 
      puts his arms around her.  She grabs onto him, crying.  He 
      holds her, gently stroking her hair.

                                  HAROLD
                          (softly)
                    It's going to be alright.  
                      Everything is going to be just 
                    fine.


      Harold comes into the second floor living room.  Jane sits in 
      her chair, flipping through her magazine.  Grandpa sits on 
      the couch, reading a newspaper, and Grandma sits in the floor 
      with Sarah playing a game with her.  They all look up at him 
      as he comes in.  Harold looks to Jane.

                                  HAROLD
                    You and I need to talk.

      Jane flinches.  Harold looks to Grandma.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Mom, I need you to watch Sarah.

                                    GRANDMA
                    Okay, son.

      Harold looks back to Jane.

                                  HAROLD
                    Come with me.

      Jane doesn't move.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  48.

      CONTINUED:6262


                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    I said, come with me.

      She looks scared.  Harold moves toward her.  Harold picks up 
      Jane's skeleton.


      Harold puts Jane's skeleton down near the workbench, and 
      walks to another section of the bench where several tools 
      hang on the wall by hooks.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    I've been waiting for this.

      He turns to her, and she is now a real person again.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Now that you've killed David, 
                    you're going to replace me with 
                    her.

                                  HAROLD
                    I didn't do anything to David.  He 
                    left her.

                                  JANE
                    You're such a liar.

      He takes a hammer down from its hook above the workbench.

                                  HAROLD
                    You know I didn't do anything to 
                    him, but you can't accept that.

      He walks toward her.  She eyes the hammer in his hand, but 
      doesn't move.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    You can't accept that it's fate 
                    that sent David away, that it is 
                    proof Celia and I are meant for 
                    each other.

      He stops, inches away from her.  She looks him in the eye.

                                  JANE
                    She'll never love you.

                                  HAROLD
                    Yes...yes she will.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  49.

      CONTINUED:6363


      Harold swings the hammer hard at her head and knocks her to 
      the ground.  He bends down and strikes her with the hammer 
      again and again.


      All the curtains are closed.  The place is a bit of a wreck.  
      Celia and Harold are in the living room, talking.  Celia sits 
      on the couch.  On the cushion next to her is a cordless phone 
      and a cell phone.  She looks tired, her hair is unkempt, and 
      she's wearing an old bathrobe.  Harold sits across from her.

                                  HAROLD
                    The police still haven't found 
                    anything?

                                  CELIA
                          (shakes her head)
                    It's been a full seven days, and 
                    nothing.  Not one clue.  Not a sign 
                    of him.
                          (sighs)
                    I don't know how hard they're 
                    looking since they probably still 
                    think he left me.

      She lights a cigarette.  Harold frowns a little.

                                  HAROLD
                    How are you holding up?

      Celia lets out a desperate little laugh.

                                  CELIA
                    I haven't done any work.  I've 
                    cried myself to sleep every night.  
                    I feel like I'm losing my mind.

                                  HAROLD
                    Have you been out at all?

      Celia shakes her head and takes a long drag off of her 
      cigarette.

                                  CELIA
                          (exhales)
                    I've been too afraid to leave.

                    I could miss a call from the 
                      police...or David.

      She looks like she is going to start crying again, but she 
      keeps it under control.

                                  HAROLD
                    You need to get out of here for a 
                    little while.  It isn't healthy for 
                    you to stay cooped up in here like 
                    this.

                                  CELIA
                    I know.  But I...
                          (sighs)
                    I just don't know what to do with 
                    myself anymore.  I'm a wreck.

                                  HAROLD
                    You look like you haven't had a 
                    decent meal in days.  Why don't you 
                    come over to my house for dinner 
                    tonight?

      She looks to the phones next to her, and shakes her head no.

                                  CELIA
                    That's really sweet of you 
                    Harold... but I really shouldn't.

                                  HAROLD
                    I'm sure David wouldn't want you 
                    sitting around here like this, 
                    wasting away.  You need a good home-
                    cooked meal.

                                  CELIA
                    I need to be here in case someone 
                    calls.

                                  HAROLD
                    You can bring your cell phone with 
                    you.

      She looks unsure.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                          (coaxing)
                    Come on.  It'll take your mind off 
                    of things.  You can take a long hot 
                    shower, put on some fresh clothes, 
                    and then come over and let me get 
                    some food into you.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  51.

      Celia looks down at her dirty bathrobe.

                                  CELIA
                    I guess I could use a shower.

                                  HAROLD
                    Why don't you come over around 
                    seven or so?  I guarantee you won't 
                    regret it.

      Celia looks reluctant, but nods.  Harold smiles.


      Harold stands at the counter, whistling happily, as he chops 
      some scallions.



      Harold arranges some flowers.


      Harold, dressed in a suit, ties his neck-tie in the mirror on 
      his open closet door.


      Harold walks into the dim living room where the skeletons of 
      Grandma and Grandpa and Sarah all sit in their positions 
      around the living room.  He picks up Grandpa, and straightens 
      him into a standing position.

                                  SARAH (O.S.)
                    Is my new mommy coming tonight?

                                  DAVID
                    She sure is, honey.

      Harold picks up Grandpa and carries him toward the entrance 
      of the living room.


      Harold stands at the workbench, looking at his tools.  He 
      reaches for the hammer, decides against it, and leaves it 
      hanging on the hook.  He thinks for a moment, and then takes 
      a little hatchet from the hook, and opens a drawer underneath 
      the bench.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  52.

      CONTINUED:7070


      He takes out a thick coil of rope from the drawer.  He 
      straightens out a few feet of it, then cuts it off with the 
      hatchet.  He puts the hatchet down on the bench, and wraps 
      one end of the rope around his hand, pulling the rope taut 
      with his other hand.  He pulls it tighter and tighter until 
      his hands begin to shake.


      Celia, looking fresh and clean in a pair of jeans and a t-
      shirt, rings the doorbell.  After a moment, Harold opens the 
      door with a big smile on his face.


      Celia follows Harold into the kitchen where several pots 
      simmer on the island stove.

                                  CELIA
                    Am I going to get the full tour 
                    this time?

                                  HAROLD
                    Sure.  A little later though, after 
                    dinner.

      She looks at his suit.

                                  CELIA
                    I didn't know this was going to be 
                    so formal.

      He looks to her and follows her eyes down to his suit.

                                  HAROLD
                    I guess I got a little excited 
                    about having company for dinner.  
                    It's been awhile.

                                  CELIA
                    You look very nice.

      He smiles at her and pours one of the pots into a bowl.  She 
      walks over to the adjoining breakfast nook, and pulls out a 
      pack of cigarettes from her jean pocket.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                    Do you mind if I smoke in here?

                                  HAROLD
                          (grimaces a little)
                    Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  53.

      CONTINUED:7272


      She looks to the backdoor in the nook.

                                  CELIA
                          (nods to it)
                    Mind if I step out back then?

                                  HAROLD
                    Do you think you can wait?

      He nods down to the bowl in his hands.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Dinner is pretty much ready.

      Celia looks a little jittery, but forces a smile.

                                  CELIA
                    Sure, I should cut down anyway.

                                  HAROLD
                    Follow me.

      Harold takes the bowl, and walks out of the kitchen.  Celia 
      looks back to the backdoor with a sigh and then follows after 
      him.


      The dining room lights are dimmed.  Celia comes in to find 
      Harold lighting candles on the table.  The table is 
        immaculately set with an embroidered tablecloth, linen 
      napkins, china dishes, crystal glasses, and real silverware.  
      Celia sees the table, and looks a little uncomfortable.  He 
      looks to her and looks kind of guilty.

                                  HAROLD
                    I hope this is alright.  I really 
                    never get the chance to entertain 
                    much so I tend to go a little 
                      overboard.

                                  CELIA
                    No, no.  It's very nice.

      He moves to one of the chairs and pulls it out for her.  She 
      seems even more uncomfortable by the gesture, but forces a 
      smile, and sits down.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.

      He picks up a bottle of wine from the table and fills her 
      glass.

                                  HAROLD
                    You wait here and enjoy your wine 
                    while I go get the rest of our 
                    dinner.

      He walks off.  Celia takes a deep breath, and then takes a 
      drink of her wine.


      Harold sits across from Celia, both of them eating.  Celia 
      looks at the food on her plate as she eats.  Harold watches 
      her from across the table.  She looks up, notices him looking 
      at her, and looks uncomfortably back down at her plate.

                                  HAROLD
                    You sure are quiet tonight.

      Celia looks up at him.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                          (smiles)
                    You're usually asking me questions.

                                  CELIA
                    I'm sorry.  I'm afraid I'm not very 
                    good company.  I can't help but 
                    keep wondering where Dav...

                                  HAROLD
                          (interrupts her)
                    Let's not talk about David tonight.  
                    No sense in upsetting yourself 
                    while you eat.  It's bad for 
                      digestion.

      Celia looks back down at her plate, and moves some food 
      around with her fork.  Harold takes a roll from the basket on 
      the table.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                          (nods to her plate)
                    How is everything?

                                  CELIA
                      Delicious.  You really didn't have 
                    to go to all this trouble.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  55.

                                  HAROLD
                    Nonsense.  I wanted to do something 
                    nice for you.  You deserve someone 
                    who does nice things for you.

      She looks at him and sees him looking at her lovingly.  She 
      bites at her bottom lip, and then picks up her glass and 
      drinks down the last of her wine.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Would you like some more wine?

                                  CELIA
                          (looks at her plate)
                    No thank you.  I think I've had 
                    enough.

                                  HAROLD
                          (frowns)
                    You picking tonight to get sober?

      Celia looks up at him, sharply.

                                  CELIA
                    What did you say?

                                  HAROLD
                          (smiles)
                    I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like 
                    that.  Just a bad joke.

      They eat in an uncomfortable silence for a moment.  Celia  
      puts her fork down and wipes her mouth with her napkin.

                                  CELIA
                          (lets out a breath)
                    That was great, but I'm stuffed.

      Harold looks down at her plate, which has barely been 
      touched.

                                  HAROLD
                    Stuffed?  You've hardly eaten a 
                    thing.

                                  CELIA
                    I'm sorry, it really was delicious, 
                    I just don't have much of an 
                    appetite.

      Harold looks at Celia and his eyes glaze over.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  56.

                          (seductively)
                    I don't want any more food, Harold.  
                    I want you.

      She sweeps the dishes, glasses, candles, and silverware off 
      of the table onto the floor.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                    I want you inside me right now.  
                    Let's do it here on the table.

      Harold snaps out of it and Celia is still sitting in her 
      chair, but she is looking at him with a raised eyebrow.

                                  HAROLD
                    I'm sorry, what did you say?

                                  CELIA
                    I said I really appreciate the 
                    dinner, but I think I should be 
                    going.

                                  HAROLD
                          (alarmed)
                      What...why?

      She gets up from her chair.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                          (standing)
                    We haven't even had dessert yet.  
                    I've got a very nice bottle of 
                    champagne I was going to open.

                                  CELIA
                    I have to be honest Harold, I don't 
                    feel comfortable with this.  I'm a 
                    married woman.

      Harold laughs.  She starts to walk out.

                                  HAROLD
                          (moves toward her)
                    Wait, wait.  I didn't mean to give 
                    you the wrong impression.  I just 
                    want to be your friend, nothing 
                    more.

                          (unconvinced)
                    This is coming off as romantic, not 
                    friendly.

                                  HAROLD
                    I brought out the good stuff to 
                    impress you, not seduce you.
                          (sincerely)
                    I know you're having a hard time, 
                    and I just wanted you to enjoy 
                    yourself tonight.

      Celia sags a little and looks embarrassed.

                                  CELIA
                    I'm sorry, of course you did.  I'm 
                    just a complete mess right now.

                                  HAROLD
                          (waves it off)
                    It's completely understandable.  
                    You've been through a lot.

                                  CELIA
                    Now I really should go.

                                  HAROLD
                    No, no.  Please don't leave like 
                    this.  We can skip the champagne, 
                    but I bought a delicious chocolate 
                    torte that I would hate to see go 
                    to waste.

      Celia looks hesitant for a moment, but then nods.

                                  CELIA
                    That sounds good.

      She moves back to her chair.  Harold smiles.

                                  HAROLD
                    I'll go get it now.

                                  CELIA
                    No, please, finish your dinner.

                                  HAROLD
                          (waves her off)
                    If I eat anymore, I won't want 
                    dessert.  I'll be right back.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  58.

      He walks off toward the kitchen.


      Harold is putting the torte onto a platter when Celia comes 
      in behind him, looking a little jittery.

                                  CELIA
                    I don't want to be rude, but I 
                    think I'm going to skip dessert.

                                  HAROLD
                    Are you sure?  I mean look at it.

      He holds the torte out to her.

                                  CELIA
                    Tempting, but I'm really not in the 
                    mood.  What I need is a cigarette.

                                  HAROLD
                    Why don't you step out on the back-
                    porch and have one?

                                  CELIA
                    Are you sure you don't mind?

                                  HAROLD
                          (forces a smile)
                    Of course, I'll save this for 
                    another night.

      He puts the torte down and walks toward the backdoor.  He 
      fishes a key out of his pocket, and unlocks the dead lock 
      with it.  He opens the door for her, leaving the key in the 
      lock.  She walks out onto the back-porch.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    You go ahead and smoke, I'm going 
                    to start clearing the dishes.

      She nods as she lights her cigarette, and inhales deeply.  He 
      walks off, leaving the door open.


      All of the dishes are gone now, and Harold is taking the 
      tablecloth off of the table when Celia walks in looking a 
      little more relaxed.

                                  CELIA
                    Much, much better now.

                                  HAROLD
                    Good.

                                  CELIA
                    So how about that grand tour?

      He looks a little surprised.

                                  HAROLD
                          (smiles)
                    Sure.

      Celia smiles back at him.


      Harold comes off the top stair and walks down the dark 
      hallway, past the closed doors, toward the soft dim light of 
      the living room.  Celia follows a few steps behind him.

                                  CELIA
                          (sees the closed doors)
                    Are these bedrooms?

                                  HAROLD
                          (looks back at her)
                    I'll show you those in a second, I 
                    want to show you my favorite room.

      He stops a few steps short of the entrance to the living 
      room, and moves to the side of the hallway, putting one hand 
      into his front coat pocket, and motioning with his other hand 
      for her to go on ahead of him.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    I spend most of my time up here.

      She walks past him, and he pulls his hand out of his pocket, 
      and the piece of rope dangles from his hand down toward the 
      ground.

      Celia walks into the living room and suddenly stops, her face 
      filling with terror.

      In the center of the living room stands the clothed skeletons 
      of Grandma, Grandpa, and Sarah.  Grandma and Grandpa's arms  
      are both posed in welcoming waves.  Sarah is positioned 
      between them with her little arms outstretched, as if wanting 
      to be picked up.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  60.

      CONTINUED:7777


      Celia screams, but the sound is cut abruptly off by the rope 
      suddenly around her neck.  Harold stands behind her, pulling 
      the rope tighter and tighter.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Do you like your new family Celia?

      Celia struggles against the rope, strangling.  Her hands 
      flail for the rope, but it is too tight to get a hold.  
      Harold buries his face in her hair.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    You see, I can give you what David 
                    wouldn't.

      Celia reaches back behind her with one hand, grabbing at  
      Harold's suit pants.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    You are going to be so happy wi...

      She grabs hold of his crotch with her hand, and twists 
      violently.  Harold yells out in pain.  Celia jerks forward 
      and Harold loses his grip and drops one end of the rope.  
      Celia turns around quickly and kicks Harold right in the 
      groin, and he falls.

      She jumps over him in the hallway, but he catches her leg, 
      and she goes sprawling onto the floor.  He tries to pull 
      himself toward her, but she kicks him right in the face.  
      There is a distinct crunch and he lets go of her leg with a 
      howl of pain.  She scrambles down the hallway, getting to her 
      feet, and runs down the stairs.

      LATER

      Celia runs down the stairs to the front door.  She tries to 
      open it, but it is locked and the key is gone.  She pulls on 
      it again in disbelief, then quickly runs to the kitchen and 
      tries the back door.

      Harold comes down the bottom of the stairs right as she 
      reaches the hallway.  He smiles at her, blood dripping from 
      his nose.  Celia turns the corner and runs toward the front 
      of the house with Harold right behind her.  She reaches the 
      front door and grabs hold of the knob and pulls...but it is 
      also locked.  She starts to turn, but before she can, the 
      rope slips around her neck and pulls her backward.

                                  HAROLD
                          (strangling her)
                    Stop fighting it, Celia.

      She struggles, but it does no good.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    You're going to be so happy here.

      He pulls the rope tighter, lifting her off of the ground.

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    I'm going to take good ca...

      Suddenly a gloved hand slips around Harold's face, pressing a 
      piece of white cloth over his mouth.  Harold's eyes go wide 
      and he tries to move his head, but his eyes suddenly droop 
      and close.  He falls back, letting go of Celia, and collapses 
      to the floor, revealing David.  In David's other gloved hand 
      there is a bottle of chloroform.  David puts down the rag and 
      bottle, and goes to Celia.  He takes her in his arms and 
      looks at her.

                                  DAVID
                          (concerned)
                    Are you alright?

      She gasps for breath, holding her throat.

                                  CELIA
                        He...almost...killed me.

                                  DAVID
                    I'm so sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.

                                  CELIA
                          (catching her breath)
                    You were...supposed to leave the... 
                    backdoor unlocked.

                                  DAVID
                    I heard something out there, and 
                    thought it would be safer to take 
                    him in here.

      He moves her hands and looks at her throat where there is a 
      distinct rope burn.

                                  DAVID (CONT'D)
                    This doesn't look too bad.  Are you 
                    okay?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  62.

      She takes a breath and nods.  He helps her to her feet.

                                  CELIA
                    She's upstairs.

                                  DAVID
                          (suddenly hopeful)
                    You...you saw her?

      She looks at David, and tears well up in her eyes.

                                  CELIA
                          (the tears fall)
                    She has on the same green dress, 
                    David.  The same gree...

      She breaks down into sobs.  David takes her into his arms and 
      holds her as she cries


      Harold comes to, tied and gagged in a chair, dried blood 
      below his nose.  Next to him there are all kinds of medical 
      equipment: an IV, a heart monitor, and a medical tray full of 
      scalpels and other sharp and painful looking things.

      Harold looks over to see David and Celia watching him.  They 
      are both wearing hospital scrubs.  Harold tries to say 
      something, but it is muffled by the gag.  David walks over to 
      him and takes out the gag.

                                  HAROLD
                          (catches his breath)
                      What...what the hell is going on 
                    here?

      David looks from him to Celia.

                                  CELIA
                    My husband has always said I'm part 
                      bloodhound, and it turns out he's 
                    right.  I tracked you down.

                                  DAVID
                          (nods)
                    It took her years, but she did it.

                                  HAROLD
                          (confused)
                      What...what are you...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  63.

      Celia punches him square in the face, and fresh blood squirts 
      from his nose.

                                  CELIA
                    You killed our daughter you son of 
                    a bitch!

      Harold shakes his head, and little droplets of blood run down 
      his face.

                                  HAROLD
                    You...you said she died of cancer.

                                  DAVID
                          (steps toward him)
                    You are a fucking cancer.

      He holds out a photograph to him:  it is of the little girl 
      from Harold's demented fantasies.  Harold looks from the 
      photograph to Celia's face, and for the first time, he looks 
      scared.

                                  HAROLD
                    What are you going to do?

      Celia laughs though there is absolutely nothing funny about 
      her laughter.

                                  CELIA
                    We're going to kill you.

                                  DAVID
                          (nods)
                    Before we do though, we're going to 
                    make you experience every single 
                    bit of pain you've ever caused.

      Harold nervously eyes the medical tray next to him.

                                  HAROLD
                          (desperately)
                      But...but, someone will eventually 
                    notice that I'm gone.  Two missing 
                    persons on one street?  It'll raise 
                      suspicion.

                                  CELIA
                    We never filed a missing person's 
                    report.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                    "Family"  64.

                                  DAVID
                    We called them to report that 
                    someone had been lurking around in 
                    our backyard.  You fucking pervert.

      Celia hits him again.

                                  CELIA
                          (to Harold)
                    In case you haven't figured it out 
                    yet, this has all been a trap.

                                  DAVID
                    Hitting your mailbox was no 
                    accident.

                                  CELIA
                    We've been planning this for years.

      David looks to Celia with a little demented smile.

                                  DAVID
                    I don't know why I was so hesitant 
                    to do this.  You were right.  This 
                    feels good.

                                  CELIA
                    It's strange, isn't it?

      David puts down the photograph, and picks up a scalpel from 
      the tray and moves slowly toward Harold.

                                  DAVID
                          (to Harold)
                    We were never violent people until 
                    you took our daughter away from us.

      Harold eyes the scalpel as it comes closer and closer to his 
      face.  He tries to scream, but Celia stuffs the gag back into 
      his mouth.


      David and Celia stand in the basement, both of their faces 
      and clothes streaked with blood.  The sound of the heart 
      monitor mixes in with Harold's moans somewhere in front of 
      them.  David yawns and looks to Celia.

                                  DAVID
                    I'm getting about ready for bed.

      Celia looks in front of them at the unseen Harold.

                                  CELIA (CONT'D)
                    But I don't really want to stop.

                                  DAVID
                    I know, me either.  But we've got 
                    weeks, maybe months, to enjoy this.

      She looks to him and smiles.

                                  CELIA
                    I love you, David.

      He takes her into his arms, and they kiss passionately.
