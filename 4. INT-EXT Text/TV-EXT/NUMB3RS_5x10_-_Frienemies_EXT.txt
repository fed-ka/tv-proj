      A CUSTOMER leaves. A YOUNG CHINESE MAN at the counter.  He s 
      distracted by movement outside, catches sight of a GUN.  He 
      reaches beneath the counter, pulls up a bat -- just as David 
      and Nikki burst in with TWO FBI OFFICERS.  David takes a 
      quick bead on him.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     7.

                    Put it down!  Put it down now!

      The Man drops the bat -- eyeing the FBI logos.

                                  YOUNG CHINESE MAN
                    What the hell is going on?

                                  NIKKI
                    Are you Bai Lan Zhou?

                                  YOUNG CHINESE MAN
                    What?  No!

      An OFFICER grabs the Man s wallet and hands it to David.

                                  DAVID
                    Where s Bai Lan?  Where is he?

                                  YOUNG CHINESE MAN
                    He?  You don t know what you re 
                    talking about.

      Nikki steps forward.  Puts the Smart Phone on the counter.

                                  NIKKI
                    We know Bai Lan owns this phone.  
                      Registered to this address.

      A look of relief on the Man s face.

                                  YOUNG CHINESE MAN
                    Hey, Grandma.

      Just beyond a pile of laundry, an elderly Chinese lady rises.

                    The FBI says they have your phone.

      Bai Lan shuffles to the counter, looks at the phone.

                                  BAI LAN
                          (heavy Chinese accent)
                    Mm-mm.  No, I got it.

      She proudly lifts a smart phone from her apron.

                                  DAVID
                    Bai Lan Zhou?

                    Sinclair -- LAPD s at the scene of a 
                    robbery. The vigilantes showed up again.

      David and Nikki and Agents leave -- the Man watching them.


      Don arrives at an LAPD CRIME SCENE.  A DELIVERY TRUCK at the 
      dock.  Boxes scattered.  A BLOODY BODY.  Colby approaches.  

                                  COLBY
                    Truck s stolen -- a crew was unloading 
                    the electronics off of it -- the 
                    driver said it was a bunch of kids.  

      Colby nods toward the BODY, they go to it. WHITE MALE, early 
      20s.  Black jeans, black shoes, a hoody over a black T-shirt.  
      On the T-shirt -- a CIRCLE with an ARROW pointing up.

                                  DON
                    One of the vigilantes.

                                  COLBY

                                        ACT ONE


      A Grad Student, ROBERT SANTOS, comes out of a door with other 
      students -- Nikki steps in front of him.

                                  NIKKI
                    Robert Santos.

      Santos looks up, sees Nikki s badge.

                                  NIKKI (cont d)
                    I want to talk to you about your 
                    roommate, Peter Hathaway. 

                                  SANTOS
                    Like I told the police, I didn t 
                    know him very well. 

                                  NIKKI
                    Though you shared a room with him 
                    for nearly a year?

                                  SANTOS
                    We didn t hang out.   

                                  NIKKI
                    What do you know about him?

                                  SANTOS
                    He was lonely. You could see it.  
                    Sometimes he tried to talk to me 
                    about stuff, his classes, something 
                    he was reading. But -- I m so busy 
                    with classes and tutoring. 

                                  NIKKI
                    Did his behavior change recently?

                                  SANTOS
                    He used to be here every night. But 
                    starting about three months ago, he 
                    went out a lot.

                                  NIKKI
                    He indicate where?  Maybe mention a 
                    group called Vanguard.

                                  SANTOS
                    Never said a word.  And I never 
                    asked where he was going. 

      He starts to realize how this sounds.

                                  NIKKI
                    What is it?

                                  SANTOS
                    Maybe if I d tried to talk to him a 
                    little, invited him to hang with me 
                    and my friends -- he wouldn t have 
                    gotten mixed up in whatever he was 
                    doing when he died.

      He shakes off the moment.

                                  SANTOS (cont d)
                    I gotta go. Peter s parents are 
                    coming today. I have no idea what 
                    to tell them.

      Amita types, a BROWSER WINDOW opens up in the LCD screen.

      The web page uploads, embedded with large data files.  One 
      file OPENS:  A LIST of warehouses, car dealerships, delivery 
      companies -- each dated and with attached photo files.      

                                  NIKKI
                    Those are robberies stopped by the 
                      vigilantes. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    This is Vanguard s website.
                    They even have the exact time each 
                    robbery was supposed to happen.

                                  NIKKI
                    Look at that last one -- an 
                    appliance warehouse.  Downtown. And 
                    the date.  That s today. 

      A PHOTO FILE suddenly opens.  A CELL PHONE PHOTO: VIC TOONER

      Nikki reacts.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Who is that?

                                  NIKKI
                    That -- is trouble.

      Text under the photo:   Vic Tooner. Cops can t stop him.  We 
      will. 

      She steps aside, gets on her phone. Charlie, Marshall and 
      Amita stare on Tooner s photo.

                                    CHARLIE

      Colby continues to watch through Binoculars as box after box

                                  COLBY
                    Just the robbers. No sign of

      Colby and David see the door on the TRUCK pull closed.

                    We gotta move in.        NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     23. 




      Nikki and Don watch the TRUCK start to roll.  The young 
      robbers beginning to disperse.

                    Take these guys.  All units move 
                    in.  Pick up everyone you can find.

      Don and Nikki exit the van -- quickly joining David and Colby 
      and SWAT as they descend on the TRUCK and the warehouse -- 
      startling the ROBBERS.

                      Vigilantes could still be here.  We 
                    should check the perimeter.

      He motions with his head toward a crowd of onlookers drawn by 
      the SWAT action. 

                                  NIKKI
                    Want to look over the crowd? See if

      David and Colby -- with A YOUNG MAN in handcuffs -- in 
      Vanguard gear, including the logo T-shirt. (OLIVER MAYO).

      Oliver goes silent, just meets his look with a calm stare. 

      A POLICE CHOPPER roars overhead. 

      IN A CROWD OF ONLOOKING WORKMEN

      A MAN in the back. He lifts his face -- it s VIC TOONER. 
      Familiar from the PHOTO.  Smiling slightly to himself. 

      He nods, and TWO MEN break away to walk with him. Casual 
      despite all the cops and FBI agents. One pulls his long coat 
      around to better hide the shotgun he s got under it.

      People on porches.  A pick-up soccer game with kids.  Colby 
      and David walk.  People make them as cops, hurry away.  The 
      ball goes bounding across the street, the kids follow.  Doors 
      close shut.  Fear on every face. 

                                  COLBY
                    Everybody knows our name, but

                                  DAVID
                    I ve never seen people so scared.

      They pause in front of an old church. A BOY, 10, appears in 
      front of them -- holding a paper tray with two coffees.

                                  BOY
                    Hey, these are for you.

      David and Colby turn to the child. He hands them the cups.

                                  DAVID
                    Thanks -- who are they from?

      They turn, standing casually behind them is Vic Tooner. 
      Totally calm, smiling slightly.  But scary, hard eyes.

      David and Colby stiffen, Colby s close to dropping his coffee 
      to go for his gun -- he resists the impulse. 

                                  TOONER
                    Heard you guys were looking for me.

                                  TINA
                    There was this guy -- didn t go to 
                    school here, worked as a tutor.
                    Super smart, had a huge crush on 
                    Lori. His name was Clayton -- 


      On the back seat, Charlie s cell phone vibrates silently.

      IN THE FRONT SEAT

      Charlie and Marshall look out at the front of a COMPUTER 
      SALES AND REPAIR store.  The lights are on.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Looks open.

      He reaches back, grabs his cell. They get out.


      Don driving, speaks into the vehicle s radio.

                                  DON
                    Colby, Charlie s on my cell.  Get a 
                    location on his phone -- tell me 
                    where.  Meet me there with LAPD.  

                                  COLBY (V.O.)
                          (over radio)
                    What s up?

                                  DON
                    He s run into Tooner.


      A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY -- Don s SUV speeds along, lights 
      flashing, blowing past an intersection.

      Sitting at the intersection are a couple cars, stopped to let 
      the emergency vehicles go by. 

      ONE VEHICLE -- a plain sedan, Tooner in the passenger seat. 
      Don s SUV goes by right in front of him. He smiles. 


      Don pulls up to find David and Nikki with Charlie and 
      Marshall.  LAPD officers milling around.

                                  DAVID
                    He s gone.

                                    CHARLIE
                    But he was here.

                                  MARSHALL
                    In all his sociopathic glory.

                                  NIKKI
                          (to Don)
                    We got LAPD running traffic stops.

                                  DON
                          (to Charlie and Marshall)
                    How d you guys wind up here? 

                                    CHARLIE
                    We thought it was an old crime 
                    scene, not a currently active one. 

      Marshall shifts a bit.

                                  NIKKI
                    You okay?

                                  MARSHALL
                          (shuddering all over)
                      Adrenaline makes my skin itch.


      An industrial landscape of 10-story container cranes, cargo 
      ships, trucks and row upon row of stacked cargo containers.   

      A SEDAN appears, pulls up to a stack of containers.  Tooner 
      steps out, looking around as Machine Gun and Shotgun get out 
      as well. Tooner pulls out a cell phone.  Speed dials.

                                  TOONER
                    How does it look?

      He listens, turns to the driver of the car.  The driver 
      flashes the headlights.  A signal.

      From the other direction -- A PICK-UP TRUCK and a SEDAN drive 
      up -- in front and in back of a large BOX TRUCK -- disgorging 
      ARMED MEN.  A young ROBBERY CREW jumps out of the Box Truck.

      TWO CARS come from the sides.  Tooner pulls out a BARCODE 
      LASER READER, walks along the containers.   He finds a 
      BARCODE, scans it with the laser reader.

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                      Twenty-two hundred cell phones, 
                    eight hundred iPods.

      He smiles at Shotgun and Machine Gun.

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    Like going to a supermarket.

      He steps to the next container.  Scans.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     54. 

      CONTINUED:6868

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    And 60 inch plasma TVs.  Thirty-two 
                    of them, to be exact.
                          (turns to crew)
                    Okay, let s get to work.

      Tooner s MEN move to the doors of the containers with 
      pneumatic crowbars.  The first one is wedged into the locking 
      mechanism and about to be turned on when --

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    Wait!

      Everyone freezes.  Tooner points to the top corner of the 
      container door. 

      Someone puts a flashlight where he s pointing. A HOMEMADE 
      EXPLOSIVE.  He looks up at the other corner of the container.  
      Another BOMB. Tooner gives a signal. Men break for cover.

      IN THE SHADOWS -- nearby -- TWO HOODED FIGURES.  One 
      standing.  The other kneeling.  Holding a detonator.

                                    CLAYTON
                    Now!

      The kneeling FIGURE twists the switch on the detonator.

      Tooner and crew look up as BRIGHT BLUE ELECTRICAL SPARKS zap 
      the boxes.  No boom. Tooner stands up, cautious but smiling.

                                  TOONER
                    Well -- that had to be 
                      disappointing.

      IN THE SHADOWS, Clayton Caswell stares at the detonator in 
      his hand, furious. And scared.  

      WITH TOONER and crew -- he motions to his MEN to fan out.

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    What, you re fighting us with 
                     bombs  you cooked up in chem lab?

      IN THE SHADOWS -- Clayton and other Vanguard guys. A couple 
      have pistols, some have baseball bats. 








                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     55. 

      CONTINUED: (2)6868

                                  TOONER (O.S.) (cont d)
                    How did you think this was going to 
                    end?  You college boys could do 
                    what the LAPD and FBI can t? 

      The Vanguard guys turn to run, but find themselves looking 
      down the barrel of David and Colby s MP-5s.

                                  DAVID
                          (sotto)
                    FBI.  Put the detonator down.

      Clayton puts the detonator on the ground.  

      TOONER and his men. Tooner senses something s wrong.  
      SUDDENLY A BRIGHT BLINDING LIGHT burns into his eyes, the 
      THUDDING of POLICE HELICOPTERS. SWAT TEAMS swarm.  FBI SUVs 
      and Chargers, lights blazing. Beyond the RAYS of the blinding 
      Xeon searchlights unseen CHOPPERS blow up a furious wind.

      Tooner, stunned but impressed.  Even he has to appreciate the 
      magnitude.  Don and Nikki charge toward him -- weapons aimed.

                                  DON
                    ON THE GROUND.  NOW.

      Tooner smiles.  His mind made up.

                                  TOONER
                    Eat it.

      He lifts his gun, gets off a couple shots -- and BAMBAMBAM - 
      Nikki and Don fire. SWAT guys too. Tooner s riddled.  He 
      drops.  Don steps forward, kicks his gun away.  See David and 
      Colby with more SWAT -- and the apprehended VIGILANTES.  
      Clayton Caswell stares at Tooner s body. A crazy smile.

                                    CLAYTON
                    We killed you. Dammit. We killed 
                    you.

      Don exchanges a look with Colby and David.
