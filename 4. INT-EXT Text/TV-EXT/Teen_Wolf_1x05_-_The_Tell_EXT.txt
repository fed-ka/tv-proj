      with Lydia, arguing with her through the open window.

                                    JACKSON
                    Hoosiers is not only the best 
                      basketball movie ever made, it s 
                    the best sports movie--

                                  LYDIA
                    No.

                                    JACKSON
                    I m not watching The Notebook 
                    again.

      She hits the window button closing it on him with a smile 
      behind the glass.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/102.



      The car door clicks open and Lydia shakily steps out.

      LIGHTS FLASHING, Stilinski s car roars into the lot, pulling 
      up next to two other Deputy Sheriff cruisers.


      Stilinski turns from a crowd of bystanders to his Deputies.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Get this place locked off.

      Stiles pushes his way through the crowd.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia?

      She doesn t seem to hear him or see him while a FEMALE DEPUTY 
      guides her and an irate Jackson to the police cars.

                                    JACKSON
                    I don t need to go to the hospital. *
                    I m fine.*

      Noticing the commotion, Stilinski heads over while leaving 
      his other Deputies to keep the onlookers back.

                                  STILINSKI
                      I understand--

                                    JACKSON
                    No, you don t understand. Which 
                    kind of blows my mind since it 
                    should be a pretty basic concept 
                    for a minimum wage rent-a-cop like 
                    you. I just want to go home!*

      He realizes everyone is watching, pity in their eyes. 
      Including Stiles, who is clearly not happy about the rent-a-
      cop line. Until something else catches his eye.

                                  STILES
                    Hey, is that a dead body?

      The throng of ONLOOKERS rushes forward. Stilinski throws an 
      angry glare at his son who shrinks back into the shadows. 
      While all eyes focus on the video store, no one notices--

      THE ROOF ABOVE - where Scott peers over the ledge. Turning 
      back he slumps down as Derek comes forward.

                    No. We re predators but we don t 
                    have to be killers.

                    Where are we going to go?

      Scott peers in the rearview mirror to see a SCHOOL SECURITY 
      CAR pulling up the lane.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know. Somewhere. Anywhere.

                                    ALLISON
                    Nowhere I could be seen, right? I 
                    could get detention.

                    Allison. Car. Start now.

      Finally, she FIRES up the engine, swerving out of the lot. 
      With a breath, Scott leans back in his seat and relaxes.


      Streaks of sunlight peek through branches, casting shadows on 
      a well worn trail. It s idyllic. Serene. But Allison keeps 
      looking behind her, checking her phone. Scott notices.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re so not okay with this, are

      She pulls him close, kissing him on the lips.

                    I d beg for mercy.

      She laughs. He takes her hand pulling her forward.


      Allison follows Scott as they press deeper into the woods, 
      going up steeper and steeper inclines. When they traverse 
      another outcropping, Allison struggles with the climb.

      Scott looks at her with concern. But she quickens her pace, 
      keeping up. The two slip around a rocky corner and when Scott 
      reaches up to climb over the crest--

      ALLISON LOSES HER FOOTING.

      Scott grabs her with one hand as CLAWS come out of the other, 
      latching into the trunk of a tree. He pulls Allison slowly up 
      and toward him.

                                  SCOTT
                    You okay?

                    I think you just earned your 
                      masculinity back.

      Once she s on steady ground, Scott looks at his hand. The 
      claws are back in. A moment of control. When he looks back, 
      Allison has her phone out, texting.

                                  SCOTT

      Quiet. Serene. Burnt to a crisp. Kate steps forward with two 
      hunters behind her. The first is handsome, an experienced 
      hunter with a disquieting stillness about him. His name is 
      LEVEQUE. The other is ULRICH, a tightly muscled little guy in 
      his twenties who looks like he s dying to kill something, 
      anything.

                                    LEVEQUE

                                  ULRICH
                    And that means we re not allowed to 
                    kill him.

                    But it doesn t mean we can t say 
                    hello.


      Scott helps Allison across the rock near a waterfall to a 
      better vantage point. She steps onto one, almost slipping, 
      but he grabs her.

      Then he turns to step onto another rock, slipping as well. 
      But she grabs him. He turns to see her covering a laugh. He 
      looks down.

      His feet are ankle deep in the water. As she smiles down on 
      him, he pulls her forward, getting her feet as well. And then 
      pulls her into a kiss.


      Derek bursts through the door, staggering out and tumbling to 
      the ground. He looks up with his teeth gritted, rage in his 
      eyes. Blood covers his chest, his lips. He s been hit several 
      times.

      But worst of all, he s been humiliated. He gets up and does 
      the only thing he can... 

      He runs.

      FADE IN:


      The HEADLIGHTS from Jackson s BMW illuminate a patch of trees 
      near a field. A SMALL HOOP hangs from a branch. 

      A BEER BOTTLE slips from Jackson s hand into the grass. Using 
      his other hand, he scoops up a ball with his lacrosse stick 
      and FIRES it at the hoop. It soars past, a miss.

                                  MR. WHITTEMORE (V.O.)
                    He s always been hard on himself. 
                    It s something we assumed was an 
                    effect of being adopted.

      Jackson scoops up another ball. Throws again. Misses again.

                                  MR. HARRIS (V.O.)
                    I think I understand. He s never 
                    met his biological parents.

                                  MR. WHITTEMORE (V.O.)
                    That s right. It s the need to 
                    please. The over-achieving. The 
                    desire to make someone proud. 
                    Someone he s never even met.

      Balls come one after another. Some nick the outer edge, but 
      none go through.

                                  MR. HARRIS (V.O.)
                    Well, simply as an outside 
                      perspective, something certainly 
                    seems to have re-calibrated his 
                    desire for achievement several 
                    notches higher.

      A BEER BOTTLE flies, upending through the air, smashing into 
      the hoop and the tree.

                                  MR. HARRIS (V.O.)
                    Not to be too blunt about it, but 
                    he seems almost... obsessed.

      Gasping through clenched teeth, Jackson drops to his knees. 
      He sits there, fists in the dirt, glaring at his failures.


      Parents and teachers come out of the school. Amongst them are 
      Stilinski, Mr. and Mrs. Martin and the Whittemores. The 
      Argents, however, rush toward their car.

                    Allison, answering your cell phone 
                    would make discussing the terms of 
                    your grounding far easier. I d call 
                    me back before your punishment 
                    reaches biblical proportions. 

      He clicks off and turns to his wife who is also on her cell.

                    Kate hasn t heard from her either.

                    She doesn t do this.

                    Um... excuse me.

      They turn to see Melissa approach, having overheard.

                    You re not Allison s parents, are 
                    you? I m Scott s mom. And I hate to 
                    say this... but he s not answering 
                    his phone either.

                                  ARGENT
                    You re his mother?

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Funny how you said that like it was 
                    an accusation.

                                  ARGENT
                      I wouldn t claim it as a source of 
                    pride since he basically kidnapped 
                    my daughter today.

                    Where exactly have you been?

                                  SCOTT
                    Uh... Nowhere.

                    Nowhere meaning not at school?

                          (tries to explain)
                    It s my fault. It s my birthday and 
                    we were just--

                                  ARGENT
                    Allison. In the car.

      Argent and Allison s mother come through the crowd. He turns 
      to level his gaze at Scott when--

      A SCREAM erupts. Argent whips around as pandemonium breaks 
      loose.

      Scott looks up, eyes wide with fear as SOMETHING LARGE AND 
      FAST darts through the parked cars.

      People move, trying to avoid it. There s a shout, a scream. 
      CARS swerve and HONK as a SHAPE races through the lot. 

      Scott s heightened senses kick in, all SOUND dropping out as 
      he zeroes in on the SLAP OF PADDED PAWS ON CONCRETE.

                                    ALLISON
                    What is that?

      A CAR charges forward, hitting its BRAKES too late--

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison!

      He grabs her by the waist, lifting her right off her feet and 
      pulling her back as if she weighed nothing. She staggers onto 
      the pavement out of the way of the skidding car.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Come on!

      THE SHAPE darts past parents, teachers and administrators 
      racing in all directions.

      Stilinski un-clips his gun holster as a panicked parent in an 
      SUV jerks out of a spot and SLAMS right into him. 

      Stilinski goes down. The SUV SCREECHES to a halt. The driver 
      jumps out to help. Thrown by the chaos, Melissa searches for 
      Scott.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    SCOTT!

      He whirls around, hearing his name.

                    Mom? Mom?

      A TEACHER bumps her, causing her to drop her cell. It 
      skitters under a parked car. Melissa kneels down, reaching 
      for it between the tires when she sees--

      The LEGS of something large and animal-like LOPING past.

      Frightened, she presses against the car and holds her breath 
      until it passes. 

      Argent catches a BLUR of the four legged creature.

      Moving with quick and steady strides, he hurries to his car, 
      unlocks the passenger side and yanks the glove compartment 
      open.

      Across the lot, a mass of parents shriek. They re backed into 
      a corner when--

      A GUNSHOT rings out. 

      Everybody hits the pavement. Argent lowers the weapon. Slowly 
      coming forward.

      PEERING OUT FROM BEHIND A CAR - Allison watches her father. 
      While everyone else in the parking lot seems to be a 
      terrified mess, her father seems perfectly and utterly calm. 
      Like he s used to this.

        A breathless Scott skids out from behind an SUV to find 
      himself at Argent s side.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/1044.

      It s a mountain lion.
