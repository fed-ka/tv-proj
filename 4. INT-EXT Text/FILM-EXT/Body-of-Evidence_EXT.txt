RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
LIGHTNING fills the night sky.
THUNDER BOOMS overhead.
The
wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.
At the
end is a cul-de-sac.
Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.
JOHN CARDENAS steps
out into the rain.
He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
He does not run through the rain -- he walks.
DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
homicide detective runs out to meet him.
2
CARDENAS
Is it Marsh?
REESE
Yeah.
Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.
It lasts an
instant, then it's gone.
REESE
Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
rain?
Cardenas doesn't move.
He ignores the question.
CARDENAS
Who found him?
REESE
His Secretary.
Joanne Braslow.
CARDENAS
She was here?
REESE
No.
She stopped by to pick up some
papers.
CARDENAS
Show me.
Reese starts for the house.
Cardenas looks up into the night
sky.
A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.
CEMETERY - MORNING
Gray clouds hang over head.
A light drizzle falls.
A GROUP of
MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave.
In the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITY
GUARDS.
7
A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS,
her face hidden behind a hat and veil.
RAYMOND SATTLER, a
tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
her.
He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.
The
service concludes.
Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
offer her their condolences.
Joanne Braslow is there.
She
does not go over to Rebecca.
CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.
Cardenas watches and waits.
He steps forward as Sattler leads
the woman by.
CARDENAS
Miss Lawson?
The Woman stops.
Her back is to Cardenas.
CARDENAS
I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.
REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
around.
She is in her late twenties.
A deep pain fills her
face -- controlled, but evident.
Her eyes are tired -- heavy
from crying -- but no tears show now.
This is a woman whose
grief is private and not displayed for others.
Although
emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.
So
beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide
how impressed he is.
SATTLER
I don't think that this is the time,
or the place.
CARDENAS
I just wanted to introduce myself and
inform Miss Lawson that there will be
an inquiry.
SATTLER
An inquiry into what?
CARDENAS
For starters I'd like to know why she
left the house and didn't report the
death?
SATTLER
Because he wasn't dead when she left,
and even if he was, not reporting a
natural death in a timely fashion
isn't a crime.
CARDENAS
Did I say it was a natural death?
8
Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes.
Rebecca stares at him
genuinely shocked by his accusation.
Cardenas nods and walks
away.
In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with
hostility.
CITY HALL BUILDING MORNING
As Dulaney and Rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by
a CROWD of REPORTERS.
Dulaney puts his arm around Rebecca and
ushers her through the crowd.
CITY HALL BUILDING - AFTERNOON
As Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled by
REPORTERS, screaming questions, asking them to verify Rebecca's
arrest.
Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in tow.
RIVER - AFTERNOON
Gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain.
Tall birch trees
line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn
is approaching.
Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging path
cut along the bank.
DULANEY
I want you to know right now that the
trial's going to be nasty.
Your sex
life is going to be dragged through
the mud.
They're going to say that
you enticed Marsh -- led him down a
dark path.
REBECCA
Andrew hardly needed leading.
He was
a very passionate man.
He was eager
to explore.
I gave him what he
wanted.
We fulfilled each others
needs.
DULANEY
This is a very small town -- people
here have very straight views on sex.
21
REBECCA
I'm used to being on the outside
looking in.
The same men who will
publicly profess their moral outrage
for my sexual tastes are the same
ones who privately rest their sweaty
little hands on my legs and talk
about weekend trips together.
DULANEY
Those same men will be sitting on the
jury.
REBECCA
I am who I am.
I can't deny it,
anymore than you can deny who you
are.
I like sex different -- I like
it wild.
That's not a crime.
(emotional)
I loved Andrew.
We made love
together.
We made it differently,
but we still made love.
It was our
way.
It was private -- and now the
whole world wants to look in through
the pretense of justice.
If I was
some middle-aged divorcee who screwed
him once a week do you think this
would be happening to me?
She stops walking and stares out over the River.
REBECCA
Have you ever seen animals make love,
Mr. Dulaney?
They have such passion
-- such savage emotion.
They
struggle, and snarl, and claw, but
neither hurts the other.
Not really.
DULANEY
No pain, no gain?
REBECCA
Something like that.
DULANEY
We're not animals.
As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated.
22
REBECCA
Of course we are.
Our primal urges
are still there -- but we've taken
sex and intellectualized it, refined
it down to its most essential
components.
It's bland, easy,
mechanical.
There's great passion in
the struggle -- such craving in
denial.
Do you know what it's like
to yearn for something?
I'm not
talking about wanting, or needing.
I'm talking about an urge so deep
that your skin burns and every cell
in your body pulses with desire?
Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's
uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside.
DULANEY
(awkwardly)
I think we're getting a little off
the subject here.
REBECCA
I thought the subject was sex?
DULANEY
As it pertains to you -- not me.
(beat)
Did you always know you had
different... tastes?
REBECCA
Yes.
DULANEY
How?
REBECCA
I don't know if it's something I can
explain to you.
DULANEY
Why not?
REBECCA
Because -- it's beyond intellect.
It's emotion.
It's passion.
It has
to be experienced -- it can't be
imagined.
DULANEY
Try.
Rebecca thinks for a moment.
23
REBECCA
When I was growing up we had a
strawberry patch in our backyard. So
did this family down the road.
I
used to sneak in their yard and steal
their strawberries.
It wasn't easy.
The stone walls were high and I'd
scrape my knees as I climbed over.
On the other side were wild rose
bushes.
The thorns would dig into my
legs and cut my thighs as I lowered
myself down.
DULANEY
If you had what you wanted at home
why did you sneak into their yard?
REBECCA
Because -- somehow the fruit always
tasted that much sweeter because of
the pain it took to get to it.
Dulaney appears lost in her words.
This isn't lost on Rebecca.
She walks off.
Dulaney stares after her intrigued.
REBECCA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Dulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's.
They get out.
Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door.
DULANEY
This is your house.
REBECCA
(walking towards the
door)
I know.
Dulaney stops.
DULANEY
I don't think this is a good idea.
Rebecca stops and turns towards him.
REBECCA
Why not?
DULANEY
Because, I'm your attorney.
I
shouldn't be going to your house.
REBECCA
Is it against the law?
DULANEY
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Rebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street
to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney.
REBECCA
No one's looking.
29
She walks to her front door and opens it.
She enters, leaving
the door open.
Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows.
CABIN, KLAMATH LAKE - AFTERNOON
An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake.
Dulaney and
Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it.
REBECCA
I figured if we have to talk all day
we might as well do it someplace
nice.
32
(looks at the cabin)
Isn't it beautiful?
DULANEY
Yeah.
REBECCA
(sadly)
Andrew loved this old cabin.
(fondly remembering)
He always dreamed about moving to
Tahiti -- living in a hut and
becoming a beach-bum.
(a sad smile)
I could never imagine myself doing
that -- but somehow when he talked
about it, he made it sound so alive -
- so wonderful.
Soft ocean breezes
and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the
world and it's problems behind.
I
wish he'd had a chance to do it.
Her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant
memory.
REBECCA
(snapping out of it)
Sorry.
DULANEY
It's okay.
LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK
Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore.
A soft wind blows
through her hair.
DULANEY
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
REBECCA
I hardly know him.
He wanted me and
he couldn't have me.
DULANEY
It's going to be hard to convince a
jury that he's testifying against you
in a murder trial because you blew
him off.
REBECCA
(confidently)
It won't be that hard.
33
She walks off.
CABIN - DUSK
Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing.
REBECCA
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
DULANEY
No -- I wanted to be a professional
hockey player.
REBECCA
Really?
DULANEY
Yeah.
REBECCA
That seems so far away from who you
are now.
What happened?
DULANEY
I broke my ankle skating.
That ended
that dream.
REBECCA
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't
it?
To let go of what you want?
Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light
of the setting sun.
Their eyes meet.
He starts to lean in
towards her -- then stops.
He gets up and walks away.
REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING
Rebecca's car pulls up in front.
Dulaney gets out.
REBECCA
I'm going to put the car away.
You
can let yourself in.
There's a key
under the flower pot.
Rebecca drives to the rear of the building.
Dulaney walks to
the door.
He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens
the door and goes inside.
ANGLE - DOWN THE STREET
Detective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house.
He
glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad.
34
RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
Rows of new Town Houses line the street.
Dulaney drives up and
walks towards the front door of one of them.
He KNOCKS.
JOANNE BRASLOW answers.
She stares at Dulaney innocently.
38
COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON
Dulaney walks down the steps.
Cardenas joins him.
CARDENAS
I'm surprised you can walk after the
way Burnham chewed your ass out this
afternoon.
Cardenas grins.
His comment was meant as a friendly jab
between old friends.
Dulaney doesn't see it that way.
DULANEY
(coldly)
I've got work to do.
CARDENAS
Hey -- the bell's sounded.
It's
between rounds.
DULANEY
I didn't hear it.
65
CARDENAS
What's happening to you, Frank?
You're acting like you're on trial
here.
This has become personal to
you.
DULANEY
Back off, John.
Cardenas studies him for a moment.
CARDENAS
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Dulaney forces a laugh.
It's not a very convincing one.
DULANEY
That's ridiculous.
CARDENAS
I'm talking to you as a friend now.
Don't ruin your life, your career for
her.
She'll spit you out when this
is over.
DULANEY
You don't know what you're talking
about.
CARDENAS
Really?
What does an attorney speak
to his client about at her house
until three o'clock in the morning?
DULANEY
You've been following me?
CARDENAS
Her.
It's an obvious move.
I'm
building a case against her,
remember?
Something in Dulaney snaps.
He grabs Cardenas and pushes him
up against the wall.
Cardenas pushes back.
CARDENAS
If your head wasn't up your ass you
would have thought of it too.
You're
losing perspective.
Get out while
you can -- before she takes you down
with her.
66
PARKING LOT - DUSK
Joanne Braslow walks to her BMW 325i.
She is about to open the
door when Dulaney approaches her.
DULANEY
I need to speak with you.
68
JOANNE
I don't think we have anything more
to talk about, Mr. Dulaney.
She starts to get in the car.
DULANEY
You were sleeping with Marsh.
She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this.
There is now
a different quality to her -- an edge.
JOANNE
Who told you that?
DULANEY
He video taped you.
JOANNE
That bastard!
DULANEY
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Joanne doesn't appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in
her face.
JOANNE
Yes, I slept with him but that was a
long time ago.
DULANEY
You're lying.
Marsh was wearing a
cast on the tape.
It was right
before he went to Chicago and met
Miss Lawson.
He dumped you for her,
didn't he?
Joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.
JOANNE
Yes.
DULANEY
It must have been horrible.
Having
to go there -- seeing them together -
- knowing he was sleeping with her in
the same bed he did with you.
JOANNE
I was jealous.
Of course I was hurt.
He switched me off like a little toy
he was finished playing with.
But I
didn't kill him.
69
Dulaney studies her.
JOANNE
(continuing)
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney.
Killing Andrew wasn't in my best
interest.
As it is I'm out of a job
and I'm not in his will.
DULANEY
Money isn't the only reason people
commit murder, Miss Braslow.
Dulaney walks off.
Joanne stares after him.
Her face is cold,
showing no sign of emotion.
BAND SHELL, PARK - NIGHT
RAIN falls in sheets.
Dulaney sits inside the small structure,
huddled against one of the pillars.
He is a tragic figure,
desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once
knew.
93
DULANEY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
RAIN continues to fall.
Dulaney is standing across the street,
staring at the house.
He crosses over and is half way to the
door when he stops.
He starts to leave.
The front door opens and Sharon steps out onto the porch.
SHARON
Frank?
He turns around slowly.
He can't bring himself to look at her.
She walks out into the rain.
He lifts his head.
Tears flow
down his face and he cries.
When she begins to cry with him
he breaks down.
DULANEY
(ashamed)
I'm sorry.
God -- I'm so sorry.
He slowly drops to his knees -- holding on to her as if she
were a strong tree in a wind-storm.
DULANEY
Help me.
Please -- help me.
HOUSE - EVENING
It is RAINING lightly.
Dulaney waits at the door of a nice two
story home.
It is answered by a heavy-set man in his fifties,
JOSEPH KOEHLER.
DULANEY
Hi, Joe.
KOEHLER
Frank -- what are you doing here?
DULANEY
I need to ask you a question.
What
made you get in touch with Joanne
Braslow?
KOEHLER
You know I can't talk about that.
DULANEY
I'm not asking for names or
specifics.
I just want to know what
prompted you to make the call?
KOEHLER
Sorry.
Koehler starts to close the door, Dulaney sticks his foot
inside, blocking it.
His face is filled with determination.
Koehler sees it.
DULANEY
Please -- I need your help.
Koehler thinks for a moment.
He can sense Dulaney's need.
KOEHLER
All I can tell you is I was contacted
by an interested party on Miss
Braslow's behalf.
REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
RAIN FALLS.
LIGHTNING fills the sky.
Dulaney drives up --
finds a PARKING SPOT down the street --
gets out of his car
and runs to the door.
As he KNOCKS as loud CLAP on THUNDER
BOOMS overhead.
Dulaney waits impatiently.
He lifts the
FLOWER POT, removes the key and opens the door.
REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
Police cars are lined up outside, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
A light RAIN falls.
Dulaney walks out and heads towards the
street.
He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down
the street towards his car.
FADE TO BLACK
