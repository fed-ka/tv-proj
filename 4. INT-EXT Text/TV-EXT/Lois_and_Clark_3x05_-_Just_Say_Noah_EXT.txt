
    LOIS comes out of a door on the right side of the ticket 
    box.  She heads for a trash can on the sidewalk to dump her
    popcorn.  CLARK appears from the left hand door and heads 
    for the same place.  As they meet:

                                    LOIS
                   What are you doing here?

                                    CLARK
                   Seeing a movie.

                                    LOIS
                   Because it's oddly coincidental 
                   that of all the movies playing in 
                   all the movie theatres we end up at 
                   the same one.  At the same time.

                                    CLARK
                   Maybe it shows we have the same
                   tastes.

    She starts walking briskly down the street.

                                    LOIS
                   Except I walked out.

                                    CLARK
                        (indicates himself)
                   Yo.

                                    LOIS
                   Well _I_ walked out because the 
                   plot was just warmed-over 'Bambi' 
                   without the political sub text.  
                   You?

                                    CLARK
                   I fell asleep!  What difference
                   does it make why I walked out?!

                                    LOIS
                   Because it shows how we look at the
                   same thing differently!

                                    CLARK
                   I think we're completely in synch!

                                    LOIS
                   Yeah, we're so 'in synch' that when 
                   you broke up with me, for 'my own 
                   good,' you figured 'Why bother 
                   talking to Lois about this 
                   life-altering decision, she 
                   probably knows it's best because 
                   we're so _in_ _synch_!!  We're 
                   about as 'in synch' as the English 
                   in a Japanese horror film.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, I was wrong and I admit it.
                   C'mon, you can't stay mad...

                                    LOIS
                   Yes I can.  You can fly, I can stay
                   mad.  It's a gift.

    They've reached the stairs to Lois' building, out of which 
    comes a couple in their 30's, MICHELLE and ARNOLD SITKOWITZ,
    holding hands, laughing and chatting.

                                    MICHELLE
                   Hi, Lois.

                                    LOIS
                   Michelle.  Clark, meet Michelle and
                   Arnold Sitkowitz, my neighbors.

                                    MICHELLE
                   The 'Clark' I keep hearing about.              (X)
                   May you two be as happy as Arnold              (X)
                   and me.

                                    ARNOLD
                        (gazing warmly at her)
                   Ten years and never a cross word.

    Suddenly they're kissing, completely losing track of Lois 
    and Clark.  Lois and Clark stare, wait for them to stop, 
    they don't.  Clark glances at his watch.

                                    LOIS
                   It's... getting late.

                                    CLARK
                   Yeah.

    They look at each other.  Kiss?  Shake hands?  Where are we?

                   Well.  See you tomorrow.

    He smiles, nods, a bit sad, passes Arnold and Michelle, 
    still kissing.

                                    CLARK
                   Nice meeting you.

    She goes inside.  A beat, then:

                                    VOICE (O.S.)
                        (echo; with import)
                   Arnold and Michelle Sitkowitz....

    Arnold and Michelle dazedly stop kissing, look around for 
    the voice.

                                    ARNOLD
                   Where'd that come from?

    A potted bush near the stairs bursts into flames.

                                    MICHELLE
                   Look, Arnold, a burning bush.

                                    VOICE (V.0.)
                   Do not be afraid, for you have been

                                    ARNOLD
                   Chosen for what?

    Dense SMOKE pours from the bush as Michelle and Arnold reel 
    and cough.  A cab pulls up with an evil, wizened Driver, and
    two Thugs in gas masks jump out and wrestle a weakened        (X)
    Arnold and Michelle into the cab.  It SCREECHES off, and

    FADE IN:



    Smoking cars are piled up on the street, with SUPERMAN 
    pulling a Man out of the rubble.  Terrified Nuns stand 
    staring at their mini-van, in the heart of the mess.  Lois 
    exits The Daily Planet.  Distant SIRENS.  Superman sits the 
    Man on the curb, makes sure he's okay, stands, as:

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Hi, where're you off to?

                                    LOIS
                   The interview.

    They both keep looking around, speaking under their breath, 
    trying not to be observed.  Superman keeps smiling, waving 
    to well-wishers who wave, give him "thumbs-up," etc.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   No, but since you're barely 
                   speaking to me, I guess this is one 
                   of the things you barely spoke to

                                    LOIS
                   I want to talk to friends and

                   Lois, I'm working... Excuse me.

    He dashes off to where smoke pours from a car, disperses it 
    with SUPER BREATH.  Meanwhile a NUN has come up to Lois.

                                    NUN
                   Oh, he's somethin', isn't he?

                   Yes.

                                    NUN
                   Thanks to him, the Sisters and I 
                   will still be able to bring our toy 
                   collection to the orphanage.  
                   Superman is a national treasure.

    Superman returns.  The Nun grabs him, gives him a kiss on 
    the cheek, goes.  A cop car and ambulance arrive.

                                    LOIS
                   You know how wonderful it feels

                   month.  They were struggling 
                   artists.  Had only been married 
                   a year.  Moved here from Sweden.

                   with the Sitkowitz's.
                        (to Hansen)
                   By any chance did they have a

                   In fact, until two months ago, Inga 
                   even spoke of divorce and moving 
                   back to Sweden.

    Lois and Clark drive into the wooded compound.



    An Attendant, JEREMY, wears khakis and a long-sleeved 
    t-shirt emblazoned with a large heart in which are the 
    initials L.S.I.L.C. He leads Lois and Clark on a trail 
    through trees, beyond which we see hints of tiny cabins.

                                    JEREMY
                   Each of our guests goes by the 
                   name of an animal species, symbolic 
                   of the primal urge to mate and 
                   further the species.  Larry wants 
                   two of every kind.  You guys'll be 
                   known as 'The Hawks.'
                        (meaningfully)
                   They mate for life.

                                    CLARK
                        (quietly, to Lois)
                   You know what the Sitkowitz's were
                   called?

                                    LOIS
                   'The Badgers.'

    They reach the steps of a cabin.

                                    JEREMY
                   Here we are.  I'll just write your 
                   code name on the doorway and you'll

    tape on the doorway; Clark tips glasses, peers at the tape.   (X)

                   are from the south, you know how
                   you get.

    He is watching her fixedly, she hasn't a clue, but:

                        (to Jeremy)

    She smiles weakly as Jeremy sourly writes "HAWKS" on the
