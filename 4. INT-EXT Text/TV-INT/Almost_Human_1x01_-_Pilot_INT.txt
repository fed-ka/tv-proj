      AT THE BAR

      Patrons, in conversation; dinner, drinks. We HEAR:

                                  JOHN (O.S)
                    ... My father used to say,  If you 
                    have good news, let someone else 
                    tell  em... if you have bad news... 
                    you tell  em. 

      ACROSS THE ROOM

      JOHN KENNEX (our lead, 30 s) and his gorgeous wife, ANNA, at 
      a table.  She listens intently.  He has a great smile.

                                  ANNA
                    -- So, what-- you have bad news?

                                  JOHN
                    Not for you, for Maldonado.  I met 
                    with him this afternoon.

                                  ANNA
                          (smiles)
                    Were doors slammed?

                                  JOHN
                          (smiles too)
                    Doors were almost slammed...

                                  ANNA
                    So what did you tell him, you re 
                    killing me.

                                  JOHN
                    That if he insists on adding 
                      synthetics to my team I m stepping 
                    down.

                                  ANNA
                    You can t help but get in trouble 
                    at work, can you?                                                                                      2.


                                  JOHN
                    No -- but I keep my trouble at the 
                    office.  Anyway, it s my genetic 
                    destiny -- and I m not nearly in 
                    the kind of trouble my dad got into 
                    -- or his dad--

                                  ANNA
                    A lot of talk about family.
                          (then)
                    What did he say?

                                  JOHN
                      Maldonado?  Not sure, I walked out 
                    before he could fight me on it.

                                  ANNA
                    Slamming the door behind you.

                                  JOHN
                    I m not gonna be forced into 
                    working with synthetics-- they 
                    retired Baker on Tuesday-- this is 
                    after Smith and Savini last month--

                                  ANNA
                      I remember.

                                  JOHN
                    Every day I m surrounded by not so 
                    subtle reminders that I m becoming 
                    the last thing I ever thought I d 
                    be: an antique.  And I m sure there 
                    are worse things, but I can t think 
                    of anything more sickening than 
                    being replaced by one of those 
                    fucking machines.  If I weren t 
                    getting results, if somehow I was 
                    letting the department down, I d 
                    get it, but don t tell me I m less 
                    than something that was built in a 
                    Goddamn factory.  Baker and Savini 
                    and Smith are good, hard-working 
                    men who didn t deserve what they 
                    got--

                                  ANNA
                    I m pregnant.

      And like driving into a freeway median at 90 MPH, John 
      suddenly STOPS.  She blushes now.  Smiles --                                                                                      3.


                                  ANNA (CONT D)
                    -- I m sorry, I couldn t keep quiet 
                    any more--

                                  JOHN
                    -- this-- this is the  little 
                    thing  you wanted to talk about--?

                                  ANNA
                    -- maybe not so little--

      He is fucking speechless and glowing and he moves to sit 
      beside her on the banquette. 

      Takes her face and kisses her.  You get a sense they thought 
      this wasn t really possible.  He looks at her, stunned.

                                  ANNA (CONT D)
                    I know-- I don t know how --  

                                  JOHN
                    -- baby, it doesn t matter how.

      He KISSES HER again -- and when he pulls back he sees she is 
      CRYING.  But tears REALLY falling.  Like she s SAD --

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    -- what is it?

                                  ANNA
                    Nothing, it s silly--

                                  JOHN
                    What?

      And she really looks like there s a secret -- something she 
      wants to say, but finally she shakes her head and says:

                                  ANNA
                    I m just so happy...

                                  WAITER (O.S.)
                    Would you like desert--?

      They look up: the WAITER has arrived -- AND THIS IS WEIRD, 
      because the Waiter s NOT HUMAN.  He looks it, mostly, but he 
      clearly has a HUMAN FACEPLATE on a MECHANICAL BEING --

                        JOHNANNA
      -- we re pregnant-- she s 
      pregnant, we re gonna have a 
      baby and he s gonna be beat---- or she.  She.
      -- or she-- is gonna be 
      beautiful.                                                                                      4.


                                  WAITER (CONT D)
                    Very good.  I ll bring champagne--

      Before he can walk off: MUFFLED SOUND OF GUNBLASTS -- AND 
      THEN THE ENTIRE WINDOW AND BAR BEHIND THEM EXPLODES INWARD! 

      A VEHICLE -- a FUTURISTIC-LOOKING CAR -- CRASHES INTO THE 
      RESTAURANT, THROUGH THE FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOW, COMING TO A 
      SUDDEN, HORRIBLE STOP!  People are SCREAMING AND RUNNING -- 
      and Anna is shocked as John protectively covers her -- 

                                  JOHN
                    You okay?!

      -- she is fine, but there s MORE GUN BLASTS NOW -- COMING 
      FROM OUTSIDE!  SCREAMS -- 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Stay here.
                          (to the Waiter)
                    Watch her, please --

      And he races over to the crash -- a terrified WOMAN gets out 
      of the vehicle. 

                                  TERRIFIED WOMAN
                    Someone is shooting at me.  

                                  JOHN
                    Who?

                                  TERRIFIED WOMAN
                    I don t know -- I don t know where 
                    it was coming from.

      John rushes outside -- 


       -- John calls on his PHONE to the station:

                                  JOHN
                    This is detective John Kennex - D10 
                    - We just had an 11-3, at East 
                    Olympic and Los Angeles Street with 
                    multiple injured. Roll paramedics 
                    and fire. 

      But, then A CAR APPEARS IN JOHN S WAY -- HOLY SHIT - he 
      avoids it --

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    -- Show me in pursuit - armed male, 
                    white, 30s, on motorcycle.    

      John turns a final corner and sees THE GUY ON THE BIKE RIDE 
      INTO A HOVER TRANSPORTER -- a large FLYING TRUCK -- which 
      TAKES OFF!

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Crossing San Pedro and East 14th. 
                    Suspect just entered a Lifter...


      Many bystanders have gathered now. John comes back in -- 
      PEOPLE STILL RUNNING ABOUT, some injured, others not -- 
      they're helping each other. 

      John moves to the damaged vehicle that crashed -- looking to 
      find the WOMAN who was driving --

                                  JOHN 
                          (urgent, to a witness)
                    Where is the woman who was driving 
                    this vehicle?

                                    WITNESS
                    She ran off.  

      The Witness points to the shattered glass wall and the street 
      beyond -- SHE S GONE.  

      Concerned, John moves to the wrecked car and SCANS THE CAR S 
      LICENSE PLATE with his COMM DEVICE and beeps are HEARD -- we 
      SEE ON HIS SCREEN -  STOLEN VEHICLE   UNREGISTERED . 

      WTF? Suddenly, the ONLY thing he can think about now is 
      getting back to Anna. And he makes it back to his table -- 
      BUT SHE IS GONE TOO -- through the madness he calls for her -- 

                                  JOHN
                    Anna! ... Anna! 

      He finds the robo-Waiter.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Where did she go?!

                                  WAITER
                    She left with her friends.

                                  JOHN
                          (stopping him, heart 
                            POUNDING)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      7.

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    -- Wait-- what friends?  I asked 
                    you to watch her--

                                  WAITER
                    Men. Two of them. 

      ON JOHN  -- as the world begins to swirl around him -- his 
      mind is racing -- WTF is going on here -- this whole thing is 
      looking like a set-up. He gets on his phone.

                                  JOHN
                    Dispatch, I need to track a phone 
                    signal. The number is --  

                                  DISPATCH OPERATOR
                    -- You know I cannot do that 
                    without a -- 


      TWO DISPATCH OFFICERS at their posts, ONE FEMALE -- HEAR the 
      panic in his voice. 

                                  JOHN
                    -- It s my wife. She s been taken 
                    against her will.  I need you to 
                    track her phone. 

      Realizing what is going on, Becky slides to her monitor.  

                                  DISPATCH OPERATOR
                    John, It s Becky. Give me the 
                    number.


      John races through the mayhem to an elevator bank -- enters 
      an elevator.                                                                                      8.



      John rushes onto the top floor -- checks his phone. -- The 
      BLIP continues  -- She s on the roof -- moving laterally -- 
      Shit. He races to a door -- BOUNDS up stairs -- and finally 
      bursts out onto --


      -- HE GASPS AWAKE.  Terrified beyond words.  Soaking with 
      sweat.  More and more angry with every passing beat.  This is 
      so hardly the first time he s had this dream.

      He reaches over.  Shakily takes a wildly TINY red pill from a 
      SILVER MEDICINE TUBE.  Puts it under his tongue.  Gets out of 
      bed.

      A joyless apartment.  John stands at the window.  Shirtless.  
      A body of training and battle scars.  Looking out, on the 
      verge of crying.  But he can t.  Like... LITERALLY can t.  He 
      is too closed up.  Too lost in his loss.  Too calloused by 
      all the fucking guilt and nightmares. And we PULL BACK... 
      REVEALING:                                                                                      9.



      CAMERA MOVES in this fast-paced environment, tracking cops 
      going about their business. SUSPECTS and LAWYERS at the 
      booking desk waiting their turn. It s hectic. It was in 2013, 
      imagine it now. 

      Much to look at here, but what s EXCEPTIONALLY COOL - Robots. 
      (In 2048, robots are widely used in law enforcement, and the 
      cops are used to it.)  They re called MX-43s, very efficient, 
      white clad, battle-ready Androids.  

      Find a 42 year-old FEMALE COP, VALERIE STAHL, who is dealing 
      with much morning business. She s got a handful of files -- 
      she SEES John as he walks in. 

                                    VALERIE
                    Are you kidding me? ... Are you 
                    kidding? 

                                  JOHN
                    What?

                                    VALERIE
                    I came in this morning and the 
                    reports were done. Even the 10-43 
                    you said you weren t gonna do. When 
                    did you do this? 

                                  JOHN
                    Last night. Couldn t sleep. 

                                    VALERIE
                    You re too good to me. How do you 
                    feel? 

      John smiles -- 

                                  JOHN
                    Who s ever better than me?                                                                                    10.


      She smiles, likes him - Very much like an older sister, not a 
      sexual spark between them.  

      John almost walks into an MX-43, and John stares at him, like 
      he wants to kill him, forcing the robot to walk around him. 
      We get the idea that John has an unqualified disdain for 
      these robots.  

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                          (under his breath)
                    You don t own the place, Synthetic.

      They walk on. 

                                   VALERIE
                          (continuing to John)
                    You couldn t look worse. 

      John s sleek belt-worn communicator buzzes as they walk. 

                                  JOHN
                    You say that every day, at some 
                    point it loses its power.  

      He looks at his COMM. 

                                    VALERIE
                          (re: the call)
                    What?

                                  JOHN
                    Robbery. Last night. Bio-facility. 


      There are things in this car we have NEVER seen before. Cool 
      buttons, levers, and screens, and God knows what they do, but 
      they sure are intriguing. A really mean DOUBLE-BARREL BLASTER 
      is locked to the dash.  

      Valerie gets in the passenger seat -- stops John, who sits 
      behind the wheel, for a beat.  

                                    VALERIE
                      Seriously.  You ve never looked 
                    worse.  

      The way she says this, we can tell she is concerned for her 
      partner. Easy back and forth gives way to legitimate concern.                                                                                      11.


                                    VALERIE (CONT D)
                    I m worried about your health. I 
                    don t mind doing paperwork, I d 
                    rather you sleep. 

      Beat... John shrugs it off --

                                    VALERIE (CONT D)
                    My brother died of a heart attack 
                    when he was 36, John.  I ve seen it 
                    happen.  You can t be a rock 
                    forever.  

      He looks at her --

                                    VALERIE (CONT D)
                    You won t talk to me... I never 
                    know what s going on inside your 
                    head anymore, man. You won t let 
                    people in. 

                                  JOHN
                    I m okay.  

      And while he doesn t convince us, we sure like him for how 
      gently he says it. And off this, CUT TO:


      We see there are a few MX-43 ROBOT COPS here with the regular 
      cops and assisting CSIs. It s cool to watch the robots do 
      their work. 

      John and Valerie enter, approach GUERRING (30), another LAPD 
      cop. 

                                  GUERRING
                          (to Valerie)
                    You look tired. 

                                    VALERIE
                    Shut up. 
                          (then)
                    What do we got?

      He hands Valerie a report.                                                                                     12.


                                  GUERRING
                    This is a private lab run by Omni, 
                      a research company working on DNA.  

                                  JOHN
                    Okay. 

                                  GUERRING
                    Three robberies in the last month. 
                    Each time they stole single-strand 
                    synthetic DNA. This time, it didn t 
                    go so well. 

      They come to a LONG WHITE HALLWAY -- there is BLOOD on the 
      floor and TWO DEAD BODIES, covered with sheets. 

                                  GUERRING (CONT D)
                          (re: the bodies)
                    Security guards. One of  em must ve 
                    got a shot off... 

      Guerring nods to AN OFFICE WINDOW -- John sees a cop standing 
      with A CAUGHT THIEF, (30) DRESSED IN BLACK, who is receiving 
      medical treatment from TWO EMS WORKERS.

                                  GUERRING (CONT D)
                    They got one of them. Took one in 
                    the leg.

      Valerie looks at the report.

                                    VALERIE
                    What s so special about this DNA?  

                                  GUERRING
                    It s programmable. 

                                    VALERIE
                      Programmable?

      An MX-43 hears the question, and begins to respond like a, 
      well, like a fucking annoying know-it-all robot.  

                                  MX-43
                    DNA programming is based on 
                        epigenetics. Epigenetics determines 
                    which genes get "turned on" and 
                    "turned off."  Molecules that 
                    determine which genes -- 

      John, bored, just walks away from the robot, not wanting to 
      hear from that walking calculator. One thing is certain -- he 
      STILL hates machines. He watches the EMTs talking to the 
      Captured Thief.                                                                                     13.


                                    VALERIE
                            (approaching John, still 
                            looking at the file)
                    Where do we start?

                                  JOHN
                          (pointing to the Thief)
                    Let s ask him. 

                                  GUERRING
                    Be my guest, but he s not talking. 

      John smiles (a fucking TERRIFIC smile).

                                  JOHN
                    Guerring!  He hasn t talked to me!  

      He heads off, Valerie says, knowing the brutal truth --

                                    VALERIE
                    He ll just charm the guy.  

      As she walks off, Guerring says:

                                  GUERRING
                    That s why I called you guys.  His 
                    charm.


      BANGGGG! The Captured Thief SLAMS against the wall. John 
      grabs him by the shirt and brings him up -- He jams a FILM-
      LIKE PAPER in his face. 

                                  JOHN
                    This is your booking sheet. Do you 
                    know why I have it? ... I 
                      shouldn t. Do you know why I do?   

                                  CAPTURED THIEF
                    No...

      ANGLE ON

      Valerie, watching this. She s a little unsettled. She s 
      someone who might bend the rules, but does not break them.  

      John slams the Thief s head against the wall once more -- A 
      cut opens above his eye. 

                                  JOHN
                          (re: the cut)
                    This way they know you had that 
                    when you came in.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    14.

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                          (then, to Valerie)
                    Suspect has contusion above right 
                    eye.

      John walks to Valerie, hands her the sheet. She clicks her 
      pen and begins to fill it in. 

      John wrenches him up -- sits across from the Thief. NO CHARM 
      INVOLVED -

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What s your name? ... 
                          (no answer...)
                    Why did you steal that DNA? What s 
                    it for? 
                          (silence)
                    ... Why do you need programmable 
                    DNA? Are you ripping off the 
                    design, or is it something else?  

      The Thief says nothing -- he actually smiles -- blood on his 
      teeth. Just then -- GUERRING enters. He has an electronic 
      tablet and he hands it to John.

                                  GUERRING
                    We picked up a car that was left 
                    parked near the lab.  

      John nods, looking over the tablet report. He looks up to the 
      Thief. John smiles now.  

                                  JOHN
                    You left your car there?

      The Thief smiles back. 

                                  CAPTURED THIEF
                          (it is)
                    Not my car. 

                                  JOHN
                          (looking at the tablet)
                    ... Registration isn t real... 
                    Insurance isn t real. 

      The Thief smiles again --

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    ... But the smog violation 
                      tickets... those ARE real. 

      The Thief s smile drops.                                                                                    15.


                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Three in the last month. Issued at 
                    the same apartment building. ...I m 
                    pretty sure, that s your real 
                    address. 

      The Thief can t hide he is worried that they have his 
      address. John hands the tablet back to Guerring. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    2356 Flower St. 
                          (the irony)
                    You live on a street called 
                     Flower?  

      Suddenly, John reaches out and smashes the guy s head down on 
      the table -- it s comical it happens so fast. He screams in 
      pain -- 

                                    VALERIE
                          (calmly, setting 
                            boundaries)
                    John... that s enough. 

                                  JOHN
                    Write down broken nose. 

                                    VALERIE
                          (to the Thief)
                    What s the DNA for? If you help 
                    us... we ll help you.  

      The Thief looks back, and we can SEE he is scared. But not 
      because of John -- 

                                  CAPTURED THIEF
                    ... You just killed me. By finding 
                    my address, you just killed me. 
                    They re gonna kill me ...

      This guy is now TERRIFIED. 

                                    VALERIE
                    Who?

      Beat. 

                                    VALERIE (CONT D)
                    We ll protect you. 

                                  CAPTURED THIEF
                    You can t protect me. They re back - 
                    you don t know.                                                                                     16.


                                  JOHN
                    Who s back?

      No answer, he just looks at John, tears in his eyes. John 
      reaches out again -- about to do his thing when the guy 
      shrinks away, finally, tearfully reveals:

                                  CAPTURED THIEF
                    ... The Insyndicate.

      CLOSE ON JOHN

      This has a huge reaction from John. He stares at the Thief 
      like he cannot believe what just came out of his mouth. 

      ON VALERIE 

      She watches John. She has a reaction too, but hers is more 
      about John s reaction, or rather, HOW John is dealing with 
      this. 

      ON GUERRING, watching John, wondering what is wrong. 

      Suddenly, John gets up and.... He leaves. 

      Valerie sits there a beat -- Guerring looks at her, like WTF? 
      She gets up and walks out after him.


      Valerie comes out -- she looks after John, who is already 
      down the hall, and heading out the door. 

                                    VALERIE
                    ... John!

      He s gone. Guerring comes out --

                                  GUERRING
                    What s his problem?

      Valerie looks at him, realizing he doesn t know. 

                                    VALERIE
                    His wife died three years ago. 

                                  GUERRING
                    Okay --

                                    VALERIE
                    The Insyndicate was behind it.

                                  GUERRING
                    What is The Insyndicate?                                                                                     17.


                                    VALERIE
                    They were a drug cartel, they were 
                    around three years ago. They had 
                    the market, really dark stuff. He 
                    was investigating them. ... He was 
                    getting too close and they went 
                    after his wife. 

      Beat.

                                    VALERIE (CONT D)
                    And when they abducted her, she was 
                    killed. 
                          (then...)
                    Every division went after these 
                    guys. But, they were gone. 

                                  GUERRING
                    What do you mean gone?

                                    VALERIE
                      Disappeared. Like they never 
                    existed. 

                                  GUERRING
                    How does a crime organization just 
                      disappear?

      And that hangs there -- Valerie turns and looks into the 
      INTERROGATION ROOM - we can SEE the Thief, sitting there, 
      looking back at them. Creepy. 

                                    VALERIE
                    I don t know... But apparently 
                    they re back.

      Guerring digests this.


      A greenish hue is cast over everything -- many long lab 
      tables and equipment. Looks like a meth lab, but so much 
      more. 

      STACKS OF COUNTED CASH, sitting around. A lounging ROBOTIC 
      SEXBOT, who has a semi-removed faceplate and barely any 
      clothing.  And for the somewhat perverted viewers, it makes 
      the future something to look forward to.

      A group of WORKERS in lab coats, are at lab tables, using 
      futuristic microscopes.  It s a sort of organized black lab 
      sweat shop.  Weird as shit.                                                                                    18.


      We find a man we will come to know as REINHARDT, (30s), 
      working hard himself at a SYNTHETIC DNA SEQUENCER (he s a bad 
      guy, but MIT drop out and smarter than anyone watching TV and 
      certainly smarter than anyone making it).  

      Reinhardt is intense and always a touch distracted. He swipes 
      his hand, and a HOLOGRAM CPU screen appears with an 
      INCREDIBLY long sequence of numbers and equations. What they 
      mean, we can only guess. 

                                  CORTEZ (O.S.)
                      Reinhardt.

      Reinhardt look up, seeing one of his men approaching, dressed 
      in the same black as the Captured Thief. 

                                  CORTEZ (CONT D)
                    I ve just confirmed. Trevor is in 
                    police custody. 

      This disturbs Reinhardt, but he isn t surprised.  Just tense.  
      The SEXBOT approaches. 

                                  SEXBOT
                    You seem anxious, Mr. Reinh--  

                                  REINHARDT
                    -- Not now. 

      -- And she s walking off before he is finished saying it. 
      Reinhardt makes it clear: 

                                  REINHARDT (CONT D)
                    We can t have him in custody.

                                  CORTEZ
                    We thought he made it out. 
                          (but...)
                    He knows very little. 

                                  REINHARDT
                    He knows enough.  And now... he 
                    knows even more. 

      Then:

                                  REINHARDT (CONT D)
                    We didn t come back to fail. 

      Cortez nods and walks off. 

      HOLD ON Reinhardt, upset.                                                                                    19.


      He picks up one of the samples he was looking at. And 
      whatever it is that they re making in those creepy test 
      tubes, it holds his attention.  And off this, we CUT TO:


      John is collecting himself, sitting on the curb. Valerie 
      comes out the door, seeing him. 

                                    VALERIE
                    I just spoke with Captain 
                      Maldonado. He wants him brought to 
                      a safehouse. 

                                  JOHN
                    I m going to check out the address 
                    on Flower St.  

      Beat. 

                                    VALERIE
                    John -- I think...  Maybe you want 
                    to go talk to Balthazar.

      A longer beat. 

                                  JOHN
                    Don t need a shrink. 

      Valerie holds her look - she smiles at him, but he sees she s 
      very concerned.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I promise you, I will go. 

                                    VALERIE
                    When?

                                  JOHN
                    Before I die. Likely just before.

      They get to John s car.

      Valerie looks at him.  

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    You gotta hand it to  em.  They re 
                    creative.  For five-hundred years 
                    street drugs were nothing new.  
                    Iterative differences.  Then they 
                    came along and showed us what 
                    dangerous is. ... But, if they re 
                    back?  ... If this is for real?                                                                                     20.


      Beat. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Whoever runs it has learned a few 
                    things.  And they re gonna be a 
                    step ahead of us. They already are.

      John gets into his car. Valerie s concern for him is not 
      assuaged. CUT TO:


      BOOOOM! The door is shredded. MX-43s and TACTICAL COPS enter, 
      GUNS DRAWN, swarming the place. 

      It s a basic three bedroom apartment. John enters too now, 
      gun up, and after a moment --

                                  TACTICAL OFFICER (O.S.)
                    Clear! ... We re clear. 

      John lowers his weapon -- He looks around. The place has been 
      cleaned out.

      A WAFER-THIN, futuristic hovering TV is still here -- a 
      cartoon (one character we will come to see from time to time 
      throughout the series) playing for no one. It s a bit creepy. 

      ON JOHN -- searching the place. There are some straggles of 
      wires and leftover shit on the floors -- and in the closet. 

      Nothing noteworthy, just small things left behind. Magazines. 
      The fridge? A few packets of take-out Chinese food mustard 
      and soy sauce. 

      The TACTICAL OFFICER APPROACHES. 

                                  TACTICAL OFFICER (CONT D)
                    Landlord says people would come and 
                    go here a lot, but there were never 
                    any problems. 

                                  JOHN
                    See if you can speak to any 
                    tenants. 

      The Tactical officer heads off. John walks around, looking 
      for clues -- notices... The WINDOWS HAVE BEEN HERMETICALLY 
      SEALED. In an apartment? Weird. 

      CLOSE ON AN OUTLET COVER --- The outlets are loose, and John 
      opens one -- they ve been augmented. THICK WIRES leading 
      THROUGH the wall to the balcony outside -- John tracks these -
      - what are they?                                                                                     21.



      A deserted office building floor somewhere, with a mostly 
      blown-out city view.  

      The Thief is led into a holding room by TWO DETAIL COPS. TWO 
      MX-43s are here also.  Valerie watches as THE THIEF is cuffed 
      to a chair.  Valerie takes out a cell phone. She dials. 

                                    VALERIE
                    Stahl. D10. 
                          (then)
                    He s  tucked in.  

      She hangs up. When she looks back at the Thief, he s looking 
      at her. After a long beat --  

                                  CAPTURED THIEF
                    They re gonna find me. 

      The way he looks at her is spooky. She takes off her jacket 
      and sits down with the other cops. CUT TO:


      CLOSE ON - a small drop-ceiling door in the closet, up to the 
      air vents. 

      WEAPONS ARE STASHED HERE. TACTICAL AGENT #2 hands down a few 
      weird looking grenades, a SLEEK RIFLE, and ... A BLASTER, 
      like the one that Long Hair on the motorcycle had in the 
      teaser -- John looks at it -- FLASH CUT TO: 


      Valerie is looking out the window to the city beyond. Maybe 
      thinking about John. Maybe worrying about John.  

      The detail cops watch the Captured Thief asleep in his chair -
      - But, he startles awake, as he hears a LOUD DISTANT BOOM -- 
      like a door has been blown off its hinges from below. 

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    ... What was that? 

      Valerie reacts -- now we hear GUNSHOTS --  the safehouse is 
      BEING RAIDED. And off this, CUT TO:


      Cortez blasts through the doors, FIRING - flanked by other 
      Insyndicate men. They re instantly FIRED BACK on by Cops -- 
      It s INSANE!!                                                                                      23.


      MX-43s take the front line, firing as they advance -- Brave - 
      hard to take down -- strong as hell. One of the Thieves is 
      killed by one robot. 

      ANOTHER INSYNDICATE THIEF raises a STRANGE GUN, like we ve 
      never seen before -- it s energy-based, like a pulse, and it 
      blasts the MX-43s backwards into walls. Holy shit! These 
      robots are bad-ass, but not invulnerable.  The Thieves 
      continue down the hall --


      VALERIE appears at the end of the hall unloading her clip as 
      the Thieves advance towards her. 


      Cortez and the Insyndicate Thieves continue their fire fight 
      through the uniformed cops, getting closer TO THE AREA WHERE 
      THEY RE HOLDING THE CAPTURED THIEF. 

      WITH THE THIEF -- Terrified. Valerie is the last line of 
      defense, reloads as fast as she can. 


      John moves through traffic -- Back in Downtown -- Almost 
      there... 


      Valerie is hit -- HARD -- goes down. Cortez appears. He steps 
      over Valerie -- doesn t care about her -- he s here for a 
      reason.  He approaches the trembling Thief, who is crying for 
      his life. 

                                  CORTEZ
                    Hi, Trevor. 

      Another of the THIEVES walks up, raises a rifle, and FIRES -- 
      BUT THE GUN FIRES A FUTURISTIC PLASTIC WRAP THAT SEALS AROUND 
      HIS HEAD!!! RENDERING HIM UNCONSCIOUS. WILD! CUT TO:


      John enters -- Finds the carnage -- AND FINDS VALERIE, WHO 
      APPEARS TO BE DEAD -- OH NO -- NOT AGAIN!!!!!

                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    25.


                                            ACT TWO


      POV through a WINDOW into an operating room. We can see 
      Valerie lying on a gurney in the distance -- many doctors 
      around her.  

      CLOSE ON JOHN -- watching her. 

      An ER SURGEON (30s) exits, and approaches.   

                                  ER SURGEON
                    We re going to keep her in a coma. 
                    The next step is exo-cranial 
                    surgery, but we ll know more in a 
                    few hours. 

                                  JOHN
                      Thank-you.

      The Surgeon leaves. If John was poleaxed before, he is just 
      numb and getting worse. CUT TO:


      TRACKING WITH ENERGY, as JOHN walks with CAPTAIN MALDONADO 
      (50s). Maldonado did not get this job handed to him -- he s 
        hardworking, and smart, and he got here by sheer 
      determination.   

                                  MALDONADO
                    How the hell did they find the 
                      safehouse? 

                                  JOHN
                    I don t know. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    Do you know what kind of narcotic 
                    they re making with this DNA? 

                                  JOHN
                    No, I don t have a connection yet.     

                                  MALDONADO
                    Nothing more came from the 
                    apartment lab on Flower? No 
                    evidence of the stolen DNA there? 
                    No fingerprints? 
                          (another head shake)
                    Okay.                                                                                      26.


      They arrive at Maldonado s office -- Maldonado takes off his 
      coat and settles in -- 

                                  JOHN
                    I m going to find out if 
                      Insyndicate has a renewed presence 
                    on the street. If it is drugs, 
                    maybe I can hear something about 
                    it.     

      Maldonado nods, looking at John - something on his mind. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    Are we just gonna pretend? ... 
                    We re not going to talk about this?

                                  JOHN
                    About what?

                                  MALDONADO
                      Technically, given your history 
                    with this group... you should be 
                    removed from this investigation.  

      John watches Maldonado carefully -- this COULD become an 
      issue.  

                                  JOHN
                    You did that the last time, 
                    remember? 

                                  MALDONADO
                    You think there is a statute of 
                      limitation on policy? 

      John stares back. The silence is filled with troubled 
      history.   

                                  JOHN
                          (being even clearer)
                    I sat out the last time and they 
                    got away.  

      Beat. We can tell that Maldonado cares a lot for John. We re 
      talking about his WIFE here. He lost his FUCKING wife! 

                                  MALDONADO
                    I want you to tell me you re okay, 
                    John. 

      John looks back, unflinching.

                                  JOHN
                    I m okay.                                                                                     27.


      The way this was said, it could mean  I m okay, I can handle 
      this.  Or  I m okay to track these bastards and kill every 
      last one of them.  Whatever your take, Maldonado s decision 
      is made: 

                                  MALDONADO
                    Good. Take an MX with you. Any one.  

      Blink. Blink. 

                                  JOHN
                    What?

                                  MALDONADO
                    You re partnering with an MX. 

      John looks out the glass office, where a few MX s are, like 
      they re a side-dish he hadn t ordered.  

                                  JOHN
                    ... I don t like machines. 

                      MALDONADOJOHN
      I know you re a hold out. I do flesh and bone. Like I 
      But, these aren t like the always have -- always will. 
      first and second gen models, Like my father before me did. 
      John.  Those had problems, I ll take Guerring with me if 
      and issues, and were you insist I take someone --  
      decommissioned for a reason. 
          (then... looking out to 
        the MXs)
      -- These machines stop cops 
      from dying. Period. 

      Beat. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    You re taking one. 

      Maldonado goes through his messages on his tablet -- then, 
      looks up - sees John still standing there. 

                                  MALDONADO (CONT D)
                          (like, WTF?)
                    ... Go get me results.  

      And off John, realizing he s not getting out of this shit, 
      CUT TO:

      Captured Thief s head. When the oxygen hits him, he sucks air 
      into his lungs. 

      Next -- Long Hair injects him with a metal syringe. After a 
      moment, the Thief seems to be in EXTREME PAIN. Long Hair nods 
      at... 

      Reinhardt, standing nearby, watching. 

                                  REINHARDT
                          (to the Thief)
                    You should remain calm. 

      The Thief looks up at him, confused, terrified. 

      He SEES that the SEXBOT is lounging on a chair, watching this 
      unfold, unmoved. Creepy. 

                                  CAPTURED THIEF
                          (to Reinhardt, struggling 
                          to breathe)
                    W-what... did you do to me?

      Long Hair hands Reinhardt the syringe - he silently 
        disassembles it. And it s FUCKING SCARY and you never want to 
      be in this chair. 

                                  REINHARDT
                    Your heart is swelling. Depending  
                    on your pulse rate, it will soon 
                    explode in your chest. 

      The Thief howls in pain --

                                  REINHARDT (CONT D)
                    I would calm down... remain calm... 
                    keep your heart rate down the best 
                    you can.

      Reinhardt takes a chair and sets it in front of him. 

                                  REINHARDT (CONT D)
                    I want to assure you... when you 
                    lie... your heart rate goes up. 
                    That s why we re doing this. So...
                          (beat)
                    Tell the truth. What did you tell 
                    the police? 

      Reinhardt knows he told them something, he leans in...                                                                                    29.


                                  REINHARDT (CONT D)
                    They found out where you lived. 
                    Flower Street. They showed up 
                    there. 

      The Captured Thief hesitates, and he experiences a SHOCK OF 
      PAIN... 

                                  CAPTURED THIEF
                    ... Yes. 
                          (then...)
                    But, nothing else...

                                  REINHARDT
                    Who are the cops that are 
                      investigating us? 

      And off this, we CUT TO:


      John drives -- annoyed beside a fucking MX-43. He hates it. 
      The thing is humorless and cold and has all the answers with 
      none of the charm. 

      John is so uncomfortable. After a beat. 

                                  JOHN
                    So... How does it feel to be a 
                    robot? 

      The MX-43 just looks at him.

      Beat --

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    That was a joke. 

      The thing just looks ahead again.  

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    ... What kind of music do you like? 

      Another look. 

                                  MX-43
                    Was that another joke?

                                  JOHN
                    Yeah.  

      John smirks -- looks back to the road. CUT TO:                                                                                    30.



      We can SEE through the windshield, AT THE ENTRY of a rundown 
      building - ten or so GANG MEMBERS are gathered. 

      John moves to get out, and so does the MX-43, but John stops 
      him--

                                  JOHN
                    Stay in the car. 

      The MX-43 does as told. John heads off. As John does this, 
      the MX scans the GANG.

      MX POV - and this is wild, because we can SEE HIS FACIAL REC 
      and data searching. Very quickly - the men are identified and 
      their STATS AND RAP SHEETS displayed. We can ALSO see as this 
      is going on -- various weapons are being THERMAL ID d under 
      their shirts.


      MUSIC IS PLAYING from somewhere. John, the MX-43 and Pusher 
      enter. It s dark, concrete, but a few sun streams come 
      through the painted/boarded windows.  

      They make their way through the damp hallways. In side-rooms 
      we see occasional JUNKIES, strung out... 

      Pusher leads them down the hall towards... A DOOR AT THE END, 
      mostly in darkness.

      They HEAR scary weird shit happening behind it -- and it s 
      like a horror movie, the sounds of PAINFUL SCREAMING, 
      twisting -- and they get to the door and kick it open -- 

      And there, is a PERSON having a  TWISTED O.D.  - literally.  

      ON A MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR -- A GUY (30s) IS THERE, WRITHING 
      AND IN PAIN -- And as they move through the dark room towards 
      him -- THEY SEE THAT, HORRIFYINGLY, HE IS SLOWLY MORPHING 
      FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER, THREE PEOPLE A MINUTE -- AND HE S 
      IN A KIND OF FUCKED UP AGONY AND IT IS TRULY AND ABSOLUTELY 
      TERRIFYING. And off this --                                                                                    33.



      John and the MX-43 drive on the freeway. 

                                  JOHN
                    Have you seen anything like this 
                    before? 

                                  MX-43
                    Negative. And I have been though 
                      two-hundred and eighteen raids. I  
                    can recall every detail. 

      John looks at the MX-43 -- At first, he is gonna say 
      something to the machine about how arrogant that sounds --but 
      he s struck by something. 

                                  JOHN
                    You remember every detail of every 
                    case? 

                                  MX-43
                    Yes. 

      There is a beat -- something occurs to John. Then:

                                  JOHN
                    How far back do you have recorded? 
                    Do you have the last time 
                      Insyndicate was here? 

                                  MX-43
                    I don t go back that far. 

      Beat. 

      John thinks a second, and makes a decision -- He reaches 
      over, opens the door handle, and PUSHES THE MX-43 OUT OF THE 
      FUCKING CAR AT 90MPH WITH HIS FOOT!!!! 

      The thing gets sucked out the door -- 


      John looks in the rear view mirror. That was the shortest 
      partnership of all time. 

      He puts his eyes back on the road and turns on the radio. And 
      off this, CUT TO:


        A lab/warehouse where the LAPD robots are fixed and 
      maintained. Tiny ROBOTIC CREATURES are here and there. This 
      is a wild place -- machines everywhere -- parts of robots -- 
        half-constructed MX 43s, some for parts, some in rebuild 
      state. 

      This is a wonderland for LAPD technician RUDY LOM (30s), our 
      Q, a genetic/robotic engineer. He s overworked and underpaid, 
      dressed in a lab coat. Rudy is lonely and has no friends, at 
      least human friends. 

                                  RUDY
                      Insyndicate?

      John follows him around, as Rudy is unlocking and opening 
      various storage areas.

                                  JOHN
                    I believe they re responsible for a 
                    dangerous new drug on the street. 

                                  RUDY
                    Okay. 

                                  JOHN
                    There was a division-wide raid, 
                    years ago to shut them down, the 
                    last time they were doing this - 
                    some first Gen robots were used in 
                    it. 

      Rudy opens a walk-in freezer, he walks in and then out almost 
      immediately -- continuing to open more storage areas.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I was thinking, they might have 
                      information - or maybe details - 
                    that could help us find these guys.  
                    Maybe some of these old models 
                    would have info in them that I can 
                    use now.                                                                                     35.


                                  RUDY
                    Only one robot is left that 
                    would ve been involved in those 
                    raids. He s definitely on the scrap 
                    heap -- about to be sent to LAX for 
                    menial labor. Those models do very 
                    well with re-purposing. 
                          (then)
                    Funny you showed up now, this one s 
                    scheduled to finally be picked up 
                    on Thursday.

      Rudy pulls open a last drawer, like a morgue, revealing:

      A DRN-0167. AKA: Dorian. OUR OTHER STAR.  Inert. Dead to the 
      world, eyes opened. He looks likeable and strong - like a 
      HUMAN, not like the MX-43s.  And sorta  sad, LYING THERE, 
      UNUSED AND BROKEN. 

      John stares at him -- Something strikes a chord.  Then...

                                  JOHN
                    Let s power him up.

                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    36.


                                          ACT THREE


      CLOSE ON DORIAN -- unconscious, lying on a slab. MACHINES and 
      DEVICES surround his head. These are complex instruments, the 
      likes of which, we have never seen.   

      Most of these connections are FUTURE GEN INFRARED devices 
      that send/receive information through the air. But, we ll get 
      to that.    

      John is sitting nearby, reading an R.E.C -- Rebuild/Enhance 
      Catalogue -- for all intents and purposes: an instruction 
      manual for the DRN-0167. Rudy is reaching inside one of these 
      IR machines --

                                  RUDY
                    There. This should be good now. 
                    That DF fuse was bad. This 
                    should...
                          (he clicks in the fuse)
                    ... do the trick.

      And he flicks a switch -- and suddenly a GREEN HOLOGRAPHIC 
      INTERFACE appears out of nowhere -- it hovers about a foot 
      above DORIAN -- waiting for command. 

                                  RUDY (CONT D)
                          (to John)
                    What was the operation number for 
                    the raids? Or case file if you have 
                    it. 

                                  JOHN
                    Case file. 546298 Alpha.

      Rudy nods, but he does something weird - he makes a pose as 
      he punches the numbers in.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What was that?

                                  RUDY
                          (re: Dorian)
                    He just took a picture of me. Every 
                    time his memory is accessed, 
                    there s a security function that 
                    takes a photograph of whoever is 
                    messing around in here. 

      John nods --                                                                                    37.


                                  RUDY (CONT D)
                    There s a camera, but you d never 
                    find it. 
                          (with geek pride)
                    I was on the software team that 
                    helped design that. 

      Rudy watches as the holographic interface streams millions of 
      digits as it searches... Then a few clicks are heard as the 
      machines near Dorian s head begin to activate -- like they re 
        interpreting the digits. 

      MORE COOL SCREENS POP UP - reams of FILE INFORMATION and 
      images.  John watches this, and even for a guy who hates 
      machines, he s intrigued. 

                                  JOHN
                          (walking over)
                    ... Can you find the day of the 
                    raid? 

                                  RUDY
                          (nodding)
                    You re watching it. 

      Rudy points to ONE OF THE SCREENS displaying A MOVING, SINGLE 
      CAMERA POV that we understand as Dorian s RECORDED POV - A 
      FIRST PERSON HOLOGRAM OF THE DAY THE RAIDS ON INSYNDICATE 
      WENT DOWN. The footage blips and surges, like it s a bit 
      damaged. 

      ON JOHN

                                  JOHN
                    It s corrupted.

                                  RUDY
                    Who knows how long he was sitting 
                    around in a crate before he got 
                    here? And what kind of damage was 
                    done to him. For all we know, he 
                    was dropped off a forklift.

      ON SCREEN: An intense gun battle plays out for us. Cops are 
      firing, Insyndicate bad guys fire back. Dorian s gunplay is 
      impressive. John watches as Dorian skillfully kills one, 
      undeniably saving a cop.  

      IN THE LAB

      John, IMPRESSED, looks down at the sleeping robot.  

      Then, SOMETHING ON SCREEN CATCHES JOHN S EYE.                                                                                     38.


                                  JOHN
                    ... Stop. Go back.  

      Rudy does -- John points to futuristic equivalents of WHITE 
      BOARDS in the Insyndicate lab that are visible on screen. And 
      what is written on them interests John. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                          (pointing)
                    Rudy, blow this up. 

      Rudy BLOWS UP THE IMAGE - and we see on the boards are 
      depictions of ...

                                  RUDY
                          (realizing)
                    DNA strands. 

      John goes to his own TABLET DEVICE and accesses his own case 
      files. He looks at something, and then back to the screen. 

                                  RUDY (CONT D)
                    What is it?

      John shows him his TABLET SCREEN. On it, we SEE the DNA 
      strand that was stolen from the white lab in act one.  

                                  JOHN
                    That s the programmable DNA strand 
                    that Insyndicate stole from a lab 
                      yesterday. 
                          (pointing to Dorian s 
                            recorded raid footage)
                    That raid was three years ago. On 
                    that board there, is the same DNA 
                    strand.

      Rudy compares -- it s true. 

                                  RUDY
                    So... 

                                  JOHN
                    So whatever this drug is --  it s 
                    been in the works for a long time. 
                          (to Rudy)
                    Play on.  

      Rudy continues the footage -- 

      ON SCREEN, the raid plays out, ANOTHER GUNSHOT is fired at 
      him -- and we SEE the shooter is LONG HAIR, the MAN THAT 
      KILLED ANNA!                                                                                    39.


      This bowls John over.  HOLY SHIT.  Seeing John s reaction -- 
      Rudy stops again, looking at the creepy image.  

                                  RUDY
                    Who is that? 

      Beat... John stares at Long Hair -- he s in 3D Hologram, so 
      it s like John can reach out and touch him. 

                                  JOHN
                    He was involved in the death of my 
                    wife.

      Longgg beat. Rudy doesn t hear THAT every day. He looks at 
      John and then back to the screen. 

                                  RUDY
                    What does Insyndicate have to do 
                    with your wife? 

                                  JOHN
                    I ve been asking that question for 
                    a long time. 

      John looks to Rudy. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                          (re: Dorian)
                    I want more information out of this 
                    thing. Files. Video. Interviews, 
                      everything.   

                                  RUDY
                    I can t get any more from this 
                    region. The rest is fragmented. 

      John looks like someone just shit in his cereal. 

                                  JOHN
                    But, if the information WAS in 
                    there...

                                  RUDY
                    It still might be in there. I can 
                    try and find it -- might take 
                      forever...or... 

                                  JOHN
                    Or what?

                                  RUDY
                    Or there s a chance he might be 
                    able to remember himself and he can 
                    share it with you.                                                                                     40.


                                  JOHN
                          (confused)
                    ...  Share it with me? 

                                  RUDY
                    Yeah - take him out for a beer. 

      Rudy smiles. John looks down at Dorian.  You gotta be kidding 
      me.  John s COMM rings --

                                  JOHN
                          (answering)
                    This is Kennex. 



      Maldonado is enraged. John sits in a chair.

                                  MALDONADO
                    He  fell  out of the car!?

                                  JOHN
                    It was an accident. I tried to 
                    catch him.  

      Maldonado KNOWS it was no accident. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    Do you have any idea what that will 
                    cost to replace? 

                                  JOHN
                    No need to replace him. I have a 
                    robot. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    What are you talking about?  

                                  JOHN
                      A DRN-0167. 

      Beat.

                                  MALDONADO
                    ... DRN-0167s are loading baggage 
                    at the airport. 

                                  JOHN
                    Not this one. I ve been through 
                    every file in this precinct on the 
                      Insyndicate raids -- no stone 
                    unturned -- there is nothing. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    41.

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Not one clue to grab onto. The 
                    robot I got, was ACTUALLY there --
                    He could have invaluable 
                      information that needs to be mined. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    There were problems with that 
                    design. 

                                  JOHN
                          (nodding, no problem)
                    I read about them. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    They re unreliable. DRNs were based 
                    on a platform called The Synthetic 
                    Soul program, and it had its 
                    issues. Among them, unexpected 
                    emotional responses.

                                  JOHN
                    I have unexpected emotional 
                      responses. I have more issues than 
                    it does. 

      This was meant to be funny, but it s not to Maldonado, and it 
      lands terribly, because this is a policeman on the edge, and 
      he has been for a while.   

                                  MALDONADO
                    They were retired from service for 
                    a reason, John. 

      We re expecting him to keep arguing, but all he says is...

                                  JOHN
                    ... I need this. 

      The way this was said, we can tell this was from a very deep 
      and dismal place... It s all he has. 

      Beat. 

      Maldonado nods. He ll go along with it. John sits there a 
      moment, pleased with his win. He nods thanks, and gets up and 
      heads for the door. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    John. 

      John turns back.                                                                                     42.


                                  MALDONADO (CONT D)
                    Valerie is still not responding. 
                          (then)
                    They re going ahead with the Exo-
                    Cranial surgery tonight. I wanted 
                    you to know. 

      ON JOHN, this is bad. He collects himself and leaves. 
      Maldonado looks after John for a beat -- CUT TO:


      A MONTAGE IN WHICH WE INTERCUT: Valerie in surgery -- the 
      doctors performing exo-cranial surgery. OPENING HER CRANIUM 
      AND REMOVING -- ENTIRELY -- HER BRAIN, USING ROBOTIC ARMS, 
      ETC., FUTURE TECH, WITH:


      JOHN AND RUDY IN THE LAB, POWERING UP DORIAN.  Rudy has 
      problems, the Robot is not firing up -- RUDY NEEDS TO OPEN 
      HIM AND EXCHANGE COMPLEX PARTS.

      AS VALERIE S BRAIN IS BEING OPERATED ON, AS IS HER BODY.

      AND JUST AS DORIAN COMES ON LINE...

      VALERIE S SURGERY DOESN T GO WELL... AND THE DOCTORS LOOK AT 
      EACH OTHER, CLEARLY UNABLE TO DO ANY MORE.  WHILE WE DON T 
      KNOW EXACTLY HER FATE, IT ISN T GOOD AT THE MOMENT...

      STAY WITH DORIAN AS - 

      Dorian opens his eyes and turns to John and utters his first 
      words: 

                                  DORIAN
                    ... Thank you. 

      Beat. 

      John ignores him. 

                                  DORIAN (CONT D)
                          (once again)
                    Thank you.

                                  JOHN
                    What does that mean? 

                                  DORIAN
                    I m grateful.                                                                                     43.


                                  JOHN
                    No, I know what  thank you  means, 
                    what are you saying it for?

                                  DORIAN
                    I was decommissioned in January of 
                    2046. Redesignated for a menial-
                    tech labor unit intended for heavy 
                    baggage handling at Los Angeles 
                      International Airport. You re  
                    Officer John Kennex, Los Angeles 
                    Police Department --

      John stares at him as he talks... 

                                  JOHN
                    Jesus, this creeps me out.

                                  DORIAN
                    -- and you re in a street uniform, 
                      indicating you re not tasked with 
                      transporting me to my re-
                      designation.

                                  JOHN
                          (to Rudy)
                    Do they always talk this much? 

                                  DORIAN
                    If I m being put to work again, as 
                    a police officer, I m simply 
                      expressing my gratitude. 
                          (then)
                    I m Dorian.

      John stares at him, uncomfortable. 

                                  RUDY
                    At least he s friendly. 

      John, already regretting this, just walks off. 

                                  JOHN
                    Let s go. 

      Dorian to Rudy:

                                  DORIAN
                    Go where?


      John drives, eyes straight ahead -- a little uncomfortable -- 
      we KNOW how he feels about robots.                                                                                     44.


      Dorian has a gentle way -- sincere, earnest, authentic. If he 
      WERE human, we would admire his values. 

      Dorian watches the city. Then, after a moment. 

                                  DORIAN
                    What would you like to be addressed 
                    as? 

                                  JOHN
                          (curt)
                    Officer Kennex.

      Dorian nods -- he looks out the window again. 

                                  DORIAN
                    Kennex is an old name. Migrated all 
                    across the world over time.  And as 
                    the Kennex family spread, so did 
                    the pronunciation in different 
                    regions. In some regions, taking 
                    the pronunciation of -  Kennich , 
                    or -  Kennacks . 

      Dorian looks at John, who is glaring back:

                                  JOHN
                          (no it s not)
                    That s very interesting. 

      Dorian realizes John doesn t care. And then, Dorian melts our 
      hearts when he says:

                                  DORIAN
                    I am very perceptive. But I can be 
                      programmed to be less so. My last 
                    partner liked to talk. If you tell 
                    me about yourself I can change to 
                    suit --  

                                  JOHN
                    -- Stop

      Dorian does. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Don t Q9 me. 

      Dorian looks at him --

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I read your manual.  Questionnaire 
                    9. Q9. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    45.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    You re trying to run a 
                      psychological profile on me. It s 
                    what you re programmed to do. 

      Dorian looks a bit surprised. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    You know what I m talking about. 

                                  DORIAN
                          (nods)
                    I know.

                                  JOHN
                    So do I. I know what you re doing. 
                    So leave it at the door. Okay? 

                                  DORIAN
                    Okay, John. 

                                  JOHN
                    I don t need to be figured out. Let 
                    me ask you something -- I want to 
                    talk about Insyndicate. Tell me 
                    about them.  

                                  DORIAN
                      Insyndicate is an organized crime 
                      syndicate. Initial activity from 
                    Dec 2040.  Involved in illegal bio-
                    tech, illegal narcotics, human 
                      enhancement -- 

                                  JOHN
                          (cutting him off)
                    -- Yeah, yeah. I know all that. 
                    Tell me about the long haired man. 
                    An Insyndicate operative. Long 
                    hair. I saw his face in your data 
                    storage. The day of the raids. 

      Dorian thinks about it -- But, John realizes how much work he 
      has ahead of him, when...

                                  DORIAN
                    I don t recall a long haired man. 

      John looks at him -- 

                                  JOHN
                    He was in your files. Try again.                                                                                      46.


                                  DORIAN
                    I don t recall a long haired man. 
                    Do you want me to continue 
                    searching for him? 

      John shakes his head, like  what the hell good is this 
      Synthetic? 

      And he gets that look on his face, like maybe -- just maybe 
      he s gonna lean across and open the door on this robot too 
      for a little pavement surf.  

      But, he thinks better of it --

                                  JOHN
                    Please. Do. ... Search. 

      He sets his eyes back on the road. Dorian watches him for a 
      moment. And off this, CUT TO:


      John and Dorian walk in. They go to a glass window that 
      separates two rooms, watching the Drug User we saw MORPHING 
      FROM PERSON TO PERSON. He s STILL UNCONSCIOUS, but morphing, 
      but it s getting slower now, he s coming down. 

      Dorian is compelled by what he sees. 

                                  JOHN
                    Do you know what it might be? 

      Dorian explains, feeling the pain of the poor guy, what could 
      be happening -- 

                                  DORIAN
                    Perhaps retroviral.  A retrovirus 
                    is a virus that inserts its own DNA 
                    into the host's DNA.  Retroviruses 
                    are a great delivery method for 
                    gene therapy and --

      John s not buying this hypothesis. He waves his hand, as if 
      wiping a page on a iPad --

                                  JOHN
                    Next --

      Seamless, Dorian changes gears, moves onto the next 
        possibility.                                                                                      47.


                                  DORIAN
                     -- Could be "pirate DNA" or 
                    "Occupier DNA."  The drug delivers 
                      engineered strands of DNA to the 
                      bloodstream, and these strands 
                    literally take over control of 
                    cells, like pirates or an occupying 
                    army. 

      John finds this one interesting -- 

                                  JOHN
                    Go on.

                                  DORIAN
                    The drug would put a person's own 
                    DNA on lockdown, preventing it from 
                    working, so that the pirate DNA can 
                    take its place.  Suddenly all the 
                    person's cells are taking orders 
                    from a new genetic code.  

      CLOSE ON JOHN as he watches the man morph again -- spooky. A 
      NURSE (late 20s) enters. 

                                  NURSE
                          (to John)
                    I went ahead and sent his blood 
                    samples to the LAPD lab for you. 

                                  JOHN
                    Thank you. 

      Then, suddenly - A KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK on the glass to the next 
      room. They turn to SEE ANOTHER NURSE standing behind the 
      glass. She s pointing to the bed -- 

                                    ANOTHER NURSE
                    He s awake! ... He s awake. 

      CUT TO:


      John and Dorian walk into the room with the Nurse. They 
      approach the bed, and the man s eyes weakly open. 

      He tries to focus on John and Dorian. His face is ever 
      changing -- SO FREAKY!!!

                                  JOHN
                    Can you hear me?

      The patient looks at him for a beat, and then nods.                                                                                     48.


                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I would like to know what happened 
                    to you. 
                          (nothing)
                    Can you tell us? ... What is your 
                    name?

                                    PATIENT
                          (quietly terrified)
                    ... Help me. 

      ON JOHN

      John is FUCKED UP right now, because there is NOTHING he 
      would rather do than help this poor soul. 

                                  JOHN
                    I want to help you. ... Who did 
                    this to you... 
                          (then...)
                    Have you heard the name 
                      Insyndicate? 

      He searches John s eyes and nods.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What s your name? ... Can you tell 
                    me who you are... 

      The Patient takes a moment, his face STILL SHIFTING, and 
      gathers enough strength to say four more weakened words in a 
      whisper:

                                    PATIENT
                    I... am a cop. 

      HOLD ON JOHN AND DORIAN 

      And off this, CUT TO BLACK:

                                        END ACT THREE                                                                                    49.


                                          ACT FOUR


      Captain Maldonado walks down the hall in his overcoat. His 
      face tells us he knows EXACTLY what is going on. He 
      approaches John and Dorian, who are standing outside the 
      Patient s hospital room. 

                                  JOHN
                    His name is Craig Shields. 
                    Detective from Rampart. He went 
                    missing three days ago. 

      Maldonado looks at Dorian. 

                                  DORIAN
                          (a nod)
                    Sir. 

      Maldonado doesn t respond, but looks in the room -- seeing 
      the Patient s face slowly shifting. Even he, a thirty year 
      veteran, can t hide his reaction. This is straight up 
      disturbing. Period. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    What can he tell us? 

                                  JOHN
                    He says he was parked on the 
                    shoulder and the last thing he 
                    remembers is someone approached his 
                    window... A male. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    You re saying somebody dosed him? 

                                  JOHN
                    I don t know what happened. 

      Maldonado isn t satisfied. But he certainly is worried. CUT 
      TO:


      Reinhardt walks along the rows of lab tables, watching the 
      Lab Coated chemists working with masks and test tubes. WE CAN 
      SEE that there has been much progress since the last time we 
      were here. 

      Several crates of small silver canisters are becoming full. 
      We TRACK WITH ONE CHEMIST who brings ANOTHER TRAY OF 
      CANISTERS, loading them.                                                                                     50.


      Then, one of Reinhardt s men, WHO WE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZE AS 
      LONG HAIR (the man who killed Anna) comes to deliver a 
      message.  He s alive and well. 

                                  LONG HAIR
                    Second shift is here.

      Reinhardt looks to the massive doorways -- we see a few 
      futuristic people carriers are here, as more workers are 
      arriving. 

                                  REINHARDT
                          (looking at this watch)
                    Have them set up. ... Give them 
                    something to eat.  

      Long Hair walks off. Reinhardt sits down, puts on his rubber 
      gloves and begins working again. CUT TO:  


      Rudy is on the phone with John, looking at the blood sample 
      results that the Nurse sent over. 

      As Rudy paces, we SEE a set of ROBOTIC EYES on a small stand 
      on the lab table -- in the process of being worked on. The 
      EYES FOLLOW HIM as he walks. 

                                  RUDY
                    I found the same programmable DNA 
                    strand in his blood that was stolen 
                    from the lab. 


      John is on his phone, listening to Rudy.

                                  RUDY
                    So for sure -- it s Insyndicate. 

      INTERCUT THE CALLERS: 

                                  JOHN
                    Okay, so what s happening to him? 

                                  RUDY
                    Still trying to figure that out, 
                    but the stolen DNA is an 
                      ingredient.  

      A CHIME is heard and a machine DISPLAYS AN ELECTRONIC 
      PRINTOUT. Rudy walks over.                                                                                     51.


                                  RUDY (CONT D)
                    Whatever they dosed him with, was 
                    tailor made for him. Him 
                      specifically. 

      Rudy has a look at the results. 

                                  RUDY (CONT D)
                    It s adhering to unique antibodies 
                    in his blood. 

                                  JOHN
                    What do you mean? 

                                  RUDY
                          (reading the results)
                    It seems it s clinging to elements 
                    of an inoculation he once got. It 
                    wouldn t work on anyone who didn t 
                    have it.

                                  JOHN
                    An inoculation? 

                                  RUDY
                            (fascinated)
                    To protect against widespread 
                    disease, it looks like. 
                            (then...perplexed)
                    I don t know what they re playing 
                    with here. Hang on.  

      Another printout PRESENTS ITSELF. More info. Rudy reads it -- 
      and he stops cold.  

                                  JOHN
                    ... Rudy?

                                  RUDY
                    It s not just unique to him. 
                          (then...)
                    It s unique to the entire LAPD.  

      ON JOHN -- this lands.

                                  RUDY (CONT D)
                    This guy is a cop. All cops get the 
                    same mandatory inoculations. LAPD 
                      inoculations are designed in LAPD 
                    labs. For our officers only. You 
                    got one. So did he.  
                          (then)
                    What they did to this guy, they 
                    could do to anyone on the force.                                                                                      52.


      On John realizing what this means. 

                                   JOHN
                    They re targeting cops. 

      Beat. 

      Just then -- A CODE BLUE - and we realize that the Patient is 
      in trouble. Doctors rush into his room. John rushes in too, 
      worried. 

      Maldonado watches as they try to save the Patient s life. 

      AND WE BEGIN A SLOW PUSH IN ON JOHN, as the doctors struggle, 
      it soon becomes apparent that the Patient is dead. His face 
      stuck in a half-way grimace between two different faces. 
      Maldonado looks at John.   

      HOLD ON JOHN - a disturbed expression. CUT TO:


      CLOSE ON - A TINY RED PILL BEING SHAKEN OUT OF THE SILVER 
      pill container we saw at JOHN S apartment. 

      WIDEN as John takes the pill, about to swallow it. But he 
      drops it, and Dorian picks it up, looks at it, and hands it 
      to him. There is a pause and John takes it.  Now he swallows 
      it. 

                                  DORIAN
                    You don t speak a lot. ... About 
                    yourself. 

      John nods. 

      He looks out the window, with nighttime LA looking like a 
      city of lights. 

                                  DORIAN (CONT D)
                    ... I noticed that. For instance, 
                    that man died, and I m not even 
                    sure how you feel about it.

                                  JOHN
                    How do you think I feel?

                                  DORIAN
                    If I told you, they would be my 
                    feelings not yours. 

      We expect him to respond with a wall, the same way he did 
      with his good friend Valerie -- but --                                                                                    53.


                                  JOHN
                    I feel like the world s out of 
                    control. I m just trying to hang 
                    on.

      He looks at Dorian -- 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I m trying... very hard to find my 
                    purpose again. 

      John lowers his eyes -- 

      These are the answers Valerie didn t get. It s been a very 
      long time since he has opened up to anyone. 

                                  DORIAN
                    It s okay. 

      John looks up -- a bit surprised to hear Dorian. The way he 
      says it, it s calm, and sure, and catches John off guard.  
      And we can FEEL the EMPATHY/COMPASSION PROGRAMMING THAT 
      DORIAN HAS...

      And as they sit with one another, we realize these two are 
      bonding. Until...

      John looks at Dorian -- realizing. 

                                  JOHN
                    You Q9 d me. I told you not to. 

      Beat.

                                  DORIAN
                    I already had a profile on you 
                    before you asked me not to.

                                  JOHN
                    Is that right.

                                  DORIAN
                    You shared with me because I m not 
                    human. 
                          (then...)
                    If anything happens to me... I can 
                    be replaced.  Not like those you 
                    lost.  
                          (beat)
                    You protect yourself. And I 
                      understand that. 

      Silence.                                                                                     54.


      John glares at Dorian. 

      His COMM RINGS.

                                  JOHN
                          (answering)
                    Kennex. 


      The White Lab Coats are busy at their stations making more of 
      the drug.  

      Suddenly, BOOOOM! DOORS BLAST OPEN! The warehouse is flooded 
      with TACTICAL TEAMS and their MX-43s. Everyone scatters!!!! 

      WE INTERCUT BETWEEN DORIAN AND JOHN AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THIS 
      PLACE.

      John blasts a few baddies -- a bullet rips past his head. He 
      looks from where it came -- HE SEES LONG HAIR!!!! GUN RAISED 
      AT HIM -- John dives away, as he fires again. Long Hair grabs 
      Reinhardt and heads up the stairs. John gets to his feet -- 
      goes after him.  

      Dorian is unrelenting -- bad guys are realizing 
      outmaneuvering a robot isn t easy. He comes down on ONE BAD 
      GUY hard and takes him out. Spins, FIRING -- taking out 
      another. 

      WITH JOHN

      As he communicates via radio to Dorian. 

                                  JOHN
                      Upstairs!!!

      WITH DORIAN 

      He can HEAR this transmission. Dorian barely escapes a sub 
      machine gun blast -- A THIRD MAN fires at him now BANG BANG 
      CLICK!!! His gun jams. Bad luck, because Dorian reloads and 
      kills the guy.  

      WITH JOHN

      MOVING up the stairs -- looking around -- where did they go? 
      He looks up to the next flight -- it s tense. HEARS A NOISE. 
      SOMETHING causes him to spin -- creak in the floor! SEES the 
      Massive Bad Guy who made the noise. John FIRES, making 
      another corpse.                                                                                     58.


      He turns, ANOTHER MAN there -- they both UNLOAD ON EACH 
      OTHER, diving out of the way!!!!

      WITH DORIAN

      Gunfire all around. He s trying to raise John on the Comm -- 

                                  DORIAN
                    Officer Kennex. I am in the east 
                      corner.... What is your 20? ... 
                    Officer Kennex. 

      Nothing from John --  Dorian, worried, looks up, wondering 
      WTF is happening, CUT TO: 

      DORIAN HEADS UP THE STAIRS -- SEARCHING. He HEARS something. 
      He comes to a landing and HEARS it s coming from this 
      darkened floor. 

      He enters the dark area -- AND WE SEE HIS POV of THERMAL 
      SHAPES - it s wild tech, super cool, BUT THERE DOESN T SEEM 
      TO BE ANYONE THERE. But, the NOISE continues...

      Dorian, gun extended, moves to a pool of yellow light from a 
      dim security lamp... and we see that the NOISE is the SEXBOT 
      on the ground, malfunctioning as it has been shot. It is 
      creepily jittering, looking up at him. 

      Suddenly, PPPPFT! The TIP OF DORIAN S FUCKING EAR IS SHOT OFF 
      from behind!!!! Dorian spins, BLASTS A BAD ASS that shot at 
      him, killing him. 

      Dorian looks back at the SEXBOT and his face changes -- why? 
      Because in the light, he can SEE that there is A GRENADE IN 
      HER HAND!!! 

      But worse -- the pin is gone. BOOOOOOM!!!! The blast sends 
      Dorian hurtling backwards through the air, SMASHING against 
      the wall AND WE CUT TO BLACK. 

                                        END ACT FOUR                                                                                    59.


                                          ACT FIVE


      A HUGE, BLINDING LIGHT shines in the stairwell windows. We 
      realize it is from a HOVERCRAFT VEHICLE as it approaches the 
      roof. 

      John runs up the stairs, blasting at Long Hair, who is a few 
      flights up. He keeps looking down, firing at John, as he and 
      Reinhardt continue up... 


      Dorian manages to stand, unsure of his footing at first -- 
      his gyros messed up.

      A BAD GUY appears, moving toward where Dorian is. But when he 
      gets there, Dorian is gone. WTF? The Bad guy looks around -- 
      Dorian appears from the darkness, breaks his neck. This robot 
      will not fucking quit. 

                                  DORIAN
                          (into Comm)
                    Where are you?


      -- Long Hair, breathless, being pursued by John. He takes 
      off...

      John comes forward through the dark space -- oblivious, 
      searching.

                                  JOHN
                          (into his Comm)
                    Fourth floor.


      Dorian climbs the stairs. We can see more of his THERMAL 
      READINGS.  He can SEE TWO WHITE BLOBS OF HEAT the next floor 
      up, where John is.  

                                  DORIAN
                    I have you on thermal. There s 
                    someone on that floor with you. 

                                  JOHN (ON COMM)
                    I know. Where is he?

      INTERCUT:                                                                                    60.


                                  DORIAN
                    He s next to the door. To your 
                    left. Waiting for you... 

      But, JOHN/WE SEE a glimpse of SOMEONE hiding behind some 
      crates to the RIGHT - Not left like Dorian says.  

                                  JOHN
                    There must be two people here. Is 
                    there more than one?  

      Dorian scans his thermo as he continues up ...

                                  DORIAN
                    No! 

                                  JOHN
                    I can see him. He s way off to the 
                    right. 

                                  DORIAN
                          (insisting)
                    He s left.  

      John doesn t want to continue left like Dorian says and risk 
      being shot by Long Hair. 

      He stops, thinking, WTF does he do? He chooses left. And 
      lucky for him he did, because that s where Long Hair is, and 
      they both fire, missing each other! Long Hair disappears into 
      the darkness. 

      But John would have been killed by Long Hair if John had gone 
      right. 

      John looks right, to where he thought he saw Long Hair, and 
      we see robot parts, torsos, etc, WRAPPED IN PLASTIC.  It s 
      THIS that John saw. 


      Maldonado watches Reinhardt BEHIND THE TWO WAY GLASS. He s 
      sitting in county orange, waiting to be interrogated. 

      John enters with Dorian, handing Maldonado a tablet. 
      Maldonado gives Dorian a once over, then takes the tablet 
      from John. 

                                  JOHN
                    We can t ID him. 

      Maldonado looks up from the tablet. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    Request a cellular scan. 

                                  JOHN
                    Already did one.   

      John and Maldonado look at Reinhardt.


      John and Dorian enter. John carries a small kit. 

      Reinhardt watches as John sets up a SMALL ELECTRONIC DEVICE 
      and switches it on. A green holograph screen appears with 
      tiny bandwidth meters.   

                                  REINHARDT
                          (know what it is)
                    You don t need that. 

                                  JOHN
                    We ll see. 

                                  REINHARDT
                    I m not gonna lie to you. 

      John makes an adjustment and the device is set. It must be 
      some kind of lie detector.                                                                                     62.


                                  JOHN
                    Sure about that?

                                  REINHARDT
                    ... As sure as I know my own name. 

      John looks up -- Reinhardt is fucking with him already. He 
      knows they can t find his name. 

      CLOSE ON DORIAN, watching him. 

                                  REINHARDT (CONT D)
                    A lawyer is on his way. I think I m 
                    entitled to due process. ...I m not 
                    going to talk to you. So pack up 
                    your machine... and go away. 

      ON JOHN and DORIAN -- they didn t expect that. Reinhardt just 
      stares back.   

      BEHIND THE GLASS

      ON MALDONADO - riveted.

      BACK IN THE ROOM

      Beat. 

      Reinhardt says nothing. John stares at him for a long moment -
      - he would love nothing more than to beat what he needs to 
      know from this guy s skull.

                                  JOHN
                    Sooner or later, we re gonna get a 
                    match for you, and we ll find out 
                    who you are. And then, you re going 
                    to unravel. We ll get answers.
                          (then..)
                    We stopped you - I m sure someone 
                      somewhere... will be upset.  

      Beat. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    And... if that someone asks you -- 
                    who is responsible for that? My 
                    name is John Kennex. 

                                  REINHARDT
                    You really think we came back just 
                    for this? 

      John suddenly feels off balance.                                                                                     63.


                                  REINHARDT (CONT D)
                    I know who you are. 
                          (beat)
                    ... I knew your wife.  

      Long beat. 

      Reinhardt just stares. John is a fraction of a hair away from 
      ripping this guy s face off. 

      Just then, the door opens, and Reinhardt s LAWYER (40) 
      arrives. 

                                  LAWYER
                    Let s go.

      Reinhardt stands and moves to the door. 

      But then, he turns again -- like maybe, suddenly feeling what 
      might be a tinge of compassion, maybe he WILL throw John a 
      bone. 

                                  REINHARDT
                    I want you to ask yourself... and 
                    think. 
                          (then...)
                    Do you find it strange that you 
                    never recovered a body? 

      ... Then: 

                                  REINHARDT (CONT D)
                    Anna s body?  

      John just stares at him -- And off this, CUT TO:


      The possibility of Anna not being dead lands on John.                                                                                     64.


      Dorian watches John twist in anguish as Reinhardt is taken 
      away.

      WITH MALDONADO, also watching John. And off this concern, CUT 
      TO:   


      John enters. Valerie is hooked up to machines, still in her 
      coma.  

      John sets a candle by her bedside. He lights it. A nice quiet 
      moment passes. He reaches out and touches her hand... and 
      sits with her in silence, CUT TO:


      Dorian sits on a chair, waiting. CUT TO: 


      Maldonado is behind his desk, debriefing John.

                                  MALDONADO
                    You did good work. They were 
                    targeting cops. Rampart lost a man, 
                    but you stopped them. 

                                  JOHN
                    What if she is alive?

      Beat. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    He was messing with you from the 
                    moment you walked in. You don t 
                    know what he meant by his comment. 
                          (then)
                    I know you re not going to give 
                    this up. But, my job is to bring 
                    you back, John.
                          (off his silence)
                    You can step off the ledge right 
                    now.... Or you can show up at roll 
                    call tomorrow ready to work.  
                          (then)
                      Tomorrow s another case, John. 

      John sits there a moment, considering it. He gets up, walks 
      to the door. He stops and turns to Maldonado.                                                                                     65.


                                  JOHN
                    I m keeping the robot.

      Beat. 

                                  MALDONADO
                    I thought you hate machines?


      Dorian gets in the car too. 

                                  DORIAN
                    Can you take me to get a new ear, 
                    John?

      John looks at Dorian s shredded ear. It s hanging there, like 
      beef jerky.  

                                  JOHN
                    I think we d better. ... It s 
                    kind ve disgusting. 

      Dorian puts on his sunglasses. Settles in. 

                                  DORIAN
                    Are you okay?

                                  JOHN
                    ... Yes. 

      There s a beat. Dorian nods, pleased. 

                                  DORIAN
                    Now, I don t want to start 
                      anything... but I just want to put 
                    it out there... -- I do like to 
                    drive. 

      And off John - CUT TO BLACK:

                                  END OF PILOT
