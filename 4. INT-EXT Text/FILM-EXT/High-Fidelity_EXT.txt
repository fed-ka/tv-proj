Rob and Alison sit on the bench, kissing awkwardly.
ROB (V.O.)
Which brings us to number one.
Alison
Ashworth.
PARK BENCH - DUSK
The same shot, the next night: new clothes, same clumsy make-
out session.
ROB (V.O.)
My relationship with Alison Ashworth
lasted six hours.
PARK BENCH - DUSK
...Next night...
ROB (V.O.)
The two hours after school and before
The Rockford Files, three days in a
row.
On the fourth afternoon.
SAME PARK BENCH
...And the fourth night...
ROB (V.O.)
Kevin Bannister.
Alison and another boy, KEVIN BANNISTER.
Kissing.
In the
background, Rob approaches and stops.
He implodes with self-
consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a casual
gait as he mopes away.
ROB (V.O.)
It would be nice to think that since
I was fourteen, times have changed,
relationships have become more
sophisticated, females less cruel,
skins thicker, but there still seems
to be an element of that afternoon
in everything that has happened to
me since.
All my other romantic
stories seem to be a scrambled version
of that first one.
...and continues as SOUNDTRACK.
PENNY, 16, is walking across
the grass toward us.
She's the clean, sporty, nice wholesome
girl-next-door.
She waves to off-camera friends, smiling a
winning smile.
ROB (V.O.)
Everybody liked her.
She was nice.
Nice manners.
Nice grades.
Nice-
looking.
"Nobody Does It Better" continues as Rob walks Penny to her
front door.
She is smiling, he seems distant.
ROB (V.O.)
Penny was nice, but I wasn't
interested in nice, just breasts,
and therefore she was no good to me.
And so I was finished with her.
She leans in to kiss him, and he shrugs her off.
ROB
What's the point?
It never goes
anywhere.
Without looking at her, Rob turns and walks down the street,
getting smaller.
Penny watches for a while.
CUT TO:
An old Chicago block of local merchants, on a busy street.
Rob makes his way down the street, jangling a set of keys
and talking to us.
ROB
My store's right up here.
It's called
The Record Exchange.
It's carefully
placed to attract the bare minimum
of window shoppers.
Rob arrives at a storefront, and begins unlocking a rusty
gate with two locks and then a beaten-down door.
ROB
I get by because of the people who
make a special effort to shop here
on Saturday young men, always young
men, who spend a disproportionate
amount of their time looking for
deleted Smiths singles and "original
not rereleased" underline Frank Zappa
albums.
About twenty feet away we see a tall, thin beauty, bleach-
blonde hair cropped short in darling '80's new-wave asymmetry.
She is speaking animatedly to a PAMPHLETEER, driving her
points home with a forefinger.
ROB (V.O.)
She looked different.
Dramatic.
Exotic.
She talked a lot, about
remarkably interesting things like
music, books, film, and politics...
Rob and Charlie walk arm in arm, Rob in cool clothes and
sunglasses trying to look cool, Charlie making a point about
something.
Rob checks out how cool he looks with her as they walk by a
store window REFLECTION.
ROB (V.O.)
We went out for two years, and for
every single minute I felt as though
I was standing on a dangerously narrow
ledge.
I couldn't get comfortable,
couldn't ever stretch out and relax.
Why would a girl -- no, a woman --
like Charlie go out with someone who
only a few years ago sewed a Foghat
patch on his jacket?
I felt like
all those people who suddenly shaved
their heads and said they'd always
been punks.
I felt like a fraud.
And I was depressed by the lack of
flamboyance in my wardrobe...
It is RAINING like crazy, and Rob is shouting up at a lit
window, maniacally gesturing.
The curtains part and Charlie's
figure appears, clad only in a sheet.
Next to her is a tall,
built, handsome man, MARCO, also in a sheet.
Eventually he falls to his knees with a splash and buries
his head in his hands.
The light goes out.
ROB (V.O.)
And I lost it.
I lost it all.
Dignity, faith, fifteen pounds...
Rob wandering through the rain.
ROB (V.O.)
Any small idea of personal identity
that I had acquired up to that point.
The MUSIC becomes SOUNDTRACK to the following scenes.
Rob
and SARAH, a thin, modestly attractive young woman, SARAH,
walk and talk.
They seem to be emphatically complaining
together.
ROB (V.O.)
Charlie and I didn't match.
Marco
and Charlie matched.
Me and Sarah,
number four on the all time break-
ups list, matched.
She wore more or
less the same clothes as mine, had
an acceptable working knowledge of
music, and she had been dumped by
some asshole named Michael.
He was
her moment, Charlie was mine.
Sarah
had sworn off men.
I had sworn off
women.
It made sense to pool our
loathing of the opposite sex, swear
them off together, and get to share
a bed with someone at the same time.
Rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to enter
the club.
From inside he hears a GUITAR, playing a tune
that becomes familiar not only to Rob, but to us.
When a
strong, lilting female VOICE begins to sing, we hear what it
is: "Baby I Love Your Way," by Peter Frampton.
Rob smiles at first, but begins to darken as the verse
continues.
He steps out of line and leans against the outside
wall, listening.
Is he beginning to cry?
Yes, he is...
CUT TO:
ROB IN HIS CHAIR
ROB
Peter.
Frampton.
That perm! "Show
Me the Way"!
A phenomenon based on
a live album that was actually
recorded in a studio!
What is
happening?
I am getting misty, choked
up at a song that I had the good
sense at twelve to realize was so
saccharine and stupid as to be
inarticulatable, until Michael Bolton,
that is.
CUT BACK TO:
He looks around self-consciously, and paces a bit, deciding
whether or not to stay.
He takes a deep breath, and heads
in the door.
Rob mounts the stairs and rings the doorbell.
The door opens,
revealing a too-tan WOMAN in her late forties, in designer
jeans and a T-shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign.
She says nothing.
ROB
Hi.
You called about the records?
She turns and walks into the house, leaving the door open
for him.
He follows her in and through a fabulous first
floor, packed with big-bucks bourgeois: Rugs, art, and
antiques:
She ushers Rob into a large study, and turns the light on.
He misses a breath.
The walls are lined with mahogany cases
custom-built for CDs, albums, epicurean stereo components, a
couple priceless vintage guitars -- every one of the thousands
of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum.
She
points to several boxes on the floor, full of hundreds of
singles.
WOMAN
Those.
Rob steps into the room like an Undeserving, and carefully
drops to his knees to examine the singles, each pristine in
a plastic sleeve: the original God Save the Queen by the Sex
Pistols, original Otis Reddings, Elvis Presleys, James Browns,
Jerry Lee Lewises, Beatles... on and on.
The mother lode.
Rob is doing the best to control the onset of
hyperventilation.
He dares a glance over his shoulder to
her to see if this is a joke.
WOMAN
What do you think?
ROB
It's the best collection I've ever
seen.
WOMAN
Give me fifty bucks and they're all
yours.
Rob's face goes funny.
He looks around for a hidden camera.
ROB
These are worth at least, I don't
know --
WOMAN
I know what they're worth.
Give me
fifty and get them out.
ROB
But you must have --
WOMAN
I must have nothing.
Their my
husband's.
ROB
And you must not be getting along
too well right now, huh?
WOMAN
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three-
year-old.
A friend of my daughter's.
He had the fucking nerve to call me
and ask me to borrow some money and
I told him to fuck off, so he asked
me to sell his singles collection
and send him a check for whatever I
go, minus a ten percent commission.
Which reminds me.
Can you make sure
you give me a five?
I want to frame
it and put it on the wall.
ROB
It must have taken him a long time
to get them together.
WOMAN
Years.
This collection is as close
as he's ever come to an achievement.
Rob looks back at the records but avoids the trance.
ROB
Look.
Can I pay you properly?
You
don't have to tell him what you got.
Send him forty-five bucks and blow
the rest.
Give it to charity.
Or
something.
WOMAN
That wasn't part of the deal.
I
want to be poisonous but fair.
ROB
(looking back at the
records)
Look... I... I'm sorry.
I don't
want to be any part of this.
WOMAN
Suit yourself.
There are plenty of
others who will.
ROB
That's why I'm trying to compromise.
What about fifteen-hundred?
They're
worth five times that.
WOMAN
Sixty.
ROB
Thirteen hundred.
WOMAN
Seventy-five.
ROB
Eleven-hundred.
That's my lowest
offer.
WOMAN
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
They start smiling at each other.
WOMAN
With eleven hundred he could come
home, and that's the last thing I
want.
ROB
I'm sorry but I think you better
talk to someone else.
WOMAN
Fine.
Rob half stands, then drops again for one last lingering
look.
ROB
Can I buy this Otis Redding single
off you?
WOMAN
Sure.
Ten cents.
ROB
Oh, come on!
Let me give you ten
dollars for this, and you can give
the rest away for all I care.
WOMAN
Okay.
Because you took the trouble
to come up here.
And because you've
got principles.
But that's it.
I'm
not selling them to you one by one.
CUT TO:
Rob comes down the stairs holding his single, and walks down
the street talking to camera.
ROB
How come I end up siding with the
bad guy, the man who ran off to
Jamaica with some nymphette?
I just
got left for someone else, so why
can't I bring myself to feel whatever
it is his wife is feeling?
All I
can see is that guy's face when he
gets that pathetic check in the mail
for those records, and I can't help
but feel desperately, painfully sorry
for him.
CUT TO:
Rob comes out of the club and follows Liz.
She hears him
and turns on him, punctuating with a finger in his chest.
LIZ
To think I sympathized with you for
two seconds!
Poor Rob!
Laura left
him out of nowhere for the schmuck
upstairs.
You let me believe that!
ROB
It's true!
LIZ
Rob!
Two years ago you got Laura
pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat
on her!
You borrowed money from her
and never paid a dime back!
And
then, just a few weeks ago, you told
her you were unhappy with her and
were "kind of looking around for
somebody else!"
ROB
Well she --
She turns again and keeps walking, holding a defiant middle
finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street.
Rob emerges behind them, Vince's skateboard in hand.
They
have enough distance to bolt, but they can't leave that board
behind.
ROB
Okay, fuckos.
How much is this deck
worth to you, and how many CD's did
you rip off?
Can you do the math?
Justin pulls two CD's out and slides them over to Rob.
ROB
(to Vince)
And what about you, dork?
Vince pulls about six, and puts them down in a neutral spot.
Rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them.
Dicks pokes his head out of the door.
ROB
Dick, call the police, please.
Vince and Justin look at each other.
ROB
(looking through the
CD's)
Eno import.
Sigue Sigue Sputnik.
Break beats.
Serge Gainsbourg.
Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett...
What's going on here?
Are you guys
stealing for other people now?
VINCE
Naw.
Those are for us.
ROB
Oh really.
You two are slamming to
Nico now?
JUSTIN
You're, like, so bigoted to look at
us and, like, think you know what we
listen to.
VINCE
You got the CD's so can I have my
board back?
ROB
I think you have more.
VINCE
Well we don't.
ROB
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Justin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up
with a tattered old book, "How To Make A Record."
He tosses
it over.
ROB
Jesus.
That thing's been in the
bargain bin for six months!
Was it
just your criminal nature or what?
Hell, I would've given it to you for
free.
VINCE
No, we...
JUSTIN
We don't know how it works.
Nobody
even knows, so we wanted to check it
out in that mag.
Rob snorts.
JUSTIN
Like, do you know how to actually
make a CD?
Rob can't resist edifying them -- the curse of the
underappreciated expert.
ROB
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple.
You make the tracks -- recording
studio -- deliver them to the pressing
plant where a master is cut, the
master is then dubbed to submasters,
which are the "mothers," as their
called, for each press in the plant.
You press the CD's or records, put
in your cover art, and that's it.
VINCE
Records are those big round black
things, right?
ROB
Fuck off.
Rob turns to go back in the store.
VINCE
Hey, can I have my board?
Rob drops it and enters the store.
CUT TO:
Rob, now alone, turns the sign from "open" to "closed" shuts
the door behind him, and pulls the gate across.
Laura appears
from the next doorway.
He jumps.
ROB
Shit!
LAURA
Hi.
ROB
Hi.
LAURA
I thought I could give you a lift
back.
ROB
Are you coming home?
LAURA
Yes.
Well, I'm coming over to your
house to get some things.
ROB
My house?
Laura turns and begins walking.
Rob looks at camera.
ROB
First of all: The money.
The money
is easy to explain: She had it and I
didn't, and she wanted to give it to
me.
If she hadn't, I would have
gone under.
I've never paid her
back because I've never been able
to, and just because she's took off
and moved in with some Supertramp
fan doesn't make me five grand richer.
So that's the money --
Laura's CAR HORN is heard.
He heads off.
CUT TO:
Rob bounces along, a smile wider than we have seen yet.
Maybe even jumping to touch an awning.
He lands and tells
us:
ROB
I feel good!
I feel great!
I feel
like a new man.
I feel so much
better, in fact --
The two of them come out of the building and into the street.
ROB
Which way are you going?
MARIE
(points left)
That way.
You?
ROB
(points right)
That way.
MARIE
And so it is.
I'll talk to you later.
ROB
I'll call you.
MARIE
(smiles)
Right.
A downpour is on.
Rob has himself wedged into a phone booth,
the little kind.
ROB
(into phone)
Hi.
It's me... I'm right outside...
I know... I know... I figured I could
just walk you to the train and you
could go... home.
Or whatever it
is... No!
Of course not -- okay.
I'll be right here.
Rob stands under the overhang, watching Laura walk the long
hallway from the elevators to the door.
ROB (V.O.)
Laura looks different.
Less stress-
out, more in control.
Something has
happened, maybe something real, or
maybe something in her head.
Whatever
it is, you can see that she thinks
she's started out on some new stage
in her life.
She hasn't.
I'm not
going to let her.
She emerges from doors, says something to him and they start
walking, sharing her umbrella.
Rob pushes through the rush hour raincoats, seeming to be
the only one going his way.
Rob is tucked into a phone booth across the street.
He can
see the silhouettes of Laura and Ian in the window.
He picks
up the phone, drops a quarter, and hits the numbers hard as
he dials... a muffled male "hello?" is heard and Rob hangs
up.
He does it again.
And again.
And again.
Until --
Rob stands on the sidewalk in the rain, Ian's building behind
him and down a few doors.
ROB
I wish I could be one of those guys
who doesn't call, the kind of guy
that gets broken up with and appears
not to give a shit.
He doesn't make
an ass out of himself, or frighten
anybody, and this week I've done
both of those things.
One day Laura's
sorry and guilty, and the next she's
scared and angry, and I'm entirely
responsible for the transformation,
and it doesn't do my case any good
at all.
I'd stop if I could but I --
His head turns at the sharp SOUND of a door opening -- Ian
and Laura are coming out of the building.
He jumps behind a
tree, peering around it as they fade down the street.
Rob walks through Uptown toward the train.
ROB
And suddenly I am fine.
For the
moment there is not one extra pound
on my chest.
This is fate.
Alison
married Kevin.
You get it?
That's
fate.
That's got nothing to do with
me, that is beyond my control, beyond
my fault...
CUT TO:
ROB IN HIS CHAIR
Rob into camera, digging through a box, fishing through
pictures and letters, concert tickets and other mementos.
He begins to assemble a small pile of pictures of women.
ROB
I want to see the others on the Big
Top Five.
Penny, who wouldn't let
me touch her and then went and had
sex with that bastard Chris Thompson.
Sarah, my partner in rejection who
rejected me, and Charlie, who I have
to thank for everything: my great
job, my sexual self-confidence, the
works.
There's this Springsteen
song, "Bobby Jean," off Born in the
USA.
About a girl who's left town
years before and he's pissed off
because he didn't know about it, and
he wanted to say goodbye, tell her
that he missed her, and wish her
good luck.
Well, I'd like my life
to be like a Springsteen song.
Just
once.
I know I'm not born to run,
and it's clear that Halsted Street
is nothing like Thunder Road, but
feelings can't be that different,
can they?
I'd like to call up all
those people and ask them how they
are and whether they've forgiven me,
and tell them that I have forgiven
them.
And say good luck, goodbye.
No hard feelings.
And then they'd
feel good and I'd feel good.
We'd
all feel good.
I'd feel clean, and
calm, and ready to start again.
That'd be good.
Great even.
CUT BACK TO:
Rob and Penny walk out of the theater mid-conversation.
They look happy as they walk down the street.
ROB (V.O.)
Penny is as beautiful as she was in
high school when I broke it off with
her because she wouldn't sleep with
me.
In fact she's even more
beautiful, and really grown into
herself.
Sarah, in the doorway, smiles painfully.
It's clear she
doesn't want to shut the door, but she does.
Rob turns and
walks down the hall toward the door to the street as he talks
TO CAMERA.
ROB
I could've ended up having sex back
there.
And what better way to
exorcize rejection demons than to
screw the person who rejected you,
right?
But you wouldn't be sleeping
with a person.
You'd be sleeping
with a whole sad single-person
culture.
It'd be like sleeping with
Talia Shire in "Rocky" if you weren't
Rocky.
Rob walks toward the record store, and looks into a Starbuck's
window he passes.
He stops for a second, seeing Ian at the
counter, chatting merrily with the espresso jockey.
Rob
keeps walking.
So darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining
torrents and big sheets.
Rob emerges from the front door of
Laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street,
hands thrust into his pockets.
The rain almost immediately
soaks him.
In the distance, Rob runs toward us.
As he gets to us we
move with him down the street.
He is drenched.
We hear the
rain, and his ragged breath.
Headlights appear behind him
and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine
gets louder.
Rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks
desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small
brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the
black wet earth.
The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows
deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and
staring up at the sky.
Off-camera the car engine catches
up, and a door opens and shuts.
He sighs and shuts his
eyes...
He opens his eyes again, to see Laura's face, wet as well,
staring down at him.
It is difficult to distinguish rain
from tears.
LAURA
Are you going to lie in that flower
bed all night?
ROB
Uh... No.
But Rob keeps lying there.
Laura pulls herself to a sitting
position on the wall just above him.
LAURA
You're soaking.
ROB
Mmnn.
LAURA
You're also an idiot.
Rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall
next to her.
ROB
I can see why you say that.
Look,
I'm sorry.
I really am.
The last
thing I wanted was... that's why I
left, because... I lost it, and I
didn't want to blow my top in there,
and... look, the reason I fucked
everything up was because I was
scared.
I just wanted you to know,
that's all.
LAURA
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
I can't
reciprocate.
ROB
What do you mean?
LAURA
I didn't mess things up because I
was scared.
I slept with Ray because
I was sick of you.
And I needed
something to snap me out of it.
ROB
Sure, I understand.
Look, I don't
want to take up any more of your
time.
You get back, and I'll wait
here for a bus.
LAURA
I don't want to go back.
ROB
What do you want to do?
LAURA
C'mon.
They swing their legs over the wall and walk to Laura's VW.
Rob and Laura walk the cement breakfront.
LAURA
... Like Mexico.
Or Jamaica.
Or
New York, even.
ROB
Hey, great idea.
What I'll do is,
tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box
full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on
the Sub label, and I'll pay for it
that way.
LAURA
I'll pay for you.
Even though you
owe me money.
We have to do something
with the money I earn.
I need to.
I deserve it.
You can just think of
it as winning the lottery.
ROB
Fantastic.
The Girlfriend Lottery.
LAURA
Money does not matter.
I do not
care how much you earn.
I'd just
like you to be a little happier in
your work, but beyond that you can
do what you like.
ROB
But it wasn't supposed to be like
this.
When I met you we were the
same people and now we're not, and...
LAURA
How?
How were we the same people?
ROB
Well, you were the kind of person
who came to the Artful Dodger and I
was the kind of person who deejayed
at the Artful Dodger.
You wore jeans
and T-shirts, and so did I.
And I
still do, and you don't.
LAURA
Because I'm not allowed to.
I still
do, after work.
So, what?
Should
we just break up?
Is that what you're
saying?
Because if you are, I'm
going to run out of patience.
ROB
No, but...
LAURA
But what?
ROB
But why doesn't it matter that we're
not the same people we used to be?
LAURA
You haven't changed so much as a
pair of socks in the years I've known
you.
If we've grown apart, then I'm
the one who's done the growing, and
all I've done is change jobs.
ROB
And hairstyles and clothes and
attitude and friends and...
LAURA
I can't go to work with my hair dyed
pink.
And I can afford to go shopping
more now, and I've met a couple people
I like over the last year or so.
ROB
You're tougher.
LAURA
More confident, maybe.
ROB
Harder.
LAURA
Less neurotic.
Are you intending to
stay the same for the rest of your
life?
ROB
I'm alright.
LAURA
Yeah, you're alright.
But you're
certainly not happy.
So what happens
if you get happy?
And yes I know
that's the title of an Elvis Costello
album, I use the reference
deliberately to catch your attention.
Should we split up because I'm used
to you being miserable?
What happens
if you, I don't know, start you're
own record label, and it's a success?
Time for a new girlfriend?
ROB
You're being stupid.
LAURA
How?
What would be the difference
between you having a record label
and me going from legal aid to private
practice?
Rob is silent.
LAURA
All I'm saying is, you have to allow
for things to happen to people, most
of all to yourself.
Otherwise, what's
the use?
ROB
No use.
Rob comes out of the stock room and walks toward the counter
where Dick and Barry stare at the tape deck like two concerned
doctors, listening to a song that is raw and moody and lyrical --
Minor Threat meets Brian Eno, if that's possible.
Rob joins
them in contemplation.
ROB
What is this.
DICK
It's Vince and Justin.
ROB
Who's that?
BARRY
The little skate-fuckers.
ROB
No way.
BARRY
Yes way.
It's really...
Rob and Dick look at him, ready to pounce --
BARRY
(pained to say it)
It's really fucking good.
Dick and Barry look to Rob, who continues to just listen...
He takes a deep breath and walks to the front door and out,
seemingly with a mission.
Vince and Justin are doing noisy skate tricks against the
curb across the street.
When they see Rob they stop, get
ready to flee.
He walks across to them.
Dick comes out and
hovers in the background.
ROB
Your tape.
It's good.
They mumble thanks.
ROB
It's rough.
But it shows promise.
We record a couple of songs right,
in a studio.
I'll take care of the
rest.
I'll put out your record.
Any profits after recouping expenses
get split down the middle, between
us and you guys.
VINCE
Wait a minute.
Island Records charged
U2 a million five against their
overhead for one plane ride.
ROB
We're not there yet, Justin.
VINCE
I'm Vince.
ROB
Whatever.
He begins to move toward the store.
Vince and Justin look
at each other.
Rob gets to the door but stops and turns.
ROB
Hey.
What's the name of your band?
JUSTIN
The Kinky Wizards.
ROB
What?
VINCE
We saw this ad in the personals for
two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance
fair.
ROB
Nice.
VINCE
What's the name of your label?
Rob looks at them.
Then at Dick.
Then through the window
at Barry, inside looking out.
Then at his own reflection in
the window.
Then back at them.
ROB
Broken Records.
Welcome aboard.
Rob walks back inside.
He seems to be shaking a little.
BARRY
What the fuck is that?
ROB
What?
BARRY
I heard you, man.
Don't give me
that "what" shit.
You just told
them that you're gonna put out a
record with them.
ROB
So?
You even said they're good.
BARRY
HELLO.
DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around
here with a band, Mr. Branson?
Mr.
Phil Spector?
Rob waves him off and disappears into the stock room.
Laura
enters.
LAURA
Hey, Barry.
BARRY
Oh, hi.
LAURA
Where's Rob?
BARRY
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street
is in his executive suite.
Do you
have an appointment?
LAURA
What are you talking about?
BARRY
Just that Rob seems to think it would
be wiser to start a record label by
putting out a record with business-
crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters
than with someone he knows in his
bitter jealous heart is a musical
visionary.
That's all.
Laura puts it together, and smiles.
She goes to the back
and crack the door, finding Rob sitting on a box, thinking.
ROB
Hi.
LAURA
Hi.
What are you doing?
ROB
Nothing.
LAURA
Wanna go to dinner?
ROB
Where?
LAURA
At Paul and Miranda's.
Paul from
work.
ROB
Oh.
Well.
We don't really get along.
Paul and I.
LAURA
I know.
But you've never met.
It
just seems like a stone unturned in
your relationship with him.
ROB
Ha.
CUT TO:
ROB IN HIS CHAIR
Rob to camera.
ROB
We're at a point where I can't really
walk away from gauntlets she might
throw down, and so I go.
And wouldn't
you know it, I sort of fall in love
with Paul and Miranda -- with what
they have, and the way they treat
each other, and the way they make me
feel as if I'm the new center of
their world.
I think they're great,
and I want to see them twice a week,
every week, for the rest of my life.
Only right at the end of the evening
do I realize I've been set up.
Rob walks to work, drinking his coffee.
He stops and backs
up a few feet, and stares at a poster on a plywood board-up.
"'I SOLD MY MOM'S WHEELCHAIR'/the debut single from The Kinky
Wizards/on Broken Records/Record release party July 20 at
The Artful Dodger/Featuring the triumphant return of DJ ROB
GORDON/"Dance Music For Old People"
Rob scowls, and storms off.
