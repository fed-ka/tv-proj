      Jack dusts himself off and tries to stay upbeat as he picks
    up his bags.  There is a sign above him which reads:

                               Welcome to Mapleport
                              "Make yourself useful"

      Jack sees it, nods to himself: "Will do."  And begins walking.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 4.
                     




      Jack walks determinedly down the street with his luggage. 
      MR. MALVY, 55, an ass, fixes a go-cart, sees Jack and laughs.

                                    MR. MALVY
                    Jack!  Back again, huh?  What was it
                    this time?  Park Ranger?  Air Marshal?

                                    JACK
                          (despises Malvy)
                    Seminary.  Just hoping to help people
                    make spiritual sense of a random
                    universe.  But working on go-carts
                    is fine too, I guess.

                                    MR. MALVY
                    Jack Shea.  Always trying to prove
                    something. 'Til ya shoot yourself in
                    the foot.  Ha!

                                    JACK
                    That only happened once in the police
                    academy.

                                    MR. MALVY
                    Thought you did it in the Army, too.

                                    JACK
                    No, sir.  I shot somebody else's
                    foot in the Army.  
                          (off Malvy's cackle)
                    I have to go, Mr Malvy.  Say "hi" to
                    your irresponsible daughter-the-
                      stripper-with-kids-from-three-
                    different-dads.

      Malvy angrily points to three diverse KIDS sitting nearby in
      their little go-cart helmets looking upset.  

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, kids.  Your mom's a great
                    lady who only works bikini bars --
                    no actual lap-dancing or if she does,
                    it's an air dance, no real grind. 
                    Stay proud of who you are.  

      Jack glares a Malvy, takes his luggage and goes.

                                                                                  CUT TO:      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 5.
                     




      Jack's formal send-off.  Terry stands, her arm around Mason. 
      Jack is in khakis and a polo shirt with the company logo.  

                                    JACK
                    Thank you for having the faith to
                    put your business in my hands. 

      Tony won't let go of the keys.  They struggle.  Tony releases.

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    I'll prove you did the right thing.

      Jack gets in as Mason sets off flares from a Roman Candle.

                                      TERRY
                    Good luck.  Especially with Darren.

                                    JACK
                    Darren?  He's still with the company?  
                          (heart sinks)
                    Oh.  Oh, God.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jack pulls over to a curb and picks up DARREN, 22, glasses,
      skater shorts and a hoodie, brilliant and couldn't care less. 
      He's laughing on his cell phone.  In his other hand he has a
      40-ounce in a bag.  He stands beside an impossibly old man,
      ELLIS, semi-catatonic, in a wheelchair with oxygen tanks.  

                                      DARREN
                          (laughs into phone)
                    Damn, girl, save some dirty talk for
                    after work.  
                                      (MORE)      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 9.
                     



                                      DARREN (CONT'D)
                    Y'know, I was gonna jump you right
                    there in the kitchen last night but
                    I felt bad since I was there to take
                    out your granddaughter...  Yeah,
                    lemme talk to Princess.

      Jack puts on his friendliest face -- hoping for the best.

                                    JACK
                    Hey, bud.  Good to see you again.

      Darren kisses the old man goodbye and gets in, leaving Ellis
    on the sidewalk alone.  

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    Let's hear it for prompt start-times,
                    huh, partner?  I foresee us having
                    successful and spiritually fulfilling--

                                      DARREN
                    Where's Tony?   

                                    JACK
                          (still upbeat)
                    Huh?  Oh.  I'm taking over for him
                    while his heart mends.  He said he
                    was gonna call you.  

                                      DARREN
                    Maybe he did -- I been busy pokin'.
                          (into phone)
                    What's that, Princess?  You still
                    out of breath?  
                          (to Jack)
                    Told you I was busy.

                                    JACK
                          (points to Ellis)
                    Darren, we can't leave your
                      grandfather out there alone.

                                      DARREN
                    Oh, he's cool.  I left him a sandwich.
                          (off Jack's look)
                    Man, you are still so uptight.  Watch:  

      Darren gets out and goes to take the sandwich and Ellis smacks
      his hand - a sudden move like the movie "Awakenings."       Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 10.
                     



                                      DARREN (CONT'D)
                          (getting in van)
                    See?  He's bad-ass.  Let's roll. 

      Darren pulls out the 40-oz from the bag.  Sees Jack eye him.

                                      DARREN (CONT'D)
                    This is coffee.  Can we go?

      Jack forces a smile and drives.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jack is driving and trying to read a clipboard of work orders. 
      Darren has his feet up on the dash.  

                                      DARREN
                          (sotto, on phone)
                    Yeah, it's nuts -- I got this clown
                    saying he's a new Tony when nobody
                    can be a new Tony.

                                    JACK
                    I can hear everything you're saying.

                                      DARREN
                    Not you, pimp-juice.  Different guy. 
                    Across town.  
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah, that was him.  Now he's an
                    upset clown, heh-heh, but it's all
                    gravy -- I'll try and help him, but
                    history says he won't last.  

                                    JACK
                    I'm gonna last!  

                                      DARREN
                    Not you.  Damn, so paranoid.  Relax. 
                    Have some coffee.
                          (offers 40 oz, then
                          sees something ahead)
                    Whoa-whoa-whoa, stop the van. 
                          (calls out window)
                    Berrick!  Berriiiick!  What's up?  

      A shifty guy, BERRICK, hurries with a flat screen TV.  

                                      BERRICK
                    You know.  Keepin' busy.  Can I get
                    a ride?  My car won't start and I
                    kinda need to leave the area fast.      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 11.
                     



      Darren opens the door.

                                    JACK
                    Whoa.  Hey, fellas.  Don't want to
                    ruffle feathers here, but we're headed
                    to an important client, and I'd just-
                    as-soon not get involved with a thief.  

                                      DARREN
                    Thief?  That is presumptive and
                    hurtful, man.  Is that because Berrick
                    is part Asian?  

                                      BERRICK
                    Asians built the railroads, homey.

                                      DARREN
                    That's a bad start for our positive
                    working rapport.  Bad.

      This hits Jack hard.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jack and Darren walk up to a fancy house.  Berrick follows. 

                                      BERRICK
                    You sure I can't come in, too?  Maybe
                    inspect their alarm system.

                                    JACK
                    Go away.  You're done.

      Berrick lingers and Jack has to "shoo" him off like a goat. 
    As Berrick heads off, they head to the door.  Jack fumbles
      through work orders on a clipboard.

                                      DARREN
                    You said it's a shower job, right? 
                    Remember, we're using pre-mixed tile
                    grout with exclusive, heat-activated
                    polymers from Germany.  Rich women
                    love hearing stuff like that.  Your
                    dad got so much tail talking about
                    exclusive polymers from Germany.  I
                    bet you got siblings on this block
                    you don't know about.

                                    JACK
                          (tucking in shirt)
                    Don't ring the bell.  Tucking my
                    shirt in.  You need to tuck in, too. 

                                      DARREN
                    People don't tuck into shorts. 

                                    JACK
                      Professionals don't wear shorts on a
                    job, so tuck in to make up for it.

                                      DARREN
                          (pushing bell)
                    I opt out of that rule.

                                    JACK
                    No opt outs.  Put the shirt--  Ow! 
                    Got a hair in my watchband.  Oh, oh-- 

      A super TALL CLIENT LADY opens the door.  Jack straightens,
      yanks his hand from his pants, causing agony which he covers:      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 13.
                     



                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                          (eager to impress)
                    Hi.  Mr. Fix-it.  At your service.  

                                      DARREN
                          (re: her height)
                    Wow.

                                    TALL CLIENT LADY
                    Where's Tony?  I wanted Tony.

                                      DARREN
                    Tony's fantastic -- he'll be back to
                    work soon.

                                    JACK
                    No, he won't -- his heart is weak. 
                    I'm his son, Jack.  I'm saving his
                    life by taking over and bringing Mr.
                    Fix-It to the next level.  Website. 
                    Skype.    Plus I have a background
                    in law enforcement and theology, so
                    I may solve crimes or mend hearts
                    out here, the sky's the limit.
                          (off her scowl)
                    But that's down the road.  Let's
                    talk about your shower.  We're using
                    a, um, pre-mixed tile grout with
                    heat activated polymers from Germany. 
                    How's that sound?  

                                    TALL CLIENT LADY
                    I called you to re-plank my deck.

                                    JACK
                          (checks clipboard)
                    Here it is.  Deck bid.  After lunch.  
                          (explains)
                    My dad's weird notation system. 
                    I'll be improving that too.

      Awkward pause.

                                      DARREN
                    At least your shirt's tucked in.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jack comes out of the hardware store with a small trex plank
      and meets Darren coming out of a convenience store with lunch.  

                                      DARREN
                    Hey.  You owe me six bucks.  
                          (flashing dirty mags)
                    I'm refilling the van's library.  

                                    JACK
                    That's disgusting.  No.  

                                      DARREN
                    Library's crucial for morale, daddy. 
                    If you're stuck somewhere, like the
                    lumber yard waiting for them to sand
                    some wood -- you can head to the van
                    and you can sand some wood. 

                                    JACK
                    No!  It's not your van to decide the
                    rules!   This is a family business
                    and you are not family.  You are an
                    employee!  I'm your boss.  I have a
                    code of ethics, a code of hygiene,
                    and my van shall not be sullied.  

                                      DARREN
                    Too late.  Did it when you were
                    getting hardware.  

                                    JACK
                    You sullied my work van?... You
                    sullied my work van!  Go clean it
                    out, right now, and while you're at
                    it, maybe clean out your soul.

                                      DARREN
                          (glances behind Jack)
                    Okay, but someone's already been
                    cleaning out the van, so...

      Jack turns and sees Berrick is stealing tools from the van.

                                    JACK
                    You saw him there and didn't stop
                    him?!

                                      DARREN
                    "Just an employee."  Not my van.       Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 17.
                     



                                    JACK
                      Unbelievable!
                          (yells)
                      Berriiiick!

      Berrick bolts and Jack takes off running after him... He
      gets closer, closer, and as we see them cross the street
      down the block Jack gets creamed by a Malvy kid in a go-cart.

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                          (way in the distance)
                    Son of a bitch!

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Darren waits on the curb with his 40 oz.  The van pulls over. 
      Darren gets in and Jack acts cool, Clint Eastwood style.  

                                    JACK
                    Ditch the beer.

                                      DARREN
                    It's coffee.

                                    JACK
                    I'm not your clown.  Ditch the beer.  

                                      DARREN
                    You got to relax, big-baller.  That
                    kind of tense, trying-too-hard is
                    probably why you mess up careers.

      Jack glares then snatches the forty-ounce.

                                    JACK
                    Mind your business how I mess up,
                    we're ditching your stupid beer.
                          (notices fluid)
                    Huh?  It's coffee.  Why the hell do
                    you have coffee in a forty-ounce?!

                                      DARREN
                    I owe a guy money -- he sees me
                    standing out here with coffee, he
                    knows I got a job.  He sees me with
                    a forty in the morning he won't bug
                    me.  Now I need some coffee. 
                          (takes Jack's, sips)
                    Hazelnut?  You go, girl.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Tony trots barefoot down the street in the yoga clothes. 
      Mr. Malvy, flying a little helicopter, sees him.

                                    MR. MALVY
                    Look at you.  Late for mime class?

      Tony punches the chopper out of the air as he passes.    

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Darren lays planks on a half-done deck.  Jack's on the phone. 

                                      DARREN
                    Off the phone, we have work to do.  

                                    JACK
                    Oooh, now you have a work ethic.
                          (on phone, a la Darren)
                    Yeah, this clown's freaking out
                    because I want to take his sister
                    out dancing.  Freak dancing.

                                      DARREN
                    Don't push me, man.      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 26.
                     



                                    JACK
                    Not you, playboy.  Another guy who
                    also stinks like coconut oil.
                          (points)
                    That plank's not straight.
                          (into phone)
                    What's that, Liz?  You want to see
                    my straight plank?

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH...


      Jack is still nailed to the deck. Darren's freaking out.

                                      DARREN
                    Oh, man.  Oh.  I told you to use
                    deck screws, pimp juice.  
                          (looks at Jack's foot)
                    I'm gonna throw up.

    As Darren dry heaves...

                                    JACK
                    Good.  Maybe you'll throw up your
                    crazy hood slang like "pimp juice."
                    Can you please call an ambulance?

      Tony comes around the corner in his yoga outfit, on the phone.

                                    TONY
                    I'm calling them now.

                                    JACK
                    Dad?  You're checking up on me again? 
                    It's like you don't trust me.  

                                    TONY
                    Look at yourself! 

      Terry comes around the corner of the house.

                                      TERRY
                    Caught you, Tony.  You're supposed
                    to avoid stress!

                                    TONY
                    This isn't stressful.

                                    JACK
                    No?  I have a nail through my toe
                    webbing.

                                      DARREN
                    Now, I'm throwing up.

    As he does:      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 28.
                     



                                    TONY
                    I'm fine, Terry.  Stop bossing me
                    like you know everything.  My health
                    is not... affected by...

      His face gets the lemon-in-the-eye look.  He holds his chest.

                                    TONY (CONT'D)
                    Son of a bitch.

                                                                                SMASH TO:


      Jack stops to pick up Darren.  But Darren waves him off. 

                                      DARREN
                    I got a different gig...  Go.        Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 31.
                     



      Jack shakes his head, disgusted, and drives on alone.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jack limps around, working on the deck.  He hurts his foot.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jack comes in, tired and grim.  Terry is at the door. 

                                      TERRY
                    Tony's proud of you for not quitting.

                                    JACK
                          (bitter)
                    Oh, he told you that, did he?  Cause
                    he couldn't spare one word for me.

                                      TERRY
                    Well, he is.  And Mason made up some
                    lyrics he wants you to jam out to.

                                    JACK
                    We don't have a band!

                                                                                  CUT TO:
