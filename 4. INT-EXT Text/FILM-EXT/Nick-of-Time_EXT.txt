The "San Diegan" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow,
grinding stop.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano,
and Irvine is now arriving at Gate
Nine.
Doors are opened. Steps set down. Passengers pour out.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Amtrack 264 will be departing in
fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for
Oxnard, Ventura...
The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding
a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the
steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within
the train:
GENE
Lynn!
Lynn!!
GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and
inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases.
He takes a relieved breath when he sees
her.
GENE
Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?
As he comes down the steps:
GENE
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of
my sight, all right? I want you to
stay right by me. Will you do that
for me?
LYNN
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the
platform and gives out an exaggerated
sigh.
GENE
We made it.
LYNN nods back.
LYNN
We made it.
MS. JONES heads for-a van with smoked windows. She gets inside
with LYNN. GENE stops a few feet away.
GENE
What is going on?
MR. SMITH prods him in the ribs.
MR. SMITH
Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.
GENE looks desperately around for help. There is none. He
lets MR. SMITH push him toward the van.
MR. SMITH activates the walkie-talkie, speaks into it.
MR. SMITH
Let's test this thing. You on?
He holds it up for GENE to hear.
MS. JONES (O.S.)
(filtered)
Reading you.
MR. SMITH still has GENE'S wallet. He opens it, pulls out
some cash, puts it in GENE's breast pocket.
MR. SMITH
You'11 need some cash.
(re: the wallet)
I'll hang onto this for the time
being. Oh, and...
He grabs one of GENE's hands.
MR. SMITH
You'll need these.
He dumps six bullet's into GENE's palm from a cloth Chivas
Regal bag.
MR. SMITH
Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a
wastin'.
GENE just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his
hand. MR. SMITH reaches out, turns him around and gives him
a shove away from the van and into the midst of...
...a LARGE CROWD OF TOURISTS, that have just exited an
arriving mini-bus. GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried
along like a leaf in a stream.
Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a
trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the
Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's
like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets,
turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist
him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see...
The van is gone!
ANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM
He stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks
desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his
surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions.
He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step.
A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S
legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds
himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart
plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.
LITTLE GIRL
Mama!
She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up,
reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching
the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder.
Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT
POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station.
It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He
is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more
confident.
Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into
view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right
past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in
behind him speaking in his ear.
MR. SMITH
You talk to a cop, you even look at
a cop too long and your daughter is
dead.
(into walkie-talkie)
Do it.
MS. JONES (O.S.)
(filtered)
Go ahead, sugar Die.
LYNN (V.O.)
(filtered)
Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling
Daddy. Come in, Daddy.
GENE grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man.
GENE
Lynn!
LYNN (V.O.)
(filtered)
I can hear you good. Can you hear
me?
GENE
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
MR. SMITH
That's enough.
MS. JONES (V.O.)
(filtered)
'Daddy has to go now.
LYNN
(filtered)
He has to say "over and out". Daddy,
you have to say "over and out".
GENE
Over and out.
MR. SMITH clicks off the walkie-talkie.
MR. SMITH
Look at your watch. Look at it! At
one-thirty your little girl is dead.
Say it with me. At one-thirty my
little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
GENE
(softly)
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
MR. SMITH
Unless you do what you're told. Go
do it!
He pushes GENE on, toward a cab.
MR. SMITH
And don't forget I'll be watching
you.
GENE looks back at him, full of impotent rage. MR. SMITH
raises the walkie-talkie. GENE reaches the first cab at the
stand.
The CABBIE, talking to ANOTHER DRIVER, throws away his
cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab.
CABBIE
Where to, sir?
GENE
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure
Hotel. Do you know where that is?
The CABBIE is disappointed, but he nods and GENE gets into
the cab.
GENE looks out his window and finds himself staring at MR.
SMITH, staring back at him, driving the van, next to him. He
throws himself back in the seat.
GENE stops a few yards from the cab, watching the CABBIE.
GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm
snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what
it is. He looks around.
VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and
going. No one pays particular attention to him.
GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out
and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away.
GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately
hanging onto the last glimpse of it.
MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE
goes into the hotel.
GENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving
through the traffic.
Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping
low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door,
one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on
the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks
inside the cab.
No MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces
himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks
out the gun.
GENE climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there. The
gall of his defeat is hard to swallow. He realizes he's
holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away.
About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor. Skyways connect
the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and
Figueroa. A platform has been set up with chairs and
microphones in front of a podium.
GENE blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. When his eyes
adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching A
SECURITY MAN with a hand-held metal detector. He panics,
turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along,
trapped. The line shuffles forward. He turns, determined to
make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a
2ND SECURITY MAN, who waves him to one side.
2ND SECURITY MAN Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait. I
can take you over here.
GENE is dragged forward. He looks around; no way out. He
stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of
his body, is lifted over to the other. Down it slides, toward
the pocket concealing the gun. GENE waits for the alarm -
which doesn't come. The SECURITY MAN operating the gizmo
deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. GENE is pushed
on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among:
PRESS by the dozens. Eleanor Samara Grant SUPPORTERS by the
hundreds. SECURITY MEN and COPS IN UNIFORM. GENE moves through
them, trying to figure out what just happened. He glances
back to the 2ND SECURITY MAN, and bumps into one particular
POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts
with a quick laugh.
POLICE OFFICER Easy, sir. Got to watch where you're going in
a crowd like this.
He is a handsome, solid-looking guy. You'd trust him. Call
him OFFICER TRUST. OFFICER TRUST seems to be in charge. He
moves off through the crowd, giving LOCAL POLICE orders in
an easy way.
GENE looks around. He can't see MR. SMITH. He edges his way
after OFFICER TRUST, who reaches the wall beyond which is
the drop to the street. He leans there comfortably, scanning
the crowd, GENE reaches the wall a few yards away from him.
He looks out at the city, getting his courage up. Just as he
turns to approach OFFICER TRUST:
MR. SMITH (O.S.)
I know what you're thinking.
GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him.
He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.
GENE
What would you do in my place?
MR. SMITH
Me?
He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.
MR. SMITH
The bitch would be dead. Course I
ain't sayin' which bitch.
He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie-
talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the
sidewalk four stories below.
MR. SMITH goes ballistic.
GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST.
GENE
There's a plot to kill the Governor.
If you don't believe me, check that
guy right there. He has a gun.
OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE.
OFFICER TRUST
So do you, Mr. Watson.
And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie-
Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH.
OFFICER TRUST
You got this under control?
MR. SMITH
Yeah.
OFFICER TRUST
It doesn't look like it.
MR. SMITH
It's under control.
OFFICER TRUST
It better be.
OFFICER TRUST walks away.
MR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie-
talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him
to an isolated corner.
MR. SMITH
I oughta throw you after that walkie-
talkie but I'm going to give you a
break because you're an amateur.
WAITER M (O.S.)
Gentlemen...
The WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres.
MR. SMITH
Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.
GENE shakes his head.
MR. SMITH
Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.
GENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on.
MR. SMITH
There was this guy. Big guy. Irish-
Italian. Red-faced, black-haired,
jolly son-of-a-bitch.
We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting.
MR. SMITH
Nobody could make me laugh like him.
We closed more bars together than I
can count. He was my pal. I loved
that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to
say it. But he was fuck-up. He had
this image of himself. Thought he
was con man. Always trying to shave
the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always
miss him. Tell me why.
GENE
What...?
MR. SMITH
Tell me why I miss him.
GENE
He's dead?
MR. SMITH
That's right. He's dead. Tell me
why.
GENE
How should I...?
MR. SMITH
Tell me why he's dead.
GENE stares at him for a beat.
GENE
You killed him.
MR. SMITH
That's right, I killed him. He fucked
up one too many times so I put a
bullet in his eye. Then I put two
more into him just to make sure. Now
that was somebody I loved.
He moves in on GENE, crowding him. He breathes hard, looks
like one insane piece of work.
MR. SMITH
I loved that motherfucker but I got
the call and I put him down like a
sick animal. So if you've got any
doubts about what's going to happen
if you don't deliver let me tell you
something. I'd make gravy out of
your little girl just to season that
black Irish cocksucker's meat.
A wave of applause catches their attention.
ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT
She and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward
the platform. ELEANOR GRANT gladhands people on the way.
ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:45PM
He turns' back to GENE.
MR. SMITH
Do what you're supposed to do. Do it
now.
He grabs GENE and gives him a push. There is a general
movement in the crowd toward the platform. GENE is buffeted
along. MR. SMITH follows him, keeping him in sight, but then
a PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS move in, start snapping, lifting
their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. MR. SMITH
instinctively turns away, hiding his face. He moves around
the PHOTOGS and finds himself separated from GENE by the
mob. He searches, trying to spot him.
MR. SMITH
Shit!
ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM
In the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face
displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on
something ahead:
It is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this
way and that, greeting supporters.
GENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at
the end of his rope. He is going to do it.
ANGLE ON ROSTRUM
A local POLITICO mounts the platform, taps the microphone.
LOCAL POLITICO Can I have your attention Please! Please
welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor
of Los Angeles.
The honorable Tom Bradley.
The CROWD reacts loudly, yells and whistles. GENE-pushes his
way forward.
TOM BRADLEY
It is my extreme pleasure this
afternoon to introduce to you...
ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM
He is now a few yards from ELEANOR GRANT. He comes up against
the SECURITY MAN who gave him the once-over with the metal
detector. The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away.
He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the CROWD.
TOM BRADLEY
...a woman who can only be
characterized as a one-of-a-kind.
GENE is close to ELEANOR GRANT. She is just a few bodies
away, visible between them. His hand moves in his pocket. He
swallows. The impulse sweeps over him and...
KRISTA (O.S.)
Feeling better?
KRISTA BROOKS, the young woman from the elevator is next to
him, smiling. He looks at her in confusion.
TOM BRADLEY
An iconoclast with class...
KRISTA
The elevator. You weren't feeling
well.
GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT.
TOM BRADLEY
A genuine lady who's not afraid to
get into the trenches...
KRISTA
Are you better now?
GENE turns, scans the crowd - no sign of MR. SMITH.
TOM BRADLEY
...and go to the mat with greedy
special interests...
GENE looks at KRISTA, studies her intensely. She's a bit
unnerved.
TOM BRADLEY
The finest Governor our state has
ever had...
Again GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. She's turning around,
facing the crowd, facing him.
TOM BRADLEY
My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor
Grant!
ELEANOR GRANT raises her arms. A perfect target. The CROWD
roars as GENE turns back to KRISTA. He leans into her, speaks.
GENE
My wife always said I had a problem
trusting people.
KRISTA
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara
Grant.
GENE
You don't understand. I'm going to
trust you. And you have to trust me.
Krista looks at Gene.
KRISTA
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
GENE
Look...my daughter ... she's going
to die...unless you can help me.
Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously
a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case
nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help.
KRISTA
Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me
get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist
you, he's our...
Gene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only,
unnoticed by anyone else.
GENE
(sotto voce)
No! You have to listen to me.
Krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene.
KRISTA
I'm listening, I'm listening.
ANGLE ON THE ROSTRUM
ELEANOR GRANT takes over the microphone from the beaming
LOCAL POLITICO.
ELEANOR GRANT
My friends, my good friends...
ANGLE ON THE CROWD
Gene and Krista are gone.
Hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe
of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the
pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a
ringing speech, accented with applause.
GENE
Please...please...you have to believe
me... They have my daughter.
They
want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or
they'll kill my daughter.
KRISTA tries to edge away.
KRISTA
All right, let's just...let's get
security in on this.
GENE
No! You can't! They're in on it.
KRISTA
I don't see how they could be in on
it. They're the best. They're hand-
picked.
GENE
I don't know. One of them is following
me. If he knew what I'd just told
you they'd...
GENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking
he's going to shoot her.
GENE
Look, how did I get in here with
this!?
KRISTA stares at the gun. She can't deny the fact.
KRISTA
I don't know.
GENE
You've got to trust me. I'm putting
my daughter's life in your hands.
She's only six. She's just a little
girl. Please, please, trust me.
KRISTA
It's a little hard to trust you under
the circumstances.
GENE looks at her intently.
GENE
You're right, it is.
(beat)
Here.
GENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the
least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her
fingers.
GENE
Will you trust me now?
She stares at the gun, at the strange man.
KRISTA
I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's
one person we can go to.
GENE
The man following me has a walkie-
talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll
call his partner. I do anything out
of line and he'll send the word to
kill my daughter.
KRISTA
He'll think you're in the crowd until
the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
She steps closer to the platform/ listens. ELEANOR GRANT'S
voice is heard.
ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)
...I remember that horrible night as
if it were yesterday. A phone call
pulling me out of sleep, the terrible
news...
KRISTA checks her watch.
12:48.
ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)
My husband and child senselessly
killed by a drunk driver.
KRISTA
We've got about ten minutes.
GENE
Are you sure?
KRISTA
I've heard this speech a lot. Come
on. We'll take care of him.
We will.
GENE
But...
KRISTA
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let
me help. Trust me.
GENE
Okay...
She starts to lead him away.
GENE
Hey.
He stops her, points to the gun she still holds.
GENE
I think you better put that away.
KRISTA
I think you're right.
She pulls out a handkerchief, covers the gun and tucks it
out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away.
MR. SMITH still roams the crowd, looking for Gene.
ELEANOR GRANT
But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy
us, has a curious way of giving us
strength.
He sees OFFICER TRUST who gives him a questioning look. He
ignores it.
ELEANOR GRANT
I doubt if I would be before you
now, if I hadn't been put through
that crucible of loss.
MR SMITH notices the JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE we met before.
The man has the video camera pointed at a sharp up angle.
MR. SMITH glances up toward what the man is shooting.
Consternation and anger fill his face.
ANGLE ON RED BONAVENTURE TOWER - 12:4 9PM
What he sees is one of the exterior elevators rising. KRISTA
stands at the glass looking down. Behind her, just glimpsed,
is GENE.
ANGLE ON MR. SMITH
ELEANOR GRANT
And though I can never forget William
and Bill Junior or the love I felt
for them...
MR. SMITH cuts a wake through the CROWD.
ELEANOR GRANT
I have found joy again in serving
this great state. I have found love
again in my second husband Brendan...
GENE comes out of the Men's Room, stands there at a loss.
HUEY (O.S.)
Having a rough day? Down at the heels
as they say? What you need is a shoe
shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
GENE looks around. HUEY has his nose in his magazine, calling
out his patter for whoever drifts by.
The van pulls into a waiting area.
HUEY backs away, taunting her with the walkie-talkie. She is
caught between the van and HUEY, trying to keep her gun under
wraps.
MS. JONES
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come
here!
HUEY
Gimme a dollar.
MS. JONES
Fuck you!
She loses it, hauls out her cannon.
BAM!
HUEY's leg is shot out from under him. He ends up on his
back. MS. JONES swoops down on him, trying to grab the walkie-
talkie..
MS. JONES
Gimme that thing!
HUEY's wounded leg is twisted under him.
MS. Jones jumps on the wounded HUEY who is stunned but bravely
clutches the Walkie Talkie under him.
MS. JONES
Goddammit, give it to me, you
Sunnavabitch!
She sticks the gun in HUEY's face. He tries to take it away
from her, but she's really tough...and mad.
The gun fires
wildly, hitting a passing vehicle which careens left causing
a chain reaction of COLLISIONS on the street.
...and stares at GENE, soaking wet, holding the gun. MR.
SMITH'S gun slides from his hand.
MR. SMITH
Very good...Mr. Watson. I told
them...I could make a killer out of
you.
He drops to his knees, pauses, then tree-falls onto his face.
ANGLE ON GENE
He rushes forward into the van and reaches over the seat to
pick Lynn up.
ANGLE ON MS JONES AND HUEY
She has heard the gunfire and turns her attention from HUEY
to GENE. She raises her gun and aims at GENE and LYNN inside
the van.
HUEY reaches down, grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered
artificial leg out of the pants-leg and applies it to the
side of her head. She is knocked aside and out.
HUEY
There's nothing like a good wing-
tip.
