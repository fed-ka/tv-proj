      LIZ enters 30 Rock.*



      Kenneth enters with a tray of breakfast.  Tracy is on his 
      couch which is made up like a bed.

                                    KENNETH
                    Rise and shine, Mr. Jordan.  

                                  TRACY
                      I couldn t sleep at all last night.  
                    Angie kept my Sharper Image White 
                    Noise Aromatherapy Machine.  She 
                    knows I can t fall asleep without 
                    the sound of the ocean and the 
                    smell of bacon.

                                    KENNETH
                    Well, hurry up and get your second 
                    wind,  cause I ve got our day all 
                    planned out.  We ll start at Bed, 
                    Bath & Beyond, pick up all the 
                    things you re gonna need in here.  
                    Then, an old friend of mine from 
                    college is having her baby shower 
                    out on Long Island so we ll swing 
                    by there.  And for dinner, I 
                    thought we could stay in and have 
                    the rest of that soup I made 
                      yesterday.

                                  TRACY
                    I m not doing any of that.  30 ROCK 201: "SeinfeldVision"  13.

                          (stung)
                    Okay.  That s fine.  I went with 
                    you to your black vampire movie.  
                    But I ll just tell my friends that 
                    you have a migraine.

                                  TRACY
                    Good compromising, office-wife.  *

      Kenneth exits, not sure how to feel.*

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Liz looks over and sees another WOMAN trying on  her  dress.*

                    ugly on you.  You ll thank me.*

      The woman gives her a look like,  that s rude, but maybe *
      true?   She goes to take off the dress.*

      The saleswoman nods as if this makes sense.*

                                                                            CUT TO:*
