LEVEL - A STUDY OF HOOFPRINTS - LATE AFTERNOON
The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their
way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed
drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints;
and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing
them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints
RAISES SLOWLY TO:
We see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along --
heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house
with its outlying barn and corrals.
The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is
ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing.
Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard.
Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his
clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one
pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows.
His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down
the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the
Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries
a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho...
Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and
PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto
his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk
sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer
to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing
around the corner of the house.
LATE AFTERNOON
She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s.
Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly.
DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the
neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a
piquant, memorable face.
Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her
face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again
five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps
the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of
scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger.
The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and
cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch
extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the
door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too,
sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious
but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and
tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man
than Ethan and possibly a few years older.
As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter,
LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 --
a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl
with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely
forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger.
In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto
the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years
have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work
has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be
idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares
the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she
automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and
she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.
Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a
man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He,
too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much
so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to
dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always
riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward
the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben,
MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open
ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a
lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight
hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other
horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if
they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues,
followed by Ben, toward where
Debbie crouches over her dog.
As he rides downslope toward the house.
THE CREDITS END.
AARON - LATE AFTERNOON
Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron --
recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to
check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later
Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman.
AARON
(incredulous)
Ethan?
He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the
hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows
Aaron.
as Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them.
There is a noticeable constraint on all of them. Finally:
ETHAN
Hello, Aaron...
His eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has
been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him.
ETHAN
Martha...
MARTHA
(a bit shakily)
Hello, Ethan.
Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and
Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron
pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse
toward their side.
AARON
How's California?
ETHAN
How should I know?
AARON
But Mose Harper said...
ETHAN
That old goat still creakin'
around?... Whyn't someone bury him?
He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie
have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious.
Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down
at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children.
ETHAN
Ben, ain't you?
Ben nods.
ETHAN
(frowning at Debbie)
Lucy, you ain't much bigger than
when I saw you last.
DEBBIE
I'm Deborah!
(pointing)
She's Lucy.
Ethan looks in the direction of the pointing finger.
as Lucy steps down from the porch and approaches.
MARTHA
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
BEN
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him,
too!
MARTHA
That's enough... Go on inside and
help Lucy set the table... You, too,
Deborah!
as Martin -- with slightly averted face -- crosses to take
the bridle of Ethan's horse and lead him away.
ETHAN
(wheeling on him)
MOMENTO!
Martin checks his stride, stares in surprise.
MARTHA
(contritely)
Martin!... Here we've been standing...
Ethan, you haven't forgotten Martin?
ETHAN
Oh... Mistook you for a half-breed.
MARTIN
(levelly)
Not quite... Quarter Cherokee. The
rest is Welsh... So they tell me.
ETHAN
You've done a lot of growin'...
AARON
It was Ethan found you squallin' in
a sage clump after your folks was
massacred...
ETHAN
(bluntly)
It just happened to be me... No need
to make any more of it...
MARTIN
I'll take care of your horse for
you, Uncle Ethan.
Again, he starts to lead away.
ETHAN
Hold on!
Martin stops again.
ETHAN
I'll take this...
He completes unlacing the pack and takes it -- treating it
as though it contained something of value. Martin watches
with a touch of resentment: Ethan doesn't trust him.
Ethan turns and sees the look. He doesn't care what Martin
thinks, nor does he explain. Martin leads the horse off.
MARTHA
Supper'll be ready by the time you
wash up... Let me take your coat for
you, Ethan.
He hesitates, then grudgingly surrenders it -- conscious of
its sorry condition.
MARTHA
(smiling faintly)
And... welcome home.
He just nods, then turns to follow Aaron around the side of
the house toward the wash-up.
She stands alone, looking after Ethan -- his coat in her
arms. She holds it against her breast for just a moment and
her eyes are tender.
DISSOLVE TO:
Debbie's dog is barking excitedly as six horsemen slowly
ride toward the house and dismount. A lamp goes on inside.
THE SIX HORSEMEN ARE:
CAPTAIN, THE REVEREND SAM CLAYTON, a big man with frosty
blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air
of grave and resolute authority. He is a minister of the
Gospel with a .44 on his hip.
LARS JORGENSEN, the Edwards' neighbor, is a harried little
man, Scandinavian. As we shall find out soon, he has a brisk
and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children.
BRAD JORGENSEN is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amiable,
impulsive. He is in his early twenties.
CHARLIE MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant of
Company A of the Rangers. (He is also Company A.) Charlie is
a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly patterned
by his association with Captain, the Rev. Sam.
MOSE HARPER is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet
capable of tireless feats of endurance. Some think him
"tetched" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a
time and in a region where few men lived to see their
grandchildren. He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather,
a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band.
ED NESBY is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties;
resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or
dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.
16-A
As Ethan emerges he is brought to a momentary halt by sight
of a couple -- Brad and Lucy -- in each other's arms, standing
near the saddled horses of the posse. Clayton and Jorgensen
following him out, spot the couple, who now belatedly are
conscious of their audience.
JORGENSEN
Brad!... Is no time for lolly-
gagging...
In confusion, Lucy runs back around the side of the house as
Brad -- unrepentant -- grins at his irascible old man and
heads for his waiting horse. Clayton chuckles and turns toward
Martha, who has followed them out.
CLAYTON
Looks like I'll be reading the lines
over that pair before long, sister
Edwards.
JORGENSEN
Is no time for talking weddings...
Better say prayers for those dirty
thieves, by golly... running off a
man's beef...
Mose, last to emerge, bows elaborately to Martha.
MOSE
Grateful to the hospitality of yore
rockin' chair, ma'am...
The men are mounting. Mose nimbly vaults onto the back of
his horse -- which he rides bareback, with only a blanket
pad.
AND
OMITTED
as Ethan and Martin ride to join the group.
CLAYTON
Let's get on with it...
DEBBIE
WAIT!
She comes flying out of the house in her long flannel nightie
and runs to Martin.
DEBBIE
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
MARTIN
Grab hold!...
He swings her up in front of his saddle. They start away.
Ethan is last to ride out. He is watching Martha. He brings
a gloved hand up in a salute. She starts to raise her hand
but only brings it just above her waist, a fluttering gesture
with tremulous fingers. It is the last he will ever see of
her alive.
as the posse slowly rides out, with Ethan last. Martin reins
in to let Debbie slip to the ground. Ethan passes her.
Debbie stands watching the men ride away, waving at them.
AARON'S VOICE
(calling)
DEBORAH!
She turns and comes running back -- CAMERA PANNING -- to the
little group on the porch; Ben in the door; Lucy crossing
the porch; Aaron and Martha at the steps.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
Ethan and Mose are advancing at a steady walk, both men
leaning slightly out of their saddles to study the terrain --
the trail they are following. Out to one side -- fifty yards
distant -- is the main body of the posse: Sam, Jorgensen,
Charlie, Ed, moving roughly parallel to Ethan but at a faster
clip. Martin comes riding in toward Ethan from behind CAMERA.
MARTIN
(calling)
Uncle Ethan!
Ethan reins in -- compressing his lips at the "Uncle."
Mose waits.
MARTIN
Somethin' mighty fishy about this
trail, Uncle Ethan...
ETHAN
Stop callin' me 'uncle'... I ain't
your uncle.
MARTIN
Yes, sir.
ETHAN
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither...
Nor grampaw neither... Nor Methuselah
neither... I can whup you to a
frazzle.
Mose lets out a snickering laugh.
MARTIN
What you want me to call you?
ETHAN
Name's Ethan... Now what's so mighty
fishy about this trail?
MARTIN
Well, fust off...
He breaks and all turn at a distant hail from Jorgensen.
JORGENSEN
Look! Look!
OMITTED
He is holding his rifle with both hands straight over his
head -- and he repeats the signal until he sees they have
seen him.
JORGENSEN'S VOICE
(excitedly)
Brad! He's found them... Come on!
THE DISTANCE
as Jorgensen digs spurs and leads the way. The other riders
follow.
MED. SHOT - BRAD - RISING GROUND - LATE AFTERNOON
He waits grimly until he sees them coming, then wheels his
mount and takes off over the hill.
FULL SHOT - THE POSSE
as it comes up the rise and the men rein in on the crest.
Jorgensen stares and his face mirrors shock and dismay.
The other men look down into the long valley on the far side
with equally grim expressions.
ETHAN
Call that young fool back!
Jorgensen doesn't even seem to hear him. Angrily Ethan whips
out revolver and fires into the air. Then he swings his arm
in a come-back gesture. He rides out ahead then a short
distance and dismounts... and slowly the others follow.
We see now, the bodies of a few bulls stiffening in the sun.
Ethan goes to the nearest one. A feathered lance is driven
into it. He pulls the lance out. Mose comes over beside him.
ETHAN
(angrily)
Caddo or Kiowa, huh?... Ain't but
one tribe uses a lance like that!
He hands the lance to Mose.
MOSE
(almost a whisper)
Ay-he... Comanch!
Brad rides in -- shrill with anger.
BRAD
Killed every one -- an' not for food
either... Why'd they do a thing like
that?
ETHAN
Stealing the cattle was just to pull
us out... This here's a murder raid...
(facing Jorgensen)
It shapes up to scald out either
your place... or my brother's.
Jorgensen wilts and casts an anguished look back over the
miles they have ridden.
JORGENSEN
Mama!... Oh please... please no...
BRAD!
And with that one word, Jorgensen calls upon his son to follow
and they take off... fast. Ed Nesby and Charlie MacCorry
follow. Sam Clayton pauses.
CLAYTON
Jorgensen's place is closest... If
they're not there, we'll come straight
on!
Then he too rides. Martin swings his horse back to where
Ethan and Mose still are standing.
MARTIN
Well, come on!
ETHAN
Easy!
(he starts toward his
horse)
It's forty miles, sonny... Horses
can do with some grain and a little
rest.
MOSE
Comanch generally hits at moonrise.
MARTIN
Moonrise!... It'll be midnight
before... I ain't waitin'...!
He wheels his horse and goes tearing to catch up with the
others. Ethan shrugs and stoically takes grain bag to feed
his horse. Mose does the same.
MOSE
Wisht it was Caddoes... or Kiowas...
(shakes his head)
Comanche...
Ethan just gives him an angry look and then ruthlessly begins
discarding every bit of unnecessary equipment from his saddle.
WIPE TO:
Nothing moves. Nothing could be more tranquil. The shadows
are long. A thin wisp of smoke rises from the chimney. And
then Debbie's little dog trots around the side of the house
out into the yard.
He comes to a standstill and his nose is working. He begins
to make excited little sounds deep in his belly.
Then he lies down, muzzle between his paws, watching,
listening.
ON PORCH
Aaron is slowly scanning the terrain.
AARON
(to Ben)
Mind you sweep up them shavin's.
BEN
Yes, Pa...
(undertone -- man to
man)
An' if you see any sage-hens, I'm
ready.
Aaron stares as the boy shifts a fold of blanket, or whatever,
by his side -- to disclose Ethan's cavalry sabre. Aaron smiles
and rubs the youngster's head, then sets out across the yard.
Debbie's dog rises at Aaron's approach and joins his master
as they set out across the plain.
AARON
He is walking through the scrub and brush grass, every sense
alive and straining. He pauses every three or four strides --
casting each quadrant in turn. Once he whips, gun ready, as
a sage-hen or quail whirrs up not far from him. He smiles
grimly as he watches it fly away. He keeps on.
Martha comes to stand in the doorway. Ben doesn't look at
her. His eyes -- like hers -- are fixed on the figure of the
man.
BEN
(quietly)
It's all right, ma... I been
watchin'...
Only I wish...
MARTHA
(quietly)
What, Ben?
BEN
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't
you, ma?
She doesn't answer. Lucy comes to the door.
LUCY
Mother, I can't see what I'm doing!...
MARTHA
NOT YET, LUCY!...
He stands on the near slope of a rise and then gradually
moves toward its summit, so that only head will be
silhouetted. He drops to one knee, half-leaning against the
slope and slowly looks out... The CAMERA PANS very slowly,
following his careful sweep of the terrain.
The scene is entirely peaceful.
with narrowed eyes slowly scanning the ground. Suddenly the
head whips right. We hear a bird's sharp call.
It is taking flight, sweeping away in erratic arcs.
He squints closely at the ground from which the bird had
flown. Then slowly his eyes range toward the left.
Across the meadow, a shadow seems to touch the grass and at
once a covey of quail takes off, whirring loud. Aaron waits
no longer, but slides down the slope and starts running at a
crouch for the house, stopping every so often to look
backward.
SUNSET
NOTE TO W. HOCH: What J.F. has in mind for this and the
following scenes is the same kind of dramatic use of red you
achieved in "Yellow Ribbon" in the scene telling of Custer's
defeat.
They are standing in the ruddy glare of the sunset and Ben
has Ethan's sabre in his hand. We hear Aaron coming at a
run, breathing hard. Ben takes a step as though to go to
him, but Martha's hand at once is on his shoulder. Aaron
gains the porch.
AARON
In the house, boy... and...
He puts finger to his lips, sign for Ben to say nothing.
Ben nods and goes inside. Aaron and Martha face each other,
the question large on her face. Slowly he nods the
confirmation of her fears, then gently propels her ahead of
him through the door.
This should be an expansive view to convey the fact that the
posse has split -- the main group heading for the Jorgensen
place, Martin forking off to race alone for the Edwards ranch.
Coming toward and passing CAMERA is Martin, riding all out.
Several hundred yards away and moving in a divergent direction
are the others -- Brad and Charlie, Sam, Jorgensen and Ed
Nesby. The men are not compactly bunched, but strung out,
each taking his own best course and his own speed... As the
riders pass and the dust of their passing, we see two other
riders -- Ethan and Mose -- minute specks in the distance,
possibly a mile or two behind.
(NOTE TO W. HOCH: What we are trying to get here is that
moment of swift transition from twilight to night; of riders
briefly touched with the last colors of day and then, as
they pass, becoming one with blue shadows of night.)
Ethan and Mose are holding their mounts to a jog, in marked
contrast to the all-out pace of the others. The CAMERA PANS
after them as the dark fingers of the night stretch across
the valley. The wind begins to rise and somewhere off in the
hills a coyote pack yaps.
DISSOLVE TO:
NIGHT
Nothing stirs and we hear nothing. Then, with faintest little
rustle, Debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow
between the two graves and lies there face down, pressed
against Topsy. She becomes one with the earth and the
stillness. And then the moonlight strikes the tips of the
scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by, the moonlight reveals
something glittering -- like beads. And the CAMERA from that
ground-level shot
RAISES QUICKLY TO:
CLOSE SHOT - FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE - SCAR
The Comanche we are later to know as SCAR is painted for war --
tall, savage, mockingly looking down at what we know is the
child's hiding place... And in that instant, from a dozen
quarters and a dozen throats, sounds the wild yammer of the
warwhoop!
DISSOLVE TO:
OMITTED
He stands beside his spent and fallen horse. Its breathing
is a rasping whistle. Martin tries to haul its head up.
Useless. Breathing hard himself, his face ashen in the
moonlight, Martin looks desperately off in the direction of
the ranch. Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard --
struggling with it because it is under the horse. He freezes
then -- listening... And we hear the steady beat of two
horsemen approaching. Martin knows who they are and his face
is alive with hope. He gets the rifle free at last and goes
running toward the oncoming riders.
MARTIN
(shouting)
Ethan!... Ethan!
The CAMERA SWINGS with him and we see Ethan and Mose
approaching at the same steady gait.
MARTIN
(waving)
Uncle Ethan... it's me... Martin!
Ethan doesn't slacken, nearly rides him down.
ETHAN
Out of my way!
Martin goes sprawling to his hands and knees. Mose continues
without slowing.
MOONLIGHT
MARTIN
(desperately)
Mose! Wait!...
He goes running, stumbling after the riders -- desperately
calling to them...
MARTIN
Ethan!... Mose!...
And then at the crest of the rising ground, he stops --
We see in the distance the glow of a fire leading from the
barns and the hayricks and the house of Aaron Edwards.
Martin runs down the slope.
(NOTE TO W. HOCH: Here again that use of red is suggested.)
The ANGLE is past the porch uprights toward Mose and Ethan
as they ride in. Little tongues of fire are licking the edges
of the uprights. A few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are
burning along their shafts. Beyond are the glowing ashes of
the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral.
There are no bodies in evidence... The red glow of the burning
is on the faces of the men as they dismount.
Ethan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing
arrows as he heads to the door. He stops there -- and what
he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump.
Slowly then -- and removing his hat -- he goes in. Mose
shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks
back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with
senile grief. We hear a splintered door crash from its hinges
within the room and Ethan's muffled voice calling through
the house:
ETHAN (O.S.)
Lucy?... Deborah? Lucy?
He strides back through the main room and out onto the porch
just as Martin comes at a shambling run across the yard.
Ethan takes a few steps out toward him. Martin would pass
him, but Ethan grabs his arm.
ETHAN
(harshly)
You stay out!
Martin tries to fight his arm free.
ETHAN
Nothing for you to see.
MARTIN
Leggo...
Ethan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw. Martin
goes down -- out cold. And only now do we understand how
merciful the blow was as Ethan looks compassionately at the
fallen figure.
ETHAN
Don't let him go in there, Mose...
And he takes off at a stumbling run for the hilltop.
as he nears the graves.
ETHAN
(calling)
Lucy -- Lucy!
He runs in, looking around him. He sees the little dog, dead
on the ground. And then he sees a shadowed something:
The shawl Debbie had worn. It is spread out, almost as though
concealing a body. Fearfully he stoops and pulls it away...
There is nothing there, but the shawl. He drops to his knees,
his head bowed, his face tortured. The moonlight is clear on
the face of the nearer headboard. It is of weathered wood
and the chiselled letters on it read:
HERE LIES
MARY JANE EDWARDS
KILLED BY COMANCHES
MAY 12, 1852
a good WIFE & MOTHER In her 41st year
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
The funeral is begun. In the foreground are three newly-
made crosses at the head of as many open graves -- which we
need not see. With head bared, Sam Clayton is concluding his
prayer. Near him stand the Jorgensen family: Mrs.
Jorgensen,
Lars and LAURIE -- blonde, just beginning to reach her
maturity -- and a stepping-stone of tow-headed children.
CLAYTON
...and to Your keeping we commend
the souls of Aaron... Martha... and
Benjamin Edwards...
Mrs. Jorgensen and Laurie -- impelled by the same feminine
sympathy and interest -- turn to look at Ethan and Martin.
The PANNING CAMERA picks them up...Ethan standing dry-eyed,
looking at the grave of Martha; Martin -- with bruised lip --
looking out across the plain.
Clayton now opens his small, well-worn Bible to a marked
page.
CLAYTON
Man that is born of woman is of few
days and full of trouble...
Ethan looks at him, angrily, impatiently.
CLAYTON
He cometh forth like a...
ETHAN
(harshly)
Amen!... Put an 'amen' to it!
CLAYTON
...like a flower and is cut down...
Amen!
ETHAN ET AL.
Amen!
Ethan turns on his heel and walks -- CAMERA PANNING -- to
where Ed Nesby has been holding the horses. Brad is already
mounting. Mose is there too and Charlie MacCorry.
Silhouetted
against the dawn light are the rifles in each man's saddle
scabbard. Clayton is right behind Ethan.
CLAYTON
Charlie--you and Brad ride point!
...Don't get too far ahead...
The young riders spur out.
JORGENSEN
Ethan is about to mount when Mrs. Jorgensen comes up and
catches his arm.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Ethan...
(he turns impatiently)
Those girls mean as much to me as
though they were my own... Maybe you
don't know my Brad's been sittin' up
with Lucy... and my Laurie's real
fond of Martin...
Ethan glances back at where Martin and Laurie are standing.
ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING LAURIE AND MARTIN
The girl is looking at Martin full of compassion, tries to
console him by taking his arm and squeezing it as he stares
blindly at the graves and Jorgensen stolidly beginning the
work of shovelling them full.
Ethan looks back at her -- stone-faced.
ETHAN
(impatiently)
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the
point, ma'am.
MRS. JORGENSEN
I am... I am... It's just that I
know Martha'd want you to think of
her boys as well as her girls... And
if the girls are... dead... Ethan,
don't let the boys waste their lives
in vengeance!
Ethan shrugs his arm free and mounts.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Promise me, Ethan!
He ignores her and turns angrily to where Martin is.
ETHAN
(harshly)
Come on, if you're comin'...
He digs spurs and rides out with the others. Martin comes
over, with Laurie a step behind. His face is set, his eyes
almost unseeing.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(a heartbroken murmur)
Oh, Martin... Martin...
MARTIN
We'll find them, Mrs. Jorgensen...
We'll find them...
He swings into his saddle. Laurie impulsively runs to his
side, steps onto the toe of his stirruped boot and pulls
herself up to his level to kiss him hard and full upon the
mouth.
He looks at her dully, as though hardly conscious of it. And
she is back beside her mother. Martin rides away after the
others.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(slowly)
I almost hope they don't find them!
Laurie looks at her mother and understands.
CUT TO:
61-A
The SEARCH THEME begins as we see the riders in turn.
A series of portraits of the men.
CLOSE SHOT - BRAD AND CHARLIE - riding point, they come to a
pause, surveying the terrain ahead. Charlie, with an arm
signal, indicates he will take the left. Brad nods and he
rides out to the right.
THE MAIN BODY OF THE MEN, Clayton passing first, expression
resolute, competent... Then Ed Nesby and old Mose, squinting
at the ground as they ride, all but sniffing like an old
hound dog.
63A
MARTIN - Next to last in file. Finally:
63B
ETHAN - His face a study of relentless purpose.
WIPE TO:
OMITTED.
The two men are at a cairn of rocks -- their horses nearby.
In the near distance, Clayton is leading the men of the search
party at a fast clip toward the cairn. Charlie is standing,
Brad tearing the rock cairn apart. In Charlie's hands is a
Comanche head-dress of polished buffalo horn and feathers.
Brad doesn't even look up as the men ride in and dismount,
but continues his grim work of uncovering the buried Indian.
CLAYTON
Another one, eh?
CHARLIE
This 'un come a long way 'fore he
died.
CLAYTON
Well, that's seven we can score up
to your brother, Ethan.
NESBY
I don't like it.
CLAYTON
What don't you like?
NESBY
Injun's on a raid generly hides their
dead so you won't know how many
they've lost... If they don't care
about us knowin', it only spells one
thing... they ain't afraid of us
followin' -- or of us catchin' up
with 'em either.
ETHAN
You can back out any time, Nesby.
NESBY
Didn't say that...
(angrily indicating
Brad)
What's he doin' that for...
CHARLIE
He wants to be sure...
Brad shifts another rock and Looks grimly upon the face (O.S.)
of the dead Comanche. Then he spits at it and stands.
BRAD
(grim)
Let's get along...
ETHAN
(to Brad)
Why don't you finish the job?
With that he strides to the cairn, whipping a knife out. he
crouches over the body (O.S.) concealing what he is doing,
he bends to his bloody task.
Sam Clayton crosses to stand behind him.
CLAYTON
(gravely)
What good does that do?
ETHAN
By what you preach... none!
He stands now and he faces Sam.
ETHAN
But by what the Comanche believe --
now he can't enter the spirit land,
but has got to wander forever between
the winds... because I took his mangy
scalp!
He flings the scalp down and grinds it into the dirt with
his heel... He wipes clean the blade of his knife as he
crosses back to his horse. The men mount (those who have
dismounted) and they ride off.
DISSOLVE TO:
OMITTED
Brad is looking out into the night -- strain and tension in
every line. Beyond them we may see some of the other men --
sitting or sprawled on the ground near a sheltered fire.
BRAD
(a whisper)
If only she's alive... I'll make it
up to her... No matter what's
happened... I'll make her forget...
She's just got to be alive...
Ethan crosses behind them carrying his blanket roll. He looks
at them sourly.
ETHAN
Get some rest!
They move off, heading for their blankets. The CAMERA HOLDS
on Ethan as he rolls up his blanket and turns on his side.
He fishes a miniature out of his pocket and gravely studies
it by the light of the flickering little fire.
70-A
CLOSE SHOT - THE MINIATURE - NIGHT
It is a picture of Martha. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show
Ethan studying it gravely, then putting it away and lying
back to stare broodingly into the night.
DISSOLVE TO:
SUNSET
The four faces are just over the ridge, peering at something
far distant, far below.
MOSE
Could be a buffler...
BRAD
It's horses, I tell ya...
ETHAN
It's them all right...
He starts to squirm down the ridge, the others following.
Ethan's group crosses to where the other men are waiting
with the horses.
ETHAN
They're camped by the river -- 'bout
twenty miles from here.
Soon's it
gets dark we'll circle out so's to
jump 'em before daybreak.
CLAYTON
(slowly)
You're right sure you want to jump
'em, Ethan?
Martin and Brad stare at Sam -- not understanding the
question. But Mose knows what he means and studiously looks
into space.
ETHAN
(touch of defiance)
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
CLAYTON
I thought we were trying to get the
girls back -- alive... We jump those
Comanches, they'll kill 'em... You
know that!
BRAD
(bewildered, angry)
But... but what are we doin' then?...
What are we supposed to do?
CLAYTON
What I had in mind was runnin' off
their hoss herd... A Comanche on
foot is more apt to be willin' to
listen...
NESBY
That makes sense to me.
MARTIN
Yeah...
ETHAN
(angrily)
What do you know about it?... What's
a quarter-breed Cherokee know about
the Comanche trick of sleeping with
his best pony tied right beside him...
You got as much chance of stampedin'
their herd as...
CLAYTON
...as you have of findin' those girls
alive by ridin' into 'em...
I say
we do it my way, Ethan... and that's
an order!
ETHAN
Yes, sir... But if you're wrong,
Captain Clayton, don't ever give me
another!
They look into each other's eyes a moment, then Sam turns to
mount... and the others follow. Slowly then they start riding
down the slope.
DISSOLVE TO:
SEARCHERS - DAWN MIST EFFECT
(NOTE: It is now planned to shoot this on sound stage.)
Fog and heavy morning mist rise from the swamp. Some cattails
in the near ground. The effect is eerie, very still except
for the trilling of frogs. Then, very quietly, the men emerge
from the mist swirling around them. They are leading their
horses. Sam looks baffled, angry. They stand still, listening --
then slowly continue.
(SOUND STAGE)
The mist is thinning. In the f.g. is a small blackened area --
the ashes of a campfire. The men come through the mist --
wary, vigilant. It is Mose who first spots the fire. He runs
to it and drops beside and feels the ashes.
The others come up around him.
MOSE
Ay-he... They was here...
ETHAN
(to Sam)
SURE!... They WERE here... Now they're
out there... an' waitin' to jump
us!...
He looks at Clayton.
ETHAN
You got any more orders, Captain?
CLAYTON
(quietly)
Just keep goin'...
They move on, slowly.
74-A
The mist is thinning as the men warily move along.
Suddenly there is the faint hoot of an owl from behind and
to one side... the men turn slightly, hearing it... A moment
later another owl hoot, from the same side but up ahead.
From the interchange of looks, we must know that the riders
are aware of its significance. Mose cups hand to his mouth
and he hoots in exact imitation of the other calls. Clayton
glares at him.
MOSE
(in soft apology)
Jus' bein' sociable, Cap'n...
Ethan grins wryly. And now the first, faint, ruddy touch of
the sun hits the slowly moving horsemen and begins to burn
through the mist.
74-B
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS from a sun-touched butte or crag to
the file of men slowly walking their horses. An occasional
shred of mist drifts by. Everything about the little cavalcade
bespeaks tension, watchfulness. Suddenly -- and every man
sees it at the same time -- we see a file of eight Comanches
ride slowly out of a canyon at a distance, walking their
horses at the same pace and on a course roughly parallel
with, but slightly converging on, our group.
CLAYTON
(softly)
Keep goin'...
Brad, who has been looking up ahead, sounds a new warning.
BRAD
(tensely)
Look!
CLAYTON
Easy!
74-C
Another Indian file of eight angles out of a different canyon
and begins to cut in toward the group -- riding slowly, very
quietly. Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly
away from the converging files, but still riding slowly. And
then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group
seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing
the gap.
ETHAN
(to Clayton)
If you were tryin' to surround 'em,
you sure succeeded.
CLAYTON
How far's the river from here, Mose?
MOSE
I been baptized, Reverend... yes
suh, been baptized, thank ye...
CLAYTON
Well, you better brace yourself for
another one... Ya-HEE!
And with that yell, he drives spurs and cuts sharply at an
angle to the converging Indian files -- and every man is
with him. In the next instant, the Comanches whoop and give
chase.
74-D
with the Ranger group short-cutting in such a way as to
outstrip the Comanche horsemen in a mad dash for the river.
74-E
Clayton flings his hand up in a signal to halt as the Rangers
reach the bank. They rein in, wheel their horses and are
reaching for the rifles as the Comanche vanguard races into
view -- to find themselves opposed by seven veterans, sitting
their horses, rifles at their shoulders.
The charge breaks as the seven rifles bark, almost in unison --
and the Indians wheel to shelter.
CLAYTON
YA-HEE!
And once again he spins his mount and takes off, across the
river, followed by the others.
74-F
As the men pound across.
74-G
They dismount and Charlie and Nesby take the horses and run
them to some place of protection as the men group around
Clayton and Ethan. During this:
CLAYTON
(shouting his orders)
This is as good as any... Charlie,
you and Ed take the horses...
Mose runs over and crouches beside Ethan. Beyond Ethan is
Martin, then Brad... Nesby and Charlie will rejoin the group
after an appropriate interval... with all the men shielded
behind river boulders, etc.
AND BRAD BEYOND
Ethan and Mose are hunkered down behind some rocks, very
casual and business-like as they check rifles, set out and
carefully wipe cartridges.
MOSE
(chattily)
Minds me o' the time Joe Powers an'
me fit us some Kiowas...
Martin is in the throes of buck-fever, wiping mouth with
back of his hand, peering anxiously across the river.
MARTIN
You think they mean to charge us,
Uncle Ethan...?
MOSE
...We found us an ole buffler
wallow...
BRAD
(staring across river)
Criminy!
On the opposite bank, we see the full force of Comanches
riding into sight -- racing their mounts to the edge, then
wheeling off -- jeering, taunting. Brad starts to bring up
his rifle.
ETHAN
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want
to miss... It makes them think their
medicine's stronger than yours...
MOSE
Ay-he... That's jest what I tole Joe
Powers... That un's gettin' kinda
sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
One Comanche rides a few yards into the water, brandishing
his rifle, taunting the white men. A moment later he is joined
by a second brave.
ETHAN
(grimly)
Real sassy.
He and Mose slowly bring their rifles to bear -- and then
the two shots crack out almost simultaneously. And within
split seconds both Comanches fall. The others race away.
Sam comes charging over to Ethan and Mose.
CLAYTON
(angrily)
I didn't give any order to fire!
ETHAN
That's all right, Captain... I don't
need any formal invitation to kill a
Comanch...
CLAYTON
(grimly)
You got one now!
And he drops behind a rock as, with a wild whooping, the
Comanche forces swing from their places of hiding and hit
the river. The men open fire, all but Martin, who has frozen,
staring wild-eyed at the oncoming Comanches.
Brad, Charlie, Clayton, Nesby are snapping shot after shot.
Only Martin seems out of it. Ethan shoots him a glance.
ETHAN
Slack your shoulders... Slack 'em...
Your hands'll take care of
themselves...
Some of the tension leaves Martin. Somehow his gun is in
position and he is firing as fast and well as the others.
77-A
The Comanches are coming in, crouched low over their ponies'
necks, whooping and firing. Men and horses go down, counted
off by the expert marksmanship of the Texans. But they keep
coming.
77-B
They drop their rifles now and pull out revolvers for close-
range work. One Comanche breaks through from the side, his
buffalo lance ready for the thrust. Ethan whirls and fires.
The Comanche horse charges through the defense line and out
and there is a muffled scream of pain from Ed Nesby.
77-C
The charge breaks and Comanches wheel left and right, racing
back across the river. With magnificent horsemanship, one
brave rides to an unhorsed warrior crouched in the shallows
and swings him up behind. Two others, riding together, head
for one of the two dead Comanches Ethan and Mose had downed
on their first shots. Swinging simultaneously from their
saddles, they grab the dead man and carry him off.
77-D
MOSE
(cackling)
There goes yer scalp, Ethan!...
Ethan snuggles his rifle to his shoulder as two other racing
Comanches prepare to pick up the other dead Indian. Most of
the Comanches have regained the far bank now and are racing
away. The firing from the Texans has stopped.
ETHAN
I still got one out there.
OMITTED
The angle is along his rifle barrel as it beads on one of
the racing Comanches trying to pick up the dead Indian.
Clayton's big hand grasps the rifle barrel.
CLAYTON'S VOICE
(quietly)
No, Ethan.
Ethan looks up into Clayton's face.
CLAYTON
Let them bury their dead...
Ethan pulls the gun free and looks out across the river.
The Comanches have done their work, are riding away -- and
over the saddle of one lies the limp form of the dead Indian.
Ethan looks back at Sam.
ETHAN
That tears it, Reverend... From now
on, you keep out...
(mad now -- facing
the others)
All of you!... I don't want you with
me... I don't need you... for what I
got to do!
CHARLIE
(quietly)
No need to shout, mister.
The CAMERA SWINGS to pick up the figure of Nesby outstretched
on the ground, writhing in pain; with Charlie kneeling beside
him. The men cross to stand around the fallen man.
CHARLIE
Reckon we got to go back -- Ed's
shoulder is smashed -- bad!
NESBY
I can make it... just get me on a
horse...
CLAYTON
No good, Ed... And Ethan's right...
This is a job for a company of
Rangers... or it's a job for one or
two men... Right now we're too many...
an' not enough...
BRAD
(facing Ethan)
Only one way you can stop me lookin'
for Lucy, mister... An' that's kill
me...
MARTIN
That's how I feel, Uncle Ethan...
(correcting the slip)
Ethan, sir.
Ethan glares at them, but has to accept it.
ETHAN
All right... but I'm givin' the
orders... You take 'em or we split
up here and now...
MARTIN
(quickly)
Why, sure, Ethan... There's just the
one thing we're after... finding
Deborah and Lucy...
ETHAN
(grimly -- turning
away)
If they're still alive...
He heads away, for his horse. Brad and Martin look at each
other as the full import of Ethan's footnote strikes home.
Then they head for their own horses.
OMITTED
86-A
Ethan, Martin, and Brad mount. Clayton crosses to them.
CLAYTON
You boys got enough shells?
They nod.
MARTIN
Yeah...
CLAYTON
Vaya con dios.
The three re-enter the river and slowly start across, with
Clayton gravely looking after them. The three riders continue
across the river... and the Search Theme resumes.
DISSOLVE TO:
A region of buttes and giant rock formations; treeless, arid
and seemingly reaching out to infinity. Far off we see a
cloud of dust -- miles and miles off. Only the dust, nothing
else. From behind CAMERA ride the three men -- Ethan, Brad,
and Martin -- dust-powdered, eyes bloodshot. The three are
watching that distant cloud of dust. They force their weary
horses onward.
WIPE TO:
The ANGLE is past some spectacular butte or citadel of rock
into another long reach of valley -- different from the first
view of it, yet alike in its suggestion of endlessness.
But now there is no cloud of dust far away -- nothing to
suggest the passage of anything but time itself.
Ethan, Martin, and Brad ride into the fringe of the butte's
shadow and scan the terrain ahead.
BRAD
(shrill)
They got to stop sometime... if
they're human at all, they got to
stop!
ETHAN
Naw... a human man rides a horse
till it dies... then he goes on
afoot... A Comanche comes along...
gets that horse up... and rides it
twenty more miles... Then he eats
it.
Ethan turns to catch Martin thirstily drinking from his
canteen.
ETHAN
(angrily)
Easy on that!
MARTIN
Sorry... We don't even know if Debbie
'n Lucy are with this bunch... Maybe
they split up...
ETHAN
They're with 'em -- if they're still
alive.
Brad wheels on him.
BRAD
You've said that enough!... Maybe
Lucy's dead... maybe they're both
dead... but if I hear it from you
again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
ETHAN
(an aside)
That'll be the day!... Let's ride.
WIPE TO:
OMITTED
89-A
LATE AFTERNOON
(NOTE: This is the gap in the rocks near the "Medicine
Country" at Monument.)
The three riders come to where the trail they have been
following forks... the main horseprint track leading ahead,
a lesser track heading for a narrow gap between two buttes.
MARTIN
Four of 'em cut out here... Why?
Ethan thinks he knows why. His face is bleak. But he tries
to be casual.
ETHAN
I'll take a look... You keep after
the others...
He turns his mount toward the gap.
MARTIN
(eagerly)
You want us to fire a shot if...
ETHAN
(disgustedly)
No... nor build bonfires... nor beat
drums neither. I'll meet you on the
far side.
He's still grumbling as he rides off. An abashed Martin rides
ahead along the broad trail with Brad.
(NOTE: Ethan's serape, tied behind his saddle, should be
clearly seen as he rides away -- not pointed up, but visible.)
WIPE TO:
Martin and Brad, riding in a direction opposite to that in
which they had taken off -- indicating their circle route --
haul up momentarily as they spot Ethan, standing beside his
horse, his back to them, some distance along. They turn
slightly off their course and ride out toward him.
Ethan turns, almost startled, as the two youths ride in.
His serape is no longer behind his saddle. Ethan looks at
them blankly for a minute -- as though not really seeing
them.
ETHAN
Oh... it's you.
They both stare at him.
ETHAN
(a vague gesture)
I... uh... here's where they met up
again...
They both can see that.
ETHAN
(pointing)
Trail leads off there...
They look at him and each other -- for these are clearly
unnecessary remarks and doubly surprising coming from Ethan.
BRAD
Why'd they break off?
(no answer)
Was there water in that canyon?
ETHAN
Huh...?
No... no water.
MARTIN
You all right, Ethan?
ETHAN
Huh...?
(more like his usual
gruff self)
Sure I'm all right...
He goes to his horse, mounts. Martin is right beside him and
he notes the missing serape.
MARTIN
Say!... What happened to your blanket?
Lose it?
ETHAN
Must've... Anyway, I ain't goin'
back to look for it...
He leads out. Brad rides up beside Martin. Again the two
exchange puzzled looks. Martin shrugs and the three continue
along the broad trace of the Indian ponies into the setting
sun.
DISSOLVE TO:
Ethan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so
that barely the glow of the flames can be seen. Beyond him
Martin is leading their unsaddled horses away. The men have
come to the end of another long day. Both men look up as
Brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the
incline to their camp. His horse is lathered.
BRAD
(shouting it)
I saw her!... I saw Lucy!
Martin runs to his side as Brad slides off his mount.
Ethan moves more slowly.
BRAD
(continuing)
They're camped 'bout two miles over...
I was just swingin' back when I saw
their smoke... I bellied up a ridge
an' they was right below me...
MARTIN
Did you see Debbie?
BRAD
No, but I saw Lucy all right... She
was wearin' that blue dress... an'
she was walkin' along...
ETHAN
(voice flat)
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
BRAD
It was, I tell you!
ETHAN
What you saw was a buck wearin'
Lucy's dress...
(they stare at him)
I found Lucy back there in that
canyon... I wrapped her in my blanket
an' buried her with m'own hands... I
thought it best to keep it from you --
long as I could.
He can't look at Brad or at Martin. Brad can't speak -- and
then finally:
BRAD
Did they...? Was she...?
Ethan wheels on him in shouting fury.
ETHAN
(blazing)
What've I got to do -- draw you a
picture?... Spell it out?... Don't
ever ask me!... Long as you live
don't ever ask me more!
Brad wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. He turns --
walking stiff-legged as though on stilts back to his horse.
He bends his head against the saddle, as though to hide his
grief. Martin turns away from him and walks back to Ethan.
And in that moment, Brad mounts and takes off in the same
direction from which he had ridden in.
MARTIN
(frantically)
BRAD!...
They run for their horses.
CUT TO:
92-A
BRAD
He comes pounding down a slope, and he takes off his hat and
skims it away. He rips off a neckerchief as though to relieve
the rush of raging blood.
92-B
He reaches the crest and reins in. A distant firelight is on
his face. He takes one moment to look down into the Comanche
camp o.s. Then he has his gun out. His eyes are wild, his
face wet with sweat. Then he throws back his head and he
yells -- and with the yell goes charging into the camp.
92-C
They rein in -- staring -- as from afar they hear Brad's
yell echoing and bouncing off the canyon walls. There is
nothing they can do. They hear his shouts, then the quick
bark of his .44, and the angry shouts of the Comanche.
92-D
His face is red with the reflected light of the fires he is
passing o.s. and his eyes are alight with a crazy, savage
joy. His gun cracks once, then again -- and the hammer clicks
on a spent shell.
92-E
He stands apart, warbow drawn and arrow notched. He releases
it at his running target. We hear its impact and a high gasp
of pain... and then the jubilant, yammering yells of other
Comanches.
92-F
The distant yammering of the Comanches doesn't quite drown
out one stifled scream of pain; we can surmise a scalping
knife was busy in the last instance of Brad's life. Martin
slumps in his saddle. Ethan listens a moment, then turns to
Martin.
ETHAN
Let's just hope he took some with
him...
He turns his horse back the way they had come. Martin stares
at him.
MARTIN
What you goin' to do?
ETHAN
Get some sleep... Tomorrow's another
day...
Slowly, he rides away. Slowly, reluctantly but helpless to
do otherwise, Martin follows.
DISSOLVE TO:
OMITTED
A study of horseprints etched in the soil -- the mark of the
passage of many horses; perhaps an eagle or turkey feather
fallen from a warbonnet. And then we hear and see the approach
of two plodding horses, and the dusty boots of the horsemen --
Ethan and Martin -- following the trail. The Search Theme
resumes and continues over the next three shots, helping us
suggest the passage of time, the change of scene.
The two figures are little more than specks in a vastness of
savage country.
WIPE TO:
Again we study the hooves of two horses, fighting their way
up a rocky slope and past a thorn bush on which -- fluttering
in the mountain wind -- is a torn scrap of scarlet cloth
with a bit of beadwork or Indian decoration.
WIPE TO:
OMITTED
AFTERNOON
It is a portrait study of two faces -- etched by wind and
privation and cold into tragic, fanatic masks.
Martin has aged years in a matter of months. Falling snow
flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly
beards.
MARTIN
(bitterly)
Say it. We're beat!
ETHAN
(slowly)
No... our turnin' back don't change
anything... not in the long run. If
she's alive, she's safe... for a
while... They'll keep her to raise
as one of their own, 'til she's of
an age to...
He turns his mount.
MARTIN
And you think we got a chance to
find her?
ETHAN
An Injun will chase a thing til he
thinks he's chased it enough... Then
he quits... Same when he runs...
Seems he never learns there's such a
thing as a critter that might just
keep comin' on... So we'll find them
in the end, I promise you that...
We'll find them just as sure as the
turning of the earth.
FADE OUT
OMITTED
FADE IN
TWILIGHT
The time is spring. It is a year and a half later.
The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of
sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two
separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room,
the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen
brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or
two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and
Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In
that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars
Jorgensen comes to the door.
Jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing
them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their
appearance and full of unspoken questions.
Bearing a lamp, Mrs. Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside
her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in
her eyes. Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her.
Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even
looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as
Ethan and Martin dismount.
The passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue
during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image
of Ethan. Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick
of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or
paucity of speech). Neither man is sure of his reception.
They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search;
and Martin is thinking of Laurie. And then Mrs. Jorgensen is
running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though
he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him. He stands
frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. Ethan watches
a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen.
ETHAN
(to Jorgensen)
You got my letter about your son,
Brad?
JORGENSEN
Yah... Just about this time a year
ago...
MRS. JORGENSEN
It came the day before his...
birthday.
JORGENSEN
The Lord giveth--the Lord taketh
away...
Mrs. Jorgensen starts to lead the way inside. Martin hangs
back.
MARTIN
I ain't fit to go indoors, miz
Jorgensen... These clothes is...
Laurie rushes past her mother.
LAURIE
Martie!
She kisses him hard and full on the mouth -- and has no eyes
for anyone else. Mrs. Jorgensen looks on with amusement.
Martin is just bowled over.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(teasing)
And him probably forgettin' all about
you!... Probably can't even call
your name to mind.
MARTIN
(smiling)
Laurie.
And Laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother.
MARTIN
(continuing)
But I fairly forgot just how pretty
you was...
Laurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors -- and there
is no further resistance from Martin.
Mrs. Jorgensen and her husband converge then on Ethan -- and
her face is gravely questioning.
MRS. JORGENSEN
The little one?... Debbie?
Ethan shakes his head. She squeezes his arm reassuringly and
they start indoors.
DISSOLVE TO:
It is a still scene, with the first light of day in the sky,
a thin plume of smoke rising from the chimney.
MORNING
ANGLING from behind Laurie in the doorway as Martin, riding
one horse, leading another, goes galloping away.
Low, squat adobe structure, with a crudely lettered sign-
board proclaiming it:
'JEREM. FUTTERMAN, TRADER'
There are adjacent outbuildings and corral. Four horses are
tied outside, two being pack animals. A surly-looking white
man or breed sits in a stool tilted back near the door,
whittling with a long-bladed knife, eyeing the horses
covetously. He glances aside and glares as a squaw shuffles
along bearing a clumsy load of faggots on her bowed back.
MAN
Andale! Andale!
Fearfully she quickens her step. The man gets up, shoves
knife into belt and heads into the post.
They have set up camp near a cluster of cottonwoods to which
the horses have been tied. One of the horses is restless,
possibly nickering. Ethan strokes its neck, looking out
thoughtfully into the night -- listening.
MARTIN'S VOICE
Acts like somethin's out there.
ETHAN
(heading toward
campfire)
Smells a change in the weather...
CAMERA PANS him to where Martin is spreading his blanket
some little distance from the small fire.
ETHAN
Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't
have a frost 'fore mornin'... Here...
(he picks up a saddle
and puts it close to
fire)
Whyn't you bed down closer to the
fire, boy?
Martin is a bit surprised as Ethan takes the blanket and
spreads it near the saddle -- making the saddle serve as a
pillow. Then Ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry
wood on the fire, making it blaze up.
MARTIN
Hey! What's the idea...?
ETHAN
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper --
my bones is cold tonight...
He spreads his own blanket as Martin wraps into his bedroll,
and when Martin turns, he casually arranges the blanket to
suggest it is over the figure of a man. During this:
MARTIN
Funny... When we passed through Fort
Wingate last winter, we didn't hear
mention of any Nawyecky Comanche
there...
Ethan steps back -- and studies the "dummy."
ETHAN
Not so funny... if you recollect
what 'Nawyecka' means...
MARTIN
What's that?
Ethan studies Martin's back -- the light on him -- and looks
around figuring the range of fire.
ETHAN
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a
man says he's goin' one place when
he means to go just the reverse...
MARTIN
(drowsily)
Oh...
ETHAN
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Martin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket. Ethan
nods his satisfaction -- sure Martin isn't going to change
positions. Then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them
to complete the dummy. He picks up his rifle then and quietly
walks out of the camp.
CUT TO:
MEN - NIGHT
Three shadowy figures -- Futterman and his two henchmen --
are quietly dismounting, taking rifles from saddle scabbards.
At a hand signal from Futterman, they quietly fan out afoot.
still snug in his blankets, sound asleep; the fire burning a
little lower but still shedding plenty of light on him.
HIS HENCHMEN
At a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some
rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the
camp. Martin is asleep and next to him is Ethan's dummy, hat
over its face, and the fire still burning. The two henchmen
snake their rifles up to a firing position. A shot cracks...
and one man is knocked flat on his face.
The other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle
swinging in search of a target. A second shot splits the
night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist...
Martin is sitting up now, staring wildly around. Futterman
starts to run down-slope, away from the hidden marksman,
dodging between the rocks. A third shot catches him in the
back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into
the firepit camp area. Martin is on his feet now.
He is staring at Futterman, face down and almost at his feet.
He looks around in fear at someone approaching -- hand going
to his gun. Then he relaxes as Ethan casually enters the
camp, bareheaded, carrying his rifle.
ETHAN
Thanks... you did just fine...
Ethan kneels beside Futterman, turns him over, reaches into
his pockets -- first one, then another.
MARTIN
(dazed)
Futterman?
ETHAN
He just couldn't wait...
MARTIN
(watching him go
through pockets)
Whatchu doin'?...
Ethan grins satisfiedly as he straightens and spins the gold
piece in the air, catches it and pockets it.
ETHAN
Even got my twenty dollars back...
We did all right.
And now Martin is getting the whole picture... and he's mad.
MARTIN
WE?... You just used me for bait --
staked me out like a... buildin' up
the fire... fixin' it so's... I coulda
had my brains blowed out!
Ethan is just grinning at him -- completely unruffled, denying
none of it.
MARTIN
(explosively)
Suppose you'd missed!
Ethan sobers a little, seems honestly surprised.
ETHAN
Never occurred to me...
DISSOLVE TO:
It is a day in early winter. Charlie MacCorry, short-coated,
is galloping across the yard as Jorgensen crosses it --
carrying a load of firewood.
CHARLIE
(calling it)
Howdy, Mister Jorgensen...
JORGENSEN
Charlie...
MacCorry swings off his saddle near the porch, as the door
opens and Mrs. Jorgensen comes out -- shawled against the
cold.
CHARLIE
Got a letter here...
Jorgensen lets the cordwood drop...
JORGENSEN
By golly! A letter?
CHARLIE
For Miss Laurie...
MRS. JORGENSEN
Come in, Charlie, come in...

LAURIE!... My land!... Two letters

leading their pack animals. Martin's voice picks up the
narration.
MARTIN'S VOICE
Soon we was meeting up with Kiowas
an' Wichitas an' even some Comanches
camped by one of the agencies...
WIPE TO:
WIDE ANGLE - A COMANCHE ENCAMPMENT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY
FALL WEATHER (SILENT)
The camp is on the outskirts of a trading post. Indians watch
unsmilingly from tepees, or in little clusters afoot; a few
mounted braves ride on parallel courses as Ethan and Martin
ride through camp toward the post.
MARTIN'S VOICE
But none of them was Nawyecky's nor
claimed to know a war chief named
Scar... He's the one the late Mister
Futterman said had Debbie...
WIPE TO:
INDIAN - EARLY WINTER OR FALL DAY
Ethan is ceremoniously pinning something on the stern-faced
buck. It is one of the rosettes seen in the shoebox.
CAMERA MOVES to an extreme CLOSEUP of the rosette. On it, in
gold letters, is:
FIRST AWARD
LARD TYPE HOG
DAY
As the Indian proudly steps back, we see beyond him a half
dozen other braves -- all rosetted. Ethan looks them over
complacently while Martin -- to hide the smile that threatens
to split his face -- bends to pick up a huge bundle of furs.
WIPE TO:
FALL OR EARLY WINTER - DAY
"LOOK" is somewhat under five feet tall, pigeon-toed, platter-
faced and wide-eyed. Over her arm is a very handsome blanket.
She is coming forward shyly toward Martin, propelled by a
Comanche -- her father. Martin, with an armful of trade goods --
a few yards of bright calico, a couple of AGED SOW rosettes
and some trinkets -- is indicating the blanket. Look glances
shyly at her father.
He shakes his head negatively. Look is disappointed.
The father points to Martin's pile of trade goods. Martin
bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered
high-crowned beaver hat. The Indian grunts his approval and
puts it on. Look looks relieved. Martin reaches for the
blanket. Look takes a quick step backward and holds up one
finger: wait! Then she runs back through the other Comanches
now crowding forward.
INCLUDING ETHAN
who rides in slowly, leading their pack horse and Martin's
horse.
ETHAN
(quietly)
Let's go... I think I stumbled onto
somethin'...
MARTIN
(eagerly)
Scar?
The name registers with some of the nearer braves. There is
a quick interchange of glances, frowning, hostile.
ETHAN
(angrily)
When are you goin' to learn to keep
your mouth shut! Come on.
Let's get
out of here.
MARTIN
But I just bought a good blanket.
ETHAN
(curtly)
Forget it...
Martin mounts and the two ride out. The Comanches stare after
them suspiciously, resentfully.
SHOT - EARLY WINTER DAY
They are riding down a slight grade beyond which (we can
assume) is the Comanche camp.
ETHAN
What I heard back there was that a
band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through
this way less'n two weeks ago...
MARTIN
(excitedly)
Think it might be...?
He breaks and both turn as Look rides over the hill on a
little spotted Indian pony, with her squaw-bag slung up behind
her and her blanket over the saddle. She closes the gap
between them.
ETHAN
What's she followin' for?
Look smiles shyly at Martin.
MARTIN
Look, I changed my mind... You can
keep your blanket.
He gestures for her to go back.
MARTIN
Go on back...
She stares and then dutifully wheels her horse. Martin and
Ethan face front again. Look wheels her horse again and is
right with them. Martin stops - exasperated.
MARTIN
Look... you don't understand...
(he waves her away)
I don't want it.
Look just sits.
ETHAN
(explosively)
YOU don't understand, ya chunkhead!
You didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought
her!
MARTIN
(aghast)
What?
ETHAN
You got yourself a wife, sonny!
MARTIN
(a wail)
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go
back...
ETHAN
And have her whole family after our
scalps for floutin' one o' their
women?... No sir! Come on, Mrs.
Pauley...
Look smiles and sets her horse in motion as Ethan moves ahead.
Martin's face is a mask of comic despair as he gives up. He
is mouthing the words --
MARTIN
Mrs... Pauley?
And Ethan suddenly breaks into song; to the tune of "Skip To
My Lou:"
ETHAN
(singing)
I got another gal purtier'n you.
I
got another gal purtier'n you.
I
got another gal purtier'n you.
Skip
to my Lou, my darlin'.
DISSOLVE TO:
Ethan is wrapped in his blanket roll, head propped by an
elbow, grinning sardonically as he watches a strange ritual
in the camp. The score is softly reprising "Skip to my Lou."
Look is standing with her blanket folded over one arm, her
head shyly downcast, not far from where Martin (back to her)
is spreading his own bed roll. He sits on it then and begins
pulling off his boots. He is very conscious of Ethan's
watchful scrutiny. Finally he is ready. He lies back on his
blanket. At once Look is at his side to spread her own
blanket. Martin sits bolt upright and tugs his blanket free
and wraps it protectively around him. She stares at him,
puzzled.
MARTIN
Water!...
(in Comanche)
Pah!
She nods her understanding, hurries off to fetch a canteen.
Martin glares at Ethan.
ETHAN
That's the way to train 'em. Looks
like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you
a fine beautiful wife...
MARTIN
Cut it out, will ya...
Look returns with the canteen, hands it to Martin and kneels
beside him. He looks at her sympathetically.
MARTIN
Look... I wish I could explain to
you.
And now Look speaks for the first time. She indicates herself.
LOOK
Look?...
Now she jabbers in Comanche and, at the appropriate time,
will point to the sky and imitate a bird flying.
LOOK
Nay tzare T'sala-ta-komal-ta-name...
unt kang-yah Look.
(which means)
(My father calls me Wild Goose Flying
in the Night Sky... but you call me
'Look').
Martin looks blank, but Ethan chuckles.
ETHAN
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in
the Night Sky... but she'll answer
to Look since it pleases ya...
MARTIN
(blankly)
Look?
She nods and smiles and quickly settles alongside him and
spreads her blanket over them both. Martin recoils, plants
his foot in the small of her back and sends her sprawling.
Ethan busts a gut laughing. Martin jumps to his feet, angrily.
MARTIN
(hotly)
I don't think it's so funny... If
you want to do some good, whyn't you
ask her where Scar is?
Ethan stares at the girl. Her face is suddenly impassive as
she looks from Martin to the ground.
ETHAN
(grimly)
She heard ya-all right... An' she
knows...
He gets to his feet and he crosses to stand before her. So
does Martin.
ETHAN
Unt osupanet cah-nay Scar?
(meaning)
(You know where Scar
is?)
She stares sullenly, not answering.
ETHAN
You ask her!
MARTIN
Look!
(she faces him)
Scar?...
(sign talk)
Do you know where he went? And if he
has a girl with him... a white girl --
nai-bist pabo taibo...
She stands... She indicates Martin. She indicates herself.
LOOK
Mah nee-koo-ur?
(meaning)
(Your woman?)
MARTIN
(shaking head)
No... not my wife... My...
(to Ethan)
How do you say sister?
ETHAN
(in Comanche)
Nami.
She looks gravely from Ethan to Martin. Then, with impassive
face, she bends swiftly, picks up her blanket and walks away
from them to choose her own sleeping place. The two men don't
know what to make of it.
DISSOLVE TO:
MORNING
It is the same scene the following morning. The men are
standing above where Look had bedded for the night, looking
at the ground. Clearly marked on the hard ground is a crudely
drawn arrow.
MARTIN
Beats me how she could get that pony
out o' camp without neither of us
hearin' a thing...
ETHAN
She ain't goin' back to her family,
that's certain... not if she took
off where the arrow points.
MARTIN
Think she means for us to follow?
ETHAN
How should I know... She's YOUR wife!
He walks toward their horses, starts to saddle up.
Martin follows.
MARTIN
I think maybe we oughta...
ETHAN
(hiding a grin)
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say
that... Bein' a new husband and all...
And Ethan starts singing "Skip to My Lou" half under his
breath. Martin gives him a sour side-glance and continues
saddling.
DISSOLVE TO:
FOOTAGE)
The two men are picking their way through a snow-mantled
grove. Martin's voice resumes the narration.
MARTIN'S VOICE
Ethan's always been throwing it up
to me that I'm a quarter-breed... I
never figgered it made much
difference...
137-B
MARTIN'S VOICE
But this day we came on a small herd.
We needed some meat so we circled
'round...
137-C
MARTIN'S VOICE
...and came up on 'em afoot...
They
hadn't been hunted, so it was no
trick workin' in close.
137-D
The two men walk from behind CAMERA. Ethan aims, fires and
brings down a bull.
MARTIN'S VOICE
Ethan got a nice one on his first
shot, but then he began killing one
after another -- cows as well as
bulls -- fast as he could fire and
load... It was just a slaughter...
no sense to it...
137-E
Shots cracking out -- the terrified bawling of the bulls --
the beginning of the stampede.
137-F
Martin strides across to where Ethan is firing.
MARTIN
Ethan, quit it!
ETHAN
(firing again)
Nine...
(another shot)
Ten!
MARTIN
What's the sense in it!
Ethan turns and swings a backhand blow which catches Martin
by surprise and fells him.
ETHAN
(in a fury)
Hunger! -- Empty bellies! That's the
sense in it, you Cherokee!...
He swings up his gun and fires again -- and again... as Martin
stares at him from the ground.
137-G
Fear-maddened animals are swinging into full stampede fleeing
the deadly marksman. Rifle shots keep cracking out.
137-H
The thunder of the hooves is receding and Ethan grimly lowers
his rifle. Martin picks himself up -- still staring at Ethan
as though at a madman. Ethan turns and looks at him.
ETHAN
Least, THEY won't feed any Comanches
this winter... Killin' buffalo's as
good as killin' Injuns in this
country.
MARTIN
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo,
too....
ETHAN
Ain't that too bad... If you feel
that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm
surprised you didn't take up with
that squaw wife of yours...
He whips out his shinning knife and strides toward the dead
buffalo o.s. Martin looks after him with troubled expression.
Suddenly he hears something, borne faint by the wind.
MARTIN
ETHAN!
Ethan turns. Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound,
is the distant blowing of a bugle.
MARTIN
Listen!... Hear it?... There! Ain't
that a bugle... and firing?
Ethan stares -- and then the bugle sound repeats and the
distant crack of shots, from long miles off.
ETHAN
(grimly)
Just hope we ain't too late...
And the two break and run for their horses.

DAY
MARTIN'S VOICE
(as narrator)
It was all over long before we got
there and the soldiers was high-
tailin' it back to the agency with
their prisoners -- squaws mostly --
by the time Ethan and me reached the
camp...
Horses and riders plunge downslope through breast-high snow.
MARTIN'S VOICE
It was the Nawyecky Comanches all
right -- the ones we'd been looking
for all this time...
DAY
as they ride in, passing dead horses, a few bodies of men.
MARTIN'S VOICE
Trouble of it was that the soldiers
had hit when most of the fightin'
men was away -- huntin' maybe... So
most of the dead was old men and
women an' kids... And it was in one
of the tepees Ethan found her -- the
little squaw who wanted me to call
her Look...
Ethan has dismounted in front of one of the tepees, heads
inside.
Ethan stands there, his expression bleak, looking at the
scene. Martin joins him.
MARTIN
We gotta catch up with them yellow
legs... Maybe they got her with them.
Ethan isn't thinking of that at all.
ETHAN
(harshly)
And maybe they got Scar!
They start away -- fast.
DISSOLVE TO:
DAY
A long line stretching across the landscape -- women falling
and being prodded along by their captors. From behind CAMERA
ride Ethan and Martin and move to intercept the column.
as Ethan and Martin come closer and look at the shawled
prisoners stumbling along.
as a young OFFICER spurs out of the column and rides toward
them.
OFFICER
(inquiringly)
Yes?
ETHAN
We're looking for a girl -- a white
girl...
MARTIN
She'd be about thirteen now...
OFFICER
We got two around that age...
MARTIN
(eagerly)
Where?
OFFICER
You'll have to wait until we reach
the agency... Fall in behind the
column...
MARTIN
(protestingly)
But couldn't you...?
OFFICER
Sorry...
(shouting it)
Keep the column moving!... Close
ranks there!
The officer spurs out to rejoin the column. Martin looks at
Ethan, his face alive with hope. But Ethan is just looking
stonily along the line of passing prisoners.
WIPE TO:
The column of cavalry and prisoners enters the agency
(COLORADO FOOTAGE). We see the dead and wounded on travois;
the agency Indians watching stoically; the prisoners -- some
of them -- being herded into a chapel.
DAY
The search theme is heard again as the two riders, with single
pack horse, are heading south through New Mexico.
It is hot country.
DAY
Their faces are sun-tanned, burned dark and dry. Gone are
the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days. They do
not speak, just ride -- and there is the same bleak, fanatic,
hard look about them both. The music theme segues into
something livelier and Mexican as we -
DISSOLVE TO:
It is a small place -- a single dirt street, a few adobe
houses; a few racks of dried meat; a burro with a load of
faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy; the
music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the
street. Before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse, without
a saddle -- only a blanket pad. There is something familiar
about the horse and Ethan is staring at it as they ride in.
The two men dismount, beating dust out of their clothes.
Ethan takes another look at the sorry old nag tied outside.
Martin pauses beside Ethan.
ETHAN
Recognize it?
Martin shakes his head. They start toward the cantina.
ETHAN
There couldn't be two like that in
all the world...
FULL SHOT - DAY
A small pack train (nine or ten horses, six or seven men)
winds through a canyon behind which we can see huge needles
of rock: majestic, savage country. At the head of the column
ride Ethan, Emilio, and Martin. Behind them come Emilio's
cargadores -- lean, hard-bitten wiry little Mexicans. One
leads a handsome palomino. The SOUND of the CASTANETS ECHOES
in the musical theme.
Ethan is looking around with grim interest.
ETHAN
Medicine country, huh?
EMILIO
(slight smile)
Medicine so strong they believe the
feather of an eagle found here can
guard a man against bullets...
MARTIN
(looking ahead)
If you got one handy, now's the
time...
Ethan and Emilio both look in the direction of his glance.
DAY
They are turning a bend and now, ahead, we see a cordon of
Comanches -- all armed, all quiet, all very menacing as they
watch the approaching column. Emilio calls a greeting in
Comanche. It gets no answer.
The CAMERA PICKS UP the faces in turn, as from the white
men's viewpoint, as they ride slowly by.
One tepee stands apart from the other's -- Scar's. Beyond it
are other tepees, the gathering of braves and some squaws,
the drying racks for meat, etc. Emilio leads the way toward
the central tepee. They dismount nearby and Emilio inclines
his head toward the one tepee. Ethan and Martin brace
themselves and wait. The flap of the tepee is closed.
MARTIN
(gruffly)
What are we waiting for?
Emilio cautions him with a hand gesture.
The flap is thrust aside and SCAR steps out -- the same
Comanche we had seen at the grave when Debbie was captured.
He stands tall, arrogant, eyeing the white men with hard,
implacable eyes. He has a robe gathered about him. Across
his face is a scar.
EMILIO'S VOICE
Senores! This is Cicatriz!
The white men's eyes are as hard as the Comanche's: this is
the man they have long sought, the killer, the raper.
They cannot mask the hatred they feel.
ETHAN
(slowly... at last)
Scar... It's plain to see where you
got your name.
Scar's hand moves to the scar on his face, and a finger runs
along it.
SCAR
Your name - Big Shoulders... His
name - He Who Follows.
ETHAN
You speak pretty good American for a
Comanche... Someone teach you?
It is a leading question and Scar knows it. He looks long at
Ethan and the suggestion of a smile touches his lips.
But he makes no direct answer. He looks instead to Emilio.
SCAR
(in Comanche)
Ah-we pabbo-tie-bo ee-kee-tay?
(Why did you bring
the gringos here?)
EMILIO
(a shrug -- in Comanche)
Pabbo-tie-bo kim te-moo-er.
(The gringos want to
trade.)
ETHAN
That's right... We come to trade...
Only not out here...
(with sign language
accompaniment)
I don't stand talkin' in the wind.
Emilio quickly turns and calls to one of his men. Emilio is
worried.
EMILIO
(sharply)
Miguel... caballo -- aca!
One of the Mexicans comes on the trot, leading in the
palomino. Emilio makes a gesture -- giving it to Scar.
EMILIO
Co-bay tabitz-chat.
(meaning)
(Very fine horse.)
Scar looks at it greedily, then nods. He'll accept it.
He looks at Ethan. Again that faintly contemptuous smile.
He signals them to enter his tepee.
ETHAN
(to Martin)
Stay out here.
MARTIN
Not likely.
He follows Ethan into the tepee... and a worried Emilio goes
along.
As the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair, the slant
green eyes looking at them from a tanned, but still white
and very beautiful face. (NOTE TO MUSIC: The SEARCH THEME
should cover all the foregoing action -- but at the first
clear view of DEBBIE, it ends dramatically.)
Debbie's eyes hold theirs -- and then Scar's voice is heard:
SCAR
(in Comanche)
Pie-kay!
(Go!)
Swiftly she straightens, takes away the scalp pole and goes
back to her former place.
They emerge from the tepee and begin to walk away -- not
fast, not slow, and without a side glance. Scar emerges and
looks after them -- glowering. A few other Comanches begin
to gather near his tepee.
EMILIO
(urgently)
Walk with dignity!
(after a moment; lips
hardly moving)
If you gringo heretics have any
prayers, say them...
MARTIN
(transfigured)
She's alive... Can you believe it,
she's alive... alive... An' we found
her...
EMILIO
(fervently)
Please!... I, too, am alive... I
wish to stay that way.
They reach the waiting cargadores and the pack train,
surrounded by suspicious Comanches.
EMILIO
(to his men)
Vamanos!
They mount and ride out.
WIPE TO:
AFTERNOON
Emilio is standing near his horse, talking to Ethan and
Martin.
EMILIO
You understand, senores... It is not
that I am cobarde... cowardly...
ETHAN
Don't apologize... You did your job...
Emilio nods and mounts.
EMILIO
He knows you -- who you are -- and
why you are here... This I did not
understand... or I would not... even
for gold, senores... have led you
here.
He fumbles for a pouch, holds it out to Ethan.
EMILIO
Take it. I do not want blood money.
Vaya con Dios!
He digs spurs and rides out. Ethan turns and looks soberly
at Martin. We hear the rest of the riders moving away.
Ethan and Martin cross the sand and go down slope toward the
creek where their horses are waiting.
174-A
MARTIN
You figger Scar means to kill us?
ETHAN
He's got to... All these years,
runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were
after him... Now we caught up...
It's him or us.
MARTIN
Why didn't he make his move back
there?
ETHAN
I don't know... Somethin' tied his
hands... maybe hospitality...
He breaks and both wheel as sand slides from the top of the
dunes. They look up.
174-B
Debbie is silhouetted atop the dune, looking down at them.
MARTIN
(barely breathing the
name)
Debbie...?
She slides down the dune to stand across the creek from them.
174-C
Her hand cautions them to silence and against coming any
closer.
DEBBIE
(in Comanche)
Unnt-meah!
(Go away!)
Both men move closer. She takes a
frightened step back, as if to run.
MARTIN
Debbie... Don't you remember me? I'm
Martin.
She hesitates. She looks long at him.
DEBBIE
(in Comanche)
Unnt-meah!
MARTIN
(softly)
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without
you, Debbie... Ethan, get the
horses... I'll try to keep her
talkin'...
ETHAN
(harshly)
How? She's even forgot her own
language!
MARTIN
Debbie, you're comin' with us!
Hear
me?
DEBBIE
No... not now... not ever.
These have been her first words in English... and they bring
new hope to Martin.
MARTIN
I don't care what they've done to
you... what happened...
DEBBIE
(angrily)
They have done... nothing... They
are my people...
ETHAN
Your people? They murdered your
family!
DEBBIE
(reverting to Comanche)
Ee-sap!
(furiously)
White men killed them - to steal
cows! I was... little... I ran away...
They find me... take care of me.
MARTIN
No Debbie! That ain't what happened!
They been lyin' to you...
DEBBIE
You lie! All white men lie... and
kill...
MARTIN
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin...
remember? Remember how I used to let
you ride my horse? Tell you stories?
Don't you remember me, Debbie?
DEBBIE
I remember... from always... At first
I prayed to you... come and get me...
take me home... You didn't come...
MARTIN
I've come now...
DEBBIE
These are my people...
(in Comanche)
Unnt-meah! Go! Go! Please!
ETHAN
(grimly)
Stand aside, boy...
Martin turns as Ethan slowly reaches for his gun. It takes
Martin a moment to realize what he is about to do.
MARTIN
Ethan -- NO!
He moves quickly then to put himself between Ethan and the
girl and in that instant there is the crack of a rifle.
Ethan is hit in the leg. It goes out from under him. Martin
swings and his gun is out and firing.
174-D
A mounted Comanche is on the crest of the dune above them --
rifle raised. Martin's first shot brings him down the dune
in a spectacular horse-and-man fall. Debbie goes running
like a deer up the creek, away from Martin; in the same
instant we hear the angry yells of distant Comanches charging
from the far left. Martin turns to see Debbie running away.
MARTIN
Debbie! WAIT!
Ethan is on his feet now and limping frantically toward their
horses. He shoves Martin ahead of him.
ETHAN
(angrily)
Never mind her! MOVE!
They mount and take off, just as the vanguard of the attacking
Comanches swings around a point of rock and comes charging
toward the creek.
as Ethan and Martin race their horses from the creek area
and down a long incline, as -- from the heights above -- a
dozen or more Comanches, led by Scar, come tearing after
them.
175-A
Ethan is swaying in his saddle, just barely hanging on, as
Martin races up behind him -- driving Ethan's horse along.
They swing past a huge outcrop of rock and go tearing along
a vaulting wall of stone. Their hoofbeats and those of the
pursuers bounce and echo off the canyon walls, and bullets
whine and ricochet.
175-B
DAY
They swing around giant boulders, up-ended like pancakes.
Ethan is lurching almost out of the saddle, barely conscious.
Martin spots the cave -- ahead -- and drives his mount and
Ethan's toward it.
175-C
Martin pulls his horse in and swings off just as Ethan slides
from his saddle. He runs toward one of the huge boulders,
crouches and starts firing.
175-D
The Comanches are spread out but coming on fast. One goes
down under Martin's fire.... another is hit in the arm. He
pulls up and the other Comanches wheel away from the hidden
marksman.
175-E
Martin runs back from his firing post toward where Ethan has
fallen.
ETHAN
(angrily)
Go on! Get out of here while you
can...
MARTIN
(pointing to the cave)
Over there!
Ethan turns and sees what he means. He starts dragging himself
to the cave as Martin grabs the rifles from their saddle
scabbards, yanks off the water canteens and then drives their
horses away. Then he too runs for the shelter of the cave.
175-F
Both men are crouching, rifles ready. In the distance we see
their horses running off -- pursued by some yelling Comanches.
Four or six others come into sight, heading for the cave --
moving cautiously, uncertainly -- not seeing their quarry.
Then the white men open fire and the Comanches bend low over
their horses' necks and clear out of there. Ethan looks grimly
at Martin.
ETHAN
They'll be back...
MARTIN
We won't be here... Come on!
He gets an arm under Ethan and hauls him to his feet.
DISSOLVE TO:
175-G
CAMERA PANS from the top of the rock chimney to where Martin
is snaking his way through, carrying newly-filled water
canteens. He stands there, listening and looking back the
way he has come; and then, satisfied there has been no
pursuit, he continues away.

Martin is hauling an improvised travois over the ground in
which, lashed by vines and some clothing, is the unconscious
figure of Ethan.

Eyes shadowed, whiskered, drawn -- he is an implacable figure
as he drags the weary miles home. He hears a groan from Ethan
o.s. He barely lets his eyes drift to the sound. He doesn't
stop.
CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - ETHAN IN THE TRAVOIS - DAY
We see he is delirious, lips parched, strapped to the poles.
The travois jolts over the ground. As he passes out of frame,
the CAMERA HOLDS on the marks of the travois poles scraping
across the desert.
FADE OUT
OMITTED
FADE IN
Horses, wagons fill the yard. We can hear the lively music
of the square dance. As Jorgensen opens the door and sets
out toward the barn, a battered dusty trap drives in -- and
on it are Martin and Ethan. Jorgensen at first doesn't
recognize them.
JORGENSEN
(hailing them)
Hi!... You're late... hurry...
And then he sees who they are, and his jaw drops.
JORGENSEN
(staring)
Ethan... Martie... No, don't get
down! ...You can't come in!
They stare at him.
JORGENSEN
The Rangers are here!
He says it as though that explains everything.
ETHAN
What's that got to do with us?
MARTIN
(eyeing the house)
What's goin' on?
JORGENSEN
(who's forgotten they
wouldn't know)
Why, my Laurie's getting married...
Martin throws the reins aside and jumps out. Jorgensen grabs
his arm.
JORGENSEN
Wait! Don't you hear me! The
Rangers...
MARTIN
So what?
JORGENSEN
You been posted for murder... both
of you... That trader fella, the
late Mister Futterman...
Martin tries to break free.
MARTIN
I gotta see Laurie!
JORGENSEN
(desperately)
Go around the side... the
grandmother's room... I'll tell her...
PLEASE!
MARTIN
You better!
He heads around the side. Ethan meanwhile has climbed stiffly
down, slightly favoring his leg.
JORGENSEN
Quick... hide in the barn, Ethan...
ETHAN
Hide? Why would I?
He brushes past the little man and heads for the door.
Charlie waits assuredly as Martin follows him outside.
Martin makes a wild run, swings. The blow is neatly guarded
by Charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts
Martin down. Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this
time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an Indian,
not a white man. The men from the wedding party come out now
at a run.
CLAYTON
(yelling)
Sergeant MacCorry!
Charlie turns slightly and in that instant Martin springs
and drives a straight right at his face -- almost as though
there were a knife in the hand. MacCorry stumbles back into
Clayton's arms.
CLAYTON
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
CHARLIE
(regaining his balance)
No sir... pleasure.
CLAYTON
In that case, give the boys room...
Martin waits at a crouch as Charlie comes in, feints his
right and crosses his left. It is a hard blow but Martin
recovers and waits... Charlie circles and starts to repeat.
He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks
and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws
Charlie over his head. What we are looking at, in effect, is
a wrestler against a boxer.
CLAYTON
Fight fair, son... Use your fists!
ETHAN
(drily)
Comanches don't use their fists,
reverend... Let 'em alone...
Charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling -- now
trying to imitate Martin's crouch. Suddenly Martin feints a
right swing and connects with a solid left -- reversing the
order of business. Charlie staggers and Martin follows up
with a wrestling hold, leaping behind Charlie, locking both
legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back
so that his face is in the dirt and so he could -- under
other circumstances -- be neatly and expeditiously scalped.
With the hands locked, Martin then calmly draws a knife. He
looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd.
MARTIN
Could scalp him... but I'll just
count coup!
With that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to
grab a lock of Charlie's hair and neatly snip it off.
He stands then and laughs as Charlie lamely gets to his feet --
easing the tortured arms. Clayton goes to Charlie's side.
Laurie moves to Martin's side.
CLAYTON
You all right, sergeant?
CHARLIE
Dunno... Seems so.
CLAYTON
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll
proceed with the weddin'...
Charlie frowns and looks off at where Laurie and Martin are
standing.
CHARLIE
Ain't goin' to be any weddin' -- not
till we get a few things cleared up
'round here...
He walks rather unsteadily away leaving a thunderstruck
assembly, murmurous with surprise.
WIPE TO:
Clayton stands in the opened doorway, Jorgensen behind him,
looking out. Drawn up outside is the four-man cavalry detail,
led by a young and very crisp LIEUTENANT. We may or may not
see the sixth man, slouched over his horse. The Lieutenant
swings off and crosses.
LIEUTENANT
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
CLAYTON
I'm Clayton.
The Lieutenant gapes at Clayton's ministerial coat.
LIEUTENANT
(doubtfully)
You're Captain Clayton?...
Ethan chuckles, to Clayton's very obvious annoyance.
LIEUTENANT
(recovering, he salutes)
Colonel Greenhill's compliments,
sir.
The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company
of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
CLAYTON
Hold on, son... Who's this Colonel
Greenhill you're talking about?
LIEUTENANT
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel
Greenhill, sir... Commanding Officer,
Fifth U.S. Cavalry... I'm Lieutenant
Greenhill, sir.
CLAYTON
Oh... Now what's this your pa wants
to know?
LIEUTENANT
My pa wants to know... Colonel
Greenhill wants to know how soon you
could put a company of your Rangers
in the field, fully armed and
equipped, for joint punitive action
against the Comanches.
CLAYTON
JOINT action?
LIEUTENANT
Yes sir... We've received information
about a band of Comanches under a
chief named Scar...
ETHAN
What information?
LIEUTENANT
That maybe he's not far from here --
holed up somewhere, waiting his chance
to get back over the border... He
raided north about a month ago...
ran into more army than he bargained
for... Now he's running for cover,
for keeps this time...
CLAYTON
And what makes you think he's in
this territory?
LIEUTENANT
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked
up a man claims he was a prisoner
with Scar till only two days ago...
He talks crazy but I brought him
along... Says he lives here... keeps
mentioning a rocking chair.
ETHAN
(half to himself)
Mose...
And then he is striding to the door, calling it:
ETHAN
MOSE!
MOSE'S VOICE
Ay-he?... Ay-eh?...
And the old man totters in, half-supported by a trooper --
hollow-eyed, weak, almost delirious.
MOSE
Come f'r my rockin' chai'... ole
Mose.
ETHAN
(shouting it)
Where's Scar, Mose... SCAR?
MARTIN
Ask him about Debbie!... Is she all
right, Mose?
MOSE
My rockin' chai'...
MRS. JORGENSEN
(bustling over)
Leave the poor man be! Can't you see
he's out of his mind...
She tries to lead him away, but Ethan shoves her aside and
grips the old man by his arms.
ETHAN
Mose... try to remember!... You were
in Scar's camp...
MOSE
Ay-he... Made out I was crazy...
(he giggles foolishly)
Ate dirt... chewed grass... I fooled
'em, Ethan!... an' I got away...
ETHAN
Scar! Where's he holed in?
MOSE
Seven Fingers... ay-he... Seven...
He staggers and this time Mrs. Jorgensen won't be denied.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Now that's enough!
Here... by the
fire... What you need's a good bowl
of soup...
She leads him away, at last to his rocker by the fire.
During this, Ethan and Clayton have been mulling Mose's
answer.
ETHAN
(blankly)
Seven Fingers?
LIEUTENANT
That's what he told us... but there's
no such place on the maps.
MARTIN
Wait a minute! Isn't that the Caddo
name for where all those canyons
branch on the Malapai?
MOSE
(from his rocker)
Caddo or Kiowa... ay-he... ay-eh...
Sam Clayton wheels on the Lieutenant.
CLAYTON
You tell your pa a company of Rangers --
all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed
an' equipped will be in the field by
daylight... headin' for the south
end of the Malapai. If he can catch
up with us, well an' good...
LIEUTENANT
But... but captain, we can't possibly
take the field tomorrow... for your
own protection...
CLAYTON
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers,
complete with Texican scalps an'
white girl captive... You want to
protect us, you just get out of our
way... Now skedaddle!
The lieutenant skedaddles. Sam whirls on Martin and Ethan.
CLAYTON
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby
appointed civilian scouts -- without
pay... Charlie, hightail it to
headquarters an' spread the word...
CHARLIE
Yes sir...
He leaves. Martin's hands go to his side -- recalling where
he left his guns.
MARTIN
My guns...
He heads for the inner door to the grandmother room.
A file of eighteen men and horses -- Rangers -- is walking
under the shoulder of a mesa, keeping well below the skyline.
FULL SHOT - THE FILE OF RANGERS - DAWN LIGHT
They pass CAMERA one by one -- Sam Clayton in the lead, Martin
behind him leading two horses, then the others -- grim-
looking, capable men of varying ages; some with long drooping
mustaches, some in need of shaves, some chawing tobacco.
CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - AT RIM OF A MESA - DAWN LIGHT
He is lying prone, his hat off, squinting down into a long
reach of desert canyon at the Comanche encampment -- with
tepees set up, a thin wisp of smoke rising from a fire, the
horse herd penned in a draw cut off by an improvised corral
of rawhide ropes.
The camp is sleeping. A dog yaps shrilly. One of the tepee
flaps opens and Scar steps out. He picks up a stone or a
chunk of wood and throws it. The dog yelps and runs off.
Scar's air is troubled, suspicious. He heads for the horse
herd. The camp sleeps on.
CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - AT RIM OF A MESA - DAWN LIGHT
His face betrays a bitter inner satisfaction. He looks back
along the trail as faintly we hear the approach of the Ranger
company. Then he squirms back, retrieving his hat.
FULL SHOT - HEAD OF RANGER COLUMN - DAWN LIGHT
Sam, seeing Ethan in the near distance, raises his hand in a
signal for halt and waits. Ethan scrambles down the trail to
join him. He takes the reins of his horse from Martin.
ETHAN
We can get within 500 yards... there's
a hogback to the south.
CLAYTON
How many, would you say?
ETHAN
(drily)
Enough to go around... I'd say about
a dozen apiece... Mount 'em up!
He moves as though to mount, but Martin steps forward.
MARTIN
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll
kill her... and you know it.
ETHAN
(calmly)
It's what I'm countin' on.
Sam stares at him, but Martin isn't surprised.
MARTIN
I know you are... Only it ain't goin'
to be that way... she's alive...
ETHAN
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein'
alive...
MARTIN
(same tone)
She's alive... Better she's alive
and livin' with Comanches than her
brains bashed out...
CLAYTON
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say,
but there's more than your sister at
stake here.
ETHAN
There sure is! I'm going to tell you
somethin'... I wasn't going to speak
of it... But I'll tell you now.
Did
you notice them scalps strung on
Scar's lance?
(MARTIN NODS)
Did you see the third scalp from the
point of the lance? Long... wavy
hair...
MARTIN
I saw it... And don't try to tell me
it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
ETHAN
You don't remember it, but I remember.
That was your mother's scalp!
Martin stares, quick disbelief in his eyes. But Ethan's eyes
hold his and there is no doubting the truth in them.
ETHAN
I didn't want to tell you... but
maybe it's your right to know.
CLAYTON
(quietly)
Now mount up, son...
Sam puts his hand on Martin's elbow -- as though to turn him
to his duty. But Martin jerks the arm away.
MARTIN
It don't change it... All I'm askin'
is a chance to sneak in there... an'
try to get her out before you come
chargin' in.
CLAYTON
What if you're caught?
MARTIN
It won't tell 'em anything, will it!
Just a man alone...
ETHAN
I say NO!
CLAYTON
Go ahead, son... But at the first
alarm, we're comin' in -- and we
ain't goin' to have time to pick and
choose our targets when we do...
Ethan looks long and hard at Martin, then reaches into his
shirt for the folded, dirty, dog-eared paper that was his
will. Slowly he tears it into shreds.
ETHAN
It's your funeral...
Martin squats and starts pulling off his boots. He glances
up as Charlie MacCorry comes over, an Indian blanket in his
hands. He tosses it onto Martin's shoulder.
CHARLIE
Here... you fight like a Comanch...
Maybe this'll help ya pass as one.
Then he grins and extends his hand. Martin takes it -- and
they shake as Charlie pulls him to his feet. Martin drops
his hat, and then -- at a crouching run -- he heads for the
distant Comanche camp.
FULL SHOT - FROM BEHIND CLAYTON AND ETHAN, TOWARD MARTIN
as he runs downslope under the shelter of the hogback toward
the unseen camp. Clayton waves an arm at his men and starts
leading out -- in a somewhat different direction.
FULL SHOT - THE RANGERS, FAVORING CLAYTON AND ETHAN
They are leading their horses down the slope, still under
the lee of the butte, when two riders are seen approaching
at a fast gallop -- Lt. Greenhill and his courier. (The latter
is a bugler).
CLAYTON
What in...?
GREENHILL
(calling -- still
distant)
Captain Clayton... Captain!
Sam whips off his hat and makes frantic signals to Greenhill
to shut up. Greenhill pulls to a canter, puzzled, and rides
in.
CLAYTON
(exploding)
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler
sound the charge while you're at
it??
GREENHILL
(blankly)
Sir?
CLAYTON
Never mind... Your pa know you're
out here?
GREENHILL
Yes, sir... Troop's about ten miles
back... The Colonel sent me looking
for you...
CLAYTON
(dismissing him)
Well you found me... Good work, son...
Good work.
He starts away. Greenhill follows.
GREENHILL
If there's anything I can do, sir...
CLAYTON
(under his breath)
God forbid... No, son, you flog on
back and tell your pa where we're
at... and where he's at...
GREENHILL
But he knows THAT, sir... Can't I
stay, sir?
CLAYTON
(reluctantly)
All right... But keep your eye on
me, boy... I'm the hard case you're
up against here -- not these childish
savages... If you don't hear me first
time I holler, you better read my
mind... I don't aim to raise no two
hollers on any subject at hand...
GREENHILL
Yes, sir...
He whips out his sabre -- to the imminent peril of Captain
Sam who quickly shifts out of the way.
CLAYTON
Watch that knife, boy!
Then Sam continues away and the Rangers after him.
Martin runs from behind CAMERA and dodges behind a rock. The
camp is still asleep, very quiet. Martin runs out from behind
the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp,
dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta. A
dog runs out of one of the tepees, begins barking.
He stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse lines.
In the near distance the dog's barking is heard -- shrill,
insistent. Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air
suspiciously. The other Comanche laughs.
COMANCHE
Tahbo.
(A rabbit.)
Scar isn't satisfied but returns to his work.
MARTIN
He is staring at it -- remembering it from certain distinct
decorations. The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for
better air circulation. Martin wraps Charlie's blanket around
him and begins walking to the tepee.
RANGERS
The line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their
sidearms, tightening cinches, etc. Sam moves briskly along
the line of men, then mounts his horse.
CLAYTON
The State of Texas is payin' you
boys $12 a month. Here's your chance
to earn it... Now I don't want any
foolin' around after scalps. We ain't
got the time... Yankee cavalry's on
its way here to set those Comanches
free... We gotta beat 'em to it --
our way... Now mount an' guide center
on young Greenhill here. Son, you
just follow me... And WATCH THAT
KNIFE!
The last comes as Greenhill tries to mount, simultaneously
flailing out his sabre perilously close to Clayton.
Martin has gained the tepee, takes one quick look around,
then strides in.
P.O.V. - SCAR
He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the
grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife
in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the
other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd.
They are mounted and in line. The echo of a shot comes
bouncing back. Clayton is facing the men. He solemnly doffs
his hat and bows his head.
CLAYTON
For these Thy gifts which we are
about to receive...
(donning his hat, he
turns to the bugler)
Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us
Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE!
And shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge. The yell
is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge
as though he had a regiment at his back. Lt. Greenhill -- a
West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre
at the "charge."
FULL MOVING SHOT - ON THE CHARGE
In the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice
that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill's
saber ominously close to his back. The charge is sounding,
the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they
did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their
teeth, guns in their fists.
Comanches are running from the tepees, trying to reach their
horse herd as the file of Rangers knifes in.
The bark of
hand guns is a steady sound now -- and the Comanches have
never been up against such marksmen. One charging Ranger
rides down a tepee. Another, with two guns drawn, scores a
running double on two Indians racing toward him from opposite
sides of his fast-running horse. A dodging Comanche screams
as a barrel-chested roan hits him broadside and sends him
sprawling into the embers of the campfire.
He yanks his horse back to its haunches, firing at a Comanche
crouched near the tepee. The charge races past him. Ethan
swings off and runs to the tepee flap, whips it open and
glares. A squaw comes running out at him, knife upraised,
but he knocks her sprawling with a full arm sweep. He turns
and his face is a mask of frustration -- and then he freezes,
seeing what he has been looking for:
Martin is running with Debbie, trying to pull her along,
while she kicks and claws and tries to break free. (They are
about thirty yards from the camp proper.) Riderless horses
are milling, circling. O.s. we can hear the firing, the yells.
Ethan remounts and heads around the side of Scar's tepee.
In the distance we see Martin and Debbie. The Rangers,
regrouping, are charging back through the camp, driving the
Comanche horse herd.
Martin hears Ethan's horse riding down at them; he turns,
and Debbie pulls free and starts to run away.
MARTIN
No, Ethan! NO!
He goes running into the path of Ethan's horse.
as Martin runs and grabs hold of his stirrup, trying to fight
the horse to a stop. Ethan swings on him -- once, twice --
and Martin is knocked sprawling. Ethan rides on, relentlessly.
She is running and dodging, trying to escape the horseman.
Ethan has his gun drawn. She ducks to one side and the horse
goes past. Both figures are almost obscured in the dust.
Ethan spins his mount and charges after her. She runs and
then falls -- and he is off his horse and striding toward
her.
Ethan is at the left of CAMERA and slightly closer to the
foreground, with Debbie at the right, supine on the ground
and the dust swirling around her. Ethan draws and raises his
gun. The hammer goes back.
ETHAN
(quietly)
I'm sorry, girl... Shut your eyes...
The dust clears. The CAMERA MOVES slightly forward along the
gun arm and HOLDS on Debbie's face -- the eyes gazing
fearlessly, innocently into Ethan's. We HOLD for a long moment
and then the gun lowers. Ethan slowly holsters it and walks
over to her.
He looks down at her.
ETHAN
(softly)
You sure favor your mother...
He extends his hand to her. She takes it and he helps her to
her feet. And then she is against his chest and his arm goes
protectingly about her. They are standing that way when Martin
stumbles up -- and stares.
WIPE TO:
233-A
The line of Rangers is afoot now, each man near his horse,
each man with rifle out, pumping shot after shot at the
fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long valley
with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-crossing
in mid-ground... And then as the firing slackens, from afar
we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge:
sign of the approach of Greenhill's troop.
DISSOLVE TO:
It is perhaps half an hour later. Clayton is very grim of
face and occasionally wincing. His trousers are down over
his ankles, his shirt-tails flapping over his long-handled
red underwear. Behind him Charlie MacCorry is kneeling,
applying some crude first aid to Sam's rump. Beyond them
some of the Rangers are readying for the move-out. Sam looks
up angrily as COLONEL GREENHILL, a guidon bearer, and bugler
ride in. Greenhill is a choleric man.
COLONEL
Clayton, if you were in my command
I'd have you courtmartialed for this!
CLAYTON
(angrily, to MacCorry)
Hurry it up!
COLONEL
What's the matter, sir... You wounded?
What is it, Sergeant -- a bullet or
an arrow?
Charlie just gapes, but Clayton -- grim-lipped -- bends a
meaningful glare on someone off. Greenhill looks that way.
He is standing with his sabre at salute -- looking as
miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace. It
could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend.
Sam suddenly slaps MacCorry's hand away and grabs for his
pants and pulls them up -- and around a tepee come three
figures -- Ethan, Debbie, and Martin -- with Ethan holding
Debbie's hand. And Sam's face is split by a grin as he tucks
his shirt-tails in and goes to meet them.
DISSOLVE TO:
AFTERNOON
He is in a rocker on the porch. Suddenly he stares out and
stops rocking. Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the
clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk. A moment later
Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading
his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing
the distant horsemen.
He is joined by Mrs. Jorgensen. And
then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first,
then with dawning realization.
Lars and Mrs. Jorgensen also begin to guess... to suspect...
and then to know. And Laurie starts to run.
CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH LAURIE
The CAMERA MOVES ahead of her as she runs blindly over the
hard-packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the
still unseen but nearing horsemen.
FULL SHOT - THE GROUP
Ethan has Debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm
supporting her, and she is asleep. Martin is riding beside
them. Laurie comes running up to stare at Ethan and at the
girl. He smiles and puts a finger to his lips -- cautioning
her against waking Debbie -- and then he rides by. Laurie
looks then at Martin. He doesn't know whether to smile or
not; he just waits. And then she is beside him and she steps
onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she
kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to
take up the search. And still holding her beside him, he
rides slowly after Ethan and Debbie toward the house.
