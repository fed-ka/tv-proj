      FROM BLACK

      We re hit with a blinding SANDSTORM, hallowed by a fierce 
      desert sun. A dragon s breath of sand and heat -- as a 
      BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER touches down. We re...

      EXT. DESERT AIRBASE (EGYPT) - DAY

      ...at a remote desert airbase. BOOTS hit the tarmac as 
      SOLDIERS pile out of the copter, guiding dazed and emaciated 
      CIVILIAN passengers to safety. Heavily armed MILITARY POLICE 
      join the fray, their mood dispassionate as they scan the 
      faces of the civilians, zeroing in on--

      RICK MARTINEZ, mid 20s. Rick looks a wreck -- dehydrated, 
      battered and bruised. Despite this fact, he still manages to 
      radiate boyish good looks. His demeanor both serious-minded 
      and disarmingly innocent.

                                  MILITARY OFFICER
                      Martinez?!

                                  RICK
                    Yes! That s me!

      Rick extends his hand for a greeting. To his great surprise 
      the military officer slaps cuffs on him. 

      INT. HELICOPTER HANGER - DESERT AIRBASE  

      The CIA s North African Chief of Station, LOWDEN, 50s, a 
      sweat-stained, world-weary, career spook, sits alone at a 
      table in an otherwise empty helicopter hanger. Rick is 
      dragged in by the military police. He is directed to sit 
      across from Lowden, where he s cuffed to the table. 

                                  LOWDEN
                    For the record please state your name 
                    and association with the Agency.

                                  RICK
                    Am I under arrest?

                                  LOWDEN
                    No. Putting you under arrest would 
                    afford you legal rights that I m not 
                    prepared, or frankly in the mood to 
                    extend. You re being detained until 
                    it s determine if you need to be 
                      categorized as an enemy combatant.

                      Disruptive Services. 
                                  (MORE)                                                           2.       

                                  RICK (CONT'D)
                    You re telling me that I ve got no 
                    lawyer. No rights. And no choice but 
                    to cooperate. 

      Lowden pulls a bottle of coke from a cooler by his feet. He 
      pops the cap against the table edge.  

                                  LOWDEN
                    You have a choice. You could choose 
                    not to answer my questions. And I can 
                    choose to call it a day, and leave 
                    you cuffed to this table, inside this 
                    hanger, where temperatures routinely 
                    top 135 degrees. You know how we know 
                    that? We know that because our 
                      thermometers melt in here.  

      Lowden, a right prick, sips from his coke. Rick considers his 
      plight. The full weight of his situation landing on him: the 
      cuffs, the heat, the sadistic interrogator. 

                                  RICK
                    Okay... Let s talk. Let s talk about 
                    the truth...

      Title card:  Five Days Earlier 

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - MAIN LOBBY - DAY

      We re looking at a biblical verse etched in a wall. 

                     And ye shall know the truth and the 
                    truth shall make you free. 
        John VIII-XXXII

      We FIND Rick standing in the main lobby of CIA Headquarters, 
      taking in the etching. He tries to get his bearings. There is 
      no directory. The lobby is empty of personnel, with the 
      exception of...

        ...OPERATIVE BLANKE, 50s. Blanke sits on a bench, like a 
      butler awaiting instructions. He notices Rick s lost 
      expression, lights up, and hustles to his aid.

                                  BLANKE
                    You look lost? Are you lost? 

                                  RICK
                    Could you tell me how to get to 
                    Central Administration? I have an 
                      appointment with the Director.

                                  BLANKE
                    Which Director? Science and 
                      Technology? Intelligence? Support?                                                           3.       


                                  RICK
                      Clandestine Service.

                                  BLANKE
                    Well... lucky you.

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY

      Blanke leads Rick at a brisk pace.

                                  BLANKE
                    So, what was your golden ticket?

                                  RICK
                    Excuse me?

                                  BLANKE
                    Your golden ticket to Clandestine 
                    Service. What s your special skill? 

                                  RICK
                    I speak fluent Arabic.

                                  BLANKE
                    Smart. I studied Spanish. Course that 
                    was back in the disco era when no one 
                    much spoke Spanish. Boy has the world 
                    changed. Now I m no more qualified to 
                    be a spy than my mechanic. 

                                  RICK
                    What department do you work for? 

                                  BLANKE
                    I was formerly a military analyst.

                                  RICK
                    And now?

      The question hangs in the air. They walk in awkward silence, 
      finally arriving at a set of double doors: Clandestine 
      Administration and Oversight Services. (C.A.O.S.)

      Blanke nervously checks to see that no one is watching before 
      pulling Rick close and urgently whispering...

                                  BLANKE
                    You re entering a house of mirrors! 
                    You won t survive without help! I can 
                    provide that help! All I ask is for a 
                    chance to prove my value! 

      Blanke slips Rick a business card and scurries off, 
        disappearing around a corner. Rick s left wondering: What the 
      hell was that all about?                                                           4.       


      INT. CIA HEADQUARTER - CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS - DAY

      Sitting behind a spotless desk is DIRECTOR HIGGINS, 40s. 
      Higgins approaches his job the same way a politician 
      approaches a microphone -- calibrating his every word. 

      Higgins reviews Rick s application file when his AIDE enters.

                                  AIDE
                    Mr. Martinez is here, sir.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Count to twenty then send him in.

      Director Higgins slips Rick s file into a drawer, then dumps 
      a box of file folders onto his desk, scattering them to 
      achieve a  cluttered look.  Rick enters moments later to find 
      Higgins hunched over his desk  buried in paperwork.  

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    Have a seat. I apologize for the 
                    mess. We re under serious cost 
                    cutting pressures. Every program is 
                    up for funding review.

      Director Higgins lifts his head, sizing up Rick.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    Tell me, how much money is too much 
                    to spend protecting this great 
                    country from a world increasingly 
                    filled with ignoble villainy bent on 
                      destroying our very way of life? 

                                  RICK
                      I wouldn t know, sir.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Well, I do. But I m not at liberty to 
                    share budget numbers. Remind me, 
                    which program did you apply for?

                                  RICK
                    The Core Collector Training Program.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Oh... that s unfortunate. Our
                    CC program was red-tagged.

                                  RICK
                      Red-tagged?

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    The program lost funding. Your job 
                    has been cut. I m sorry.                                                           5.       


      Rick registers utter shock. Is this some cruel joke?

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    Well, it was a pleasure meeting you 
                      Operative...  er, Mr. Martinez. 

      Director Higgins returns to his work. Rick doesn t make a 
      sound, or a move, his world silently imploding. 

                                  RICK
                    So... that s it? I m out? But I ve 
                    trained my whole life for a career 
                    with the CIA. My whole life! When my 
                    brothers went to soccer camp I stayed 
                    home and studied Arabic. When they 
                    were playing video games I was 
                    getting my pilots license! While 
                    everybody else was dating I was 
                    working at a firing range getting 
                    paid in bullets so I could train on 
                      semi-automatics! I will-- would-- 
                    could be a great spy. I m dedicated, 
                    focused--

      Rick reads Higgins  look as utterly uncaring. 

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    -- and embarrassing myself. I m 
                    sorry. I... I suppose I should let 
                    you get back to slashing jobs.

      Rick staggers to his feet and heads for the door. Unaware of 
      Higgins delight over Rick s desperate outburst. 

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Hang on a minute.

      Higgins gets out from behind his desk. He approaches Rick, 
      drawing his attention to a large glass encasement. Inside the 
      encasement hangs a U-2 Pilot flight suit and helmet.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    You re looking at one of my most 
                    prized treasures. That suit was worn 
                    by our U-2 pilots. At the altitudes 
                    they flew-- and without artificial 
                    air pressure-- human blood would 
                    boil. Paradoxically, were pilots 
                    forced to eject they would instantly 
                    freeze. Boiled or frozen alive 
                    without the protection of this 
                    amazing suit.
                          (then)
                    Our operatives have many amazing 
                    tools at their disposal. 
                                  (MORE)                                                           6.       

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    But do you know what the most 
                    important item in an operative s 
                    arsenal is?

                                  RICK
                    No, sir

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Trust.  
                          (then)
                    There is a position available here, 
                    at The Agency. A job-- an assignment-- 
                    that requires the savvy and skills of 
                      a seasoned spy-- cloaked in the 
                    veneer of youthful innocence. 
                      Interested?

                                  RICK
                    Yes.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Of course, due to the covert nature 
                    of the position, I will need you to 
                    accept the job sight unseen.  

      Rick s mind races, trying to reconcile the strange offer.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    Consider it our first test of trust. 
                    Do you trust I have our country s 
                    best interests in mind? Trust that I 
                    have your best interests in mind? 

                                  RICK
                    I... I want to say yes...

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                          (a mantra)
                    Trust. Trust.

                                  RICK
                    Right, trust. Still...

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    My time, and patience is limited, Mr. 
                    Martinez. As you so astutely noted-- 
                    I have many jobs left to slash. 
                          (then)
                    So now I ask for the final time. Do 
                    you accept the job?

      Rick reels in the pressure of the offer. Feeling like he s 
      stepping into a trap... and we PRE-LAP...

                                  LOWDEN (O.S.)
                    And you said yes.                                                           7.       


      INT. HELICOPTER HANGER - DESERT AIRBASE

      We re back at the interrogation. CAMERA remains fixed on Rick 
      -- he nods  yes.  His expression pained, filled with remorse.

                                  RICK
                    Director Higgins assigned me to the 
                    Office Of Disruptive Services. I was 
                    to monitor the activities of my 
                    fellow operatives and report back.

                                   LOWDEN (O.S.)
                    Report what?

                                  RICK
                    Proof of misconduct. Undocumented 
                    expenses, lack of receipts. No 
                    offense was considered too small. The 
                    Director was looking to red-tag the 
                    program. And to accomplish that he 
                    needed political ammo.

      Lowden s voice drips with disgust.

                                   LOWDEN (O.S.)
                    You re telling me you accepted the 
                    job of a mole? That you agreed to spy 
                    on your brothers-in-arms? That you 
                    entered the CIA spying on the CIA?

      The condemnation is quite unnecessary. Clearly Rick regrets 
      the decision. Off his discomfort we RETURN TO--


      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE ODS - DAY

      --Days earlier. Rick stands outside the door of The Office Of 
      Disruptive Services -- filled with dread. He reaches for the 
      door handle when a man hauling a desk chair approaches. 

                                  CASEY
                    Get the door, will ya?

      Rick swings the door open and steps aside. 

                                  CASEY (CONT D)
                          (calling inside)
                    Pants on, Billy! New guy s here!

      Meet OPERATIVE CASEY MALICK, 30. A slight, ex-marine. On the 
      whole, Casey expresses little interest in people. Content to 
      spend his days inside a gym, or in his own head.                                                           8.       


      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ODS - DAY

      Rick follows Casey into the office. He takes in the bullpen. 
      Over all the place has the feel of an accounting office than 
      the expected CIA command center. 

                                  BILLY
                    Where are your manners?  New guy  has 
                    a name. Mick is it?

                                  RICK
                    Rick. Rick Martinez.

                                  BILLY
                    Martinez? You re a Mexicano! Bueno!!

      Meet OPERATIVE BILLY COLLINS, 35. (Scottish) Billy is a 
      gregarious, hard living, charmer. A man committed to 
      nourishing his inner-devil over his inner-child. Billy 
      admires the chair Casey has carried in.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Where d you pinch that?

                                  CASEY
                    From Plotkin s office.

      Rick reacts involuntarily to the news.

                                  RICK
                    The chair is stolen?

                                  CASEY
                    If we made a formal request you d be 
                    stuck on a milk crate for six months. 
                    Besides, Plotkin won t miss it. 

                                  RICK
                    Why not?

                                  CASEY
                    Plotkin ate a bullet last week.

                                  RICK
                    I m sorry...

                                  CASEY
                    No, literally. He ate a bullet. On a 
                    dare. It got lodged in his lower 
                      intestine. Septic shock set in. Now 
                    he s out on permanent disability and 
                    you re the proud new owner of his 
                    Herman Miller. 

      We realize the guys are setting up a desk for Rick. A third 
      man enters the office lugging a desktop computer.                                                           9.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    Is this the new guy?

                                  BILLY 
                    His name s Rick. He s Mexican. 

      Meet OPERATIVE MICHAEL DORSET, 37. A trained psychologist 
      turned Core Collector. Michael is a man that has little 
      regard for fools in a world he perceives to be chock full of 
      fools. Michael sets the computer on Rick s desk.

                                    MICHAEL
                    There you go. Your own desktop. It 
                    comes with Windows  97 installed.

                                  RICK
                    That s a joke right?

                                    MICHAEL
                    You re familiar with the IRS? Post 
                    Office? FEMA? What do they all have 
                    in common? 

                                  RICK
                    They re government run agencies?

                                    MICHAEL
                    As is the CIA. Now, when was the last 
                    time you walked into the post office 
                    and shouted:  My God! I ve stepped 
                    into the future!  

      Casey begins unloading supplies from a cardboard box labeled: 
      PLOTKIN. Billy snags a framed photo of a basset hound. 

                                  BILLY
                    Look at the furry mug! Priceless! 

      He places the frame on Rick s desk.

                                  RICK
                    You re Scottish.

                                  BILLY
                    Indeed I am. Billy Collins. Born and 
                    bruised in South Edinburgh. I imagine 
                    you re wondering what I m doing 
                    working for the CIA.

                                  RICK
                    A bit.

                                  BILLY
                    I was with the British Secret Service 
                    until I was de-commissioned for a bit 
                    of reckless, boyish mischief.                                                          10.       


                                  CASEY
                    They deported him.

                                  BILLY
                    A mostly irrelevant detail. The point 
                    is, I landed here. Where I was 
                    welcomed into the CIA with open arms! 

                                  CASEY
                    In case you were unaware... The 
                    Agency has a rich history of wrapping 
                    their arms around sketchy characters. 

                                  BILLY
                    This proud fermenter of negativity is 
                    Casey Malick. I suspect you re 
                    wondering how such a boorish man with 
                    zero discernible charm has managed a 
                    twelve year career with the Agency. 
                          (to Casey)
                    Tell him. Don t be shy.

                                  CASEY 
                    I m a human weapon. 

      Rick looks to Michael for confirmation.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I can never bring myself to say it. 
                    But it s true.  

      Billy motions to Michael. 

                                  BILLY
                    And this is our fearless leader, 
                    Michael Dorset. A tactical genius 
                    with a fevered brain. Which, sadly, 
                    has rendered him a devoutly paranoid 
                    bastard. Remember that the first time 
                    he asks to split a salad. 

                                  RICK
                    Why?

                                  CASEY
                    He s looking to use you as a food 
                    tester. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Spies get poisoned. It happens.

      Michael plants himself on Rick s desk. His tone now pointed 
      as he addresses his new office-mate.                                                         11.       


                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Tell me, how did it come to pass that 
                    Director Higgins chose to bless us 
                    with additional staff when The 
                    Agency s cutting jobs right and left?

                                  BILLY
                    Ah, the bastard emerges. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I just think it s strange that Mr. 
                    Martinez is here. Strange, and 
                    requiring of an explanation.
                          (to Rick)
                    Well? 

      Michael fixes Rick with a challenging gaze. A beat.

                                  RICK
                    I can only assume that the Directors  
                    plan is for me to absorb your working 
                    knowledge of The Agency. Then replace 
                    you at half the pay. 

      Michael seems to take Rick s glib response as a direct 
      challenge. Billy, on the other hand, loves it.

                                  BILLY
                    I like this kid! He s muy caliente! 

      Michael s CELL RINGS. Almost simultaneously Billy and Casey s 
      CELLS RING. All three men react to incoming text messages. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You guys seeing this?

      The men share a grave look and swing into action. Throwing on 
      jackets, retrieving weapons. A mad scramble to get out the 
      door. Rick sits at his desk-- utterly in the dark.

                                  RICK
                    Is there something I need to know?

      INT. CAR - D.C. STREETS - TRAVELING - DAY

      Billy drives as the team speeds through traffic. Rick rides 
      shotgun. In the back Michael and Casey are in contact with 
        headquarters via cells and headsets--plugged into a laptop. 

                                  RICK
                    It may not be my place-- but what s 
                      happening?

                                  BILLY
                    Plutonium residue was picked up at 
                    Reagan. 
                                  (MORE)                                                         12.       

                                  BILLY (CONT'D)
                    Passenger manifests ran against our 
                    suspected terrorist list produced a 
                    hit. A Yemenese land developer, 
                    Khalid Farooq, arrived from Dubai 
                    this morning. Michael s trying to get 
                    a lock on his cell.
                          (to Michael)
                    How about some coordinates?! I m 
                    driving blind! 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m working on it...

      As they speed on, Billy turns to Rick, and calmly inquires...

                                  BILLY
                    Tell me, how much do you know about 
                    the ODS?

                                  RICK
                    Uh... well... I know the program was 
                    created under President Carter, in 
                    response to the failure of Operation 
                    Eagle Claw--- our attempt to rescue 
                    Americans held in Tehran. That the 
                    ODS was meant as an experiment to try 
                    and ensure the success of future 
                    black-ops by combining three 
                      Directorates-- Operations, 
                      Intelligence Analyzes, and Tech 
                      Expertise--  

      Michael leans forward, interrupting.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Got him! Four blocks South East!

                                  BILLY
                    That s on the other side of the Park. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Do what you ve gotta do. 

      Billy veers hard. The car jumps the curb. 

      EXT/INT. CAR - GREAT LAWN - DAY

      The sedan speeds across the Great Lawn. Billy grips the wheel 
      tightly, expertly dodging pedestrians, cyclists, picnickers. 

                                  BILLY
                          (to Rick)
                    You were saying?                                                         13.       


                                  RICK
                    -- oh, uh, that the ODS was meant as 
                    a return to a time when ops were 
                      identified, planned, and implemented 
                    by a single team-- 

      Billy muscles the wheel, while simultaneously slamming on the 
      brakes -- sending the car into a fishtail slide. The car 
      slots expertly into the flow of reverse traffic. 

                                  BILLY
                    That pretty much nails us, lad. The 
                    last of the old school spooks. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Right ahead... ahead... stop! 

      Billy screeches to a stop at the curb. Michael points to a 
      restaurant across the street. A lunch crowd has gathered at 
      the Valet Service. Michael points to a businessman, FAROOQ. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    There. Farooq.

                                  CASEY
                    We ve got trouble. Clarkson. 

      Billy points to a MAN (CLARKSON) a few feet behind Farooq.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Damn...

                                  RICK
                    Who s that?

                                  BILLY
                    Clarkson, Homeland Security. We re in 
                    potential hot water. Operating within 
                    U.S. Borders. Failing to share 
                      intelligence...

      Farooq climbs into his Mercedes. 

                                  CASEY
                    Target s on the move. 

      Michael digs an envelop from his pocket, hands it to Rick.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Make contact with Clarkson. Give him 
                    this copy of our coordination codes. 
                    And by all means treat him nicely-- 
                    he could have all our necks.                                                         14.       


      Billy swings Rick s door open. Rick jumps out. The others 
      speed off in pursuit of the businessman. Rick spots Clarkson 
      getting into his own car -- pulling into traffic.

      Rick chases him on foot. Rick darts across four lanes of 
      moving traffic-- dodging a UPS truck-- and in the process 
      getting clipped by the truck mirror. Rick goes flying. He 
      bounces off the sidewalk-- and right back onto his feet. 

      Rick finally catches Clarkson s car, pulling open the 
      passenger door as it rolls to a stop at a light. 

      INT. CLARKSON S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Clarkson instinctively reaches for his shoulder weapon when 
      Rick drops into the passenger seat. Rick waves his I.D.. 

                                  RICK
                    No! No! It s cool! I m CIA! We re 
                    tracking your man, Farooq. Here--

      Rick hands the envelope out for Clarkson. Who doesn t seem to 
      know what to make of the offer. 

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    --our coordination codes. We, I-- 
                    want you to have them. As a sign of 
                    mutual, respectful and cooperation 
                    between our two great agencies. 

      Clarkson smiles and plucks the envelope from Rick s hand 
      before answering... in Russian.

                                  CLARKSON
                      Spa-see-ba.

                                  RICK
                    What?

                                  CLARKSON
                          (Russian, subtitled)
                    I accept your offer of friendship.

                                  RICK
                    You... you re Russian?

                                  CLARKSON
                          (Russian, subtitled)
                    And you are CIA. We have much to 
                    discuss. Are you seeking asylum?

                                  RICK
                    I... uh... wha?

      Rick swings open the passenger door and dives out.                                                         15.       


      EXT. D.C. STREET - CONTINUOUS

      Rick slams into the gutter. The Russian s car speeds off. 
      Rick struggles to his feet-- his shoulder seriously out of 
      whack. Billy s sedan pulls up. Billy leans out.

                                  BILLY
                    Get in.

      INT. BILLY S SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

      Rick slides inside. Dazed and confused. All three men smile, 
      enjoying the sight of their disheveled friend. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You re understandably confused. It s 
                    because you ve been set up. Duped. We 
                    made up the mission. We made up the 
                    threat. We made up Farooq. We did all 
                    of that to trick you into climbing 
                    into a car and handing an envelope to 
                    a known Russian operative. Casey?

      Casey displays a digital camera. He turns the viewer towards 
      Rick and thumbs through photographs of him handing the 
      envelope to the Russian. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    That there s some pretty damning 
                    stuff. Selling secrets to the 
                    Russians? You re looking at life 
                    without parole. 

      Rick s head is seriously spinning. 

                                  RICK
                    But... why?

                                  CASEY
                    You think we don t have ways of 
                    knowing Higgins recruited you to spy 
                    on us? 

                                  BILLY
                    You placed your trust on the wrong 
                    horse, son.

                                    MICHAEL
                    This is day one for you, right? Then 
                    consider this your first big lesson 
                    about life on the inside: Trust 
                    within The Agency isn t earned, it s 
                    owned. And now we own you.

                                        END OF TEASER                                                         16.       


                                            ACT ONE

      INT. BILLY S CAR - IN FRONT OF RICK S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Night has settled as Billy s sedan pulls to a stop in front 
      of Rick s apartment. Billy and Rick the only passengers.

      Rick makes no move to get out. Instead he silently sulks. 
      Billy decides it s time to lighten the mood.

                                  BILLY
                    I love winter in D.C. It always 
                    reminds me of summer in Scotland.

                                  RICK
                    You ve gotta believe-- I m not a 
                      double-crossing kind of guy. I m not. 
                    It wasn t my idea to be a mole. The 
                    Director manipulated me into saying 
                    yes before I even knew what I was 
                    saying yes to! If I m guilty of 
                    anything it s that I m easily duped 
                    by authority figures.  
                          (then)
                    Which you obviously pegged.

                                  BILLY
                    You traded your soul-- your honor-- 
                    for the promise of a job. Now, I can 
                    tell you ve got the heart of a hero, 
                    but heart isn t enough to survive in 
                    the spy game. You need cunning. You 
                    need to be able to sniff out 
                      deception, manipulation. You need to 
                    think three steps ahead at all times.

                                  RICK
                      I understand. And I m not making 
                      excuses... but it was my first day. 

      Rick climbs out of the car. Billy feeling bad for the kid. 
      The passenger window comes down. Billy leans out.

                                  BILLY
                    Don t despair, lad. From where I sit 
                    you ve still got a bright future with 
                    The Agency. Provided you play your 
                    cards right. 

      Billy slides back into the driver s seat. Starts the car. 

                                  RICK
                    Wait... what? What are you talking 
                    about?! What cards do I have?!                                                          17.       


      Billy drives off. Rick frantically calls after him.

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    I HAVE CARDS?!!

      EXT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - QUAD - DAY

      Rick hustles across the quad. A new day and a new shirt-- but 
      the same suit-- looking a bit tattered from his roll in the 
      gutter. As Rick enters the building he passes Blanke soaking 
      up the sun. Blanke cheerfully salutes.

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ODS - DAY

      Rick enter the ODS. The guys are already there, feet up, 
      thumbing through stacks of internal reports.

                                  CASEY
                    No coffee? You should have brought 
                    coffee. It would have gone a long way 
                    to winning us back. 

      Rick s not there to listen. He s been up most of the night 
      thinking and he s got something to say.

                                  RICK
                    You guys don t own me! You think you 
                    own me-- but you don t! Sure you ve 
                    got incriminating photos of me 
                    passing sensitive secrets to the 
                    Russians. But I have an eight hundred 
                    pound gorilla in my corner. I am 
                      sanctioned by the Director Of 
                      Clandestine Operations. A powerful, 
                    powerful man. And a man that is no 
                    fan of yours-- by the way. So I say 
                    show him the pictures! And I say 
                    he ll pick my word over yours!

      Rick finally catches his breath. That felt good. The guys 
      share a look: who wants to field this? It s silently decided 
      that Michael will return the volley. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    We wouldn t show the pictures to 
                    Higgins. We would leak the pictures 
                    to the press. And then you would 
                    become so toxic that Higgins would be 
                    left with no choice but to deny any 
                      connection. In fact, he would likely 
                    end up leading an investigation into 
                    your double-agent activities and no 
                    doubt recommend harsh punishment. 

      Rick realizes that Michael s right. He spins on Billy.                                                          18.       


                                  RICK
                    You said I had cards!

                                  BILLY
                    I say a lot of things I don t mean.

      Michael jumps to his feet. Snags the surveillance camera off 
      of Casey s desk.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Relax. As Higgins  committed minion 
                    you still have double-agent value to 
                    us. With that in mind, we ve come up 
                    with a way for you to earn your 
                    freedom. 

      Michael pops the photo-card from the camera. Waves it in 
      front of Rick.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    We will destroy these photos-- 
                    freeing you from certain 
                      incarceration. If, in return, you 
                    agree to do a small job for us. 

                                  RICK
                    Agreed.

      Michael frowns: what a disappointment this kid. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You see? That there s your problem. 
                    You keep saying yes to jobs before 
                    you know what they are. 

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      MOMENTS LATER. A FILE FOLDER lands on a desk. It opens to 
      reveal a photo labeled  RICHARD ALDRIDGE (40s). Trim, 
      distinguished, perhaps a little bookish.

      NEW ANGLE reveals Rick now at his desk, reviewing the file. 
      Michael and Billy hovering over him. Pointing out details.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Richard Aldridge. AP print reporter. 
                    He s been held hostage by Sudanese 
                    rebels for coming on five months. 

                                  BILLY
                    The AP has tried repeatedly to 
                    negotiate his release but every time 
                    they think they ve reached an 
                    agreement the rebels simply up the 
                    ransom. It currently stands at eight 
                    million dollars.                                                         19.       


      Michael reaches past Rick, pulling a video up on his desktop. 
      Michael hits PLAY.

                                    MICHAEL
                    This video came to us yesterday. 
                    Courtesy of a French courier...

      ON THE SCREEN

      Richard Aldridge faces us. Seated on the ground. In a tent. 
      Despite his emaciated appearance and filthy condition he 
      still somehow manages to project a core sense of dignity.

                                    RICHARD ALDRIDGE
                    ...my hosts have become increasingly 
                      frustrated with your slow response 
                    to their latest demands. Beginning 
                    Monday I am to be denied food and 
                    water until the full ransom is 
                      delivered. I have been instructed to 
                    tell you that this is not a threat. 
                          (with difficulty)
                      I suggest... no implore you to take 
                    them for their word...

      Michael hits PAUSE. Rick is left staring at the troubling 
      image of a man losing all hope. Casey leans in, showing his 
      wristwatch to Michael. 

                                  CASEY
                    If this is going to happen then we d 
                    better hustle.  

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY

      Casey and Michael flank Rick. The men move at a fast clip.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We ve tried repeatedly to get Higgins 
                    to authorize a rescue mission. But 
                    he s turned us down every time.

                                  RICK
                    Why?

                                  CASEY
                      Gutlessness. He s the kind of guy 
                    that thinks you can steal second --
                    while keeping one foot on first.

      Rick looks to Michael for clarification.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What Casey s trying to say is that 
                    Higgins defines success as the 
                    absence of failure. 
                                  (MORE)                                                         20.       

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    By not authorizing ops he doesn t 
                    risk mission failure.  Inaction  has 
                    become the battle cry of The Agency. 

      Blanke falls in step with the guys. 

                                  BLANKE
                    Morning! What are we up to?

      Casey snarls at Blanke.

                                  CASEY
                    Back off! Right now!

      Blanke throws up his hands: no offense. As he recedes--

                                  BLANKE
                    Weather report for tomorrow says 
                    rain! Don t forget your umbrellas!

                                  CASEY
                    Freakin  zombie.

                                  RICK
                    Uh... what s the deal with that guy 
                    anyway? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    His program was cut. He s got no 
                    office. No place to report. So he s 
                    stuck  walking the halls.  Which is 
                    tough because I think he s still 
                    seven years from retirement.

      They arrive at a set of double doors labeled: Briefing Room. 
      Michael thrusts the Aldridge file back into Rick s hands.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Here s your task: You re expected to 
                    go into this Clandestine Briefing -- 
                    raise the Aldridge issue-- and 
                    convince Higgins to authorize a 
                    rescue mission. Which we-- the ODS-- 
                    will spearhead. In return, should 
                    you prove successful, we ll give you 
                    back your freedom.

      Rick considers the challenge at hand. 

                                  RICK
                    How am I expected to succeed with the 
                    Director where you ve always failed?                                                         21.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    It s a long-shot, but something tells 
                    me he just might say yes to his 
                    trusted  man on the inside. 

                                  CASEY
                    Meaning you, mole.

      Michael motions to the double-doors.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Well, you d better get in there. 
                    Meeting started forty minutes ago. 

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

      A typical conference room. Twenty operatives in attendance. 
      Higgins leading the meeting. Everyone s attention is directed 
      to a video wall -- displaying real time satellite images. 

      Rick slips in, hoping not to be noticed. But in a room full 
      of career spies that feat is simply impossible. 

      Rick takes the only free seat. Which happens to be next to 
      FAY CARSON, 30s. Fay is a seasoned analyst, and a woman that 
      exudes the rare combination of extreme confidence and great 
      warmth -- rendering her infinitely crush-worthy.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    ...Ms. Carson. See what we can do 
                    about triangulating our concerns. The 
                    Georgian government-- as it were-- 
                    could prove helpful.

                                  FAY
                    Yes, sir.

      Higgins turns his attention to Rick. 

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    I d like everyone to welcome Mr. 
                    Martinez. A shiny new star in The 
                    Agency constellation.

      Rick glances around the table. The collective  welcome  is 
      unquestionably chilly. Higgins addresses Rick.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    We were just finishing up. Did you 
                    have business that needs addressing?

                                  RICK
                    Um... actually, sir, I was hoping you 
                    might reconsider your position on the 
                    Aldridge hostage situation.                                                         22.       


      Higgins finds it impossible to hide his displeasure. He 
      hadn t expected this subject to come up.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Read your case file. Mr. Aldridge is 
                    a French citizen. That, per national 
                      interests, makes him a French 
                    problem.

                                  RICK
                    But he has dual citizenship. He s 
                    lived here most of his life. More 
                      importantly-- he s All American. 
                      Literally. He played cornerback for 
                    Florida State.

      Higgins leans back in his chair, assuming a patronizing tone.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    These briefings are about bringing 
                    new information. Do you have new 
                      information on Mr. Aldridge?

                                  RICK
                    We know that the rebels have cut off 
                    food and water--

      Higgins jumps on Rick s assertion.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    The rebels have made a threat. A 
                    threat does not constitute actionable 
                      intelligence. 

                                  RICK
                    But isn t this one time when the 
                    threat is enough?

      Higgins answers the question by changing subjects. He points 
      Rick s attention to the live satellite feed. 

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    These images are coming from the 
                      Chetznian-Azerbaidzhan border. A 
                    known haven for Al-Qaeda 
                      sympathizers. Give me your 
                      assessment. What are we looking at?

      The satellite images show pixilated people passing in and out 
      of some sort of underground facility.

                                  RICK
                    It appears to be some sort of bunker.                                                          23.       


                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    The opening isn t large enough to 
                    suggest it s an operating nuclear 
                    facility. Which leads you to 
                      believe...

                                  RICK
                    ...it s an ammunition cache. 

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Making it a site possibly worthy of a 
                      pre-emptive strike.

                                  RICK
                    Yes. I suppose so.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Ms. Carson, would you care to bring 
                    Mr. Martinez up to speed?

                                  FAY
                          (a bit reluctantly)
                    It s not a bunker. It s a root 
                    cellar. Those are potato farmers 
                    storing potatoes for winter. 

      Rick feels sufficiently embarrassed. 

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                      Actionable intelligence, Mr. 
                    Martinez. I d recommend you take the 
                    time to understand it s true meaning. 
                    Thank you, everyone. That s all for 
                    today.
                          (to Rick)
                    Stay put. 

      Rick braces. Shit. The room empties. 

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      MOMENTS LATER. Director Higgins prepares himself a cup of 
      coffee. He takes his time returning to the conference table-- 
      where Rick awaits-- silently freaking out.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    It s clear to me that Michael has 
                    been whispering in your ear. Sounding 
                    the charge to battle. I feel 
                    compelled to remind you that he is a 
                    dangerous man. A man who s inflated 
                    ego habitually masquerades as 
                      uncompromising heroics. 

      Higgins sits next to Rick. His tone calming, even fatherly.                                                         24.       


                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    But heroics must be balanced with 
                    risk. Physical and political. To you 
                    it must appear Mr. Aldridge is 
                    caught in a dangerous game of 
                    chicken between us and the French. I 
                    assure you nothing could be further 
                    from the truth. 

                                  RICK
                    So what is the truth?

      Higgins sips coffee, confident he holds all the cards.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                      Unfortunately, the truth lives above 
                    your pay-grade. Give me your cell.

      Rick hands over his cell phone. Higgins programs in a number.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    This is my personal cell. Call me 
                    anytime. I want you to succeed. More 
                    than everyone. In fact I may be the 
                    only true friend you have in The 
                    Agency. 

      Higgins hands the phone back to Rick. 

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    So, how is our little project going? 
                    Have you dug me up anything useful on 
                    the ODS?

      Rick doesn t know how to answer this loaded question. The 
      best he can come up with on short notice--

                                  RICK
                    Still no... actionable intelligence. 

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ELEVATORS - DAY

      Rick steps into an open elevator. He finds himself riding 
      alongside Fay. They exchange a look of recognition before 
      settling in for a silent ride. Finally--

                                  FAY
                    You know, I wouldn t sweat your call 
                    back there. Half the room voted to 
                    bomb the potato people.

      Before Rick s allowed any comfort by her words-- his cell 
      BINGS. He s gotten a text message -- from Michael. 

       Heard you tanked with Higgins.  BING.  Important you 
      succeed.  BING.  A gentle reminder...  BING.                                                          25.       


      A PDF of Rick handing an envelope to the Russian operative 
      appears. Rick lets out a tiny eek of discomfort.

                                  FAY (CONT D)
                    You seem stressed.

                                  RICK
                    Do I?

                                  FAY
                    I bet I know what s wrong.

                                  RICK
                      I seriously doubt that.

      Fay takes Rick s doubt as a professional challenge. She turns 
      to face him head-on.

                                  FAY
                    You ve been on the job less than a 
                    week and already you ve managed to 
                    land yourself on the battle line of 
                    some twisted turf war between 
                    Director Higgins and the operatives 
                    of the ODS. You find yourself being 
                    squeezed, flattered, and threatened 
                    all at the same time. And every 
                    option presented to you feels like a 
                      career-ender. Your heart pounds every 
                    time you enter a room-- your head 
                    spins every time you leave. And at 
                    this very moment you re seriously 
                      considering listening to that little 
                    voice in your head saying Run away. 
                    Run away. It s not too late to apply 
                    to grad school. I can still manage a 
                    fall-back career in teaching.

      Rick takes in Fay s spot on assessment.

                                  FAY (CONT D)
                    Of course I m guessing on the 
                    teaching part. I could just as easily 
                    picture you as a pharmacist.

                                  RICK
                    You re... good.

                                  FAY
                    Well, I m a pro.

      The elevator doors open. Fay steps out. She turns, holding 
      the door open and smiles, inviting.                                                         26.       


                                  FAY (CONT D)
                    I could really go for a steak. You 
                    like steak? I m betting you do.

      INT. D.C. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

      Fay and Rick have been served dinner at the bar of a fancy 
      D.C. Steakhouse. Fay sips from a frosty martini, savoring the 
      flavor, while Rick unloads his stress.  

                                  RICK
                    I don t get it. Why does the Director 
                    need me? Why doesn t he just crush 
                    these guys with his awesome powers?

                                  FAY
                    You ve got to remember that Higgins 
                    is mid-management. The ODS has 
                    friends in high places. They are 
                      protected, and will remain so right 
                    up to the point where they screw up. 
                    At which time, Higgins will most 
                    certainly step in and crush them.
                          (then)
                    You re familiar with the concept of 
                    office politics? Ours come with 
                    poison pills and guns.

                                  RICK
                    But I thought our job was to fight 
                    the enemy? That we re entrusted to 
                    protect our country, not our careers.

                    You are seriously adorable. I 
                    remember when I started working for 
                    the CIA. And I see it in your eyes-- 
                    the hope... The unvarnished dream of 
                    saving the world from evil deeds and 
                    evil people. Adorable.

                                  RICK
                    I... I feel like I m fighting for 
                    survival here. 

                                  FAY
                    That s because you ve got to pick a 
                    side in this fight: Higgins, or the 
                    ODS. No one survives in the spy game 
                      unprotected. 

                                  RICK
                    But how do I know who to trust?                                                         27.       


                                  FAY
                    You can t turn to another spy for 
                    that answer. You can only trust 
                    yourself. Trust your ability to 
                    recognize the choices that are right 
                    and wrong-- for you. Then live with 
                    the consequences. 

      Fay polishes off her martini.

                                  FAY (CONT D)
                    But enough with the shop talk. Tell 
                    me something about you that I can t 
                    expertly deduce?

                                  RICK
                    Like what?

                                  FAY
                    Like... are you seeing anyone?

                                  RICK
                    Not right this moment. No.

                                  FAY
                    Any serious relationships behind you?

      Rick laughs. This is a touchy subject with him.

                                  RICK
                    Tons of them.

                                  FAY
                    Tons?

                                  RICK
                    Yeah, the thing is I tend to get 
                    serious with a woman way too soon. 
                    Which probably explains why I don t 
                    land many second dates.

                                  FAY
                    You fall in love too fast. I think 
                    that s great. It means you re 
                      emotionally open. A quality seriously 
                    lacking in the men I usually date, 
                    who-- as you can imagine tend to be 
                    rather secretive creatures.
                          (then)
                    I have this crazy theory about dating 
                    in The Agency. Would you like to hear 
                    it?

                                  RICK
                    Sure...                                                         28.       


      Fay turns to face Rick, excited for the opportunity to share. 

                                  FAY
                    Okay, here goes: Commit to being a 
                    couple on the first date. Then work 
                    out the relationship details later. 
                    You know, sexual compatibility, 
                    religious compatibility. The whole 
                    making babies issue... Marriage.
                          (then)
                    Look at us for example. If we wanted 
                    to couple up we d have to commit 
                    tonight. Right this minute. Because 
                    within a week we d be keeping so many 
                    secrets from one another that it 
                    would doom any hope of us surviving a 
                    normal courtship.

      Rick becomes aware Fay s hands are now resting on his knees.

                                  RICK
                    Are... you trying to seduce me?

                                  FAY
                    No. I... is that where you re 
                    thinking this is headed? Or is it 
                    where you re hoping it s headed?

      Rick gives this question serious thought.

                                  RICK
                    Both? I m sorry. My capacity to 
                    reason is a bit off these days.

      Fay takes no offense. Instead she is utterly charmed.

                                  FAY
                    You are seriously adorable. I m 
                    having another martini. You in?

      Rick notices Michael standing at the back of the restaurant. 
      He motions for Rick to join him.

                                  RICK
                    Sure. Excuse me. Potty break. 

      Rick slides off the bar stool. He heads for the back.

      EXT. ALLEYWAY - BEHIND D.C. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

      Michael drags Rick out of the rear entrance of the 
      restaurant. He pulls him down the dark alleyway.

                                  RICK
                    What are you doing?                                                         29.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    Saving your ass. You obviously don t 
                    know Fay works for Higgins.  

                                  RICK
                    She does?

                                    MICHAEL
                    She s his Primary Analyst. His right 
                    hand gal. His functioning brain. 
                          (then)
                    My guess is that Higgins knows that 
                    we know he sent you to spy on us.

                                  RICK
                    You think Fay was working me?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Have you stepped in front of a mirror 
                    lately? That woman is way out of your 
                    league. Why else would she be wining 
                    and dining a newby like you?

      Billy s sedan screeches to a stop beside them. 

      INT. BILLY S CAR - NIGHT

      Michael and Rick pile into the back seat. Billy at the wheel. 
      In the passenger seat a rather slight Frenchman, VIDOR. 

                                  VIDOR
                          (to Michael)
                    I do not bring good news. My 
                      government buckled to CIA pressures. 
                    We sent two agents in to negotiate 
                    the release of Aldridge. And we... 
                    well... we lost them.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Killed?

                                  VIDOR
                    Vanished. Poof. For my government, 
                    there is no appetite for further loss 
                    of life. We informed your director-- 
                    with hopes he would step in. But, 
                    sadly, he does not trust our account 
                    of the lost agents. He fears we play 
                    a game with him.

      This news doesn t seem to bother Michael. In fact it appears 
      to invigorate the man. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Well, then. It falls to us to get it 
                    done. Billy?                                                         30.       


                                  BILLY
                    Agreed. We ll get it done.

                                  RICK
                    What are you getting done?

                                    MICHAEL
                    We re going to travel to Sudan 
                    without Agency authorization and 
                    rescue Aldridge.

                                  VIDOR
                    They are doing what Americans do best-
                    - they are going rogue.

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ODS - DAY

      Rick sits at this desk. The guys enter the office and crowd 
      over him -- a trio of Cheshire Cats.

                                  BILLY
                    This is your lucky day, lad. You are 
                    about to be granted a second shot at 
                    securing your freedom.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Our mission requires a translator. An 
                    Arabic speaking translator. 
                      Interested in making a trade?

                                  RICK
                    I m pretty sure Central Sudanese 
                    tribes speak Juba. Which is a 
                    regional form of pigeon Arabic. 

      The guys stare -- that matters how?

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    Which I am also versed in. Just 
                    saying...

                                    MICHAEL
                    If you re on board, sign this.

      A legal looking form is placed on the desk.

                                  RICK
                    What is it? A nondisclosure form?

                                  CASEY
                    It s a W-2. You ll need to become an 
                    employee of our corporation.

      Rick s examining the documents. He reads:

                                  RICK
                    Salvation America?

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s our non-profit foundation. We 
                    maintain it as a cover for crossing 
                      international borders-- when Agency 
                      deniability is required. 

                                  BILLY
                    It also comes in handy in times like 
                    these-- when flying below Agency 
                    radar is required.                                                         32.       


      Rick draws a breath -- here we go again-- he signs the form.

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY

      Michael leads our team down the hall. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I ve got us booked on a flight to 
                    Cairo. Leaves Reagan at six-forty. 
                    From Cairo we ll piggy-back a CTC 
                    hopper into Khartum. 

                                  BILLY
                      Logistical support?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m calling in favors with some 
                    friends at SIS. We ll be covered. 
                          (to Rick)
                    There s a travel warning for all of 
                    North Africa. Yellow Fever outbreak.
                    I don t suppose you ve been 
                      inoculated?

                                  RICK
                    I m pretty sure I had a tetanus shot 
                    in the third grade.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We ll have to deal with that.
                          (then)
                    The plan is to contact the Rebels, 
                    present ourselves as representatives 
                    for the AP and pay the ransom. 

                                  BILLY
                    And who exactly are you planning to 
                    hit up for eight million--? 

      Billy cuts off his own question-- when he sees that Michael 
      has lead them to the COUNTERFEIT RECOVERY OFFICE. 

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Oh, I see where this is headed.

                                  CASEY
                    Looks like you guys got this covered. 
                    I m going to hit the gym. Maybe sneak 
                    in a massage. We re looking at one 
                    helluva long flight.

      Casey peels off. Rick turns to Billy.

                                  RICK
                    Is he always so helpful?                                                         33.       


                                  BILLY
                    Don t worry about Casey. At crunch 
                    time he ll bring it. 

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - COUNTERFEIT RECOVERY - DAY

      The guys enter the Counterfeit Recovery Office. DORIS BALSHIK 
      (40s), a sour-eyed woman that clearly favors her love of 
      fried foods over her figure, types away at her desk.  

      Billy plants himself on her desk. He turns on the charm, 
      unleashing his pitch perfect Sean Connery impersonation.

                                  BILLY
                          (as Connery)
                    Hello, Ms. Moneypenny. You look 
                    ravishing today. 

      Balshik starts, unimpressed.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                          (as Connery)
                    This is the part where you pretend not 
                    to be charmed. But flirt shamelessly 
                      nonetheless -- before ultimately 
                    granting me the favor I so desperately 
                    need. And in return I agree to submit -
                    - at some distant time -- to your 
                    deepest carnal desires.

                                    BALSHIK
                    I m not really a Connery fan.

                                  BILLY
                          (as Connery)
                    How s that possible? This accent is a 
                    siren s call to reckless fornication. 

                                    BALSHIK
                    Not for me. Maybe if you could manage 
                    a Tobey Maguire accent.

                                  BILLY
                    You re joking.

                                    BALSHIK
                    What can I say. I like a lap-size man.

      Balshik s gaze settles on Rick-- sizing him up. Rick makes a 
      point of appearing as tall as possible.

      Michael steps in to take his shot at Balshik.                                                         34.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    We really need your help, Balshik. 
                    And we re willing to make it worth 
                    your while. A trade perhaps...

                                    BALSHIK
                    A trade? You mean a bribe. And that 
                    simply won t fly. What are you going 
                    to bribe me with, Dorset? Money? I 
                    work for the Counterfeit Office. I m 
                    sitting on billions. Offer me a 
                      promotion? Forget it. I m not the 
                    least bit interested in climbing the 
                    ladder around here. I like my little 
                    corner of the world. 

      Michael is nonplussed by the resistance. He already has this 
      woman s number.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What about Greece?

      Michael motions to not one, but three desk calendars --
      displaying the beaches and azure blue waters of Greece.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    What if I could get you stationed in 
                    Greece? Then would you be willing to 
                    make a trade?

                                    BALSHIK
                    You can make that happen?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I spent three weeks in a Serbian tool 
                    shed duct taped to the Mediterranean 
                    Field Director. In his darkest hours 
                    my co-captive confided in me a rather 
                    colorful array of personal failings 
                    and professional malfeasances.
                          (then)
                    Trust me, I can make it happen.

      Balshik s interest is clearly peaked.

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE ROOM - DAY

      The lights POP ON in this tiny storage room. Balshik leads 
      our guys inside. We discover bundles of cash, wrapped in 
      cellophane stacked high on a folding table. 

      Balshik tears open one of the bundles of cash. Hands them 
      each a one hundred dollar bill.                                                         35.       


                                    BALSHIK
                    We just picked these up in Hong Kong. 
                    It s top notch work. Bleached five 
                    dollar bills reprinted as one 
                    hundreds. Only they seriously screwed 
                    up. Can you spot it?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Watermark is off.

                                    BALSHIK
                    Most people won t notice that. I m 
                    talking about the big mistake.

      Michael flips the bill, recognizing the mistake.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You ve got to be kidding me...

      Rick and Billy flip their bills -- unable to spot the flaw. 

                                  RICK
                          (to Billy)
                    What am I missing?

                                  BILLY
                    Beats me. I m still looking for a 
                    Prime Minister. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    The back is printed upside down. See? 
                    Flip the bill over and it s not 
                      noticeable. Flip it side to side-- 
                      impossible to miss.

                                  BILLY
                          (to Balshik)
                    You ve nothing laying around that 
                    might prove less fatal for us?

                                    BALSHIK
                    You want to walk out of here with 
                    eight million dollars-- this is as 
                    good as it gets.

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - INFIRMARY - DAY

      Rick sits on an examination table in the CIA Infirmary. His 
      shirt off. A NURSE finishes administering a shot and exits. 
      Rick rubs his shoulder, feeling some discomfort as--

      Fay enters, her mood sour.

                                  RICK
                    Oh. You... I mean... hello.                                                         36.       


                                  FAY
                    Higgins is gunning for you.

                                  RICK
                    What?

                                  FAY
                    He s picked up chatter. He s convinced 
                    the ODS is inserting themselves in 
                    this Aldridge problem. Are they?

                                  RICK
                    I... am not at liberty to say.

                                  FAY
                    Look, I can only warn you. I can t 
                    protect you. Nor am I inclined to. By 
                    the way, you owe me fifty-four bucks 
                    for that steak dinner. 

                                  RICK
                    I m so sorry about that. I got pulled 
                    away. 

                                  FAY
                    By Michael, no doubt.

                                  RICK
                    He was saving me... from whatever 
                    nefarious plan you were, you know, 
                    seducing me for.

                                  FAY
                    And you believed him?

                                  RICK
                    Well... yeah.

                                  FAY
                    Because I m the evil ex.

                                  RICK
                    No... wait? Ex?

      Fay realizes that Rick is in the dark.

                                  FAY
                    You don t know. Yes, ex. Michael and 
                    I used to be married. Until I 
                    divorced him for being too damn 
                      controlling. Which, apparently, was a 
                    message he failed to receive!

      Rick once again finds himself behind the eight ball.                                                         37.       


                                  RICK
                    So, you weren t spying for Higgins? I 
                    mean, you really did like me? 

                                  FAY
                    Yes. I really did like you. Note the 
                    past tense phrasing.  

      Fay turns to go.

                                  RICK
                    How did you know? How did you know 
                    where to find me?

                                  FAY
                    Director Higgins programmed your 
                    phone with a tracking code. You re in 
                    the system. He knows where you are at 
                    all times. 

      Rick pulls out his cell. Holds it like a toxic hot-potato. 

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS - DAY

      Higgins is at his desk. His Aide standing dutifully by his 
      side. His desktop displays a GRID of CIA headquarters -- 
      where an electronic PULSE indicated Rick s exact location. 
      Higgins resigns himself to a tough decision. 

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Bring him in.

                                  AIDE
                          (into earpiece)
                    We re a GO.

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - VARIOUS/INTERCUT - DAY

      A SECURITY DETAIL sweeps down the hall, directions buzzing in 
      their earwigs.  Main Entrance... Central corridor... 

      HIGGINS  OFFICE. The Director calmly wipes a smudge from the 
      glass case housing his treasured U-2 flightsuit. 

      MAIN LOBBY. The Security Detail BLASTS through the front 
      entrance, spilling into the main lobby, trampling over the 
      CIA seal. The main lobby appears empty.

      COMPUTER MONITOR. Rick s PULSE indicates he s there.

      MAIN LOBBY. The Security Detail zig-zags through the lobby, 
      checking behind every pillar. They complete their sweep-- 
      nearly colliding with one another. No sign of Rick.

      HIGGINS  OFFICE. The Aide, losing his cool, angrily barks--                                                         38.       


                                  AIDE
                    He s gotta be there! You should be 
                    looking right at him!

      Higgins steps back to his desk, considering the puzzle: We 
      see on the monitor that his security detail has surrounded a 
      PULSE --but no Rick. And with almost zero effort deduces...

                                    HIGGINS
                    He s on the roof. 

      MAIN LOBBY. The Security Detail looks straight up. Duh.

      STAIRWELL. BAM! The door flies open. The Security Detail 
      sprints up the stairs, taking them three at a time. 

      ROOFTOP. The Detail arrives, spotting a FIGURE in the 
      distance step behind an elevator housing -- and out of view. 
      The Detail splits into two groups, surrounding the housing.

      BEHIND ELEVATOR HOUSING. The Security Detail rounds the 
      corner, stopping short at the sight of--

      Blanke -- tossing birdseed to ravenous pigeons. He grins at 
      the Security Detail, unconcerned by his discovery.

                                  BLANKE
                    What up, my bros?

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS - DAY

      A bag of birdseed is dropped onto Director Higgins  desk 
      alongside Rick s cell phone.

                                  AIDE
                    His phone was stuffed in the bag of 
                    birdseed. 

                                    HIGGINS
                    And just when I was beginning to 
                    think him an idiot.

      Rick s cell phone RINGS. Higgins contemplates the meaning. Is 
      this some sort of game? He lifts the phone to his ear.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Hello..? No, this is his boss. No, I 
                    don t know. Yes, I will relay the 
                    message. You have a great day too.

      Higgins ends the call. His Aide stares. What happened?

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    That was his mother. She s wondering 
                    where her son is.                                                          39.       


      Higgins flings the cell onto his desk.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    That is the burning question...

      EXT. SUDANESE DESERT - AID STATION - DAY

      A C-130 Cargo Prop Plane touches down on a remote desert 
      airstrip and taxis to a stop.

      Michael is hit with a blast of desert heat as he cracks open 
      the door. He spots a man waiting on the tarmac. This is...

      VINCENT FURIO, 30s, their Italian contact. Vincent is decked 
      out in a sport coat and long pants. Evidently fashion trumps 
      comfort for this particular Italian. Standing alongside 
      Vincent, holding a serving tray covered with bottled cokes, 
      is his smallish Sudanese ASSISTANT.

      Vincent greets Michael and the others with hearty hugs as 
      they climb down the gangplank. Michael introduces Rick. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Vincent, this is Martinez. He s part 
                    of our team.

                                    VINCENT
                    A fourth Musketeer!? Fantastic! 

      Vincent embraces Rick. Then points to the cokes.

                                    VINCENT (CONT D)
                    Welcome! Enjoy a frosty beverage!

      Michael snags a couple of sodas, hands a bottle to Rick. The 
      baked glass burns his hands.

                                  RICK
                    Ow! They re hot.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We re six hundred miles from a 
                    working refrigerator. You re expected 
                    to use your imagination.

      EXT. SUDANESE DESERT - AID CAMP - DAY

      The camp is a staging area for distributing aid supplies. We 
      see large crates of aid being loaded into U.N. supply trucks. 
      In an open tent we find Vincent and Michael hunched over a 
      folding table, reviewing a map, conversing in Italian. Billy 
      and Casey check their GPS system-- comparing their position 
      with their location on the map. Vincent indicates--                                                         40.       


                                    VINCENT
                    We are here-- approximately fourteen 
                      kilometers from the rebel encampment.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What can you tell us about the big 
                    boss?

      Michael lifts a photograph of a REBEL on horseback wearing 
      fatigues and designer shades, posing with an AK-47 on his 
      hip. A war criminal s equivalent of a publicity photo.

                                    VINCENT
                    His name is Doji. Ask him and he ll 
                    say he s waging war against Southern 
                    Sudan succession. Ask me and I say he 
                    murders, rapes and terrorizes for 
                    money. That said, you ll find him a 
                      reasonable fellow. 

                                    MICHAEL
                      Reasonable?

                                    VINCENT
                    This country has been locked in a 
                    civil war for fifty years. Savagery 
                    has become the national pastime. Doji 
                    is a brutal man, yes, but his 
                    judgement remains unclouded by 
                      intractable ideology. He is above all 
                      a profiteer. Much like every soul you 
                    will meet wandering in this desert. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You have horses for us? 

                                    VINCENT
                    Yes, but I suggest you wait until 
                    sunset to begin your journey. It is 
                    suicide to travel in this heat.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Our hostage is on his fourth day 
                    without food or water. We travel 
                      immediately.

      Vincent shrugs: your funeral. 

      EXT. SUDANESE DESERT - DAY

      Blinding sun. Scorched earth. Four riders crest the horizon. 
      The horses limping along, smart enough to conserve energy in 
      the crippling heat. Billy notices Casey coating his nose and 
      cheeks with bright pink zinc sunscreen.                                                         41.       


                                  BILLY
                    That is a beautiful color on you. Not 
                    every man can pull off such a 
                      flamboyant under-shadow.

                                  CASEY
                    They confiscated my good sunscreen at 
                    the airport! That s why I hate-- hate 
                    flying commercial! 

      They ride along for a beat. Billy reads Rick s somber mood. 

                                  BILLY
                    Why the sour puss, lad? We re on 
                      horseback, riding through the heart 
                    of hell to save a man from certain 
                    death! This is heroes work! Trust me, 
                    when you re old and feeble...
                          (indicating Casey)
                    ... like Pink-Cheeks, you ll look 
                    back on these as happy days!

                                  RICK
                    It s just... you re not worried about 
                    what Higgins will do to us when we 
                    get back to the Agency?

      The question momentarily snuffs out the spark in Billy s eye. 
      He flicks his reins, hurrying his steed.

                                  BILLY
                    Only if we fail. Only if we fail...

      EXT. DESERT - (LATER THAT) DAY

      Michael has dismounted. He stands on a rise, holding a pair 
      of binoculars, studying the rebel camp in the valley below. 
      It looks like something out of a Mad Max movie. A patchwork 
      of stolen Red Cross tents and metal huts linked together by 
      rope and wire. Piles of rotting garbage ring the encampment. 

      A Land Cruiser outfitted with a Browning 50 caliber machine 
      gun, and filled with Rebels, speeds out of the camp.

      Michael lowers his binoculars. His mind racing, accessing his 
      options as his partners catch up to him. 

                                  BILLY
                    They re sending out a greeting party. 

      The Land Cruiser stops a couple of hundred yards away. A 
      silent standoff ensues. Michael makes a decision.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Casey, I want you to ride down and 
                    make contact. 
                                  (MORE)                                                         42.       

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Inform them we re representatives 
                    from the paper. That we ve come to 
                    pay Aldridge s ransom.

                                  CASEY
                    Me? What about the kid? He s the one 
                    that speaks Arabic.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Which is why I can t risk having his 
                    head blown off before we settle into 
                      negotiations.

      Michael hands Casey a note.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    This will explain everything.

      Casey reluctantly takes the note. He gallops down the 
      embankment, arriving alongside the Rebels moments later. 

      From their distant viewpoint, Michael, Billy, and Rick watch 
      Casey hand the note to the Rebel Driver. The driver crumples 
      the note, unread, and tosses it back into his face. The 
      Rebels descend on Casey --pulling him from his horse. He s 
      savagely punched and kicked. 

      Casey crawls on his belly -- channeling Don Knotts -- seeking 
      refuge under the truck. Rick turns to the others, confused. 

                                  RICK
                    Human weapon?

                                    MICHAEL
                    No doubt he s picking his moment.

      Casey s dragged out by his feet-- kicking and squirming. A 
      rifle held to his head. He s a hostage now. The Rebels calmly 
      signal for the others to ride down.

                                  BILLY
                    At the risk of sounding disparaging, 
                    I sense we are not dealing with 
                      gentlemen.

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                         43.       


                                          ACT THREE

      EXT. REBEL CAMP - DAY

      The guys are led by gunpoint into the camp. They are brought 
      to a young rebel KAYA(16) -- seated in a makeshift throne -- 
      which consists of a car seat bolted to wooden pallets. Kaya 
      shoulders an AK-47. He fires-- strafing a burned-out U.N. 
      truck. He lowers his rifle as they approach.

                                    MICHAEL
                          (to Rick)
                    Tell him we ve come to negotiate with 
                    Doji for the reporter s release.

      Rick translates. Speaking in Arabic. Kaya responds in kind.

                                  RICK
                    He says that we can t talk to Doji.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why not?

      Rick asks the question. Kaya respond by aiming at a huge 
      mound of garbage. He FIRES, causing the vultures to scatter. 
      When they do we realize the birds were feasting on a human 
      body -- presumably that of the dead rebel leader, Doji.

      Kaya speaks to Rick. He again translates.

                                  RICK
                    He says his name is Kaya. And that he 
                    is in charge now. And that we must 
                    negotiate with him. 

      INT. REBEL CAMP - LATER - DAY

      A BLACK SCORPION tries to climb the walls of a shoebox. A 
      second scorpion in dropped inside the box. 

      WIDER ANGLE: We see that the shoebox rests at Kaya s feet -- 
      where he uses a stick to coax the scorpions to fight. Kaya 
      delights in his tiny gladiator battle, remaining mostly 
      oblivious to--

      OUR GUYS: Seated together on the ground. Still held at 
      gunpoint. Their supplies rifled through by the Rebels. A 
      duffle bag of cash (in bundles) is dumped on the ground. 

      A bundle is broken open, and bills are distributed to Rebels. 
      Our guys watch -- careful not to betray their worry as Rebel 
      after Rebel examines the bills, each man FLIPPING them over. 
      Finally, Kaya is assured the bills are good.                                                         44.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    Tell them that s two million. The 
                    remainder will be brought once we ve 
                    confirmed that Aldridge is alive.

      Rick speaks to Kaya in Arabic. Kaya respond.

                                  RICK
                    He wants to know where you ve hidden 
                    the rest of the money.

                                    MICHAEL
                    That remains a secret until we have 
                    Aldridge safely in hand.

      Rick translates. Kaya grins, responds.

                                  RICK
                    He s asking why he doesn t start 
                    shooting us one by one until we ve 
                    told him where the money is hidden?

      This question momentarily stymies Michael. 

                                  BILLY
                    I ll field this one. 
                          (to Rick)
                    Tell him that bloodshed is bad for 
                    business. That a true leader would 
                      understand that an open hand -- in 
                      negotiations like these --achieves 
                    more than a closed fist.

      Rick translates. Kaya responds. Rick hesitates...

                                    MICHAEL
                    What did he say?

                                  RICK
                    That he doesn t need to shed blood to 
                    find the money. That he can simply 
                    break a few fingers.

      Our guys exchange concerned looks. Kaya grins, understanding 
      his threat has registered.

                                  BILLY
                    Well, he s clearly gained the upper 
                    hand in this negotiation.

      Rick makes a decision. He jumps to his feet. All the rebel 
      guns now trained on him. Rick speaks to Kaya -- quickly, 
      forcefully. We don t know what s being said, but it s clearly 
      gotten the young Rebels undivided attention.                                                          45.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    What did you say?

                                  RICK
                    I blew my cover. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You what?

                                  RICK
                    I told him that I alone know where 
                    the money is hidden. I told him that 
                    I am an elite operative of the CIA. 
                    That breaking my fingers would 
                      accomplish nothing. That I was 
                    trained to endure intense torture. 
                    Trained to beat death itself.

      Kaya stares, attempting to surmise Rick s wild claim.

                                  BILLY
                    I love the bold words, lad, but I 
                    fear he s about to ask for a 
                      demonstration.

                                  RICK
                    Yeah, I know...

      Rick steps forward. He reaches into the shoebox, snagging one 
      of the scorpions by the tail. He raises the squirming 
      creature up and drops it into his mouth. 

      All watch, disgusted and horrified, as Rick devours the live 
      scorpion. Once complete, Rick raises his arms, shrugs-- the 
      scorpion having been eaten with no apparent ill affect. 

      A beat of stunned silence follows. Then--

                                  BILLY
                          (brightly)
                    Highlight of the mission-- right 
                    there!

      Kaya too is apparently impressed. He steps forward, slapping 
      Rick on the back, addresses him in a friendly tone.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What did he say?

                                  RICK
                    He says that I am a fool. And he 
                    wants to know if I have a dying 
                    request.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Tell him you want to see Aldridge.                                                         46.       


      INT. REBEL CAMP - HOSTAGE TENT - DAY

      RICHARD ALDRIDGE sits on the ground, his head resting on his 
      knees -- his breathing labored in the stifling heat. 

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                      Richard... 

      Aldridge raises his eyes, sees Michael standing over him. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    My name is Michael Dorset. I m with 
                    the CIA. We ve come to get you out.

      Michael holds a canteen of water to Aldridge s lips. The 
      reporter clutches the canteen, draining it s contents. 

      Michael takes in the tent -- it is home to a dozen or more 
      civilian captives --mostly white and Asian. All of whom look 
      to be fighting for their lives.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Jesus...

      EXT. REBEL CAMP - HOSTAGE TENT - CONTINUOUS

      Billy, Casey, and Rick await outside with the Rebels. They 
      take a mental count of the full tent.

                                  BILLY
                          (to Rick)
                    Ask who all these people are.

      Rick questions Kaya. Kaya responds with a glimmer of pride. 

                                  RICK
                    Hostages.

      Kaya continues to speak. Rick translates.

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    He says that we are safe to take 
                    Aldridge tomorrow. Provided we bring 
                    the rest of the money. He says that 
                    he wants us to see that he is a 
                      reasonable man. That he can be 
                    trusted to keep the other hostages 
                    alive, presuming ransoms are 
                      forthcoming.

      Kaya extends an open hand to Billy -- as if sealing the 
      business deal. Billy smiles, shakes Kaya s hand and says--

                                  BILLY
                    You, sir, are a royal cocksucker.                                                         47.       


      Kaya looks to Rick for a translation.

                                  RICK
                    I m going to stick with a simple 
                    thank you.

      EXT. DESERT - LATER - DAY

      The men ride away from the rebel camp, the mood somber, the 
      group clearly moved by their encounter with the hostages.

                                  BILLY
                    What was your head count back there?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Fourteen hostages. Chinese oil 
                      speculators. Dutch Aid workers. And 
                    our two missing French Agents. 

                                  CASEY
                    So, what are you thinking? We 
                    planning an extraction? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    The three of us against a hundred-
                    plus heavily armed rebels? Not a 
                    chance.

                                  RICK
                    Four.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What?

                                  RICK
                    There are four of us. You didn t 
                    count me. I m prepared to do 
                      whatever s required. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    As comforting as it is to know we 
                    might have the pleasure of dying in 
                    each other s arms... I still say no. 

                                  BILLY
                    You are aware that half of those poor 
                    souls will starve before their 
                    releases are negotiated.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m not blind to that fact. But the 
                    four of us mounting a suicide mission 
                    won t solve that problem.                                                         48.       


                                  RICK
                    Then I say we contact The Agency -- 
                    share our Intel. There are multiple 
                    lives at stake now--

                                    MICHAEL
                    --which is exactly why they won t 
                    take action. The CIA s not in the 
                    business of rescuing foreigners, 
                      remember?! 

      Rick s sense of outrage getting the best of him, snaps-- 

                                  RICK
                    So your recommendation is  inaction. 

      Michael spins on Rick, all semblance of charm and wit 
      dropping away. His eyes flare from a rarely tapped rage. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Never, ever challenge my courage! I 
                    have not given up on those hostages! 
                    To even suggest otherwise--!

      Michael chokes off his outburst. Which nevertheless places 
      Rick back in his saddle. 

      EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

      Our guys sit around a campfire, contemplating the day. 
      Michael has a stack of files in his lap-- which he scans. 
      Rick finally musters the courage to address Michael.

                                  RICK
                    I m sorry about, you know, what I 
                    said back there.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Don t sweat it. I recognize you were 
                    born stupid. But I also recognize 
                    that you are capable of learning.

                                  RICK
                    I d like to believe I am.
                          (off reports)
                    What s that?

                                    MICHAEL
                    My weekend reading. Internal reports.

                                  RICK
                    You dragged those this whole way?                                                         49.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    I pride myself on keeping up. In case 
                    you didn t know, there are over 
                    seventeen thousand employees at the 
                    CIA. Less than a thousand are core 
                      operatives, like us. Gathering vital 
                    human intel. The rest of them sit 
                    back home generating threat reports. 
                          (off reports)
                    Somewhere in all this clutter-- rests 
                    the oil that will light our lamp.

                                  RICK
                    Lamp?

                                    MICHAEL
                    The lamp we -- the operatives of the 
                    ODS hold high-- as a beacon -- 
                    guiding our once proud agency on its 
                    return to greatness. 

      Billy and Casey share a look: clearly no fans of Michael s 
        sermonizing.

                                  BILLY
                    You know, you re not scoring many 
                    sanity points with the kid by 
                    rambling on like a Knight of the 
                    Round Table.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I think he gets my meaning.

                                  RICK
                    You chose to prioritize results over 
                    risks. I imagine there was a time in 
                    The Agency when they called that 
                      leadership.

      Michael nods, satisfied with the response.

                                  BILLY
                    Well, since we re all in love again, 
                    I think it s high time we gave Mr. 
                    Martinez his present.

      Billy pulls a flash-card from his pocket, tosses it to Rick. 

                                  RICK
                    What s this?

                                  BILLY
                    The pictures of your Russian tryst. 
                    We relinquish ownership. 
                                  (MORE)                                                         50.       

                                  BILLY (CONT'D)
                    You proved yourself to be a man of 
                    action back in that camp. You have 
                    proved yourself worthy of our 
                    respect. You, sir, have earned your 
                    freedom. 

      This unexpected gift catches Rick off guard. It means more to 
      him than he ever expected.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Today I witnessed the bravest thing 
                    I ve ever seen in my life. I watched 
                    a man eat a deadly scorpion. A live 
                    poisonous scorpion. 

                                  RICK
                    Thanks, but it was an Emperor 
                    Scorpion. And they re not lethal. I 
                    know, I had one as a pet. Point of 
                    fact-- they re considered a great 
                    delicacy in parts of central Asia.
                          (then)
                    Although I found the experience... 
                      unpleasant. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I suggest you destroy that flash-card 
                    at the first possible opportunity.

      Rick thinks, then tosses the flash-card into the fire. Billy 
      pulls a flask from his backpack.. 

                                  BILLY
                    I propose a toast. To Senor Rick -- 
                    mission MVP!
                          (to Rick)
                    First honors.

      Rick accepts the flask, feeling compelled to say something. 
      Filled with emotion, flush with a feeling of camaraderie.

                                  RICK
                    Your respect... it means a lot. More 
                    than you can know. The thing is, I 
                    didn t join the CIA to write reports 
                    or earn a pension. I joined to help 
                    make the world safer. 
                          (looking to Billy)
                    I joined to do  heroes work.  When we 
                    get back to The Agency-- and I have 
                    to report to Director Higgins-- I 
                    will tell him that I was proud to 
                    have served with the ODS. If only 
                    even for a week...                                                         51.       


      Rick takes a swig from the flask. He enjoys the burn.

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    That... is... good... stuff.

      Rick turns to hand the flask to Michael. Then, recoils, as if 
      he d just received an invisible punch.

      Rick s eyes roll back in his head and he drops to the ground -
      - knocked out cold. Drugged by his fellow operatives. Michael 
      and Casey share a look: the plan worked. Billy leans over to 
      check Rick s pulse and confirm he s okay.

                                  BILLY
                          (to no one in particular)
                    Sometimes we can be right bastards.

      EXT. REBEL CAMP - MORNING

      Morning light is just breaking over the rebel camp. A Rebel 
      Sentry spots a horse approaching the camp -- and Rick, 
        unconscious, strapped to its back. 

      MOMENTS LATER. Rick is cut loose. He falls to the ground. 
      Landing with a thud-- which jars him awake. Rick struggles to 
      make sense of where he is-- finally piecing together that 
      he s back in the grasp of the Rebels. Shit.

      Kaya leans over Rick. He asks-- 

                                  KAYA
                          (subtitled)
                    Where are your friends?

                                  RICK
                          (subtitled)
                    Damn good question.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                         52.       


                                          ACT FOUR

      EXT. REBEL CAMP - NIGHT

      The hour is late. A few open fires provide what little light 
      there is in the rebel camp. With the exception of a wandering 
      sentry or two, there is no other sign of movement.

      INT. REBEL CAMP - HOSTAGE TENT - SAME

      The Hostages are spread out on the ground, asleep. Among the 
      hostages we find Aldridge, and laying beside him... 

      Rick-- wide awake. His sour expression makes it clear he s 
      not counting sheep, but more likely imagining ways to murder 
      his betraying partners.

      A BAGPIPE melody begins to BLARE through the camp. Rick sits 
      up on his elbows. None of the Hostages stir. He looks out of 
      the tent (the walls of which are mesh) and spots some Rebels 
      chatting by a fire-- oblivious to the blaring bagpipes.

      Rick hops to his feet, his eyes searching for the source of 
      the music when it suddenly cuts out, replaced by--

                                  BILLY (O.S.)
                    You ve been listening to the dulcet 
                    pipes and stirring drums of the Royal 
                    Scots Dragoon Guards, playing O er 
                    The Blows of Ballindalloch.

      By this point Rick understands Billy is in his ear. He digs 
      his finger in his ear, unable to locate an earwig.

                                  BILLY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Don t bother trying to dig out the 
                    receiver, lad. It s glued to your 
                    inner eardrum.

                                  RICK
                    Can you hear me?

                                  BILLY (O.S.)
                    Indeed we can.

                                  RICK
                    What the hell happened to you guys? 

                                  BILLY (O.S.)
                    First, our sincerest apologies for 
                    drugging and ditching you like we 
                    did. You see, it was the only way we 
                    could see fit to motivate Director 
                    Higgins to mount a rescue operation.                                                         53.       


                                  RICK
                    By getting me taken hostage?

                                  BILLY (O.S.)
                    We needed to put pressure on him. We 
                    needed an operative in impending 
                    danger. Meaning, you.

                                  RICK
                    And you couldn t tell me that in 
                    advance? You couldn t be bothered to 
                    loop me into the plan?

                                  BILLY (O.S.)
                    There was some concern you might 
                    chicken out. Not from me, mind you.

                                  RICK
                    Who? Who thought I would chicken out?

                                  BILLY (O.S.)
                    I m not naming names. Just know that 
                    I was out-voted two to one.

      The dull ENGINE ROAR of low flying drones begins to be heard 
      over the camp. This is heard by the Hostages, who stir. It s 
      also heard by the Rebels-- who scramble-- guns ready.

                                  RICK
                    What s happening?

      Michael now cuts into the conversation.

                                    MICHAEL(O.S.)
                    The mission is underway. Keep the 
                    hostages on the ground. Get them 
                    covered best you can-- with coats, 
                    sheets, rugs, whatever you ve got.

      By this point the Hostages have all awakened -- aware of the 
      aerial assault-- and an OILY MIST, falling over the camp. 

      Sporadic GUNFIRE begins breaking out around the camp-- as the 
      Rebels shoot into the night sky at an unseen adversary.

      Rick addresses the Hostages. Assuming command.

                                  RICK
                    A CIA rescue operation is underway! I 
                    need everyone to lay flat! And cover 
                      yourselves!

      The Hostages begin to scramble under rugs and sheets.                                                         54.       


                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Rick, it s important you try and not 
                    get wet. 

      Rick realizes that he s already soaked, his face and arms 
      coated by the oily mist.

                                  RICK
                    Too late for me. Why?
                          (no response)
                    Guys? What happens if you get wet?

                                  BILLY (O.S.)
                          (gently)
                    Sorry, buddy. This may hurt a bit.

      Just then-- A TREMENDOUS FLASH rips through the camp. The 
      mist becoming ELECTRIFIED. Rick is charged with electricity-- 
      as if hit by a taser. He drops to the ground convulsing.

      EXT. REBEL CAMP - CONTINUOUS 

      The Rebels are tasered by the mist. Some writhe in pain-- 
      others knocked unconscious. All drop like flies.

      In the next instant, Soldiers begin to sweep through the 
      camp, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, securing incapacitated 
      Rebels. Gunfire rings out.

      INT. REBEL CAMP - HOSTAGE TENT - SAME

      The remaining Hostages begin to crawl out from under their 
      sheets and rugs. They all appear okay. And are thrilled when--

      Michael, Casey, and Billy slip into the tent -- wearing full 
        paramilitary garb, and armed with handguns.

      The guys find Rick on the ground-- conscious, and apparently 
      having lost feeling in his tongue. Which he stabs into the 
      air-- in an effort to regain speech. Michael and Billy pull 
      Rick to his feet. Explaining--

                                    MICHAEL
                          (to Rick)
                    We have to split the hostages into 
                    two groups. We can t fit them all in 
                    one helicopter. Billy and I will take 
                    the more injured. You and Casey will 
                    lead the others to the second drop 
                    point. Got it?

      Rick can t quite form words, so he simply nods.                                                         55.       


      EXT. REBEL CAMP - NIGHT

      Casey leads Rick and the Hostages past the outskirts of camp, 
      and into dessert night. They begin to draw GUNFIRE from 
      within the camp. 

                                  CASEY
                    Down! Down!

      Casey hurries the Hostages into a slight ravine. He and Rick 
      piling in after them, as--

      The Land Cruiser blasts out of the darkness, zeroing in on 
      the group, the 50 millimeter peppering the night with MUZZLE 
      FLASHES. Casey considers his puny handgun. He turns to Rick.

                                  CASEY (CONT D)
                    What s the Arabic word for surrender?

                                  RICK
                    Islam.

                                  CASEY
                    Islam? 

                                  RICK
                    It means surrender-- as in surrender 
                    to God.

                                  CASEY
                    Well, I recommend you start shouting 
                    it.

      And with that Casey sprints off into the darkness. It takes 
      Rick a moment to realize that he s just been abandoned.

                                  RICK
                    Really?! You re running away?! What 
                    happened to the human weapon?! Huh?! 
                    You know, I knew you would suck!! 
                    This comes as no surprise!!

      Rick thrusts his arms high as the Land Cruiser, filled with 
      Rebels rolls up. Rick shouts:

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    Ehna Islam!!! Ehna Islam!!!

      The Rebels command the Hostages to join Rick. One by one they 
      pull themselves off the ground. Their capture secured, when--

      A BLUR catches Rick s eye a split second before-- Casey leaps 
      out of the darkness --and onto the truck -- fists and feet 
      moving in concert, taking out the Rebels in an explosive, 
      deadly display of hand-to-hand combat.                                                          56.       


      Rebel bodies topple from their perch on the truck. And within 
      seconds Casey had dispatched the lot and taken control of the 
      Land Cruiser. At long last Rick has seen the  human weapon  
      in action. He is dutifully impressed. 

      Michael and Billy arrive on foot. 

                                    MICHAEL
                          (re hostages)
                    Any injuries?

                                  RICK
                    No, we re good.

      The sand beneath their feet begins to STIR -- the rescue 
      copter drawing near. Michael and Billy climb into the Land 
      Cruiser-- with Billy manning the 50 millimeter. Michael 
      shouts to be heard over the copter roar.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Keep them safe! We ll provide all the 
                    cover we can!

      Casey turns the Land Cruiser and steers back toward the rebel 
      camp. The sound of a fierce FIREFIGHT echoing in the darkness 
      as our fearless trio disappears -- back into the breach. 

      Rick shields his eyes, buffeted by sand, looking up as the 
      Blackhawk s blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down on him, and we--

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. HELICOPTER HANGER - DESERT AIRBASE

      We re back in the helicopter hanger --where our tale began. 
      Rick has just finished reporting to Lowden. The Chief of 
      Station s opinion of his detainee has shifted-- now 
        begrudgingly impressed. Lowden pulls a coke from his cooler, 
      pops the cap, and sets the drink in front of Rick.

                                  LOWDEN
                    I suppose I owe you a belated 
                      congratulations. The mission was a 
                    complete success. All the civilians 
                    are safe.

                                  RICK
                    And my partners? Any word on my 
                    partners?

                                  LOWDEN
                    Unharmed. 

      Rick is visibly relieved to hear the news. Lowden gets a 
      phone call. He answers his cell.                                                         57.       


                                  LOWDEN (CONT D)
                    Lowden. 

      Lowden listens, snaps to attention.

                                  LOWDEN (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Yes, sir. I m looking right at him.

      Rick knows who s on the other end of the line. Knows that it 
      was only a matter of time before he d have to face--

      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS - DAY

      -- Director Higgins. Seated behind his spotless desk. The 
      picture of contained fury. Rick is shown in by Higgins  Aide. 
      Rick takes a seat across from the director.

      Higgins silently considers his wayward protege. Rick holds 
      Higgins  gaze, defiant, refusing to submit to shame.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    Less than a week ago you sat in this 
                    very office. At that time I provided 
                    you with a job. And in return all I 
                    asked for was your trust. You 
                    betrayed that trust. You chose, 
                    instead, to place it in the hands of 
                      reprobates. Three men that define 
                      everything that is currently wrong 
                    with the Agency. 

      Director Higgins straightens his desk blotter. Making sure it 
      aligns perfectly with the edge of his desk.

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS (CONT D)
                    It s been said that the two greatest 
                    dangers facing the world are these: 
                    order and disorder. I happen to 
                    accept half of this statement as 
                    true. You clearly accept the other. I 
                    am confident time will prove me 
                    right. And when that day comes-- rest 
                    assured I will show no mercy.
                          (then)
                    That will be all.

      Rick struggles to make sense of Higgins  cryptic declaration. 

                                  RICK
                    I m not fired?

                                  DIRECTOR HIGGINS
                    No. You are now permanently assigned 
                    to the ODS.                                                          58.       


      INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ODS - DAY

      Casey, and Billy are at their desks, relaxing. Michael plows 
      through a stack of Internal Reports. Rick stands before them.

                                  RICK
                    I don t understand? Why am I still 
                    here? 

                                  BILLY
                    Our mission report was leaked to the 
                    White House -- detailing your 
                      participation and personal heroics. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    This was a big win for the Agency. 
                    And the White House. Which is why 
                    your job is safe. For now.

                                  RICK
                    That s... wow... thank you.

                                  CASEY
                    Don t thank us. We didn t leak the 
                    report. Personally, I m still tee-d 
                    off. I heard your desert insults. 
                    Your words stung. They stung hard.

      Rick looks to Michael and Billy for clarification.

                                  RICK
                    If not you guys, then... who?

      Billy and Casey turn to Michael. He ll have to field this 
      one. Michael hesitates, reluctant to answer, and we--

      INT. D.C. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

      Fay eats dinner at the bar. Rick approaches, he takes the bar 
      stool beside her. She looks over, annoyed.

                                  FAY
                    That stool s occupied.

                                  RICK
                    It is?

                                  FAY
                    Yes, by a jerk-ass.

      Rick quickly realizes she means him.

                                  RICK
                    I deserve that. Look, Fay, I came 
                    here for two reasons. 
                                  (MORE)                                                         59.       

                                  RICK (CONT'D)
                    First, to thank you for leaking the 
                    report. And secondly, and more 
                      importantly, to ask you to come home 
                    with me.

      Fay nearly chokes on her salad. 

                                  FAY
                    What?!

                                  RICK
                    I think we should couple up. Tonight. 
                    Right away. We should walk out of 
                    this bar and into a committed 
                      relationship -- before the next 
                    mission risks ending the possibility 
                    of us forever.

      Fay turns to face Rick, giving him her full attention.

                                  FAY
                    You obviously haven t noticed, but 
                    I m stone sober. Which means, if your 
                    goal is to take me home, you ll have 
                    to do a lot better than throwing my 
                    own words back in my face.

                                  RICK
                    Okay... okay... let me try my words.
                          (then)
                    From day one at The Agency, everyone 
                    I ve met, everyone I ve trusted, has 
                    played me. My boss, my partners... 
                    everyone but you. And in spite of the 
                    crazy week I ve just had-- I still 
                    want a career in The Agency. It s 
                    clear to me now that I m not going to 
                      accomplish that without help.

      Rick slides closer to Fay. Focused, filled with urgency.

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    I need a touchstone. A tether to 
                    reality. Someone I know that I can 
                    trust completely. I want-- I hope 
                    that someone can be you.
                          (remembering)
                    Plus-- I think you are the most 
                    amazing woman I ve ever met. 
                      Seriously. I just spent two days in 
                    the Sudan dodging bullets, eating 
                    bugs, and getting roofied. And not 
                    once-- at any point in all that 
                      craziness-- were you out of my 
                    thoughts.                                                          60.       


      Fay softens, clearly charmed by Rick s efforts.

                                  FAY
                    Remind me, how old are you?

                                  RICK
                      Twenty-six.

                                  FAY
                    I suppose that s old enough to fully 
                      appreciate  amazing  when you see it.

      INT. RICK S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      The apartment is dark. Silent. Suddenly the front door bursts 
      open. Rick and Fay tumble in, hot and heavy, kissing, 
      fumbling to rip off each other s heavy coats.  

      Rick kicks the door shut and the two fall, in a heated 
      embrace, onto the couch, landing in the lap of-- 

      Billy, seated in the dark. The couple stares up at the 
      grinning Scotsman.

                                  BILLY
                    Evening, Boyo.  Fay...
                          (to Fay)
                    Might I say you look quite ravishing 
                    this evening.  

      The lights POP ON. We find Michael and Casey seated at the 
      kitchen table.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I think the more appropriate 
                      description would be ravished.  

      Fay sits up, brushing her hair back, not altogether surprised 
      to see the guys.

                                  FAY
                    Billy.  Casey.
                          (to Michael)
                    Miserable Bastard.

      Rick hops to his feet, greatly annoyed.

                                  RICK
                    What are you guys doing here?!

                    Otherwise known as al-Qaeda s ugly 
                    cousin. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    We re expected to infiltrate and 
                    confirm with human intel. My guess is 
                    the Director is throwing us back in 
                    the field as punishment for the 
                    Aldridge affair.  
                          (to Fay)
                    Am I right?

                                  FAY
                          (admonishing)
                    You have to expect bite-back when you 
                    poke the bear.

      Rick turns to Fay, feeling betrayed.

                                  RICK
                    You... you knew about this?

                                  FAY
                    My hope was that this could wait 
                     till morning. Sorry.

      Michael hops to his feet. Pleased with himself. He claps an 
      arm around Rick.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don t want to see any tears about 
                    this, Martinez. Remember, you re the 
                    one that wanted to do  heroes work. 

      The fact is, there are no tears. Instead, Rick looks quite 
      energized. Ready for action. This is what he wanted.

                                  RICK
                    What s our cover?

                                    MICHAEL
                    We go in as buyers for a Portland 
                    based organic grocer.  

                                  CASEY
                    I packed for you.  

      Casey grabs a duffle off of the table, tosses it to Rick.  
      The bag STRIKES him in the chest. And we MATCH CUT TO:                                                         62.       


      EXT. CAMBODIAN JUNGLES - DAY

      Where Rick is STRUCK in the chest with the very same bag.

      WIDER: Our guys are now deep in the Cambodian jungles. The 
      air thick with moisture and bugs. We discover they are in the 
      process of unloading supplies from their SUV -- which is 
      stuck in a deep muddy rut, on a narrow dirt road.  

      Billy notices Casey has tucked his pants inside of his knee-
      high gym socks.  He looks suitable ridiculous.

                                  BILLY
                    Jungle fever already set in?

                                  CASEY
                    You won t be laughing when we 
                    encounter leeches.  And we will 
                    encounter leeches.

      The team gathers in front of the SUV. They take in the road 
      ahead, which disappears into dark, dense jungle overgrowth.

                                    MICHAEL
                    My guess is we have about a two mile 
                    hump. 

      Before they can take a step-- a CRASHING NOISE booms from the 
      jungle. Something HUGE is coming at our guys, snapping bamboo 
      trees like blades of grass. They brace for an attack, armed 
      only with luggage as-- 

      -- an elephant steps out onto the narrow road. On top of the 
      elephant sits a CAMBODIAN MAN, armed with a semi-automatic. A 
      dozen more ARMED MEN step out of the brush, guns trained on 
      our team. A tense beat. Billy turns to Rick.

                                  BILLY
                    You ve got hostage experience.  
                    What s our move?

      Off of Rick, poised for battle, mind racing, loving it--
