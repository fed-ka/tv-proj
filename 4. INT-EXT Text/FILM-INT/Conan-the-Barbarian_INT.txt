Flames reflect in the blue eyes of Conan as he works the
bellows of the forge. Sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he
stokes the blaze.
Corin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. Conan cannot take his
eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows.
CORIN
Stoke your fire, boy.
Conan slams the bellows closed, anger rising.
CONAN
"Stoke your fire, chop your wood."
I have slept where wolves dare not.
I have balanced a thousand river
stones. When will you teach me the
sword?
Corin stares his son in the eyes. Judging.
7.
CORIN
Think you're ready? Then tell me:
what is a sword's purpose?
CONAN
To slay ones enemies.
CORIN
No. That is what it does. Its
purpose is why you use it.
He tosses Conan two lumps of ore.
CORIN (CONT'D)
Tell me, which makes the best
sword?
Conan takes the two lumps, testing them. He hands his father
back one.
CORIN (CONT'D)
The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall
make a sword of it, and tomorrow
you will show me what brute
strength yields.
CUT TO:
Conan works the bellows, putting his back into it. Corin
places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt.
CONAN
Why did it break?
8.
CORIN
Because it had no life.
CUT TO:
Sparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword
with hammer. Corin nods at Conan, who sprinkles the glowing
blade with ash.
CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
The strongest blade isn't made of
the hardest steel, boy. The hardest
ore is what a man will die for. It
is strong and unyielding. It
neither cowers nor concedes. But
without the softer ore, it can be
shattered like glass.
CUT TO:
Steam rises as Corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack
tub, only to place it right back into the flames.
CORIN (CONT'D)
The softer ore is what a man lives
for. It is flexible and lasting. It
survives, even against the greatest
of foes. But too much of the soft
ore, the blade will not cut deep
enough when it must.
CUT TO:
Corin fashions the blade's hilt, engraving the guard and
pommel. It is a work of art.
CORIN (CONT'D)
A sword must be tempered, the two
ores united through fire and ice.
Through its suffering the sword
comes to hold both life and death.
Corin hands Conan the sword.
CORIN (CONT'D)
Now tell me, what is this sword's
purpose?
Conan furrows his brow, trying to puzzle the answer. He
can't. Corin's disappointment shows. He takes the sword from
Conan's hands.
CORIN (CONT'D)
This one is not ready yet.
9.
Blood rushes to Conan's face but he says nothing. He rushes
out.
Built into the side of a huge tree, fifty feet up, this
wooden structure houses two CIMMERIAN SENTRIES. A BIRD CRIES
in the woods, causing one of the sentries to investigate.
THWICK! He suddenly stands up straight, unmoving. The one
still sitting in the structure notices.
CIMMERIAN SENTRY
See something?
The standing sentry falls backwards, revealing an ARROW
piercing his right eye. Shocked, the remaining sentry reaches
for the WARNING HORN mounted on the wall.
But as he reaches for it, his shadow becomes three
dimensional, MORPHING into
A SHADOW SCOUT
A thin, feral humanoid, bodies covered in tattoos, from the
deepest jungles of Zingara. The scout lashes out with his
black sword and cuts straight across the sentry's throat.
This Shadow Scout's name is REMO.
The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into
the room. He bolts the door behind him.
CONAN
Do we need more weapons?
Corin drops his sword, then struggles to lift a heavy grating
in the dirt floor. Beneath it a trough of cooling water leads
under the hut and away from the village.
CORIN
Go. There is a hunting lodge in the
North Pass with provisions.
CONAN
No! I will fight!
Corin grabs Conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face.
Corin's eyes are half-crazed.
CORIN
This fight is over, but yours has
just begun. You wanted to be a
warrior of the tribe, Conan--now
you must be its last.
CONAN
Father, I am not afraid to die.
CORIN
Good. Make your death have purpose.
BOOM. Something slams at the door. It does not budge. Again,
BOOM.
A shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and
MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo. Remo quickly slides away
the bolt.
14.
In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa. Corin and Conan face their
attackers, fighting in close quarters. Lucius rushes at
Conan, only for Conan to duck under his attack and --
THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising
up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a
crisp.
Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from
the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his
back.
Corin falls to his knees.
CONAN
No!
Lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending Conan flying
backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forge's main support
beams.
Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan,
pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from
his fallen father.
Enraged, Lucius turns his anger to Corin, raising his sword
to deliver the killing blow.
KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
I said I wanted a word with him.
Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge.
Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier,
grinning from ear to ear.
Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
As promised.
PICT
(strange dialect -
SUBTITLED)
Their heads. You promised me their
heads.
KHALAR SINGH
All you wish, once we are gone.
The Pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. Khalar Singh
stares down at Corin, sizing him up.
Corin lifts up into a sitting position, back to the forge.
15.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
I take no pleasure in this day,
barbarian. Your people are fierce
warriors, deserving of every story
told of them. But now you must
choose the story for yourself. I am
Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked
from the best Hyboria. My second,
Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo
and his Shadow Scouts from the
jungles of Zingara. And countless
others. They all had a day like
this one. They all chose a way
forward.
Into the forge walks Cherin and Akhun. The lieutenants stand
behind Corin, eyeing Corin with malice.
Corin catches a glimpse of Conan, buried but staring back at
him, unable to move. Corin quickly turns away, careful not to
give his son away.
CORIN
What is it you want?
KHALAR SINGH
I seek neither gold nor steel, but
flesh and blood. The last of a
royal line that goes back three
thousand years.
Corin LAUGHS.
CORIN
Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each
man is free here.
KHALAR SINGH
But I seek a woman.
Khalar looks outside the door of the forge. The Cimmerians
women are being herded by the slavers.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
A queen in hiding. Point her out
and you'll spare the lives of your
own. Perhaps even your wife?
CORIN
My wife was killed, long ago, by
swine such as you.
Khalar nods, understanding.
16.
KHALAR SINGH
Then our stories began in the same
place, Cimmerian. I too lost my
wife to marauders. How many men, in
how many lands have suffered so?
The only answer is power, strength
unfettered, the kind of which can
unite all Hyboria under a single
crown. That is the legacy I seek.
Will you join me?
It's a powerful, convincing speech. But Corin holds his
tongue, unmoved.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Very well. Then death will be your
story. Your men will die. And your
women too, when I am done with
them. None will survive to carry
your name forth, and over time,
even your enemies will forget you
ever were. You will be wiped from
the pages of history.
(to his men)
Take your blood, but leave the
kill.
One by one, the lieutenants beat and stab Corin, taking
pleasure in his pain.
Conan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything
other than lie there. But a huge timber lies upon his back,
pinning him to the ground.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Fariq! Come!
Entering the wrecked forge is FARIQ, the six year old son to
Khalar Singh. He stares at Corin's bleeding form with the
dispassion of a sociopath.
Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged
together, the one Corin took away. He admires it, then hands
it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for
his son to lift alone. He instructs his son as if teaching
him multiplication.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Before you lies our enemy. His
tribe waits for him in the beyond.
What would you do?
17.
FARIQ
I would cut out his eyes, father,
so that he will not find them. So
he will wander the afterlife
forever.
Khalar smiles.
KHALAR SINGH
Show me your strength, Fariq.
Without it, you will never rule.
With it, you will never be
forgotten.
Fariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORIN'S EYE. Corin doesn't make a
sound. Once Fariq has ripped out Corin's eyes, Khalar runs
Corin through.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
You have your desire. Death has
found you.
Corin spits out his last words, also meant for Conan.
CORIN
Soon -- it comes for you.
CONAN'S POV
Conan glimpses around the faces of Khalar and his men, each
image seared into his memory as if ablaze.
KHALAR SINGH
Burn this place. It no longer
exists.
CUT TO:
Smoke fills the air. Conan struggles, still unable to move.
He COUGHS, dying.
But then the fire collapses more of the forge, and the
falling beams shatter the one that pins Conan to the ground.
18.
Slowly, painfully, Conan drags himself into the cooling
trough that runs beneath the hut.
FADE TO BLACK.
A raucous bar on the Argossean waterfront. Out the window we
see a port lined with Shemish galleys and junks from Kush.
The bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of
those ships, and those who desire to part them from their
hard-earned money; Zamoran thieves, Hyborean mercenaries and
Brythunian whores. Most of them watch the arm wrestling match
taking place at the back of the bar.
A pair of CITY GUARDS, short swords sheathed at their sides,
enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the
harried BARKEEP.
BARKEEP
He's back there.
The barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers.
19.
CITY GUARD #1
What's this one done?
BARKEEP
What's he done?! What hasn't he
done? He's bedded six of my whores
and finished off three casks of
mead--and he hasn't paid so much as
a silver piece for it.
CITY GUARD #1
So have your men deal with him.
BARKEEP
I did.
Behind the bar, six men each hold down two HULKING MEN
YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped
back into place.
CITY GUARD #2
Sounds like a real problem. Too bad
we have other places to be right
now.
The Barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine. He slips a
pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand.
BARKEEP
Just get that behemoth out of here.
The two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar.
His back to them, the DRUNKEN MAN they're after struggles to
pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready
to strike at the loser. A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch,
caressing the Drunken Man's sinewy back.
The Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other man's
hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey.
As the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard
of ale at the Barkeep, who's now back behind the bar.
DRUNKEN MAN
Piss-water! You'll serve my friends
and I your best, barman, or you'll
taste steel!
CITY GUARD #1
Time to leave, northerner.
The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his
shoulder.
20.
CONAN
The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully
built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with
battle scars. Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut
black mane remain from the boy we last saw.
Conan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller
City Guards, who instinctively take a step back.
CONAN
No, my small friends. It's time to
die. Now--
Conan sways. The room spins. He falls on his face.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Who's first --
CUT TO:
The two City Guards drag Conan into the guardhouse, where a
LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner.
The Lieutenant doesn't even bother to look up from his meal.
21.
LIEUTENANT
What's the charge?
CITY GUARD #2
Public drunkenness. Another damn
hill ape who can't handle his
liquor.
LIEUTENANT
Is that so, boy? How do you plead?
Conan yawns in response. One of the City Guards slaps Conan,
hard, across the face. Conan slowly opens his eyes.
CONAN
Where's the Captain of the Guard?
SCREAMS OF PAIN come from down the hall, past a locked door.
LIEUTENANT
In the cells, interrogating a
prisoner. And you'll get the same
if you don't answer. You're accused
of public drunkenness. How do you
plead?
CONAN
In truth, I've been guilty of much.
Jewels stolen from the crowns of
kings, men's heads split in battle
for the price of a night's drink.
But through that I've searched and
waited and hunted my prey.
Suddenly Conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did
a moment ago.
CONAN (CONT'D)
But drink? Haven't had a drop all
night.
The guards holding Conan up by his arms, suddenly find those
arms wrapped around their heads. Twist, twist. SNAP. SNAP. He
breaks both their necks in an instant.
The Lieutenant is horrified. He goes for his sword. Conan
bats it out of his hand, slamming his head against the back
wall.
CONAN (CONT'D)
The key to the cells.
22.
LIEUTENANT
I don't have it. There's a guard
inside the door. Only he can open
it.
Conan picks up the Lieutenant's sword.
LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
You can't kill me! He'll only open
the door for me!
A FLASH OF STEEL as Conan delivers a blow.
CUT TO:
A GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door. Behind
him, the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained ONE-EYED
PRISONER to a pulpy mess.
There's a KNOCK at the door.
GUARD #1
What is it?
MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
Need to see the Captain.
The Guard exhales, frustrated. He stands up, getting his keys
out. He stops. Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into the other
room.
The Lieutenant stares back at him.
GUARD #1
Fine, fine.
He opens the door--
Only to see Conan standing there, holding the decapitated
head of the Lieutenant.
The shocked Guard goes for his sword. Conan swings the
Lieutenant's head, smashing it into the Guard's jaw and
putting him down for the count.
That's when the Captain of the Guard turns around. And WE
RECOGNIZE HIM! He's LUCIUS, the disfigured Aquilionian who
was one of Khalar Singh's lieutenants.
LUCIUS
Men!
23.
From around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their
weapons. Lucius draws his as well.
LUCIUS (CONT'D)
You've made a huge mistake, ape.
You'll never make it out of this
place.
CONAN
I came for you, Lucius.
Lucius nods to the guards, who advance on Conan.
LUCIUS
You talk as though you know me,
ape.
CONAN
I do. And I am no ape. I am
Cimmerian.
As recognition crosses Lucius' face, Conan springs into
action. He KICKS the table at the men, sending the knives and
other torture implements flying right into the first guard.
The second guard tries leaping over the falling table. Conan
just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the
iron bands of the prisoner cells.
Lucius lunges at Conan, Conan steps in on him, grabbing his
sword hand. In a show of strength, he twists Lucius' own
sword until points down at the floor, then THRUSTS IT THROUGH
LUCIUS' FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW.
Lucius BELLOWS in pain, pinned to the spot.
The next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal
with three weapons attacks at once.
The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around
Conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from Conan's grip.
Instead, Conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying
into a wall-mounted torch. The guard burns like dry kindling.
The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand, carving a
deep gash and causing him to drop his sword.
Conan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. The guard's
face goes pale. Conan head butts him with all his might and
the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears.
24.
However, the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react.
The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift
Conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by
the neck.
Conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his
throat into the wall. The thickness of the Cimmerian's neck
gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden
knife which he buries into the Guardsman's eye.
CUT TO:
Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning
guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. Then he pulls
the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out
of Lucius' now liberated foot.
Conan takes Lucius' face and smashes it against the table.
Lucius looks, aghast, as Conan takes his injured hand and
places it over the torch flame, searing the wound closed. The
Cimmerian never even bats an eye.
LUCIUS
What do you want? Who are you?
Conan turns his face to the burnt side.
CONAN
I'm the one who made you pretty.
LUCIUS
Impossible! You're dead!
Conan shows Lucius the FIVE SCARS running down his forearm.
CONAN
No. I am death. And I came a long
way for you.
Conan lifts the sword.
LUCIUS
Wait!! Wait!!
(CONAN PAUSES)
I can tell you where the rest are.
CONAN
Where?
LUCIUS
The end of the earth. You kill me,
and you'll never find them.
25.
CONAN
Who are you offering?
LUCIUS
Who do you think? All of them.
Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and
Khalar Singh himself. But you have
to swear you won't kill me.
Conan thinks about it.
CONAN
You have my word. You tell me where
I will find Khalar Singh, and I
will not kill you.
Conan lets Lucius go. Lucius hobbles to his chair.
LUCIUS
He is in a city called on the edge
of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of
Hyboria. Khor Khalba.
Conan looks him in his eyes, sizing him up. He likes what he
sees. In a flash, Conan grabs Lucius' head again, yanking it
back, exposing his throat.
LUCIUS (CONT'D)
You gave your word!
Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring. He drops it in
Lucius' throat. The big man chokes instantly. A second later,
Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well.
Lucius swallows the key, gasping for breath as Conan releases
him.
LUCIUS (CONT'D)
What are you doing?!
CONAN
Toasting, to our deal.
Conan swings his sword and cuts the One Eyed Prisoner from
the wall.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Go. You are free.
One-Eye looks at his wrists and ankles, still hobbled by
shackles.
ONE-EYED PRISONER
I won't get far like this.
26.
Conan hands him a fallen Guardsmen's sword.
CONAN
The key to your shackles sits in
the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.
The One-Eyed Prisoner grins with malice. As he closes in on
the terrified Lucius, Conan heads for the door.
LUCIUS
Barbarian! I had your word! You
said you would spare my life!
CONAN
No. I said I wouldn't kill you.
We hear Lucius SCREAMS OF PAIN as Conan walks out into the
night, cutting another notch into his arm.
CUT TO:
A thin alleyway at the rear of the monastery, leading away
from the din of battle, towards a rear gate of the oasis.
Tamara and Ilira run for the gate, only for the shadows of
the alleyway to move and shift -- REMO and three of his
shadow scouts.
They advance on the women, drawing dark shortswords.
REMO
No swords. Khalar needs them alive.
TAMARA
Good to know.
Tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife,
but when she strikes, she hits nothing but shadow. It reforms
behind her and grabs her.
Another grabs Ilira. Tamara launches her body into the air,
executing a backflip that puts her behind the shadow scout. A
quick knife strike and he goes down.
And with one continuous motion, she vaults over the shadow
scout holding Tamara, cutting his throat as well.
Remo and the remaining scout give chase, blending in and out
of shadows. But each time they strike, Tamara defends Ilira.
They near the far end of the alleyway, the North gate looming
ahead with the desert beyond.
Remo blends into another shadow --
Tamara and Ilira run for the whirling sands just ahead --
when the flaming arrows land before them.
Ilira hesitates.
TAMARA
Run!
ILIRA
We'll die!
TAMARA
We'll die if we stay!
She locks eyes with Ilira, who nods. Together they run right
for the arrows.
But at the last minute, Ilira falters. She falls to the
ground.
Tamara turns to see Ilira lying in the gateway a moment too
late.
THE ARROWS EXPLODE causing a cave in that closes the gateway.
The flames become the blaze of the forge.
CORIN (O.S.)
More wood boy! We must test the
steel with our fire.
Conan, a young boy again, kneels beside the woodpile, pulling
OUT LOGS--
56.
But when he hands them to his father, he notices his father
is covered with sword wounds, cut and bleeding.
CORIN (CONT'D)
What are you waiting for? The fire
is dying.
Conan turns back to the wood pile. Instead of wood, the pile
is full of the bodies of those he recently killed: Lucius,
Remo, etc.
The young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the
forge. Still the fire diminishes.
Conan turns and there is no more wood. And no more bodies.
CONAN
It's not enough. I've failed you
father.
CORIN
It will never be enough, Conan.
CONAN
I don't understand --
He spins. Behind him TAMARA stands, a look of sadness on her
face.
CORIN
Through suffering, you will learn
your purpose, boy. And you have not
begun to suffer yet.
Conan's eyes pop open. He inhales sharply, gripped by the
dream.
The room is dark, surrounded by thick draperies. Conan lies
on a straw bed with white sheets, soaked through with his
sweat. He looks to his wounds, all bandaged.
He rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed.
TAMARA
I wouldn't move so fast. I bound
your wounds as best I could, but
I'm no healer.
Conan looks over to discover Tamara sitting nearby.
57.
CONAN
Where am I?
TAMARA
On the Wasp. You told me where it
laid, just before you passed out.
Though I can't say as I feel much
safer here.
Conan's response is to rise again, his face contorting in
pain.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
Don't embarrass me with thanks, I
only saved your life.
CONAN
You were -- adequate.
Conan pulls aside one of the thick draperies that surround
his bed. Behind it lies a staircase, which he ascends.
Conan collapses on the bed as Tamara follows him inside.
TAMARA
We go to Khor Kalba?
CONAN
I do.
59.
Conan puts a brawny arm over his tired eyes.
TAMARA
No. We do.
CONAN
Just leave me to sleep.
But Tamara doesn't leave, forcing Conan to respond.
CONAN (CONT'D)
You would risk your life for
royalty? Why?
Tamara pauses, realizing she must trust Conan to gain his
help.
TAMARA
Because she represent freedom, not
just ours but all Hyboria's. What
do you know of Acheron?
CONAN
A tall tale. Meant to scare
children.
TAMARA
It is no fable. It's my people's
history. Acheron was an empire that
swallowed all of Hyboria, led by
the King and his legion of demon
warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable.
Immortal. But still it had one
weakness. For the true power of
Acheron laid not with its King, but
the Queen. Every twenty years, a
new queen from the royal line would
be coronated with a crown of iron.
Spikes would pierce her, slowly
drain her precious blood, and
through her suffering Acheron would
remain invincible. Until one of my
ancestors, an Acheronian himself,
put a stop to this tyranny. He and
others spirited the new Queen away,
hiding her from the empire and all
those who would raise it again.
CONAN
What care I for queens and empires?
Conan turns to head back to his bed. Tamara grabs him,
incensed.
60.
TAMARA
Didn't you hear me? This evil faces
us all. All of civilization will
fall if the army of Acheron is
raised again.
CONAN
I heard. Only I would happily put
all of your "civilization" to the
torch myself.
TAMARA
But -- you owe me a debt, you
thankless oaf!
CONAN
My only debt is to my people. And
it still lies unpaid.
AKHUN and his Turanian slavers lead the female monks into a
large circular chamber, lit by many torches. Before them lies
a PIT, dark and foreboding, with a bamboo grid placed atop
it.
Fariq enters, an AIDE holding the iron box he used earlier.
Fariq has a bandage on his face where Conan struck him, and
he looks even more angry and malevolent than before.
FARIQ
Here we stand again. Will the queen
reveal herself, or must another
innocent suffer?
Fariq walks past the row of women, each recoiling. He slaps
one. Then another, his rage only building.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
My father, he tires of your
charade. He grows impatient. But I
have no such haste. I enjoy
watching you squirm.
63.
Fariq passes Ilira, slowing his pace. He closes in on the
YOUNGEST FEMALE MONK, a true innocent with terrified eyes.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
Perhaps you'd like to see the end
your sisters faced back at the
monastery?
Fariq slowly opens the box before her.
ACHERONIAN BOX
In the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque TENTACLE. The
tentacle is severed, but still alive, thirsting for blood.
Terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. Fariq
closes the box.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
No? Your fear is not enough yet?
Let's try harder.
Fariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
I've read all there is to know of
mighty Acheron. Why would true
Acheronians protect a traitor to
their own? You once held the entire
world in your grasp, now you hide
and cower like pitiful mice.
He pushes the girl. She falls to the grid, the sound echoing
down into the pit.
AN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes.
The girl looks below.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
And mice are meant to be swallowed
whole.
Suddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one
in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the
young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the
darkness below.
Her SCREAMS echo.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
What was in the box could only
drink from you one at a time. But
the beast of Acheron, it will claim
four of you this night.
(MORE)
64.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
Who will spare the rest and tell me
which of you is the queen?
Not a single woman moves, resolved. Ilira catches herself,
but also stays silent. She looks up to see Fariq staring at
her.
CU - ILIRA'S EYES
Her pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into
her.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
I am here, swine.
Fariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at
him.
FEMALE MONK
I am the one you seek.
Fariq smiles.
FARIQ
At last. Some bravery. But of
course, you wouldn't expect me to
take your word, would you?
As the Fariq reaches for her--
CUT TO:
Tamara awakens with a SCREAM, her body resting against the
curved hull of the ship.
TAMARA
No!!!
Tamara looks around with a panicked look, until she realizes
where she is.
CONAN (O.S.)
I hope I awoke with less clamor.
Their roles reversed, now it is Tamara's turn to see Conan
sitting nearby, drinking from a flask of mead.
TAMARA
You're drinking? You were near
death this time yesterday.
65.
CONAN
Is there a better reason to drink?
Tamara actually manages to LAUGH.
TAMARA
Do you think--I could try some of
that? I'm curious of its taste.
CONAN
You've never tasted mead?
Tamara shrugs, embarrassed. Conan hands her flask. She takes
a deep swallow, some spilling out over her cheeks. But she
doesn't cough, and smiles brightly afterwards.
TAMARA
It's good.
Conan reaches for the flask, but Tamara ignores him, taking
another swig. It quickly loosens her tongue.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
Let me ask you something. Once
you've killed Khalar and claimed
your vengeance, then what? You will
be free from your ghosts. What of
your future, Conan?
CONAN
I have no future. It died with my
people, as I should have.
TAMARA
So your life is penance? For what,
for living? And when you too die,
what do you believe happens then?
Conan just shrugs, taking back the mead.
CONAN
Nothing.
Tamara, her tongue loosened by drink, laughs.
TAMARA
Nothing? I couldn't live without
some kind of belief in the world
after this.
CONAN
I believe in the cold of steel, the
warmth of flesh. All else is fairy
tales.
66.
TAMARA
Perhaps. But I still die with faith
in my heart, belief in something
greater than one's self. What will
you die with?
CONAN
Purpose. I die with purpose.
DISSOLVE TO:
Conan pulls off his jerkin, revealing a torso rippling with
muscles.
CONAN
We'll rest here until morning.
73.
TAMARA
Will I awake alone? Do you intend
to leave me?
CONAN
I would do you a kindness. Khor
Kalba will bring only death.
TAMARA
Please, Conan. Artus told me of how
you lost your tribe. I too had to
watch as my people were taken from
me.
Conan ignores her, gathering wood for a fire.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
All I ask is that you let me travel
with you. I too have a purpose. I
must get to the queen. I would
rather you kill me here, than fail
her again.
Conan continues collecting, infuriating Tamara.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
I was wrong about you. You are no
fearless warrior. Your heart is
closed to all but fear -- and hate.
Conan draws flint, starting the fire. Only once his task is
complete does he answer Tamara.
CONAN
We leave at dawn. I will not break
stride for you. Not once. I will
get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond
that I have my purpose, and you
yours.
Tamara offers a thankful nod, her anger subsiding.
TAMARA
Nice fire. Does it mean you'll
actually cook the meat this time?
CUT TO:
The great haunches of the beast roast over the fire. Conan
turns the meat.
Behind him, Tamara approaches. She has cleaned herself up,
her white robe translucent in light of the fire, her wet hair
glistening.
75.
Conan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves. He
stops chewing.
Tamara notices. Embarrassed, she turns so that he can only
see her side. Conan returns to his food.
TAMARA
What were the women of your tribe
like, Conan?
CONAN
They fought beside the men.
TAMARA
So they were equals. And your
mother?
CONAN
She died in battle, even as I was
born.
TAMARA
So you never knew her. It was the
same with me. I've always known
being a mother was somehow not my
fate. But--
Tamara falters, unsure. But Conan's quiet eases her.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
You said earlier Khor Kalba will
bring only death. Were you trying
to scare me, or do you really
believe our end lies there?
CONAN
I don't lie.
Tamara nods, having heard as much about Conan. She turns back
to face him, no longer hiding her body.
TAMARA
Then we don't have much time. Your
mother perished too young, but at
least she died having known the
touch of one who cared.
Tamara steps closer to Conan.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
So -- do you care, Conan?
Conan rises to her, his broad form looming over her slight
build.
76.
But Conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe
and pulls her naked body into his, their mouths meeting in a
desperate kiss.
LOVE SCENE
Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire, their sinewy limbs
intertwined, fingers locked together. He thrusts into her,
causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain.
The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top, undulating as
their pace quickens. Tamara CRIES OUT in ecstasy.
AFTERMATH
Tamara stares into the fire, her body wrapped around Conan's.
She gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
I've only ever heard you speak of
what you'd die for, Conan. What
would you live for?
Conan, his eyes closed, keeps them shut.
CONAN
Do you ever tire of talking? Let me
rest, woman.
Tamara reaches down between Conan's legs. His eyes open.
TAMARA
I thought that may work.
Conan growls and pulls himself atop Tamara. Looking down at
her face, her hair loose and wild, she's beautiful in the
soft glow of the firelight.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
I see you clearly now, finally,
after all this time.
(she kisses him deeply)
I would be that which you live for,
Conan, if you would have me. You
may have faith in nothing, Conan --
but I have faith in you.
Conan lowers himself back down upon her.
DISSOLVE TO:
77.
A rundown hall, built beneath the city. Wooden supports hold
up the buildings of the entire city block overhead.
And within the hall, a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES.
They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or
even hands, evidence of Khalar's cruel justice.
They eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, WENCHES and
SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian
outsider.
The One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table, and
immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan,
caressing him.
Tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a COUGH, even
as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table.
Conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile
women, their breasts practically framing his face.
80.
CONAN
What? Do you wish to join in?
CUT TO:
Conan cleans mead from his face, scowling at Tamara, as the
One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress.
ONE EYED THIEF
--so you were right about the
platform. You'll be long dead
before you make it top. Same with
scaling the cliff. There's no known
way to break into the fortress.
CONAN
So that's it?
ONE EYED THIEF
I didn't say that. I just said
there's no known way in -- because
no one has ever tried to. But
breaking out -- that's another
story. It's not much easier, but
it's possible.
The One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin.
ONE EYED THIEF (CONT'D)
You just need to find someone crazy
enough to show you the way.
Tamara is the last to follow Conan, the One Eyed Thief and
the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder. Below lies
a darkened catacomb, lit only by their torches.
ONE EYED THIEF
These catacombs run underneath the
entire city, even to the cistern
that drains out from the fortress
dungeon.
Tamara's foot drops into knee high water. She immediately
grabs her nose.
TAMARA
Catacombs? You mean sewers.
ONE EYED THIEF
Piss and shit are the last things
you need to worry about down here.
81.
Tamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its
murky surface.
The group wades through the water, single file. Conan notices
HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb.
Massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice.
CONAN
What is it?
TAMARA
A warning. These catacombs are
connected to the sea. It says that
the beasts of Acheron protect its
secrets.
CONAN
Not from me.
Conan presses on, into the darkness.
The catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its
walls rising up high into the darkness. As the torches bring
light to the space, we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD, ROTTING BODIES.
As Conan and Tamara walk forward, the One Eyed Thief and the
other stop at the entrance.
ONE EYED THIEF
Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've
heard too much about what lies
within to go any further.
Conan simply nods and the thieves depart. Conan raises his
torch, illuminating the near wall.
TAMARA
Where now?
CONAN
Around. Up.
Conan heads off one direction, leaving Tamara to navigate the
other half. Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. She
inhales deeply and takes her first step.
CONAN
82.
Following the slick wall, he passes many DEAD BODIES, but
only one catches his eye. He stops before it.
DEAD WARRIOR
Nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. But
he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that
resembles his father's own.
Conan takes the helmet and places it on his head. It fits
perfectly.
TAMARA
Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high
sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within.
TAMARA
Oh!!!
Tamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water.
Conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword.
CONAN
What?
TAMARA
Something touched me. Something
slimy.
Conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on
Tamara's leg. It's a SLUG, which he flicks off.
CONAN
Crom! Stop wasting time.
But when Conan steps forward, something ROILS THE WATER right
before him. He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its
submerges back into the water.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Crom indeed.
Then Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the
water, wrapping around her waist. Tamara grabs hold of the
wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater.
Conan immediately SLASHES the tentacle, pulling Tamara away.
The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood
everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with
roiling intensity.
Conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into
the far cistern wall.
83.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Let's go.
Carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad
corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors,
leading to prison cells.
Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way
to the floor of the hallway. The heavy darkness presses in on
Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing.
The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in
varying states of decay. There are buckets, filled with
entrails and feces, upended. Tamara put her hand over her
mouth.
Conan continues down the hallway. He and Tamara begin to hear
the sound of EERIE CHANTING.
TAMARA
What is that?
Up ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as
the torches end. Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to
peer into the black void.
CONAN
Nothing good.
Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND
blows out his torch. A moment later, there's the sound of A
GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND.
In the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE.
VOICE (O.S.)
Welcome.
A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the
gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a
vast CAGE built around a massive PIT.
84.
The same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk, only
now, a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the
void.
Hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS,
including Tamara's fellow female monks. Several of them YELL
out Tamara's name as they see her.
And watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage,
is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers.
AKHUN
Which ever one of you slaves gets
me the girl, lives.
The Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara, each taking
a different plank way to get to them.
CONAN
(TO TAMARA)
Stay behind me.
Tamara steps behind Conan, who blocks the others' path to
her.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Who dies first?
The first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a
short sword, the other a pike. The pikeman thrusts first,
Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending
the wielder off balance and into the abyss.
The prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better,
as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single
blow.
TAMARA
Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the
top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage,
her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.
CONAN
Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo.
Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have
the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much
like the one Conan cut through earlier.
TENTACLED MONSTER
85.
Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a
gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that
feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth.
The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING
combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in
its gnashing maw.
The creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the
tentacle, the slices it off. He immediately turns back to
check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there.
He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty
feet directly above him.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Crom!
AKHUN
The massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the
prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers.
AKHUN
Get her!
TAMARA
She's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the
baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in, climbing
towards her from either side.
CONAN
Spotting Tamara overhead, Conan tries to keep beneath her,
evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety
planks.
TAMARA
She's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first
Jailer reaches out to grab her. She reacts by GASHING his
eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he FALLS TOWARDS
THE PIT.
CONAN
Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer
SMASHES through the plank he was on, forcing Conan to jump to
another.
Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the Cimmerian,
forcing him to defend while still not balanced.
86.
TAMARA
The next Jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage. He
struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES
HIS EAR OFF.
The Jailer drops Tamara, who SCREAMS as she falls.
CONAN
Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him. In one swift move,
he SLASHES his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing
tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE
FALLS. His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold
onto Tamara.
TAMARA
She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster
below her. Only a single splintering plank holds her and
Conan aloft.
CONAN
With a grunt, he swings Tamara and throws her to safety, at
the edge of the pit.
But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun
entering the arena.
AKHUN
The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as Conan.
He thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to
bend and warp.
Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his
training in Cimmeria serves him well.
Akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his
legs. Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank
close enough for him to jump to.
AKHUN (CONT'D)
You'll make a nice meal.
Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time
Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR.
Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him
focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun. With one
great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun.
87.
Akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the
abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.
CUT TO:
Conan lowers down the last of the baskets. Tamara use a sword
to smash open the lock, freeing the prisoners inside.
Tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock.
The women look worn, but unbroken.
TAMARA
Where is Ilira?
FEMALE MONK
She was taken away by Fariq.
TAMARA
Then I'm too late.
One of the stronger looking women, an ELDER MONK, steps
forward.
ELDER MONK
No. She was just taken this
morning. It's not yet midnight,
and Khalar still must bring her to
the cave of Acheron.
Tamara nods and the women begin to ARM THEMSELVES. Conan
shakes his head at the rag-tag group.
CONAN
You're going to fight Khalar's
troops? Just you?
The Elder Monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly
about her body, clearly well versed in it use.
TAMARA
Cimmerians aren't the only women
who know how to fight. And to kill.
Tamara looks at the other monks.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
Our duty was to keep the queen
safe. We failed. But if Khalar
brings her to Acheron, it will rise
again -- and all our peoples'
sacrifice is for nothing.
(MORE)
88.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
So if the queen is not free by the
stroke of midnight -- she must be
already dead.
The other monks nod and they start to head off. Tamara is the
last to head off, her eyes burning into Conan's.
CONAN
You want my help again.
TAMARA
No. You kept your word, I'll keep
mine. I pray you fulfill your debt.
Tamara kisses Conan's cheek one last time and heads off.
The monk travel in single file, the Elder Monk leading the
way. Suddenly, she stops, motioning to an entranceway ahead.
ELDER MONK
(WHISPERING)
Guard.
TAMARA
(WHISPERING)
Don't kill him. We need to find out
which way Ilira was taken.
The Elder Monk nods and slips up ahead. We hear a SMASH.
The stunned GUARD lies before the assembled monks. Tamara
glares down at him.
TAMARA
Tell us where the last girl was
taken.
The Guard just LAUGHS at them through bloody teeth.
CONAN (O.S.)
Let me ask.
The Guard's face drops as Conan steps out from the darkness.
TAMARA
Your debt --
89.
CONAN
Will be where your queen is.
Tamara smiles. She knows it is a half truth.
As Conan and the monks enter, the throne room is empty,
scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber.
Ilira sits on the throne, crown on her slumped head. Tamara
runs over to her.
TAMARA
Ilira!
She raises Ilira's head, only to discover lifeless eyes.
Tamara cradles her best friend's face.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
She's dead. It's over.
VOICE (O.S.)
Not yet.
Before the monks can react, ARROWS STREAK OUT FROM THE
DARKNESS, killing them all. Only Conan is quick enough to
dodge his arrow by diving aside.
When he comes up, Khalar has Tamara, his sword at her neck.
Several ARCHERS stand behind him, at the ready.
KHALAR SINGH
It's only begun. Because that one
was not the heir to Acheron.
Khalar smiles down at Tamara.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
She is.
Slowly, what he's saying dawns on her.
TAMARA
No. It can't be --
KHALAR SINGH
Secretive, the traitors of Acheron.
It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally
wrung honesty from the girl. That
poor innocent was forced to live a
lie, even as the truth was kept
from the queen herself.
(MORE)
90.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
(TO CONAN)
And you did the rest, barbarian. My
thanks for delivering the Queen to
me.
TAMARA
No!
Suddenly, a trap door opens beneath Conan and drops down in
the darkness, landing with a heavy THUD.
Conan awakens to the familiar sound of a hot blade SIZZLING
as it hits the cooling vat.
But this is no dream of his father's forge -- as he looks up
to see Fariq holding a sword, its tip still red hot, the
flames of the fortress's forge behind him.
Conan's thrusts forward, only to find his armed chained
around a heavy mortar and stone pillar.
Fariq strokes his newly acquired scar.
FARIQ
At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's
been hours you've made me wait for
my fun.
Conan says nothing, but his eyes scan the room, taking in
everything.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
You made me lose face in front of
my father. That wasn't wise. But
what should I expect from a
Cimmerian?
CONAN
A swift end!
Conan strains at the chain, ripping the skin beneath his
shackles -- but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the
pillar.
FARIQ
Hardly. But that is a difference
between you and me. A swift end
would be a mercy I do not intend to
grant. No, you must suffer for your
transgressions.
(MORE)
91.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
You must beg for your suffering to
end. Just as your people did.
He waves the glowing sword tip in front of Conan's face.
CONAN
You lie. I was there. My father
never uttered a sound.
Fariq LAUGHS, amused.
FARIQ
You were there? What were you
doing, warrior? Watching your
father die, without saying a sound?
Taking your eyes will be justice
indeed, coward.
Fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against Conan's skin.
Conan's face reddens with pain, but he doesn't utter a sound.
But as Conan pulls on his chains -- more mortar falls. As
Fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge, Conan
notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is
LOOSE.
CONAN
I saw my father die. Slain by one
who can only kill men already on
their knees.
Fariq turns, his eyes blazing. He glances over at the two
GUARDS by the door, who try not to listen.
FARIQ
I've killed many in battle, cur.
CONAN
Really? Then why did your father
not let you face me before, when I
had sword in hand. He thought you
unequal to the task.
Fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against Conan's
chest. Conan just YELLS back at him.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Coward! Prove your strength!
Again, Fariq pushes the hot blade against Conan's skin.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Take my eyes, coward -- if you can.
92.
Fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at Conan's head.
Conan lifts his manacles, forcing the blade up into the brick
holding his chain.
Then Conan pulls on the chains with all his might, loosening
the heavy brick, which falls to the ground.
In one powerful movement, Conan begins SWINGING the chain
with the mortar block on the end, a homemade ball and chain.
The two Guards come forward, sword drawn, only to meet with a
CRUNCHING blow by Conan's weapon. Both their heads get caved
in.
Fariq rushes Conan, getting in too close for Conan's wide
swings. Conan simply meets Fariq's sword with the heavy
chains, then encircles Fariq's neck with the steel bonds.
Fariq CHOKES, falling to the ground, gasping for air. But
Conan doesn't kill him -- yet.
THE FORGE
A vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge.
Conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out.
FARIQ
Conan kicks him onto his back. Fariq's last vision is that of
Conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward
his eyes. Fariq SCREAMS.
Conan reaches down and picks up Fariq's sword. THE SWORD
CONAN'S FATHER MADE FOR HIM.
It takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous
doors. Khalar Singh rides in. Moonlight from the huge eyes of
the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces
of demonic warrior statues.
At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too
numerous to count.
TAMARA
This is no empire, only a
graveyard.
KHALAR SINGH
You see only with your eyes.
Khalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and
light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain
reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing
the true scope of this place.
An enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns
that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin.
And at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised
THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty.
Khalar turns to his guards.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Close the gates and stay here. Send
my son to me when he arrives.
(motioning to two of them)
You two, come with me.
THE ALTAR
Khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of
purple-shaded rock. Around its edges are deep channels, for
the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles
of bone.
KHALAR SINGH
The Acheronians had a wonderful
sense of balance, don't you think?
For one to ascend to royalty,
another must fall.
With the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds.
94.
Tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar
absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the
altar, his two guards shackling her in place.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
For a hundred generations the kings
of Acheron were crowned, and the
queens were sacrificed.
Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately
carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a
Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of
skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES.
And from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A
CROWN OF IRON. The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately
detailed gold that glows in the firelight.
But the crown of iron is terrifying. Huge rough spikes extend
from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than
a crown.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
What a day for you. This morning
you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you
are a queen giving birth to an
empire.
CUT TO:
Khalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian. Ancient, harsh words, as
he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the
statues of dark gods all around.
95.
TAMARA
Stop. You don't know what you are
about to do.
KHALAR SINGH
But I do. For thirty years I have
dreamed of this day. The day our
people rise from the ashes.
Khalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown
upon his head. As he does so, the light from the moon
reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an
unnatural glow.
THUMP-THUMP. A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout
the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. It sounds
like the heartbeat of a giant.
Khalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head. She
thrashes and struggles but to no avail.
Once the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP! The spikes
around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE
THEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony.
Blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels
around the edges of the altar.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
It begins. You give birth to an
empire.
Tamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in
pained whispers.
KHALAR SINGH
It's good that you pray. Gods will
be here soon.
Tamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain.
TAMARA
He'll--be---here--sooner.
KHALAR SINGH
Who?
CONAN (O.S.)
Me!
Khalar turns to see the outline of Conan, framed by the
moonlight, looking down at Khalar from atop of one the
warrior statues. A thick vine dangles nearby, Conan's route
down from the cave roof above.
Conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before
the altar. It is a killing floor.
The two Guardsmen leap for him, but Conan dispatches them
with a pair of strikes. Both fall down dead.
Conan meets Tamara's eyes, a look of determination,
assurance. He starts toward the altar.
KHALAR SINGH
I will say this for you, barbarian.
You are hard to kill.
CONAN
Let her go.
KHALAR SINGH
You've faced me before and lost.
What do you think has changed now?
CONAN
My purpose.
Conan lunges for Khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of
sparks. They fight to a brief standstill when ---THUMP,
THUMP.
THE ALTAR
97.
Tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her
head. More blood pours forth. The blood in the channels
speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the
sacrificial pool.
Conan makes another movement toward the altar, but Khalar
nimbly blocks his path.
KHALAR SINGH
You are strong, Cimmerian, but we
both know you are not my equal.
Conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.
CONAN
Once you used my father to teach
your son a lesson about strength.
Now let me teach you.
Conan tosses out what is inside. It falls to the ground,
rolling to Khalar Singh's feet.
FARIQ'S HEAD
Khalar looks down at the ground -- at the head of his beloved
son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal. Khalar trembles
in shock and rage.
KHALAR SINGH
No.
Khalar reaches for the severed head, giving Conan a brief
window to rush to Tamara's side. Conan tries to lift her off
the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Cimmerian!!!
Enraged, Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and
force into an all-out attack. Conan simply sidesteps it, then
shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamara's wrists.
Before he can shatter the other, Khalar charges again.
Khalar swings, Conan spins, his blade catching Khalar's just
inches from his face. Conan throws Khalar off him, knocking
the warlord back ten feet. Khalar's attack is feral,
uncontrolled. He's lost his balance.
Spinning and striking blindly, Conan smashes the second
shackle on her wrist. He continues his motion, bringing his
sword around to meet Khalar's next strike.
98.
Now Khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and Conan the more
polished warrior. Their battle takes them away from the
altar.
With her hands free, Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out
and remove the crown.
THE KILLING FLOOR
Conan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking
Khalar's chest and drawing blood. The Guardsmen arrive from
the other side of the cave, drawing their swords.
Khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the Cimmerian.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
The Queen. Shackle her!
THE ALTAR
In agony, Tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another.
She pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off
her bloodied head --
When the Guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the
crown back on.
THUMP, THUMP! The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper
as Tamara SCREAMS. The blood now fills the channels of the
altar.
WE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in
a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around
the altar until reaching the channel's end --
THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL
POOL. It BOILS instantly, multiplying itself exponentially,
bubbling forth and filling the entire pool.
AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. A massive earthquake jolts the
entire cave.
THE KILLING FLOOR
As Khalar Singh and Conan battle, the ground beneath them on
the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS.
THUMP-THUMP! The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor
of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss.
Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can
reach to prevent them from falling further.
99.
Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the
cave. Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred
pool.
Their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. They look
below, searching for the source of the glow.
ACHERON
Another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of
ancient Acheron. The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest
taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron.
And as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows
there MOVE.
Is it a trick of the light? No. Whatever the dark forms are,
they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires
and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and Khalar
Singh.
Khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Beyond my dreams --
THE ALTAR
Tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to
the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised
to fall into the fiery depths.
TAMARA
Conan!!!
CONAN
On the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales
the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. He moves quickly,
trying to get to Tamara.
KHALAR SINGH
Khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures
rises out of the pit. They climb the walls like insects,
clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying
mantis.
ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
The look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human,
part demon. Their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of
black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red
eyes and gnashing teeth.
100.
They advance on Khalar Singh, who is furthest down now that
Conan climbs upward towards Tamara.
KHALAR SINGH
(IN ACHERONIAN)
I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron.
I command you to kneel!
And this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor
sharp teeth bared. Unsure, Khalar grips his tulwars tight.
The demonic creatures draw close, and they -- kneel. They
climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads
before Khalar Singh.
Out of the corner of his eye, Khalar spots Conan, drawing
near.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
(IN ACHERONIAN)
Show him the might of the army of
Acheron!
But they do not rush to follow the order. They stir. One of
them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at
Khalar's Guardsmen.
ACHERONIAN COMMANDER
(IN ACHERONIAN)
First, we feed.
Its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss.
KHALAR SINGH
Fine. Take your fill. I will kill
him myself.
CONAN
Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across
chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave
of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining
Guardsmen.
KHALAR'S GUARDSMEN
Khalar's Guardsmen, who have been watching the events with
mouths agape, realize the danger too late. The horde of
Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues
between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.
CONAN
His climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling
the cliffs of Cimmeria.
101.
KHALAR
Intercepts Conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the
ready.
CONAN
Your story ends here.
The two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to
the statues.
ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
The demon warriors not only slay Khalar's Guardsmen, but rip
their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the
blood of their victims. It is a violent ritual, both
Bacchantic and gruesome.
KHALAR
Launches himself at Conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone
statuary. Conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows.
Khalar overextends himself, and Conan's sword just barely
misses his throat.
Khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. Conan's eyes
narrow, he knows what Khalar is doing.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Like a woman, Fariq cried and
begged me to spare him.
Khalar ROARS in rage, launching an all-out offensive. Conan
backs up slowly, waiting for his moment.
And it comes quickly. Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS
Khalar across the stomach. Khalar loses his balance and
falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling
over the abyss.
Conan raises his sword to finish the job.
TAMARA (O.S.)
Conan!!!
Conan glances down. The Acheronian Commander drank his fill,
and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking Tamara's
body. With one touch, the shackles open. He and the
Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss.
Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.
102.
KHALAR SINGH
They take her to a place you can
never follow. Who will you fail,
Cimmerian? Your father or your
woman?
Conan leaps down to the altar. The Acheronian Warriors
attack. Standing atop the altar, Conan cuts down all comers,
cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to Tamara.
CONAN
Tamara!!
They leap on Conan, impossibly fast. They stab him. They cut
him. But he does not stop. Even wounded, he throws them into
the abyss.
And he reaches Tamara, just before the Commander drags her
below. He grabs her arm. The Commander grabs her other arm,
baring his shark-like teeth.
BLAM! Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and
the Commander falls into the abyss.
The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms. Only for
Tamara to scream.
TAMARA
Conan!
Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes. Khalar's tulwar
narrowly misses, and Conan counters. His father's sword runs
Khalar Singh through.
Khalar's body falls into the abyss.
But the Acheronian Warriors surround them. Thousands climb
out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded
Conan. Tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs Conan.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
Conan, you know what you must do.
Kill me.
CONAN
No.
TAMARA
It is the only way to end this. My
death gives others life.
CONAN
I cannot.
103.
TAMARA
You must. Your parents both
understood that purpose. Now it is
yours. Live, Conan.
A tear falls from Tamara's face. The demonic warriors prepare
to strike.
Conan drives his sword into Tamara's heart. The crown spikes
retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss.
BOOM! A seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly
GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into
the abyss.
ACHERONIAN CAVE
The cave begins to fall, massive sections of the roof
dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below.
ALTAR
Conan pulls Tamara's body away, even as the world descends
into dust and debris.
