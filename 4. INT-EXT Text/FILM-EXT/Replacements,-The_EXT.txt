It's raining lightly in the harbor and the
water around the moored boats looks dirty and
cold.
We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in
an end slip.
It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin
cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long
time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood
addition has been nailed to the top of the
cabin. It's partially covered with a blue
plastic tarp.
SUPERIMPOSE:
MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA -
FALL
The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked
torso emerges from under it. Shane is late
twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly
going to seed. He looks hung over.
Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He
pulls on the top part of an old patched wet
suit and zips it up. He shivers.
We're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in
an old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY.
Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood
to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty
oblong of his face is visible.
It's still raining as he steers the little
boat around the sailboats and yachts.
He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS
the ENGINE.
With practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to
the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a
bill for services rendered on the sailboat's
stern line.
He slips on a weight belt,
puts on a pair of
old gaffer taped goggles,
jams the end of a
air-hose in his mouth, and
falls backward out
of the dinghy and into the
water.
It's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane
floats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long
spatula.
ANOTHER ANGLE
He attacks the underside of the sailboat
which is covered with green algae muck that
hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.
The spatula scrapes away the green mess
revealing the pure white underside of the
boat.
CLOSE ON SHANE
As he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats
past him. This doesn't look like fun.
As he works, he happens to look down and
notices something on the bottom.
SHANE'S POV
Amidst the beer cans and other trash,
something golden is sitting on the bottom.
BACK TO SCENE
Shane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it
go and drifts down.
A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky
water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried
in the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks
it up.
The trophy is almost a full-size football
rendered in bronze attached to a broken base.
Shane turns "the ball" over in his hands. He
grips the seams like he's done this before.
Then he holds the football out in front of
him.
Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals
to an imaginary offense. He turns to his
running back as he yells something like "Blue
31!" It comes out in bubbles
He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver
goes in motion.
Then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five
step drop.
He moves in slow motion because hey... he's
underwater! He executes a perfect play
action fake on the third step of his drop,
and looks "down field" for his receivers.
But there's a blitz! He steps up in the
pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes
his head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves
in a kind of delicate ballet.
He rolls left and keeps looking for the open
man.
Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and
cocks his arm.
The "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps
forward in a perfect release.
The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON
Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he
throws both arms up in a touchdown signal.
We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of
victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the
trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del
Rey.
CUT TO:
D.C.) -
DAY
Bam! A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a
Washington Redskin running back and lands on
his throat, elbow first.
It's a beautiful fall day in November and
Miami is beating the Skins in front of
seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans.
The Redskins are at their home stadium better
known as "The Big O."
Redskin quarterback EDDIE MARTEL is
conferring with Redskin head coach BUD TILDON
near the bench. Madden and Summerall
continue OVER.
MADDEN (V.O.)
Take it all in, people.
This could be it for
2,000.
We MOVE TO veteran Redskin center REESE
EVANS, 38, standing on the sidelines, uniform
totally clean.
He looks near tears.
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
Once again, if you
haven't heard, it was
announced during
halftime that the
N.F.L. Players
Association will hold a
press conference
immediately following
this game -- that would
make it about five
o'clock Eastern time --
and it is expected that
the players' union will
announce a strike
effective immediately.
ON REDSKINETTES
Twelve striking-looking women dressed in
burgundy and gold are doing some inane
chatter to a section of fans that ignore
them.
The girls are led by pretty ANNABELLE
FARRELL, a bundle of manic energy inside a
body from heaven.
MADDEN (V.O.)
It's all about money,
folks. More money, of
course and ain't it
always? The shame of
it is the big losers
are you out there, the
fans.
ON MARTEL
The Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
Here we go: Third
down, eight seconds to
play, ball on the
Dolphins' thirty-three
yard line. Skins down
by a touchdown.
The huddle breaks and Martel sets up over the
center.
MARTEL
Green 48! Green 48!
Hut! Hut!
The ball is snapped and Martel drops back.
He looks for a receiver and doesn't see
anybody.
He steps up in the pocket, sees an opening
and takes off running down field.
MADDEN (V.O.)
There goes Martel!
Martel is a pretty good broken field runner
for a big guy. Plus with the defense
covering every possible receiver, he's got a
lot of daylight.
Nobody has touched him as he crosses the
fifteen. Suddenly, a safety, smaller than
Martel, looms in front of him at the ten.
Martel goes down in one of those wimpy
quarterback slides before the safety can even
hit him.
BANG!
The GUN sounds and the game is over.
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
They look at each other in disbelief
SUMMERALL
Well... Martel goes
down ten yards short of
a score.
MADDEN
On maybe the last play
of the season.
SUMMERALL
I think he might have
slipped.
MADDEN
Yeah, there's a lot of
that going around.
ON THREE REDSKIN FANS
We'll see these guys throughout. They're
typical low level Washington bureaucrats
named TODD, ROD and BOB who live for the Hogs
-- the traditional name for the Redskin
offensive linemen.
Todd is shirtless and his entire upper body
is painted Redskin red.
At that moment, they are livid with their
quarterback and Bob is speaking for them all.
BOB
We're
coming to your
house
tonight, and
we're
gonna fucking
kill
you! And if you
got a
dog, we're gonna
kill
your fucking dog
too!
ON ANNABELLE
Behind her, the rest of the cheerleaders are
already walking away. Annabelle looks at
Quarterback Martel with pure disgust as he
walks off the field.
CUT TO:
Shane Falco, wearing his patched wetsuit,
climbs out of his inflatable dinghy and flops
onto the deck of his cabin cruiser.
He looks cold and tired.
McGINTY (O.S.)
You look like a
swordfish I caught
once.
Shane jumps.
McGinty is sitting in an old deck chair on
the stern of the boat.
McGINTY
He hit the deck just
like that.
Shane studies his visitor.
SHANE
And you look like that
coach from the
Seventies. From the
Redskins. McGinty.
Except you look a
shitload older.
McGINTY
The price of happiness.
Something to take the
chill off?
He offers Shane an elegant flask.
Shane
takes it and drinks.
McGINTY
I'm running the
Redskins again. And I
want you to quarterback
'em.
SHANE
No, man, I've been out
way too long.
McGINTY
What, three years since
San Diego dumped you?
That's nothing. You're
in shape, flopping
around in the water
like that.
SHANE
You know what my
nickname was in San
Diego, don't you?
McGINTY
Sure.
Footsteps.
SHANE
As in, I hear 'em and I
dump the ball.
McGINTY
Well, you didn't have
much of a line to
protect you.
SHANE
I got two concussions
to prove it.
McGINTY
That's why girls don't
play the game.
McGinty drinks from his flask.
McGINTY
I scouted you when you
were playing at Ohio
State. I told San
Diego they were
probably making a
mistake when they
signed you.
SHANE
(truly shocked)
No kidding?
McGINTY
Oh, you had a lot of
tools: a quick
release. Fast. A
scrambler by nature.
Good downfield vision.
But you got hurt a lot.
And worst of all, you
never could win the big
game. What did you
lose the Sugar Bowl by,
your senior year?
What, forty points?
SHANE
Forty-five. And now
you want to recruit me?
McGINTY
A scrambling
quarterback is gonna do
real well in this new
replacement
environment. And to
tell you the truth, I
think I can help you
with your biggest
problem.
SHANE
Okay.
What's my
biggest problem?
McGINTY
Courage. I think that
Sugar Bowl took it all
out of you.
There's a beat as Shane looks away.
SHANE
I'm retired from
football.
McGINTY
Yeah, and it looks like
things have been going
really well for you
since.
Shane doesn't meet McGinty's eyes.
SHANE
I like being here.
It's quiet. I like
being alone.
McGINTY
Yeah. No screaming
crowds, that's for
sure.
(pause)
You know what separates
the winners from the
losers? Gettin' back
on the horse. The one
that kicked you in the
teeth. You're still
young. You still got
bags of talent. If you
do well, who knows what
will happen when the
strike ends?
Shane keeps staring out at the water.
McGINTY
You want me to tell you
you're not going to get
hurt? You know you
will. No doubt about
that. But, hell...
McGinty points to the boats in the harbor.
McGINTY
... Wouldn't you rather
get hurt than scrape
the shit off of other
guys' toys?
CUT TO:
We're right off Queens Boulevard on a busy
side street where LOU PACIFICO, 30, is taking
book. Lou is short, dark and handsome.
He leans against the wall of a liquor store.
PASSERBY #1
Deuce and an eightball
on Go Down, Rita in the
eighth.
Lou writes quickly on a small pad.
After a beat, another passerby leans in and
whispers something to Lou. Lou writes
quickly again.
>From across the street an old woman sticks
her head out of a four-story walk-up. This
is LOU'S MOTHER who speaks with a heavy
Italian accent.
MOTHER
Louis, you got a phone
call!
LOU
(from across the
street)
Who is it?
MOTHER
It's the Washington
Foreskins.
LOU
What?! Ma, what are
you, out a your tree?
MOTHER
(yelling louder)
I'm telling you they
said it's the
Washington Foreskins!
Foreskins! Foreskins!
Foreskins!
People in the street are now starting to look
up at this old woman screaming "Foreskins!"
Louis quickly crosses the street to his
apartment house.
But at that moment, a soccer ball bounces
toward him from where a group of kids are
playing in an alley.
Out of pure instinct, Lou gives it a mighty
boot.
We FOLLOW the arc of the ball as it sails
DOWN the block. Everyone stops to admire the
kick.
Still airborne, the ball crosses Queens
Boulevard.
At that moment, a very old mafioso type is
being helped from his limo by several
lieutenants.
Pow! The ball hits the old guy right in the
back of the head, knocking off his porkpie
hat and dropping him to the pavement like a
bullet.
The lieutenants pull pistols and surround
their fallen leader.
ON LOU
He sees what happens and quickly ducks into
his apartment house.
ON ONE MAFIA LIEUTENANT
He spots Lou before he disappears inside.
CUT TO:
Coach ROLAND LAMONT, a good-looking ex-
running back in his late twenties, is
coaching a high school player.
We can see that Roland is wearing a pretty
substantial knee brace.
He holds up a football.
ROLAND
Cut right on me, now.
Right on me.
He pitches the ball out to one kid, who runs
right at him, steps on Roland's foot with his
cleats and then cuts around him.
Roland screams and falls to the ground.
ROLAND
Not right on me,
goddamn it!
He writhes there a beat until he hears:
VOICE (O.S.)
Coach Lamont! Phone
call! Long distance.
Washington, D.C. It's
the Washington
Redskins!
Roland holds his foot and manages a smile
because he seems to know what the phone call
means.
ROLAND
(to the sky)
Thank you, Lord!
CUT TO:
The stadium appears empty.
Suddenly, a football thrown with a perfect
spiral comes AT us.
REVERSE ANGLE
We see the ball sail cleanly through a rubber
ring attached to the crossbar on the
goalpost.
ON SHANE FALCO
He's in shorts and a sweatshirt taking snaps
from center Reese Evans.
EVANS
Nice. Try a roll to
the right.
Evans bends over another ball.
Shane sets up
in the shotgun.
O'NEIL (V.O.)
Shane 'Footsteps'
Falco? This is what
you're going to build
an offense around?
McGinty is sitting with O'Neil on the fifty
yard line twenty rows back.
Augustine holds O'Neil's oxygen tank as the
old man sits huddled in a coat that's way too
big for him.
O'NEIL
Christ, Jimmy, I ask
you to build me a team
based on balls and the
first player I see is
Footsteps Falco?!
McGINTY
He's got as much
natural talent as any
quarterback in the
league.
O'NEIL
And he's got the
happiest feet I've ever
seen!
McGINTY
All he needs is a shot
of self-confidence.
He's our quarterback.
That's the way it is.
O'NEIL
What about a safety?
We got two a days
starting tomorrow and a
game in five days! And
we still don't have a
safety?!
O'Neil motions to Augustine for more oxygen.
AUGUSTINE
Here we go. Nice fat
little hits.
He turns the valve up.
O'Neil breathes
deeply.
O'NEIL
I called a friend of
mine who just happens
to be the Governor of
Maryland.
McGINTY
Terrific, the Governor
is going to play
safety?
O'NEIL
Don't worry about it.
ON SHANE
He drills a perfect spiral through the
circle.
CUT TO:
A ramp at the rear of the stadium gives
vehicle access to the interior. The bottom
of this ramp is now a maelstrom of activity.
The regular Washington Redskins are in a
picket line walking in circles. The players
are dressed in everything from fur coats to
expensive leather jackets and leather pants.
Half of them are on cell phones.
We can see some of their cars parked
haphazardly nearby: BMWs, Porsches,
Mercedes, etc.
Jerome Lindell, the president of the
Players' Association, is being interviewed on
camera by a REPORTER.
REPORTER
As president of the
Players' Association,
what does your presence
mean here, Mister
Lindell?
LINDELL
Very simply, support
for these fine players
and union men.
Washington D.C. is the
home of freedom and the
collective bargaining
agreement. I am here
to remind all Americans
that the owners are no
better than the robber
barons of the
Nineteenth Century.
They have blatantly
gone out and hired
scabs, which is against
all principles of our
Constitution and the
Declaration of
Independence and
probably even the
Emancipation
Proclamation.
The picketers start shouting and pointing.
LINDELL
And here come the
Scabskins now!
A bus slowly makes its way towards the ramp
and the picketers.
The replacements are getting off the bus as
the players chant.
PLAYERS
Scabskins! Scabskins!
When Reese Evans (former Redskin center) gets
off the bus, the players go wild.
Reese coolly gives them the international
suck my dick sign.
Clifford gets off behind him. He waves and
smiles at the striking players.
They throw rotten fruit at Clifford in
return.
CUT TO:
Andre and Jamal are hitting the blocking sled
simultaneously. They drive it OUT OF FRAME.
ON SHANE
He's now wearing a helmet with a twobar
quarterback face guard. He takes a snap and
pitches out to running back Roland Lamont.
Roland, now wearing a big knee brace, looks
sharp as he cuts to the outside.
ON PILACHOWSKI
The offensive coordinator is standing with
McGinty who is concentrating on the
scrimmage. Suddenly, Pilachowski spots
someone. His mouth drops open.
ON MICKEY LEE
He's a fourhundred-fifty-pound ex-Sumo
wrestler crammed into a Redskin uniform.
Fat
rolls are visible everywhere.
PILACHOWSKI
Oh my God. That's
disgusting!
Lee walks up. McGinty bows and says
something in Japanese. Lee bows and answers
back in Japanese. Then they shake hands.
McGINTY
How you doin', Mickey?
LEE
Not bad, Coach.
McGINTY
You look great. Why
don't you work out at
left tackle?
LEE
You got it.
Lee puts on his helmet, pulls his ponytail
out the back and rumbles away.
Pilachowski is looking at McGinty like he's
crazy.
PILACHOWSKI
You're not serious.
McGINTY
I met Mickey in Hawaii.
When he was even
bigger. He's a Sumo
wrestler. That means
he's an expert at
pushing people around.
That's what pass
blocking is, Leo.
Defensive coordinator Christopher Banes comes
running up in a lather.
BANES
(to McGinty)
I got a defensive end
who's deaf!!
PILACHOWSKI
(watching Lee
walk
away)
I'll trade you for a
tackle who's gonna play
in a diaper.
BANES
How can I coach a deaf
man?!
McGINTY
You don't have to...
He looks across the field at a big, good-
looking kid named BRIAN MURRAY who is in the
middle of a pass rushing drill.
Murray looks really fast, especially for his
size.
McGINTY
Brian Murray would have
gone in the first round
five years back if he
hadn't been born deaf.
I first saw him play
right here in D.C. for
Galludet College. He's
a hell of an athlete.
You won't have to tell
him anything.
BANES
I can't believe it! I
got to be able to
communicate with him.
McGINTY
Then learn to sign.
Hey, look at it this
way: He'll never get
pulled off sides on an
audible.
McGinty thinks this is funny as shit.
ON SHANE
He's just done a fivestop drop on a pass
play. He's looking down field when he sees
something scary.
SHANE
Oh shit! No!
He throws the ball away and then is nailed
and taken down on his back by Bateman
(psychotic cop).
Shane groans and lies there with Bateman on
top of him.
BATEMAN
Hi, I'm Danny.
SHANE
(groaning)
Shane.
McGinty pulls Bateman up.
McGINTY
Nice pop, Danny.
BATEMAN
Thank's, Coach!
Danny runs off.
SHANE
What was that?
McGINTY
Danny Bateman. Ex-cop,
ex-Marine, ex-rugby.
He's absolutely
harmless, if you just
play dead.
McGinty helps Shane up.
McGINTY
San Diego used you all
wrong. You're not a
drop back passer.
You're a scrambler.
Like you were in
college. So, we're
gonna roll out. A lot.
Get used to setting up
on the run. You'll
live a lot longer.
SHANE
I'm very interested in
that.
CUT TO:
PRACTICE MONTAGE
A)
BATEMAN
is lined up at middle linebacker. When
the play starts, he runs headlong into
four blockers and takes them all down
with him.
B)
WIDE RECEIVER CLIFFORD FRANKLIN
beats his man, and turns as Shane,
rolling out to his left, puts the ball
right on his numbers. Franklin drops it.
C)
ANDRE AND JAMAL
On the snap, they pull to lead a sweep.
Unfortu-nately, each thinks the play is
to their side. They forearm each other
and then get into a fight.
D)
LOU PACIFICO
boots one from thirty-five yards through
the uprights. He smiles, takes out a
Marlboro Light and a Bic and fires up.
E)
CLIFFORD FRANKLIN
pulls up, does a button hook and Shane
puts the ball in his hands. Franklin
drops it.
F)
LEE
the Sumo guy, hits the blocking sled and
turns it over.
G)
BATEMAN
is down on the ground viciously punching
another player as two assistants try to
pull him off.
H)
FRANKLIN
is in a crossing pattern in the end zone.
Shane puts the ball right in front of
him. Unfortunately, it hits him in the
hands.
CUT TO:
Shane is sucking down water from the portable
water cart when head cheerleader Annabelle
Farrell walks up. She's dressed in tight
workout clothes.
ANNABELLE
Annabelle Farrell, head
Redskinette.
SHANE
Excuse me?
ANNABELLE
I'm in charge. Of the
Redskinettes. The
cheerleaders?
SHANE
Oh yeah, hi.
ANNABELLE
I've been watching you.
You look good. You
look strong. Good
quick release. Smart.
You read defenses
quickly. You're gonna
do great.
SHANE
Hey... thanks.
ANNABELLE
I saw your second
concussion. The one
against Cleveland.
Pow! You could hear it
in the cheap seats.
But you completed the
pass. That's what
counts.
SHANE
I guess so.
ANNABELLE
If there's anything you
need, let me know. And
I mean anything, okay?
You understand?
Shane is really not sure.
SHANE
Sure.
I understand.
ANNABELLE
They put you up at the
Hilton?
SHANE
Yeah.
ANNABELLE
Good. Remember:
anything. You got it?
Okay?
Shane nods.
She walks away.
We watch her world-class ass move across the
gridiron.
ON McGINTY AND CLIFFORD FRANKLIN
McGinty is holding a ball and talking to his
wide receiver.
McGINTY
... because it's a damn
waste of all that
speed, Clifford. I
told you that when you
were in high school.
You've got to catch the
ball, son. This is the
main idea of the
passing game.
CLIFFORD
I know, Coach, I know.
McGINTY
Okay. I assume that
you have touched a
woman in a romantic
way, have you not?
CLIFFORD
Oh yeah, Coach, sure.
In a, you know,
romantic way.
McGINTY
Good. From here on
out, you touch this
football, all the
time...
He shoves the football in Clifford's hands.
McGINTY
... just like you touch
your girl friends. I
better not see you
without this ball. You
understand?
McGinty starts to walk away.
CLIFFORD
Coach, wait! Can I
still like touch my
girl friends if I
don't, you know, let go
of the ball?
McGinty thinks about that.
McGINTY
Yes, Clifford, if you
can manage that,
absolutely.
CUT TO:
The regular Redskins are out in force,
holding signs as they lean on their Beamers
and Porsches.
Shane pulls up in a battered '89 Honda.
When he gets out, he's immediately surrounded
by six striking regulars, led by quarterback
Eddie Martel and defensive end Wilson Jones.
MARTEL
Hey, you can't park
there.
SHANE
Look, I don't want any
trouble.
MARTEL
You don't want any
trouble?! You're
taking my job away, but
you don't want any
trouble?
(to Wilson)
He doesn't want any
trouble, but he puts
this piece of shit in a
no parking zone.
Shane looks but it's obvious he's parked
legally.
SHANE
Okay.
I'll move it.
MARTEL
No, we'll do that for
you. Go ahead, Wilson.
Move it for him.
Wilson motions to another big guy. The two
of them proceed to roll the Honda over on its
roof. It lands with a crunch.
JAMAL (O.S.)
You all put that car
back.
Everybody turns to see Andre and Jamal
walking towards them.
WILSON
Who the fuck are you?
ANDRE
We're the people who
take care of the
quarterback. We're the
guards.
All the regulars laugh at this.
JAMAL
Put the car back.
Gently.
WILSON
Kiss my ass.
SHANE
(to Jamal)
It's okay.
JAMAL
No, it's not.
Jamal points to a gorgeous midnight blue
Porsche.
JAMAL
(to Wilson)
That's your ride, ain't
it?
Before Wilson can even answer, Jamal pulls
his NINE MILLIMETER. BOOM! BOOM! No more
Porsche windshield.
All the regular Redskins dive for cover.
WILSON
My windshield! You
crazy motherfucker!
JAMAL
Move his car back.
WILSON
My car!
Jamal raises his GUN again.
POW!
No Porsche
driver's side window.
WILSON
No!
Stop!
He turns to his cowering teammates.
WILSON
Come on, help me, god
damn it!
The guys quickly pick up the Honda and put it
right side up.
WILSON
(to Jamal)
You are gonna pay for
this.
JAMAL
No I'm not. And quit
messing with my man
here. That includes
his ride.
Jamal spins the nine and holsters it.
Andre and Jamal get on either side of Shane.
They look at each other and then quickly
switch sides.
ANDRE
Let's go to practice,
Shane.
SHANE
Let's do that.
Shane smiles at his guards, smiles at the
still-shocked Redskins, and they move out.
CUT TO:
A barbecue is in progress for the new
Washington Redskins at the beautiful home of
Coach McGinty.
The huge back yard features a pool and a
catered buffet/barbecue.
Andre and Jamal are loading down their
plates.
Mickey Lee is gnawing on a two-foot slab of
ribs.
Lou Pacifico has a little three card monty
going at a picnic table.
Coach
McGinty is holding up a beautiful baby
girl
to the admiring players. He kisses the
baby
and then hands the child to his gorgeous
young
wife.
Augustine is pushing Mister
O'Neil in a
wheelchair. They pass the
outside bar and
O'Neil suddenly lunges for
a bottle of
tequila. Augustine has to
rip it out of his
hands.
Coach Banes and Earl Wilkinson (criminal) are
talking to a distinguished-looking big man in
his fifties. This is a D.C. CIRCUIT COURT
JUDGE.
BANES
Where did you play,
Judge? Wait. Do I
call you judge?
JUDGE
Your Honor, or Judge is
fine. I played at
Harvard. But I played
in the days when you
went both ways.
Offense and defense.
When players were
really tough.
(to Wilkinson)
And where did you play
college ball... I'm
sorry, what was your
name again?
Wilkinson is smiling but he looks dangerous.
WILKINSON
Smith. Ray Smith. I
played at a junior
college nobody ever
heard of. What
position did you play
on defense, Judge?
JUDGE
Middle linebacker.
WILKINSON
Yeah, big fellow like
you, that's what I
would have guessed.
JUDGE
It was a different game
in those days. Raw.
Powerful. No tricks,
like today.
WILKINSON
You know, maybe you can
show me some of your
technique, Your Honor.
Maybe you can show me
some of that toughness.
JUDGE
I'd be glad to!
There's an evil glint in Wilkinson's eye.
The Judge (now with his jacket off) and
Wilkinson are lined up across from each other
in a three-point stance in something called a
man maker drill.
The entire team forms two lanes on either
side of them, as they face off.
The idea is to knock the other guy down and
get by him.
JUDGE
Alright, this is how we
used to stop a running
back.
WILKINSON
I can't wait.
Someone says hut! And Wilkinson slams into
the Republican 16th Circuit Court Judge and
knocks him head over heels.
The Judge lands on his back, wham!
He's out
cold.
Wilkinson slaps hands with Andre and Jamal.
WILKINSON
Oooh... got me a judge!
Man, that felt good!
CUT TO:
It's another beautiful fall afternoon and
cars are entering the stadium parking lot.
At one of the entrances, the striking
Redskins are picketing. Jerome Lindell (NFL
Players President) is still marching with
them.
A little boy stops one of the Redskins and
asks for an autograph on a program. The
player gives it to him and the kid walks
away.
Lindell runs after the kid, grabs the program
and rips off the page the player signed.
LINDELL
(to kid)
Don't be asking
for no
autographs from
the
real players and
then
go in and watch
the
scabs!
The kid retreats quickly.
Lindell rips up
the page.
LINDELL
(to the player)
That is not the message
we want to send our
children!
CUT TO:
We're FOCUSED ON an enormous,
plastic blow-up
Washington Redskin helmet that
bobs on the
ground in front of the exit to
the field.
The idea is, the players will
run into and
then out of the helmet as they
are
introduced.
Annabelle and her fellow twenty cheerleaders
are lined up on either side of the bobbing
helmet, waiting for the players.
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
They are in their booth, vamping ON CAMERA.
MADDEN
... Pretty bold move by
New England Patriot
owner Victor Kiam, who
went out and bought an
entire semi-pro team
once the strike
happened.
(MORE)
MADDEN (CONT'D)
Redskin management, on
the other hand, is
going with a bunch of
unknowns. Their public
relations people don't
even have bios yet on
most of their players,
although we'll see one
or two familiar faces
out there today.
SUMMERALL
Like Shane Falco, the
enormously talented
college quarterback
from Ohio State, who
never fulfilled his
potential in the pro's.
(to Madden)
Wow, remember that
Sugar Bowl Falco
quarterbacked when
Florida State creamed
them?
MADDEN
Oh, yeah, they were
absolutely decimated!
SUMMERALL
Dusted. And if I'm not
mistaken, Falco set a
record in that game for
Bowl interceptions.
Anyway, for some of
these players this is
another shot; a last
shot, probably, for a
guy like Falco...
CUT TO:
BOOM! The Patriot kicker puts one in the end
zone for a touchback.
The ball is placed on the twenty as Shane and
the offense walk out onto the field.
Shane walks slowly toward the huddle that's
forming.
IN HUDDLE
Andre and Mickey Lee are arguing.
ANDRE
That's where I stand.
LEE
No it's not.
ANDRE
Come on, man, that's my
spot in the huddle.
ON SHANE
As he walks, we hear McGinty's voice in
Shane's helmet. Yes, they do it by one-way
helmet radio so the filtered voice you hear
is McGinty, speaking into his headset mike.
McGINTY (V.O.)
All right, son, nice
and easy now. Let's
run our ten planned
plays, get a feel for
the land...
Shane walks into the huddle and chaos.
ANDRE
... Fat fucking nip!
You don't know shit!
LEE
What did you call me?!
ANDRE
You heard me, you tub a
rice shit!
SHANE
Hold on, what's the
problem here?
Andre and Lee ignore Shane and start pushing
each other.
LEE
I'm gonna kick your
black ass...
ANDRE
You ain't kickin' jack
shit...
Now Jamal gets involved as Shane tries to get
between them.
JAMAL
(to Lee)
Don't be messing with
my brother...
SHANE
Hey, hold on...
ON REF
He's watching the play clock and when it gets
to zero he pulls his penalty flag and throws
it.
REF
Delay of game!
Five
yards!
IN HUDDLE
Lee suddenly punches Andre through his face
guard. Andre knocks into Shane and spins him
around. Jamal then goes to punch Lee, he
misses and nails Shane in the back of the
helmet.
Shane goes down hard.
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
They look confused.
SUMMERALL
... I don't know.
Something seems to be
going on in the huddle.
It looks like... yes,
Shane Falco is on his
back. They haven't run
a play yet but Falco is
down.
MADDEN
This is not a good
sign.
ON FIELD
Trainers race out to Shane, who is lying face
up with the huddle standing over him.
SHANE
(clearing the
cobwebs)
What happened? Am I
hurt already?
Shane sits up.
Suddenly, he remembers what
happened.
SHANE
God damn it! I am the
quarterback! I am the
only one supposed to
talk in the huddle!
ANDRE
Yeah, but he took my
place...
SHANE
I don't give a shit!
Shane gets to his feet.
SHANE
Huddle up!
Everybody leans in.
SHANE
If you've got something
to say, raise your
hand! Is that
understood?!
Lee raises his hand.
Shane grits his teeth
and nods.
LEE
Suppose like, you don't
feel good. Or you're
hurt or something like
that. Then what?
SHANE
Then you tell me before
the huddle starts!
Okay, listen up: 68
blue east storm toss.
On two.
Jamal raises his hand.
SHANE
What?!
JAMAL
That's to the right...
right?
ANDRE
No, it's to the left.
SHANE
It's to the right!
JAMAL
You better be quiet,
Shane, they'll hear
you.
We do hear a WHISTLE.
A penalty flag flies
by.
REF
Delay of game!
Five
yards!
Shane throws ups his hands.
ON McGINTY
He's talking into his mike.
McGINTY
What the hell is going
on?
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
MADDEN
Well, Pat, so far the
Redskins have minus ten
yards offensively.
ON O'NEIL
He's in bed sucking oxygen watching the game.
Augustine sits with him.
O'NEIL
Turn it off. This is
going to kill me.
ON REDSKIN HUDDLE
It breaks this time and everyone runs to the
line of scrimmage.
SHANE
Blue 68. Blue 68!
Hut! Hut!
On the snap, Shane turns to head off to
Lamont but instead runs right into Jamal who
knocks him down.
Shane looks up at Jamal.
SHANE
Have you suddenly
decided you don't like
me, Jamal?
JAMAL
Oh. You said it was to
the right, didn't you?
IN HUDDLE
Shane leans in.
SHANE
Okay. Let's try
something simple. 18
red left slot open.
(to Jamal)
That's to the left!
They break and Shane lines up over his
center.
SHANE
Eighteen red! Eighteen
red! Hut! Hut!
On the snap, Shane hands to Lamont who sweeps
left, cuts inside and picks up eight yards.
Shane is ecstatic.
SHANE
Yeah!
And then a penalty flag flies by.
REF
Holding! Number 78.
Shane looks at Jamal who is trying
desperately to hide his number.
Shane leans in with the next play. Cochran,
playing right tackle, can't resist.
COCHRAN
You see. We should
have prayed.
SHANE
Shut up! Pass. 22
Solo right slot 'A,' Y
stick. On one.
They break and come to the line of scrimmage.
SHANE
Twenty-two green.
Hut!
Shane does a play action fake to Lamont and
then turns downfield.
Wham! He's buried by three defenders. The
ball squirts loose and the Patriots recover.
ON PILACHOWSKI
He's livid on the sidelines. As his
offensive line comes off he rants at them.
Shane hobbles off past:
The defense rushing onto the field led by
Bateman.
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
Washington comes up a
minus fourteen yards on
their first possession.
ON PATRIOTS
They break their huddle and come to the line
of scrimmage. Bateman is snorting fire.
Earl Wilkinson (with SMITH on the back of his
jersey) patrols the secondary and calls out
the formation.
EARL
Wide right! You got
wide right! Check on
the wing!
The PATRIOT QUARTERBACK sets up over center.
PATRIOT QB
Blue fourteen!
Bam! Bateman runs offside and flattens the
quarterback. Penalty flags fly everywhere.
ON SIDELINE
Defensive Coordinator Banes rolls his eyes.
The Ref moves the ball five yards and gives
the offside sign.
ON PATRIOTS
They come out of the huddle again.
PATRIOT QB
Green eighty-seven!
Pow! Bateman dives offside again and
forearms the Quarterback, knocking him on his
back. Flags fly again.
One Patriot lineman makes the mistake of
pushing Bateman. Bateman literally jumps on
his head. More flags fly.
ON SIDELINE
Banes is screaming something unintelligible
at Bateman.
ON BALL
It's marched downfield by the Ref, this time
fifteen yards.
OVER this we hear:
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
I think the Redskins
just set a record for
penalties in the first
three minutes. We're
waiting for the stats
on that...
Here come the Patriots again.
CUT TO:
FIRST HALF MONTAGE
A)
SHANE
rolls to his right but the blitz
is on
and he reverses and rolls left.
He's
finally cornered and has to dump
the ball
off. The pass is incomplete and
he's
knocked on his ass.
B)
SHANE
fakes to Lamont and rolls again.
He
fires a bullet to Franklin on a
down and
out. Clifford actually catches
the ball,
then bobbles it and in trying to
get
possession again, hands the ball
to the
defender.
The defender can't believe it for a beat
and then he streaks down the sideline and
scores.
C)
McGINTY
just shakes his head.
D)
TODD, ROB AND BOB
scream in pain. Rod pours his own beer
over his own head.
E)
O'NEIL
looks disgusted as he watches with
Augustine.
F)
BATEMAN
grabs the opposing running backs' face
mask and spins him around and around.
Flags fly everywhere.
G)
SHANE
is on the run again looking for a
receiver. He finally throws the ball...
right into the hands of the opposing
safety.
Shane dives for the guy and misses.
The
safety scores.
H)
ANNABELLE
is trying desperately to get the crowd
into the game by jumping up and down and
waving her pom poms.
Five guys right in front of her get up
from their seats, take all their stuff
and leave.
CUT TO:
shows the Patriots up 17 to 0.
ON SHANE
He's rolling in the back field again looking
for a receiver.
SHANE'S POV
Nothing but meat coming at him.
BACK TO SCENE
Shane panics and tosses the ball out of
bounds. Shane looks at McGinty on the
sidelines. We hear McGinty's voice.
McGINTY (V.O.)
You had Lamont open in
the flat.
Shane puts his head down like he knows it.
McGINTY (V.O.)
Come on, now, son.
Pick up your pace on
the roll. See the big
picture. Pump and
fake, pump and fake.
IN HUDDLE
Everyone is dirty, sweating bullets and
breathing very hard.
Shane leans into the huddle.
Lee is raising his hand.
SHANE
What?
LEE
I don't feel good.
And with that he promptly vomits sixteen
eggs.
ANDRE
Oh, God!
COCHRAN
Oooooh...
JAMAL
Man, that's ripe!
Everyone is reacting.
Some players gag.
EVANS
Shane, we got to move!
SHANE
Okay. On the count of
three. Everyone more
left. Hut! Hut! Hut!
ON HUDDLE
Eleven bentover guys move in unison with tiny
steps to their left.
ON PATRIOTS' LINEBACKER
The guy watches the huddle moving.
PATRIOT LB
What the fuck is this?
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
Summerall has his binoculars on the moving
huddle.
SUMMERALL
John, how many years
have we been calling
games together?
MADDEN
Seventeen, I think.
Pat just hands John the binoculars.
IN HUDDLE
Shane calls the play as they continue to move
as one.
SHANE
U brown right, west 19
A lead. That's you,
Mickey. Puke on him if
you have to.
ON HUDDLE
The huddle stops and they break for the line
of scrimmage.
ON LEE
He lines up face to face with the Patriots'
defensive end.
Lee breathes in the guy's face and the
Patriot gags.
SHANE (O.S.)
Hut!
Lee runs right over the guy.
He's quickly
followed by Lamont with the ball.
Lamont runs for eighteen yards and a first
down.
ON PATRIOT DEFENSIVE END
He's waving for a substitute as he weaves off
the field.
MADDEN (V.O.)
Very nice off tackle
run by Lamont.
Execution was letter
perfect.
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
That puts the Redskins
in field goal range.
And here comes Pacifico
to see if he can get
them on the board
before the half ends.
ON PACIFICO
He flicks his smoke away as he runs out onto
the field.
He crouches down and waits for the snap from
Evans.
Pacifico lines himself up.
MADDEN (V.O.)
This will be a forty-
five yarder. That's a
tough distance for your
first N.F.L. field goal
try.
SHANE
Hut!
It's a perfect snap.
Shane spots it,
Pacifico belts it.
And it goes through for three.
ON TODD, ROD AND BOB
They begin immediately singing "Hail to the
Redskins," a march always sung after a score.
They and the sparse crowd in the stadium know
and sing every word.
ON PACIFICO
He gets high fives all around. Then Bateman
runs up and in his ecstasy, slaps Pacifico in
the head.
Pacifico goes down, knocked out cold.
ON CHEERLEADERS
Led by Annabelle, the girls are doing a
stirring finale to "Hail to the Redskins."
CUT TO:
The Patriots have the ball. Their
Quarterback drops back for a pass and throws
it.
ON WILKINSON
Earl is covering the intended receiver. He
deftly steps in front of the guy, and makes a
diving catch.
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
SUMMERALL
Another terrific
interception by Smith.
That's his second.
Madden starts shuffling through pages.
MADDEN
Yeah, this guy is a
player.
He finds the paper he's looking for.
MADDEN
According to the
Redskins, Ray Smith...
is... that's weird. No
college given, no high
school given. It just
says he's been a
resident of the state
of Maryland for the
last four years and
five months. Likes to
embroider.
CUT TO:
Shane is walking toward the huddle.
In his
ear, he hears:
McGINTY (V.O)
Half your job is
getting that huddle in
the right mindset. Use
your imagination,
Shane.
Shane stops short of the huddle.
Everyone is
looking at him.
There is a beat and then Shane steps in.
SHANE
Okay, let's all take a
few seconds to think
about what we were
doing for a living...
just last week.
Shane looks around the huddle.
Everybody
looks pained and/or depressed.
SHANE
Good. Let's kick ass.
Red right pass 15 x
hook.
They break the huddle and Shane sets up over
Evans. He glances over at Brian Murray.
Murray is lined up in a three point stance at
tight end. But his head is turned and he's
looking directly at Shane.
SHANE
Red fifteen! Red
fifteen! Hut!
Shane nods on the snap.
The front five, in the persons of Andre,
Jamal, Reese, Mickey Lee and Cochran, hit out
and simultaneously knock their men on their
backs.
Shane, with plenty of time, hits Murray over
the middle for twelve yards.
Shane looks over at the sidelines.
McGinty
is smiling.
MONTAGE
A)
SHANE
is under pressure but he rolls smoothly
and rockets the ball downfield.
Murray pulls it in for fifteen yards.
B)
SHANE
rolls left off the shotgun, fights off a
cornerback and throws back across field,
complete to Lamont coming out of the
backfield.
C)
PATRIOT
is calling for a fair catch on a punt.
He catches the ball but Bateman flies
INTO FRAME and decks him. Flags fly.
D)
ANDRE AND JAMAL
are blocking side by side, pushing their
men back as Lamont squeezes through with
the ball.
E)
EVANS
is pass blocking like the all pro that he
is. He knocks his man flat and then
doubles up on Cochran's man.
F)
BATEMAN
is pursuing a running back.
He knocks
down an official and runs right over him.
Then he gets his hands on the running
back and pushes him out of bounds and
then knocks over a photographer.
G)
SHANE
pumps once and then drills a twenty yard
spiral.
Clifford Franklin beats his man and dives
for the ball. He bobbles it, and then
squeezes it to his stomach as he hits the
ground.
CUT TO:
We're on the clock which shows one minute ten
seconds left in the fourth quarter.
ON HUDDLE
It breaks and comes to the line of scrimmage.
Shane drops into the shotgun.
SHANE
Hut, hut!
Shane rolls left but there's a blitz! The
cornerback is almost on him when Shane shifts
and rolls the other way.
ON FRANKLIN
He's wide open five yards from the goal line.
ON SHANE
They're breathing down his back.
SHANE'S POV
He sees Franklin and cocks his arm.
Suddenly, opposing jerseys are everywhere.
Shane dumps the ball. He's immediately
decked by a defensive end.
ON BALL
We watch the flight of it in SLOW MOTION. We
FOLLOW it right INTO the hands of... a New
England Patriot defensive back.
ON SHANE
He's down and not moving.
ON TODD, ROD AND BOB
They scream in despair.
ON ANNABELLE
She falls to her knees in pain.
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
Falco is intercepted.
That's too bad.
MADDEN (V.O.)
Yeah, and it looks like
he's hurt, too. He was
really starting to put
it together here in the
fourth quarter. Only
forty-eight seconds now
left on the clock.
ON SHANE
He's helped off the field and onto the bench.
ON McGINTY
He grabs Bateman before he can run out onto
the field.
McGINTY
Danny.
(very slowly)
Get me the ball.
BATEMAN
The ball. Okay, Coach.
He runs out onto the field.
ON PATRIOTS
They line up.
PATRIOT QB
Hut, hut, hut!
The quarterback hands off to the running back
right up the middle in a typical "run out the
clock" play.
BAM! Bateman comes out of nowhere, decks the
runner and literally rips the ball out of his
hands as he goes down.
ON CROWD
They go wild!
ON ANNABELLE
She does a cartwheel.
ON McGINTY
He's leaning over a groggy Shane on the
bench.
McGINTY
Don't shake your head
at me. You are going
back in there. You are
gonna run the same god
damn play, you are
gonna throw the ball to
Franklin again and this
time, he's gonna score.
SHANE
I can't...
McGinty grabs some smelling salts from a
hovering trainer.
He shoves them under Shane's nose.
Shane is
suddenly very awake.
McGINTY
You are the only one in
this entire stadium who
can do it. Do you
understand me? You can
do something no one
else can do. So, start
right here. Start
living your destiny.
Or give it up for good.
Right here. Right now.
Shane stares at him.
Then he stands up, wobbles and puts on his
helmet.
ON HUDDLE
They're all turned and watching as Shane
makes his way slowly out onto the field.
Annabelle watches him closely.
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
Here comes Falco with
eighteen seconds left
on the clock.
MADDEN (V.O.)
I'm surprised to see
him again after that
shot he took from
Bellinski.
ON HUDDLE
It breaks and Shane stands over Evans and
looks out at the defense.
Nasty-looking linebackers and cornerbacks
stare at him.
SHANE
22 green!
His voice cracks and several defensive
players openly laugh at him.
Shane gets an idea.
SHANE
Check! Black 43!
Black 43!
ON ANDRE
He's down in a three-point stance facing a
defender. He whispers to Reese:
ANDRE
What's that mean?
REESE
(whispering
back)
He's changing the play.
Listen!
SHANE
Black 43!
MADDEN (V.O.)
It's a long count.
Falco could be calling
an audible.
ON LAMONT
He shifts position in the backfield.
LAMONT
(to Shane)
Is this right?
SHANE
(shaking his
head)
Black 43 left!
Lamont shifts again. Clifford goes in motion
from his flanker position but then changes
his mind and goes back the other way.
Lamont and Clifford then bump into each
other.
ON PATRIOT DEFENSE
They are totally confused now as they try to
adjust to the equally confused Redskins.
ON McGINTY
He looks extremely pissed.
ON SHANE
SHANE
Hut!
Hut!
He turns to hand the ball off to Lamont but
Lamont is not there.
Shane turns the other way and sees Lamont
just standing there looking at him. Shane
runs over to him and hands him the ball.
Meanwhile, the Patriot defense is going the
other direction.
Lamont takes off.
One cornerback is not taken in. The guy
dives for Lamont's legs. We hear a CLANK as
the cornerback's HELMET hits Lamont's
industrial KNEE BRACE. The guy bounces off
and Lamont trots into the end zone.
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
Lamont scores!
MADDEN (V.O.)
Whoa! Falco calls an
audible at the line of
scrimmage and Lamont
takes it in!
Shane, meanwhile, is looking at McGinty on
the sidelines.
McGINTY (V.O.)
(in Shane's
helmet)
I guess you saw
something I didn't.
Shane nods vigorously.
McGINTY (V.O.)
Don't try to bullshit
me, pal. You didn't
want it. Winners
always want the ball
with the game on the
line. You know that.
Shane looks down.
McGINTY (V.O.)
Alright. The play
is... waggle right,
drag hook. You
understand?
Shane nods.
ON O'NEIL
He looks ten years younger as he and
Augustine watch.
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
With eight seconds
remaining, Pacifico
will try the extra
point that will send
this game into
overtime.
MADDEN (V.O.)
This turned out to be
one hell of a contest,
Pat!
ON PACIFICO
He sets up for the kick.
ON SHANE
He waits for the snap.
ON BRIAN MURRAY
He sets up at his flanker position.
SHANE
Hut!
Shane catches the snap and pitches the ball
out to Murray from his holding position.
MADDEN (V.O.)
It's a fake!
The Patriot right defensive end breaks
through and reaches for Murray. The only
person in his way is Shane, still kneeling in
the holding position. Shane screams as the
huge lineman trips over him and then falls on
him.
Murray sweeps around the right side and
scores untouched.
Redskins win.
Everybody goes nuts.
ON O'NEIL
He pounds on Augustine.
ON TODD, ROD AND BOB
They pound on each other.
Hail to the
Redskins is deafening.
ON McGINTY
He just smiles.
ON SHANE
He's still under the defensive end. Reese
Evans pulls the guy off and bends down to
Shane.
REESE
We won, Shane.
We won!
Shane manages a painful smile.
DISSOLVE TO:
Clifford, still carrying his football, comes
out of his apartment in a third floor walk-
up. He's wearing his Redskins jacket.
As he turns around from locking his door, he
stops dead in his tracks.
All of Clifford's neighbors, all the way down
both halls, are standing in front of their
doors.
They all start applauding.
Clifford smiles from ear to ear.
MONTAGE
A)
ANDRE AND JAMAL
are trying to hail a cab on Wisconsin
Avenue. Suddenly, one cab, then two,
then four SLAM on their BRAKES.
Cabbies hop out to open their doors for
the brothers.
B)
ROLAND LAMONT
walks down G Street with Brian Murray.
Brian spots something in a store window
and stops Roland.
Roland gasps as he sees himself
duplicated on ten TV screens in an
appliance store. He's on tape being
interviewed at a Redskins' practice.
C)
EARL WILKINSON
dressed in casual chic, is moving quickly
through Lord and Taylor's Department
Store
with two sales clerks in tow. He
stops,
grabs four cashmere sweaters,
smells
them, hands them to one clerk and
moves
on.
D)
LOU PACIFICO
is standing in front of the White House.
He has a line of ten people who are
paying five bucks for an autographed
picture of himself that he hands out from
a huge stack.
CUT TO:
We see Shane walk in the door.
We're DOWN ON the field in the middle of a
play.
Shane is running away from three New York
Giant defensive linemen.
Shane is not even looking for a receiver.
He's looking to save his life.
Finally, he's caught by a six-foot-five, two
hundred and seventy pound defensive end named
HANK MORRIS, who throws him down and lands on
top of him. Oooof!
MORRIS
(in Shane's ear)
Hello, again!
Jerome Lindell is once again outside the
stadium, picketing with a smaller group of
players.
He does his interview on camera, standing in
front of a huge semi-truck.
And a big, overweight truck driver stands
next to him.
LINDELL
... because it's about
brothers, and
brotherhood and
standing together
against the oppressors.
That's why I am so
grateful to our
Teamster brothers who
have joined us here
today in New York to
protest the greed squad
known as the N.F.L.
owners.
The truck driver suddenly pumps his arm and a
CACOPHONY OF TRUCK AIR HORNS GO OFF.
It's deafening but Lindell smiles through it
all.
Shane is rolling out with Morris on his heels
again. He can't find anyone open and runs
out of bounds.
IN HUDDLE
Everybody is breathing hard, beat-up and
exhausted. Shane leans in.
SHANE
(to Reese Evans)
You got to double up on
Morris.
EVANS
He's too far outside
for me to get to him.
(to Cochran)
Bring him down and sit
on him.
COCHRAN
He's huge! He's been
beating the crap out of
me all day! I feel
like a rag doll out
here.
LEE
I'll help this time.
SHANE
Okay. Spread left 'A'
Right, roll right Half
Back Sail. On two.
They break.
Shane sets up in the shotgun.
SHANE
Red, fifteen.
Hut,
hut!
On the snap, Lee and Cochran double-team
Morris.
Morris slaps Cochran away like, well, a rag
doll, and then confronts the Sumo master.
He bumps stomachs with Lee. Lee flies
through the air and lands on his ass.
ON SHANE
He spots his receiver, he cocks his arm and
wham! Morris decks him. And, of course,
lands on him. Oooof!
MORRIS
(to Shane)
It's just me, fuck-
face!
In order to get up, Morris puts one huge hand
on Shane's helmet and pushes himself up.
Shane moans as his face guard digs a four-
inch hole in the turf.
ON McGINTY
He's talking into his mike.
McGINTY
You want a time-out?
That looks like it
hurt.
Shane gets up. He's got a huge piece of turf
stuck in his face guard so that for a beat,
we can't even see him.
Then he pulls out the dirt and grass, and we
see Shane really pissed off for the first
time.
SHANE
Huddle up!
Everyone gathers around.
SHANE
Same thing... Except...
(to Lee and
Cochran)
Let him in. Don't
touch him.
LEE
What?
EVANS
Shane...
SHANE
Shut up! Let him
through. On two.
They break the huddle.
Shane goes into a
shotgun.
SHANE
Red fifteen. Hut!
Hut!
Shane does a three-step drop from the
shotgun.
Cochran and Lee hit out on either side of
Morris, giving him a clear shot at Shane.
Morris comes hard and fast.
Shane looks downfield, winds up, turns and
fires the ball at Morris's head.
The ball goes like a bullet for five feet and
then sticks like a dart in Morris's face
guard.
For a moment, Morris is blinded.
And Shane is dumbfounded.
Then Morris starts to wrestle the ball out of
his mask.
SHANE
Get him!
Andre and Jamal grab onto Morris who starts
stumbling down field with the ball still
stuck in his helmet.
MADDEN (V.O.)
Morris intercepts!
Wait! The ball is
stuck in his face!
But Morris won't go down. He's still trying
to pry the ball loose as he throws off Jamal.
Then he shakes off Andre.
ON BRIAN MURRAY
He's in SLOW MOTION in midair, diving towards
Morris.
MURRAY'S POV
It's absolutely QUIET (he's deaf, remember?)
as he soars towards Morris's head, helmet and
ball.
Wham! Murray's full body weight hits Morris
in the helmet, which flies off and rolls
across the field with the ball still stuck in
it.
OUT OF THE SILENCE, we suddenly hear the hit
and the crowd roar.
Morris goes down like a building with Murray
buried in his throat.
ON ROOM (D.C.)
Todd, Rod and Bob are destroying Todd's den
in reaction to the hit.
ON ANOTHER LIVING ROOM
Annabelle is screaming "Whoa!" to that hit.
ON O'NEIL AND AUGUSTINE
They're watching ON TV.
O'NEIL
Now that's a hit!
ON BALL AND HELMET
It's in the very chubby hands of Mickey Lee,
who is rumbling downfield with the
fumble/helmet recovery.
New York players have been slow to pick this
up because they, too, have been admiring the
lick that Murray put on Morris.
Suddenly, the whole team is chasing Lee.
They catch him pretty easily at the twenty,
but Lee represents a lot of weight.
Lee staggers across the ten, shaking players
off left and right.
One defensive halfback sacrifices himself and
throws himself at Lee's feet.
Lee trips over the guy, gains his footing
again, walks on the guy (who screams in
agony) and falls into the end zone carrying
three players with him.
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
John is beside himself.
MADDEN
Lee scores! Lee
scores! Lee scores! I
love to see a fat guy
score!
ON LEE
He gets up in jubilation, spikes the
ball/helmet combination, and runs through the
back of the end zone.
But he doesn't stop. He's aiming for a low
wall that separates the first row of fans
from the field.
ON FOUR FANS
They see Mickey rumbling at them and they all
get the picture at the same time. They
scream!
ON MICKEY
He launches himself into the stands in
ecstasy.
ON FOUR FANS
Crunch!
Lee lands on all four of them.
ON FOOTBALL
It's hiked into Shane's hands and Pacifico
boots the extra point.
ON SCOREBOARD
"Giants 10 -- Redskins 10
TIME REMAINING: 58 seconds."
ON SIDELINE
Murray and Lee are getting congratulations
from everyone.
PACIFICO
(to Murray)
What a hit!
(slower)
What a hit!
Murray nods that he understands.
EVANS
(to Murray)
I'm proud of you, kid.
Jamal and Andre are hugging Lee. In the
b.g., we can see paramedics lifting one of
Lee's four fans onto a stretcher.
ANDRE
You're the one, you're
the one, you're the
one...
LEE
You think that's worth
a shoe deal?
McGinty walks into the middle of it.
McGINTY
Stop with the lovefest!
Let's get the goddamn
ball back and win this
thing!
CUT TO:
We're CLOSE ON Bateman as he lines up for the
kick-off. Everybody in the stadium knows
that an on-side kick is coming.
Bateman is standing in the hot spot for
recovering the ball.
Shane and everyone with decent hands is on
the field.
Pacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards.
The ball takes a crazy hop, hits a Giant, and
ricochets off him.
Bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball
on the bounce. He's got it.
But Bateman doesn't go down. He turns and
starts running across the field.
Shane runs after him.
SHANE
No! Danny, go down!
You're using up the
clock!
But Bateman likes this new job: kick-off
returner! Especially after he runs over a
Giant and stiff-arms another.
Bateman is finally trapped on the far
sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards.
So, he turns and starts running back the
other way.
Shane has been chasing him and now sees
Bateman running back at him.
Shane has no choice but to throw himself in
front of Bateman's legs.
Bateman goes down.
Shane jumps up:
SHANE
(to ref)
Time out!
Bateman looks up at Shane.
BATEMAN
Beautiful tackle,
Shane!
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
Now that's something
you don't see everyday!
ON CLOCK
Bateman has burned up most of the clock.
Eighteen seconds remain.
ON SIDELINE
McGinty, Shane and Pacifico confer.
SHANE
We got time for one
play, but if we don't
get it out of bounds,
the game is over.
McGINTY
Yeah, but you're
looking at a sixty-five
yard kick from here.
PACIFICO
(smoking a butt)
No problem.
SHANE
Seriously?
PACIFICO
(to Shane)
You hold it. I'll kick
it.
McGinty looks at Shane and they both shrug.
McGINTY
What the fuck.
ON SUMMERALL AND MADDEN
Madden can't believe it.
MADDEN
I can't believe it!
McGinty is gonna let
Pacifico try the field
goal from sixty-five
yards out!
SUMMERALL
Hey, John, this kid has
got a heck of a foot.
STRAM
But sixty-five yards?
Come on!
ON SHANE
He's set up to receive the snap.
Pacifico lines himself up the way soccer-
style kickers do.
Then he takes a drag on his smoke, and flicks
it away.
MADDEN
(V.O.)
Pat... did he
just? I
think that guy
is
smoking on the
field!
SUMMERALL
(V.O.)
No, I think you
imagined that one,
John.
Shane looks at Pacifico and his clean
uniform.
Then Shane looks at his own uniform which is
covered with blood, dirt, and grass stains.
Pacifico looks clean.
SHANE
You look great, Lou,
you know that?
Pacifico is really touched.
LOU
Really? Thanks, Shane.
That means a lot to me.
Shane turns to Evans who smiles at him
between his own legs.
SHANE
Hut!
The snap is perfect.
Pacifico boots the shit
out of it.
ON BALL
End over end, yard after yard, it flies
straight and true.
MADDEN (V.O.)
It's straight enough!
If it's got the
distance, it's...
The ball hits the crossbar and goes over.
MADDEN (V.O.)
Good!
Redskins win!
Everybody goes crazy. Players are pounding
on Pacifico. But Pacifico is desperately
looking around for someone.
He spots him: It's Bateman running flat-out
across the field to congratulate him.
Pacifico runs for his life.
CUT TO:
It's a huge town house in Foggy Bottom.
Its
entrance is now lined with REPORTERS.
One is speaking ON CAMERA to his anchor.
REPORTER
Bob, I'm standing in
front of Redskins
owner, Edward Frances
O'Neil's home and all
we know right now is
that the Washington
player previously known
as Ray Smith is in fact
Earl Samuel
Wilkinson...
INSERT
We see two photographs of Earl: One with his
current beard and the other, his clean-shaven
mug shot of five years ago.
REPORTER (O.S.)
... the All Pro Miami
Safety who was serving
five to seven years in
the Maryland state
penitentiary for three
counts of aggravated
assault. As you may
recall, one of those
counts was against a
Baltimore City police
officer and resulted in
that officer being
hospitalized for quite
some time.
Andre, Jamal, Brian Murray, Roland
Lamont, Daniel Bateman, Lou Pacifico and
Shane are standing outside the stadium
after practice. They are all mobbed by
autograph seekers.
All of them are signing as fast as they can.
B)
The guys are on the grounds of the
Washington Monument. They are lined up
against a bunch of little kids. Shane
takes the snap. (The ball is a miniature
rubber football.)
All the linemen fall down. The kids
blitz and sack Shane for a big loss.
Annabelle watches and laughs and claps.
C)
MICKEY LEE
still crammed into the Cadillac.
He
looks exhausted and pissed.
LEE
(in a monotone)
You'll score, too, with
a Cadillac from Coleman
Cadillac. It's a big
car, for a big man.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
Okay. Good. That was
good. Let's try it
again...
LEE
(exploding)
What?! I'm not doing
it again! Who are you,
Orson Welles?! This is
nuts!
Lee tries unsuccessfully to get out of
the car.
D)
ALL REPLACEMENT PLAYERS
are lined up in Redskin jerseys, minus
pads. It's team picture day and everyone
looks happy to be there.
CUT TO:
Once again, fans stream into the parking
lots.
In a corner of a lot, Jerome Lindell is once
again holding forth ON CAMERA.
But this time, he's standing with a hard-
looking guy in a suit, named MATHESON.
LINDELL
I think that Mister
Matheson here, and
myself, are very close
to an agreement that
will put the 'pro' back
in pro-football.
REPORTER
Mister Matheson, what
are the sticking points
in the negotiations as
far as the owners are
concerned?
MATHESON
Only one: that the
players immediately go
back to work with no
change in the existing
contract.
Lindell looks uncomfortable.
But he smiles
anyway.
CUT TO:
Eddie Martel, Wilson Jones and other regular
Redskins take their seats on the fifty yard
line.
CUT TO:
Boom! Pacifico belts the kick-off deep into
the end zone. Touchback.
ON AL, DAN AND BOOMER
The three hosts sit in shirtsleeves and ties,
headphones on.
AL
That
is one
very big
leg
on Lou
Pacifico.
He's
a big
reason why
this
strike
team is two
and
0.
DAN
But the fact is, a
kicker does not an
offense make. I think
tonight the Scabskins
will have a very rude
awakening.
BOOMER
But you have to admit,
Dan, Falco is proving
to be the real thing.
DAN
Well, Boomer, no, I
don't have to admit
anything.
BOOMER
(rolling his
eyes)
Here we go...
Everybody laughs politely.
CUT TO:
Bam! Earl Wilkinson flattens a Dallas punt
returner. He's now wearing a jersey with his
real name on the back.
ON TODD, ROD AND BOB
Bob is dressed in a striped convict suit with
Wilkinson's number on it.
He gets high fives from Todd and Rod for
Wilkinson's hit.
ON SHANE
He walks out onto the field to join the
huddle.
ANNABELLE
Shane!
He turns and sees a smiling Annabelle.
Shane gives her a guilty wave and then
cringes with the pain of just having to lift
his arm.
ON LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
The Redskins line up. Cochran is opposite
Butler, the big tackle that "visited" Shane's
room.
COCHRAN
(to Butler)
I just want to say what
an honor it is to play
opposite you. And if
it's not too much
trouble, I would love
to have your autograph.
BUTLER
No problem.
SHANE (O.S.)
Hut!
Hut!
On the snap, Butler bashes Cochran's head
with his forearm and knocks his helmet off.
Then he runs over him.
ON SHANE
He under-throws a very weak-looking pass to
Lamont.
Shane grits his teeth against the pain.
ON COCHRAN
He's dazed and still on the ground.
Butler walks over and bends down to him.
BUTLER
I'm gonna autograph
your body with bruises,
you scab-ass son of a
bitch!
CUT TO:
Shane is in the backfield, once again running
for his life.
He's rolling left with Butler on his heels.
He throws another weak incomplete pass to
Murray.
Shane is crushed by Butler after he throws
the ball.
BUTLER
How's that side feel?
SHANE
(grimacing)
Like Christmas morning.
Butler leans on Shane's side as he gets up.
Shane gasps with pain.
ON McGINTY
He's watching Shane closely.
Then he talks
into his mike.
McGINTY
What's the matter with
your arm? Are you
alright?
ON AL, DAN AND BOOMER
They're watching the replay on their monitor.
Dan is very happy.
DAN
What pursuit! Butler
never gave up on him.
That's a 270-pound guy
who moves like a
halfback.
BOOMER
Dan, I think Butler's
hit on Falco was late,
to tell you the truth.
DAN
Well, of course you do.
You were a wimp
quarterback.
AL
Easy, guys.
Some laughter.
CUT TO:
FIRST-HALF MONTAGE
A)
DALLAS KICKER
Boom! The Dallas kicker puts away the
extra point after a score.
ON SCOREBOARD
Dallas 7, Washington 0.
B)
SHANE
is under pressure as he rolls out. When
a defensive lineman gets close, he throws
the ball away like we've seen him do
before. A defensive back intercepts.
Dallas's ball.
C)
BALL
Boom! The ball goes through the uprights
for a Dallas field goal.
ON SCOREBOARD
Dallas 10, Washington 0.
D)
AUGUSTINE
massages O'Neil's feet as the old man
watches the game. He looks worried.
E)
PACIFICO
smokes and stalks the sidelines. He
looks up into the stands and sees the
mafioso type looking down at him.
F)
SHANE
steps up in the pocket. He looks
downfield but in the face of the pass
rush, he throws the ball weakly out of
bounds.
G)
LEE
is pass-blocking but the first guy spins
him around and the second guy runs right
around him.
H)
BATEMAN
is double-teamed on a pass rush. He
spins but he can get no leverage against
his opponents. When the play ends, he
pushes one of them.
A penalty flag flies by.
I)
ROLAND LAMONT
takes a
pitch out, is immediately hit
hard and
loses the ball. A cornerback
picks it
up and takes it all the way for
a Dallas
score.
J)
WILKINSON
steps up and bats a ball away from a
Dallas receiver. A flag flies.
Wilkinson argues the call.
K)
COCHRAN
is lined up across
from Butler. On the
snap, Butler slaps
Cochran in the face
mask with his big,
fat club of a hand.
Cochran disappears
OUT OF FRAME.
L)
DALLAS KICKER
Boom! The Dallas kicker puts away the
extra point after a Dallas touchdown.
SCOREBOARD
Dallas 24, Washington 0.
M)
EDDIE MARTEL, WILSON JONES AND OTHER
REDSKINS
sitting in the stands look satisfied.
CUT TO:
The Redskins huddle. Shane is in pain.
He
looks up at the clock.
ON CLOCK
There's thirty-two seconds left in the half.
SHANE
Okay.
Red right 15 X
hook.
The break the huddle and come to the line of
scrimmage.
SHANE
15 X hut!
Shane rolls right and looks downfield. He
holds the ball and keeps rolling. No one can
get open.
Suddenly, Lamont cuts in front of him and
yells:
LAMONT
Shane!
Lamont sees an open lane and Shane follows
him. He eats up 15 yards before two
defensive halfbacks close in.
Lamont throws an incredible block and takes
out both guys.
Shane blows by and heads for the end zone.
Only a safety stands between Shane and pay
dirt.
CLOSE ON SHANE
His side is killing him with every step he
takes.
When the safety moves up on him, Shane panics
and goes down in the same kind of slide that
Eddie Martel did in the beginning.
Boom!
The GUN SOUNDS and the half ends.
Shane sees Redskin trainers running out onto
the field.
He turns and sees Lamont rolling on the
ground in pain as he holds his bad knee.
CUT TO:
Shane stops two paramedics who push Roland
Lamont on a stretcher. Roland is really
hurting.
SHANE
I'm sorry, Roland.
That was a great block.
ROLAND
For my last play in
football, I'll take
that block.
Shane looks terribly guilty.
ROLAND
I thought you were
going to score. What
happened? Did you
slip?
Shane can't look at him, but he nods.
ROLAND
That's what I thought.
SHANE
You were a warrior,
Roland. I'm gonna miss
you.
ROLAND
It was a dream come
true. Go kick some ass
for me.
The paramedics roll him away.
Shane slumps
against the wall near tears.
McGinty comes out of the locker room.
He
locks eyes with Shane for a beat.
And then McGinty turns his back on him and
walks away.
The Cowboys are already back on the field as
the Redskins come out of their locker room.
AL (V.O.)
... at nine-forty
Eastern time, the
agreement was reached,
and except for this
upcoming second half,
the strike is history.
ON AL, DAN AND BOOMER
Boomer's tie is off and his shirt is torn.
Dan looks guilty, but still angry.
DAN
It's about time. I say
let the professionals
back on the field. The
fans deserve nothing
less.
BOOMER
Yeah, you would say
that.
ON BALL
The Dallas kicker puts the ball in the end
zone for a touchback.
ON SHANE
He starts to follow the offense out on the
field. Then he turns and sees Annabelle
engrossed in a cheer.
He runs over to her.
ANNABELLE
Are you okay? Is it
your side?
SHANE
I'm okay. I owe you an
apology.
ANNABELLE
What?
You do?
SHANE
Yes. I'll explain
later. But thank you
for believing in me.
You give me strength
just looking at you.
And with that, Shane takes her in his arms
and kisses her deeply.
The crowd on that side of the field reacts to
the kiss with a "Wooooooo!"
AL (V.O.)
Well, this is a first.
Shane Falco seems to
be...
BOOMER (V.O.)
Hell,
Al, he's necking
with
a cheerleader!
I've
done a little of
that
in my time.
DAN (V.O.)
The players are not
supposed to fraternize
with the cheerleaders.
BOOMER (V.O.)
Hey, Dan, what are they
gonna do?
Fire him?!
ON SHANE
He breaks the kiss and looks up in the stands
at Eddie Martel.
Shane gives him the finger.
The crowd goes "Wooooo!" at that too.
Martel doesn't think this is funny.
Shane walks onto the field leaving a confused
but happy Annabelle.
He walks past Dallas defensive lineman
Butler.
BUTLER
That wasn't too smart.
SHANE
Suck my dick.
Butler is too shocked for a comeback.
ON HUDDLE
It breaks and Shane walks to the line of
scrimmage.
AL (V.O.)
Here we go, first and
ten for the Redskins.
Twenty-four zip Dallas.
We can see now that Wilkinson and Bateman are
now part of the offense.
They line up as receivers opposite defensive
halfbacks. In fact, everyone but Shane is on
the line of scrimmage, paired up across from
a cowboy.
Shane leans over Reese and takes in the
Dallas defense.
The Dallas MIDDLE LINEBACKER yells at Shane.
LINEBACKER
Are you ready for more
pain, footsteps?
Shane just smiles.
SHANE
Blue thirteen! Blue
thirteen! Hut! Hut!
Hut!
MONTAGE
On the snap, many things happen at once:
A)
COCHRAN
sticks his fingers inside Butler's face
mask and pokes both eyes. Butler
screams!
B)
SHANE
throws the ball as hard as he can at the
middle Linebacker and hits him in the
crotch. The guy grabs himself and
collapses.
C)
CLIFFORD FRANKLIN
kicks his defender in the shins as hard
as he can. The defender screams and
falls down.
D)
BATEMAN
gets a cornerback across from him in a
choke
hold. The guy can't breathe but
Bateman holds on.
E)
WILKINSON
lifts up his defender's face guard and
connects with a right hand to the guy's
chin.
F)
LEE
pulls the defensive lineman in front of
him to the ground. Then he falls on him.
The guy screams.
ON FIELD
All across the line of scrimmage, Redskins
are punching, kicking and gouging the Dallas
defense.
WHISTLES BLOW.
Flags fly everywhere.
Most of the Dallas players are down and
screaming.
Jamal stands across from a DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.
He hasn't touched the guy. But he nods to
the player to look at his hand.
The guy looks down just as Jamal flicks open
a deadly-looking switchblade.
The guy jumps back and yells:
DEFENDER
He's got a knife!
But there is so much confusion that nobody
pays any attention. Jamal slips the knife
away.
AL (V.O.)
Whoa! Flags fly
everywhere! I've never
seen anything like
this!
BOOMER (V.O.)
Unbelievable! One
Washington player had a
Cowboy in what appeared
to be a police choke
hold.
DAN (V.O.)
I see at least five
flags... no six!
The officials are going crazy trying
to
figure out the penalties as Shane and
the
offense back up and make room for the
Dallas
medical staff who come running out on
the
field.
Some Dallas players are livid:
BUTLER
(to the Ref)
He scratched my eyes
out!
LINEBACKER
He hit me on purpose!
ON McGINTY
He's smiling to himself on the sidelines.
ON REFEREE
He faces the cameras, turns on his microphone
and sums up the penalties.
REF
Unsportsmanlike
conduct, number 72,
number 81 and number 87
on the offense, fifteen
yards...
(to himself)
... times three...
that's forty-five
yards. Illegal use of
hands, number 48 on the
offense, fifteen yards.
That makes it sixty
yards. Unnecessary
roughness number 65 and
number 32, fifteen
yards... that's,
wait... forty-five...
no, thirty...
(turns to
another
ref)
... how many yards so
far?
ON BALL
A ref is taking a very long walk with it. He
stops at the Redskin two-yard line and puts
it down.
IN HUDDLE
Shane leans in.
SHANE
Okay, everybody, stick
together and don't take
any shit. Let's make
'em hurt!
They break the huddle and line up with their
backs to their goal.
ON COCHRAN AND BUTLER
Butler is still whining.
BUTLER
I can't believe you
went for my eyes!
COCHRAN
Shut up! I'm gonna do
it again 'cause it was
fun!
ON SHANE
SHANE
Black 98! Black 98!
Hut!
ON COCHRAN
He drops Butler with a vicious forearm.
Shane flicks the ball over the middle to
Murray who pulls it in for fifteen yards and
a first down.
CUT TO:
MONTAGE - FOURTH QUARTER STUFF
A)
BATEMAN
(now at running back) sweeps outside with
Jamal and Reese Evans leading the way.
Both linemen growl as they throw
themselves into the defense.
B)

heels. Just when it looks like Butler
has him, Cochran comes out of nowhere and
cuts Butler at the knees. Shane fakes a
throw and keeps the ball for a fifteen-
yard gain.
C)
SHANE
hits Franklin with a short flick pass.
D)
BATEMAN
runs off tackle and scores.
E)
PACIFICO
kicks the extra point.

blitzes from his safety position and
decks the Dallas quarterback.
G)
BATEMAN
stops a runner at the line of scrimmage
and throws him for a loss.

WILKINSON
takes a punt at his own thirty. With
Bateman blocking, Wilkinson springs to
the outside and goes all the way for a
touchdown.
Pacifico kicks the extra point.
Scoreboard: Dallas 24, Redskins 14.
I)
DALLAS FIELD GOAL KICKER
is set to boot one. The ball is snapped,
the kicker moves forward and suddenly
Brian Murray breaks through the offense
and blocks the kick.
J)
SHANE
hits Franklin on a little down and out.
He's hit by the defender, the ball goes
flying but so does a flag.
Pass interference.
Redskin first down.
K)
ON CLOCK
Four minutes six seconds remain.
CUT TO:
The Redskin huddle breaks.
The guys come to
the line of scrimmage.
AL (V.O.)
First and ten at the
Cowboy twenty and I'm
telling you, we are
looking at a totally
different team here in
the second half.
BOOMER (V.O.)
Absolutely, Al. The
Redskins are playing
like there's no
tomorrow, because, hey,
there isn't!
DAN (V.O.)
I gotta agree with you
on this one. The
surprising thing for me
is how ineffectual the
Cowboys have been in
this half. I mean,
they look totally
intimidated.
AL (V.O.)
I love when you guys
agree.
ON SHANE
He's in the shotgun calling signals.
SHANE
Hut!
Hut!
He gets the snap and starts looking downfield
for receivers.
ON COCHRAN
He slips while he's blocking Butler who takes
advantage of the situation and blows by him.
ON SHANE
He's got Franklin crossing in the end zone.
He cocks and throws, and simultaneously gets
decked by Butler.
ON BALL
A Dallas defensive halfback
goes up for
it
but just tips the ball. It
keeps going
now
end over end... right into
the waiting
arms
of Franklin who is standing
by himself
in the
end zone.
Franklin is shocked.
His teammates run INTO
FRAME and mob him.
AL (V.O.)
Touchdown, Skins!
What
a fluke!
BOOMER (V.O.)
Total luck there, Al.
Makes up for the
perfect ones they drop.
DAN (V.O.)
Maybe not so lucky.
Falco is down.
ON SHANE
He's on his back.
ON ANNABELLE
She looks worried as trainers run out onto
the field.
ON O'NEIL AND AUGUSTINE
They're watching in O'Neil's bedroom.
ON SHANE
Trainers are bending over him.
He's out but
he's mumbling:
SHANE
Put your tits on my
head...
A trainer hears that and looks worried.
Shane's teammates run up and carry him off
the field.
ON FRANKLIN
He's holding for Pacifico on the extra point.
On the snap, Franklin bobbles the ball but
manages to put it down.
Pacifico belts it through the uprights.
Scoreboard:
Dallas 24, Washington 21.
DISSOLVE TO:
Shane is sitting on the bench holding his
head and his side. He's talking quietly to
McGinty.
ON WILKINSON
He's on the field calling for a fair catch.
He makes it.
AL (V.O.)
... one minute twenty
remaining, and even
though Dallas didn't
score, they sure ate up
a lot of the clock.
ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSON
He's leading the offense out onto the field.
BOOMER (V.O.)
And it looks like Falco
cannot answer the bell.
He's still on the bench
and it
appears that
safety
Earl Wilkinson
will be
leading the
Redskin
offense.
DAN (V.O.)
They just need to get
the ball in field goal
range.
AL (V.O.)
And for Pacifico,
that's anything up to
sixty-five yards.
ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSON
He takes the snap from the shotgun and keeps
the ball on a sweep. He plows for twelve
yards.
AL (V.O.)
That's good for twelve
yards. The clock stops
on the first down. The
Redskins have no time-
outs left.
ON SHANE
McGinty is still bent over him.
McGINTY
I need your hands in
there for the field
goal. I can't trust
Franklin to hold. He
almost dropped the
extra point.
Shane is in major pain but nods his head.
SHANE
I can do it.
ON WILKINSON
He rolls again, but no one is open. He
crosses the line of scrimmage, is hit and
goes down.
ON CLOCK
It continues to run and passes twenty seconds
as we watch.
ON REDSKINS
They're hurrying back to the line of
scrimmage. Wilkinson stands over center.
On the snap, Wilkinson throws the ball out of
bounds.
AL (V.O.)
Wilkinson throws it
away, and with twelve
seconds remaining, the
Redskins will try a
forty-eight yard field
goal to tie it up.
That's almost a chip
shot for Pacifico.
ON SHANE
He shakily follows Pacifico out onto the
field.
Reese Evans catches up with him.
EVANS
(to Shane)
Are you okay?
SHANE
Just make it a good
snap.
(to Pacifico)
And you'll do the rest,
right?
Pacifico doesn't answer.
ON BALL
Evans leans over it.
ON SHANE
He's kneeling in the middle of the field
waiting for the snap. But something is
bothering him.
SHANE
(to Pacifico)
Lou, are you alright?
Pacifico looks up from where he is set up for
the kick. There are tears in his eyes.
PACIFICO
I'm sorry. They know
where my family lives.
Shane tries to digest what he just heard.
SHANE
What?!
EVANS
(through his
legs)
Come on, Shane!
Shane looks back at Pacifico and makes a
decision.
SHANE
Hut!
The ball is snapped perfectly.
Shane catches
it and spots it perfectly.
Pacifico moves to kick it.
And Shane pulls the ball away.
Pacifico flies through the air like Snoopy as
he kicks nothing but air. He lands hard.
Shane jumps to his feet and starts running.
AL (V.O.)
It's a fake! Falco has
it!
ON McGINTY
He's in shock.
ON SHANE
He has totally caught the Cowboys by
surprise. He sweeps around the right side.
The Dallas middle linebacker has recovered
and is moving quickly to cut Shane off.
But Reese Evans comes out of nowhere and
crushes the guy with a flying block.
Shane cuts downfield and heads for the end
zone with nobody near him, except:
For the same safety from the first half who
waits for him at the ten.
The safety smiles as he takes a bead on
Shane.
Shane heads right for the guy. He puts his
head down and smacks helmets with the safety.
The guy goes down and Shane runs over him and
into the end zone.
AL (V.O.)
Falco scores!
ON McGINTY
He jumps into the air.
ON O'NEIL
He jumps out of bed.
ON TODD, ROD AND BOB
They jump on each other.
ON ANNABELLE
She's jumping for joy.
ON SHANE
He spikes the shit out of the ball.
And then
sees something up field.
AL (V.O.)
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute. We've got a
flag down.
Shane stands stock-still in the end zone
watching the REF call the penalty.
REF
Clipping. Number 77
offense.
ON MICKEY LEE
He's wearing number 77 and he collapses in
tears.
ON TODD, ROD AND BOB
They are now sobbing in agony.
ON O'NEIL
He's being helped back to bed by Augustine.
ON SHANE
He's walking slowly back to the line of
scrimmage.
ON McGINTY
He looks sick.
Shane walks up to Pacifico who is down. His
arm is being immobilized by a team trainer.
PACIFICO
I broke my arm.
(big smile)
Thank you. You saved
my ass.
Shane nods.
In his earpiece, he hears
McGinty.
McGINTY (V.O.)
Someday, you can
explain what that was
all about. We got no
kicker, so you gotta
take it in. Your pick.
You're the leader.
SHANE
(to himself)
What would Unitas do in
this situation?
(pause)
I have no idea.
Shane leans into the huddle.
LEE
I'm so sorry, Shane.
I'm sorry, everybody.
SHANE
No problem, Mickey.
(to Evans)
Hell of a hit, Reese.
EVANS
That's the one I was
looking for. I can
retire in peace now.
SHANE
Right after this play.
So besides me, who
really wants the ball?
He looks around the huddle. He studies each
face. And then he comes to rest on Brian
Murray.
Brian's eyes are shining.
He doesn't need
words here.
SHANE
(to Murray)
Yeah. You want it,
Brian. Let's hook up.
(signs as he
says
it)
Blue left slot open
'A' right. Two Jet
'X' drive. On three.
Gentlemen, it's been an
honor sharing the field
of battle.
Everybody puts their hands into the middle.
They break the huddle with a roar.
ON CLOCK
Three seconds are showing.
ON LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
Shane leans over Reese and calls it.
SHANE
Blue 58! Blue 58!
Hut! Hut! Hut!
Shane nods.
On the snap, Shane rolls left.
ON REESE EVANS
He cuts his man at the knees.
ON MICKEY LEE
He takes two men down.
ON MURRAY
He cuts on a deep post.
ON SHANE
He steps up and throws a clean bullet
downfield. He roars in pain as he throws it.
ON MURRAY
The pass is perfect. He pulls it in and
beats his man to the end zone.
Redskins win.
ON CROWD
It roars! "Hail to the Redskins" is
deafening.
Todd, Rod and Bob are screaming.
O'Neil kisses Augustine.
Annabelle throws a punch into the air.
McGinty is all smiles.
Shane walks up to him
and they shake hands.
Pilachowski and Banes hug.
Lee and Andre are hugging and crying.
Cochran is on his knees praying.
Reese Evans
joins him.
Wilkinson hugs Jamal.
Clifford Franklin, hometown boy, throws
himself into the stands where fans mob him.
ON EDDIE MARTEL
The Washington Redskins first-string
quarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from
his seat and turns quickly to go up the steps
and out of the stadium.
But he slips awkwardly and falls.
He grabs
his knee and screams.
ON BRIAN MURRAY
He's still in the end zone, holding the ball
up to the crowd. The roar is deafening.
BRIAN'S POV
We HEAR NOTHING, but somehow the pure energy
of the moment comes through.
ON SHANE
IN the SILENCE, he's walking in SLOW MOTION
toward Annabelle. And everybody is smiling.
FADE OUT.
