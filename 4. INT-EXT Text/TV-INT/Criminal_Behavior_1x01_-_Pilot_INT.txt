      FIND MOLLY COLLINS, late 30s, an independent, strong-minded,
        multi-tasker whose morning routine is choreographed like a
      domestic ballet.  Simultaneously, she fills out a grocery
      list, empties the dishwasher, prepares bagged-lunches for
      herself and her kids, and keeps one eye on the TV, interested
      in this news story. 

                                      MORNING HOST
                    ... but with the discovery of her
                    abandoned vehicle -- cell phone,
                    purse, and wedding dress inside --
                    they now suspect foul play...

      Making PB&J, Molly scrapes the last bit of Skippy from the
      jar.  She tosses it into the recycling bin, shuts the lid
      with her knee, and scribbles Peanut Butter on the growing
      grocery list.  As she reaches for a bag of cookies, she
      glances at the clock -- it's 7:28.  She calls down a hallway --

                                      MOLLY
                    Two minutes and counting!

      She presses peanut butter into jelly, cuts off the crust,
      slices on the diagonal, and places the sandwich into a lunch
      bag labeled BEN, beside two other lunch bags, LISA and MOM. 

                                      MORNING HOST
                    ... Chelsea Kettner was last seen
                    leaving Belisima Bridal in Hillcrest. 
                    Anyone with information is asked to
                    call the number on your screen. 

      ANGLE ON: TV SCREEN --  An 800 number flashes.                                                                                        2.

                                      MORNING HOST (CONT'D)
                    ... When we return, Evelyn Sanchez,
                    our fashion and beauty expert, will
                    share her secret recipe for age-
                    defying skin, and you have all the
                      ingredients in your fridge.

      As Molly places a cookie into each lunch bag, she catches
      her reflection on the mirrored side of the toaster.  She
      focuses on her crows feet and brow line.  She's not happy. 
      With her thumb and index finger, she stretches away the lines. 

                                    BEN (O.S.)
                    Whatchya you doing?

      BEN, 10, a cute ball of endless energy, approaches.

                                      MOLLY
                    You think some Cholula could fix my
                    wrinkles?

                                    BEN
                    I think it would hurt.

      He grabs his lunch bag, peers inside -- unhappy.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    PB&J, again?

      Molly shuts off the TV.

                                      MOLLY
                    It's your favorite.

                                    BEN
                    That was like last week, Mom.

                                      MOLLY
                    How 'bout turkey?

                                    BEN
                          (excited)
                    Gobble, gobble.

      As Molly swaps her lunch bag with his, her husband, GAVIN
      COLLINS, 40, aging-frat-boy, enters with LISA, 8, in his
      arms.

                                      GAVIN
                    Look who I found under our covers.

                                    LISA
                    Mom, if ghosts can walk through walls,
                    why don't they fall through floors?

      Molly eyes Gavin, who shrugs.                                                                                        3.

                                      MOLLY
                    That's... a really good question. 
                    If I ever see a ghost, I'll be sure
                    to ask him.

                                    BEN
                    Or her.

                                      MOLLY
                          (smiles)
                    Or her.

                                      GAVIN
                    Alright, let's get a move on.

                                      MOLLY
                    Kisses.

      Molly and Gavin kiss each child, who then race out.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                          (calling after them)
                    Hold hands 'til you're --

                                    BEN
                    On the bus.  We know!

      As the door shuts --

                                      GAVIN
                    Nice dodge...
                          (off her look)
                    On the ghost question.

                                      MOLLY
                          (smiles)
                      Yesterday, she asked if Siamese twins
                    share the same legs, do they buy one
                    movie ticket or two?

                                      GAVIN
                    And you said -- ?

                                      MOLLY
                    One tush, one ticket.
                          (then)
                    So, what's on today's agenda?

      Gavin knows what she's really asking.  He's defensive.

                                      GAVIN
                    I'll call Rita this afternoon.

                                      MOLLY
                          (dubious)
                    She's doing us a favor.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        4.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                          (then)
                    I know the job's not exactly right,
                    but it's a foot in the door --

                                      GAVIN
                          (emphatic)
                    I said I'd call.

      As Molly begins to wipe down the counter, she quickly changes
      subjects. 

                                      MOLLY
                    Grocery list is by your wallet.  And
                    good news, I got us half-price tickets
                    to the game on Sunday, right at the
                    fifty.  My mom can baby-sit.

      Gavin watches her with more intensity than one would expect
      in this situation.  A beat, then --

                                      GAVIN
                    Molly, there's something I need to
                    say --

                                      MOLLY
                    Just go for the interview.  You're
                    smart, you're charming, in six months
                    you'll be running the place --

                                      GAVIN
                    It's not about work... 

      Molly now gives him her full attention. 

                                      GAVIN (CONT'D)
                    Look, the thing is... I've been
                      thinking... 

                                      MOLLY
                          (concerned)
                    What's going on, Gavin?

                                      GAVIN
                          (steels himself)
                    I want a divorce.

      Molly steadies herself, the wind knocked out of her.  Did he
      just really say that? 

                                      MOLLY
                    What...? 

      He nods.  She heard him correctly.  Then, for the first time
      since we've met Molly, she sits down.  S/FX: HER PAGER BEEPS. 
      As she reads a text, Gavin knows what's coming --                                                                                        5.

                                      GAVIN
                    You need to go.

                                      MOLLY
                          (fighting to keep it
                            together)
                    Yes, I know.  When I get home we'll
                    talk about... this.  Okay?

      Under the above, she methodically removes a KEY from her
      purse.  With her back to Gavin, and tears in her eyes that
      he can't see, she stands up and unlocks a DRAWER.  As she
      turns to look back at Gavin, he's already left the room. 

      Numb, she slides the drawer open to REVEAL:  A GUN --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      TIGHT ON -- THE SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE (LOCAL NEWSPAPER)

      HEADLINE reads: LOCAL BRIDE STILL MISSING, accompanied by
      another photo of Chelsea Kettner.  PULL BACK TO:


      We FIND BROOKE KROSS, 28, stunning, book smart and an over-
      thinker.  She lives in her head -- second guessing decisions
      and calculating opportunity costs at every turn.  Brooke's
      perspective on life can be summed up with two of Socrates'
      most famous quotations: "The unexamined life is not worth
      living" and "Wisdom begins in wonder."  While Brooke is both
        intellectual and clinical, she's also a closeted romantic
      who embraces her femininity and connects with her inner girly-
      girl.  As she sips grape juice, she reads the newspaper.

      From behind, ANDREW LANGE, 30, Clark Kent-ish, approaches. 
      He's an academic at heart, and despite his good looks, he's
      more comfortable with a book than with people.  In fact, he
      doesn't have many guy friends.  He and Brooke finish each
      other's sentences, have great sex, and can talk about the
      "mathematical beauty of string theory" for hours.  They've
      never had a fight and rarely disagree.  Wet from a shower
      and wearing only a towel, Andrew kisses her neck.

                                      ANDREW
                    I've got an hour before work.

                                      BROOKE
                          (wish she could, but --)
                    I've got... the dry cleaners, post
                    office and the bank.

                                      ANDREW
                    You know, I read a study that women
                    who have sex before work are more
                      productive during the day.                                                                                        6.

                          (laughs)
                    I suppose that research was conducted
                    by men.

                                      ANDREW
                    The empirical data was quite
                      convincing.

                                      BROOKE
                    Well, I am a girl who can't say no
                    to empirical data.

      Brooke yields to Andrew.  As they get hot and heavy, Andrew
      cradles Brooke's head in his hands and looks into her eyes  --

                                      ANDREW
                    Brooke, I'm happy.

                                      BROOKE
                    So am I. 

                                      ANDREW
                    I mean really happy.

      As he kisses her shoulder, Brooke gets clinical, which is
      her comfort zone.  Their scientific banter is foreplay.

                                      BROOKE
                    I had this psychology professor --
                    said happiness is 50% genetic, 40%
                    volition and 10% circumstantial. 
                    But don't you think she under-valued
                    volition?

                                      ANDREW
                          (amused; then serious)
                    I want it to always be like this.

                                      BROOKE
                          (excited)
                    Me too, which totally proves my point. 
                          (off his look)
                    We've achieved our happiness through
                    volition.

      Andrew is enchanted by this woman.  Her brains, beauty, and
      quirks are an intoxicating combination.

                                      ANDREW
                    Let's get married. 

      Brooke is taken by surprise.  Did he just propose?  Is he
      serious?  Before she can say anything, S/FX: HER PAGER BEEPS. 
      She eyes the text message.                                                                                         7.

                    I... I have to go.

      Brooke crosses to the wall of overflowing bookshelves, reaches
      behind several mystery novels and grabs a GUN.  Then, she
      heads for the door.  A beat.  On second thought, she returns
      to Andrew, looks him in the eyes, and gives him a soft kiss
      on the lips.  Before he can say anything else, she exits --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      HIGH TECH LAB.  On one wall -- a floor to ceiling LIGHT BOX,
      which allows for a full body X-RAY of the victim.  The FULL
      BODY X-RAY stands beside a FULL BODY pre-autopsy PHOTO,
      digitized on a floor to ceiling computer screen.  (It's like
      nothing we've seen before.) 

      DR. SCOTT CRAWFORD, 40s, weekend warrior type, stands over
      the Y-incisioned body.  He's flanked by Molly and Brooke.

                                    DR. CRAWFORD
                    ... Dead for approximately 48 hours.

                                      MOLLY
                    She was abducted a week ago, so she
                    was held captive for five days.

                                    DR. CRAWFORD
                          (nods)
                    C.O.D is traumatic asphyxiation,
                    confirmed by petechial hemorrhaging. 

      Under the above, Dr. Crawford peels back an eyelid to REVEAL:
      E/CU - Eyeball is spotted with red blood clots.

                                    DR. CRAWFORD (CONT'D)
                    Oddly, no defensive wounds.
                          (then)
                    There's residue from tape adhesive
                    around her mouth and nose.

      Brooke crosses to the FULL BODY pre-autopsy photo.  She's
      literally eye-to-eye with the victim.

                                      BROOKE
                    She's wearing make-up.  Was her
                      foundation over or under the adhesive
                    residue?

      With a LASER WAND, Crawford OUTLINES the victim's face on
      the pre-autopsy photo.  Then, he presses a few buttons on a
      nearby keyboard, and the "face" appears on a CEILING MOUNTED
      MONITOR.  Crawford isolates and magnifies the nose and mouth --
      which ENLARGE to FULL SCREEN.  He studies the image.

      ON THE MONITOR -- Bits of adhesive residue are coated in
      foundation.  (Think: Snow capped mountains and valleys.)

                                    DR. CRAWFORD
                    The make-up was applied over the
                    residue, which suggests --

                                      BROOKE
                    The killer applied it.  If the tape
                    caused the asphyxiation, then the
                      foundation was put on after she was
                    already dead.                                                                                        10.

      As the creepiness sets in --

                                      MOLLY
                    Any evidence of sexual trauma?

                                    DR. CRAWFORD
                          (nods)
                      Significant vaginal bruising and 
                    semen.  Sent the contribution to the
                    lab, along with a blood sample for
                    Tox.
                          (a beat, then)
                    When you find out who did this, I
                    hope you --

                    String him up by the balls, beat him
                    with a pitch fork, and feed him to
                    sharks?

                                    DR. CRAWFORD
                    That's a good start.

                    You've been crazy about him since
                    your first date and when he pops the

      A beat.  Molly knows there's more.  And here it comes --

                    Why can't we just be happy with the

                    You're uber-rational and God knows
                    you think things through more than
                    anyone I know.  But you also pull
                    pages from bridal magazines and
                    fantasize about a three-tiered cherry
                    vanilla wedding cake with cream cheese
                    frosting.
                          (re: Brooke's head)
                    So what's really going on in there?

                          (freaking)
                    I want the dress.  I want the cake. 
                    It's the whole 'what comes after'
                    that makes no sense.

                                      MOLLY
                    What are you talking about?

                                      BROOKE
                    The social construct of marriage
                    goes back to when women couldn't
                    take care of themselves.  When men
                    had to hunt and bring home the meat. 
                    And I'm perfectly capable of getting
                    my own meat.

                          (overly defensive)
                    So am I, but I still got married. 
                    And now I've got Ben and Lisa and --

                    Whoa, we're so not talking about you.

      Molly realizes she's over-reacted, given her personal
      situation.  She refocuses on Brooke.

                                      MOLLY
                    Right.  So what you're saying is --
                    this isn't about Andrew, it's about
                    your independence.  Or your fear of
                    losing it.

                                      BROOKE
                    You know how I say you sometimes
                    talk to me more like a shrink than a
                    partner?

                                      MOLLY
                    Yeah?

                    Don't ever stop.                                                                                        12.

      Molly smiles.  Tension is diffused.  As Brooke says her last
      line, she tugs on Molly's sweater sleeve.

                                      BROOKE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, is this my sweater?

                                      MOLLY
                    Maybe.

                                      BROOKE
                    I left it in your car --

                    Over a year ago, so statute of
                      limitations makes it mine.

      Now Brooke smiles.  The Lieutenant heads toward them --

                    would want to hurt her?

      PULL BACK to include Molly and Brooke.

                                      BROOKE
                    Mr. Holtz, we're so sorry.  We're

                    right now we need your help.
                          (off his nod)
                    Can you identify this ring?

      Brooke pulls a photo from her file of the wedding band.

                                    LEO HOLTZ
                    No.  Why?

                                      MOLLY
                    It was on Chelsea's finger.
                          (off his confusion)
                    Where were you when Chelsea went

                    Would you consent to a DNA sample?

                    You think...  I'm a suspect?

                    It's protocol to eliminate you.  If
                    you wouldn't mind opening your mouth.

      As Leo reluctantly complies, Brooke swabs his inner cheek.

                                    LEO HOLTZ
                    I realize that Chelsea's murder is
                    just another day at the office for
                    you, but she was everything to me. 
                    She was a medical student, did you
                    know that?  She volunteered with
                    special needs kids and right now, I
                    have four dogs at my house because
                    she fostered strays --

      Under the above, Brooke focuses on his pant leg.  We don't
      yet see what she sees.  She gets down on her knees to inspect. 

                                      BROOKE
                    There's sand on your pants.

                    I was at the beach.

      Brooke lifts each shoe.  Spotting something probative in his
      right sole, she scrapes a groove with her fingernail.

                                    LEO HOLTZ (CONT'D)
                    What's going on?

                    Dune weevil.  Stuck to the sole of

      As Brooke places the insect into a small evidence envelope.

                                    LEO HOLTZ
                    I came down to help, but I want to

                    You're welcome to leave, sir.  We
                    got what we need.

      Off a determined Molly and Brooke, they have a suspect --

                                                                              FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      Windows overlook the city.  A LAPTOP on her desk and a flat
      screen on the wall.  The screen is an audio/visual intercom
      connected to other offices as well as the interrogation room. 
      CAMERA PASSES several photos of Ben and Lisa, landing on a
      wedding photo of Molly and Gavin.  RACK FOCUS TO:

      Molly, as she enters.  She tosses "Ben's" lunch bag into a
      small fridge and sits at her desk.  Her eye catches her
      wedding photo.  It stings.  She takes a beat, exhales, grabs
      her cell and scrolls through the names -- PRESSES GAVIN.  A
      PHOTO of Gavin appears on her cell's screen.

                                      GAVIN (O.S.)
                    You've reached Gavin.  Leave your
                    info and I'll get back to you.

      Molly hesitates.  Should she leave a message?  Then --

                                      MOLLY
                    Hey, it's me.  I've been thinking
                    about you... about us.  I wish we
                    could...  I'm not mad.  I hope you're
                    not mad.  I know you're going through
                    some things right now, but --

      Without knocking, the Lieutenant swings in.  Molly quickly
      finishes her call.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Alright, I got to go.  We'll talk... 
                    I love you.

      Molly hangs up hastily.

                    You and Gavin have a fight?

                    Why would you...?

                          (off her look)
                    It's either your anniversary or a
                    rough morning. 
                          (off Molly)
                    Right now, his demons are uglier
                    than yours, so maybe cut him some
                    slack.

      Molly bites her tongue and gets back to the case --

                                      MOLLY
                    I spoke with the lab.  The fianc 's
                    DNA's not a match to the perp's semen.

                          (digesting the info)
                    Okay.  Moving on.  War room in five --

      The Lieutenant exits.  We hold on Molly, shaken but stoic.

                    On the day Chelsea disappeared, she
                    left her home in La Jolla at
                      approximately 8AM.  She attended a
                      microbiology class on the UCSD campus,
                    followed by a study group session at
                      Starbucks.  She then headed over to
                    Belisima Bridal, to pick up her gown.

      She's wearing a pink strapless top and jeans.)

                    She gets into her car and disappears.                                                                                        16.

      Under the above, Andrew, wearing a coat and tie, enters. 
      Seeing Andrew at PD is a surprise to us, but not to Brooke,
      who shoots him a smile.

                    Until her body is discovered at the
                    Coronado Dunes, seven days later.

      Brooke focuses on the monitor, now in freeze frame.

                    Chelsea's wearing a strapless top,
                    but in the crime scene photos, she's
                    wearing a bra with straps.

                                      ANDREW
                    Which means the killer likely
                    redressed his victim, consistent
                    with the make-up he applied over the
                    adhesive tape on the victim's mouth
                    and nose, per Detective Kross'
                      observation.

                          (re: Andrew)
                    I asked Dr. Lange to assist with our
                    suspect profile.

                                      ANDREW
                    We're looking for a male in his
                    twenties or thirties.  Above average
                    in intelligence and physical stature. 
                    Dressing the victim, putting on her
                    make-up -- they're acts of intimacy,
                    which he failed to achieve in his
                    daily life.  Good bet he suffered
                    severe anxiety around women due to a
                    traumatic rejection.

      He playfully eyes Brooke on "rejection" and then turns his
      attention to a photo of the wedding band, posted on a board.

                                      ANDREW (CONT'D)
                    He placed the wedding ring on the
                    victim's finger as a symbol of
                      consummation.

                          (eyes Chelsea's photo)
                    He finally found a woman who couldn't
                    say no.

                                      ANDREW
                    Exactly.  He asphyxiated his victim
                    with tape, not his hands, which is
                    unusual.

                    It suggests remorse as he distanced
                    himself from the physical act of
                    murder.  Or just as likely, he was
                      disinterested in the act of killing
                    since it was anticlimactic.

      Even for veteran cops, this weighs on them.  Then, S/FX --

      Molly and Brooke head toward the Crime Lab.  Andrew catches

                    Hey, we need to talk.

                    I'll walk with you.

      Brooke eyes Molly, who knows she needs privacy.  Molly
      quickens her pace --

                    Andrew, the reason wedding proposals
                    are steeped in rituals, like buying
                    a ring and getting down on one knee,
                    is because a woman wants to know
                    that a guy has thought it through. 
                    Proposing in the throes of passion
                    is like... impulse buying.
                          (tries to explain)
                    I don't need a new purse, but in
                    that moment I have to have it.

                                      ANDREW
                    That's not fair.

      With that, Brooke races ahead to catch up with Molly.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      CALVIN, early 30s, is a guy's guy; a consummate cad.  He
      works with scientists but he's not one of them.  Truth be
      told, he's not smart enough to be a scientist, but he
      compensates with charisma and charm.  Although he's overly
      confident with a nicely sized... "ego," he's impossible not
      to like.  He reads DNA results, on a WALL MOUNTED LIGHT BOX.                                                                                         19.

                    Got a hit off the military registry,
                    Brian Hess, a former midshipman with

                    -- I crossed-checked Brian's name
                    through county databases.  Turns
                    out, your victim and Brian applied
                    for a marriage license, 'bout three

                          (off their surprise)
                    They never tied the knot and that
                    license expired after 90 days.

      Under the above, Brooke notices that Cal is focusing a bit
      too much on her.  We don't know why. 

                                      BROOKE
                    Okay, so maybe Chelsea dumped Brian,
                      consistent with Andrew's hypothesis
                    that he was rejected.

                                      MOLLY
                    Brian hoped she'd change her mind
                    and come back to him.  But with her
                      engagement to someone else, reality
                    set in.

                    The only reason she didn't marry me
                    is because I won't have kids.  After

                    What I know, is that people kill
                    their loved ones everyday.

                    Mr. Holtz, have you heard of the
                    "heat of the moment"?  When your
                    anger, your animalistic rage, trumps
                    all logic and reason.

                                    LEO HOLTZ
                    I guess.

                    We have no doubt you loved Chelsea. 
                    In fact, we think that's why you
                    may've snapped, in the heat of the

      With Brooke's accusation, Leo falls silent.  Then, the door

      NICK LEE, 28, chiseled, strong jaw.  Understandably wrought
      over his fianc e's well-being.  He sits across from Molly.

                    ... We rent an apartment, downtown. 
                    Kathy usually takes the bus to work,
                    but on the day she disappeared, she
                    was driving my car.

                    No.  Wait.  Yes, she took a yoga
                    class at 17th and Market.                                                                                        30.

                    Yeah.  Actually, for her bachelorette

                    a blast, but I was respectful, didn't
                    ask for details.

                    No, bachelorette parties are usually
                    organized by the maid of honor, and
                    that's who we dealt with...

                    We comp the brides a complete set. 
                    Here you go -- Kettner and Lim.

      Molly and Brooke start turning pages.  Chelsea's photos are
      staged -- women posed and poised.  Kathy's are a lot more
      fun and candid.

                                      JONAS
                    So is Kathy Lim missing or is she...?

                                      BROOKE
                    We're hoping for the best.

      Suddenly, Molly spots something in common between the two
      albums.  She points to a hot SHIRTLESS GUY --

                                      MOLLY
                    I assume he's the stripper?

                                      JONAS
                    He prefers "erotic dancer." 

                                      MOLLY
                    He was at both parties.

                                      JONAS
                          (realizing)
                    That's right.  Independently hired, 
                    but he won't be allowed back.                                                                                        34.

                                      BROOKE
                    Why's that?

                                      JONAS
                    After Kathy's event, we got a
                      complaint.  He made a move on a guest. 
                    She turned him down; he got a rough.

                                      BROOKE
                    Do you know his name?

                                      JONAS
                    Roger Hanson.  Got his business card.

      Jonas reaches into a rolodex and hands them a business card.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                          (re: card)
                    See, erotic dancer.  Go figure.

      Off Jonas, providing us with our next suspect --

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:


      A FLURRY of ORGANIZED CHAOS as SWAT FANS OUT.  LEAD SWAT
      OFFICER returns from the LIVING ROOM.  In hushed tones --

                                    LEAD SWAT OFFICER
                    Clear.

      SWAT OFFICER #2 returns from the adjacent DINING ROOM.                                                                                        35.

                                    SWAT OFFICER #2
                    Clear.

      Gun drawn, Molly enters the KITCHEN.  At the stove, she spots
      a muscular SHIRTLESS MAN, back to her.  She levels her gun.

                                      MOLLY
                    Hands up.  Now.
                          (calls back)
                    In the kitchen.

      The Man doesn't comply.  Seemingly oblivious, he dumps a
      handful of pasta into boiling water.  SWAT races inside.

      Molly realizes the Man's listening to his I-POD, which is
      blasting.  As SWAT surrounds him and tension mounts, he LOOKS
      UP, surprised to find six guns pointed at him. 

      As Molly pulls the I-POD cord from his ears, he slowly lifts
      his hands in the air.  He reacts, terrified --

                                      ROGER HANSON
                    What the hell?

                                      MOLLY
                    Where is she?

                                      ROGER HANSON
                    What?  Who?

                                      MOLLY
                    You're Roger Hanson, right?

                                      ROGER HANSON
                    Yes, but I --

                                      MOLLY
                          (demands)
                    Where's Kathy?  Where is she!?

                                      BROOKE (O.S.)
                    Detective Collins --

      They turn to see Brooke, flanking a HANDSOME GUY, 25, in
      cotton shorts and a T-shirt.

                                      BROOKE (CONT'D)
                    This man was upstairs, in bed.  Claims
                    he's Roger's boyfriend.

                                      HANDSOME GUY
                    I said domestic partner.  There's a
                      difference.  What's going on, Rog!?

      As Molly wraps her head around this strange turn of events --                                                                                        36.

                                      MOLLY
                          (to Roger)
                    You're gay?

                                      ROGER HANSON
                    Far as I know, not a crime.

      The pasta starts to boil over.

                                      ROGER HANSON (CONT'D)
                    Can I turn down the stove?

      Molly nods and Roger reduces the heat.

                                      MOLLY
                          (still confused)
                    You assaulted a woman on a Hornblower
                    cruise, isn't that right?  

                                      ROGER HANSON
                    The chick was wasted.  She came on
                    to me, and when I turned her down,
                    she wigged out.  Is that why you're
                    here?

                                      MOLLY
                    Not exactly.

                                      ROGER HANSON
                    Whatever you think I did, I didn't
                    do it.

      Off Molly and Brooke, with the serial killer still at large,
      they crash full speed into a dead end. 

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Quiet.  The front door opens to REVEAL Molly.  After Gavin's
      morning announcement, nothing looks quite the same.  Family
      photos, Gavin's coat on the sofa, the stack of mail -- topped
      with a party invite to Mr. and Mrs. Gavin Collins, all remind
      her that her life is in flux.  She heads toward --


      Molly enters.  Ben is fast asleep, one leg shooting out from
      under the blankets and hanging off the bed.  She smiles, 
      crosses to the bed, kisses her son, and gently places his
      wayward leg under the covers.  She exits and heads into --


      Lisa is also fast asleep.  Molly bends down and kisses her. 
      As she heads toward the door, Lisa stirs --

                                    LISA
                    Mom --

                                      MOLLY
                    Yeah, Sweetie?

                                    LISA
                          (half asleep)
                    When lightning hits the ocean, do
                    the fish get fried?

                                      MOLLY
                    Are you worried about the fish?

                                    LISA
                    Just the dolphins.

      With that, Lisa falls back to sleep.  Molly smiles and exits. 


      She enters to find Gavin, in bed, watching ESPN.  He's wearing
      a SAN DIEGO CHARGERS T-shirt.

                                      GAVIN
                    Hey --                                                                                        38.

                                      MOLLY
                    Hi. 
                          (eyes TV)
                    Can we talk?

      Gavin turns off the TV.  A beat as he lets Molly go first.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I know the last year has been rough
                    and that you're not happy with...

      Molly hesitates.  She doesn't want to sound callous or cruel --

                                      GAVIN
                    With my life.  It's okay.  You can
                    say it.  Forty years old and I can't
                    get a job.

                                      MOLLY
                    A lot of people are out of work and --

                                      GAVIN
                    It's not just that.

                                      MOLLY
                    You have two beautiful children, a
                    wife who adores you.  We can fix
                      whatever's wrong.

                                      GAVIN
                    You mean you can fix it?

                                      MOLLY
                    What?

                                      GAVIN
                    You're a "fixer," Molly.  Anything
                    goes wrong with me, with the kids,
                    you jump in and take care it.  And
                    it's a good quality, it's just not
                    what I need --

                                      MOLLY
                    Tell me what you need.

                                      GAVIN
                          (a beat, then)
                    Every morning, I wake up at 4AM in a
                    cold sweat --

                                      MOLLY
                    I... I didn't know.  Gavin --

                                      GAVIN
                    I lie in bed with my mind racing, 
                    trying to fall back to sleep, but I
                    just can't.                                                                                        39.

      Molly takes a breath.  She sits down next to Gavin.  She
      takes his hand and looks him in the eye, suppresses her tears,
      and gives the marriage everything she's got --

                                      MOLLY
                    Gav, please, it's me. 
                          (smiles, as she recalls)
                    The same girl who ticketed your Ducati
                    when you parked in the red zone and
                    then you parked there again just so
                    you could ask me out.
                          (touching his Chargers
                            T-shirt)
                    The same girl who learned to love
                    the Chargers because anything that
                    brings you so much joy must be worth
                    it.  The same woman who needs you
                    now, like I always have.

      Gavin gently removes his hand from Molly's.

                                      GAVIN
                    You don't need me, Molly.  You need
                    someone to get the groceries and
                    clean out the gutters --

                                      MOLLY
                    That's not fair and --

                                      GAVIN
                          (resolved)
                    I can't be "that guy" anymore.

      A beat, as Molly considers her last resort --

                                      MOLLY
                    Can we try couples counseling?
                          (off his cold look)
                    It's worth a shot.  Come on, what do
                    we have to lose?

                                      GAVIN
                    Time.

                                      MOLLY
                    Huh?

                                      GAVIN
                    We lose more time.
                          (grabs pillow)
                    I'll sleep on the sofa.

      With that, Gavin exits.  Molly sits down, devastated.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        40.


      Quiet.  The front door opens to REVEAL Brooke.  Something on
      the floor catches her eye -- a big frosted CUPCAKE.  Curious,
      she bends down to pick it up and then notices a second and
      third.  It's a trail of cupcakes that she follows to her --


      She enters to find Andrew waiting for her.  Dozens of brightly
      colored cupcakes decorate the room -- on the bookshelves, on
      the bureau, on her desk.  On the bed -- rose pedals, in the
      shape of the heart.

                                      BROOKE
                    What's going on?

                                      ANDREW
                      I shouldn't have asked you to marry
                    me.
                          (off Brooke's concern)
                    What I mean is, I shouldn't have
                    asked you like that.  You're right
                    about ritual.  It's important.

                    Andrew, why are there cupcakes...?

                                      ANDREW
                    In ancient China, the proposal ritual
                    was quite elaborate.  The prospective
                    groom's family would make dozens of
                    small cakes that would be delivered
                    to the bride.  If the bride said
                    "yes," she'd distribute those small
                    cakes to her friends and family, as
                    an announcement of her wedding.
                          (off her look)
                    I read it in one of your books.

      He regards an overflowing bookshelves.  Brooke is touched. 

                                      BROOKE
                          (then, re: rose petals)
                    What about the --

                                      ANDREW
                    Rose petals.  A more classic,
                      Westernized, romantic gesture.  In
                    case you preferred a lower carb
                    ritual.

      Overwhelmed and nervous, Brooke starts rambling.                                                                                        41.

                                      BROOKE
                    You know, rose petals are extremely
                    toxic.  The outer petals, which are
                    covered in pesticides, are plucked
                    from the buds and placed into plastic
                    bags where the chemicals react and --

      As she continues to ramble, Andrew gets down on one knee. 
      He takes her hand --

                                      ANDREW
                    Brooke, I love you for who you are. 
                    I don't want to control you or change
                    you; I just wanna grow old with you. 
                    Will you marry me?

      From his pocket, he removes a ring.  Off Brooke, who now
      falls very quiet --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      TIGHT on a box of cupcakes.  PULL WIDE to INCLUDE Brooke,
      with a big smile, handing them out to Detectives, Officers
      and Office Personnel.  She pushes into --


      Brooke finds Molly focusing on the MAIN WALL, which lists
      everything we know about Chelsea and Kathy.

                    Good morning.

      Molly is all business.  Without even looking at Brooke --

                                      MOLLY
                    I've been wondering how the maids of
                    honor found out about Hornblower.

      Brooke puts down the cupcakes, returns her focus to the case.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    The brides come from completely
                    different backgrounds, so how did
                    their best friends end up picking
                    the same cruise line?

                                      BROOKE
                    I'll call 'em.                                                                                        42.

                                      MOLLY
                    Loo's on it.

                    What's with the cupcakes?

                                      BROOKE
                      I accepted Andrew's proposal.

      Given Brooke's prior ambivalence, Molly is shocked.  She
      stops in her tracks.

                                      MOLLY
                    Really?
                          (off Brooke's nod)
                    Why?

                                      BROOKE
                          (confused)
                    Mol, this is where you congratulate
                    me.  Be my girlfriend.  Maybe scream
                    a little?

                                      MOLLY
                      Yesterday, you were terrified to
                    commit and now, all of sudden,
                    marriage is a storybook to you?  Why
                    the change of heart?

                                      MOLLY
                    The first time Andrew forgets your
                    birthday or cancels a vacation or
                    tells you not to buy that expensive
                    lipstick, you're gonna freak out. 
                    You ready for that?

                                      BROOKE
                    Just because your marriage blew up
                    in your face doesn't mean no one

      That stings.  Gloves are off -- 

                                      MOLLY
                    You really think your relationship
                    is gonna be all that different from
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        43.

                    mine?  Gavin was a prince, just like
                    Andrew.  I was his whole world.  And
                    look at us now.

      Brooke takes a breath, unsure how to fight back.  Then --

                                      BROOKE
                    You're wearing my blouse.

                                      MOLLY
                    What?

                                      BROOKE
                    I loaned it to you last winter.  I'd
                    like it back.

                                      MOLLY
                    Fine -- take it.

      Molly strips off the blouse and throws it at Brooke.  Then,
      while standing in her bra --

                      Detectives.

      Molly and Brooke turn to the video monitor, where the
      Lieutenant is trying to get their attention.

                                      MOLLY
                    What's up, Loo?

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                          (re: Molly)
                    You okay?

                                      MOLLY
                    What do you got?

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    Both brides received email
                      advertisements for Hornblower's
                      bachelorette party package.  They
                    forwarded the emails to their maids
                    of honor, who made the arrangements.

      Molly crosses to a closet and puts on an SDPD jacket.

                                      BROOKE
                    So how did Hornblower acquire our
                    vic's email addresses?

                    Good question.  Keep me posted.

      The monitor goes black.  Calvin enters --                                                                                        44.

      Calvin makes a face and grabs a white one.

                    Got an update on our mystery microbe.

      Brooke's unsure why Molly's leaving.  She refocuses on Calvin --

                                      BROOKE
                    Let's hear it.

                      Pseudomonas, a bacterium that thrives
                    in moist soil and enters through the
                    feet.  CDC says there's an outbreak
                    in Solana Beach, 'bout a half hour

                    Was Chelsea's infection recent?

                    Which means she was infected after
                    she was abducted.

                    Yeah.
                          (then)
                    Hey, for what it's worth, I'm sorry
                    about before.  When I said I've been
                    thinking about you, it's just --

                                      BROOKE
                    -- I said "yes."  To Andrew.

                          (feigns a smile)
                    Okay.  Well then, I'm happy for you. 
                    For both of you.                                                                                         45.

      As Calvin exits, we HOLD ON Brooke, who shakes her head in
      amusement, not unlike Jane Goodall observing a baboon.

      Molly enters to find the Lieutenant playing video poker at
      his desk.  His office is a shrine to NY city.  Framed
      photographs of iconic sites and a Mike Piazza jersey adorn

                    I realize I may be out of line, but
                    I assume you've heard about me and

                          (as if rehearsed)
                    You can't make these kind of decisions
                    when you're in his state of mind. 
                    He won't listen to me, Loo.  I'm
                    thinking, maybe if you talked to him --

                                      MOLLY
                    About my marriage.  Yes.  You're
                    friends.

                    Divorce rate for cops is 75%.  You
                    know that.

                                      MOLLY
                    I'm not a statistic.

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    Yeah, well, that's what I thought
                    all three times.
                          (off her look)
                    Come on, Molly.  I left Brooklyn for
                    Carol.  I was sure she was the one
                    and six months later, she left me.

                                      MOLLY
                          (taken aback)
                    'Cuz you cheated on her, Loo.                                                                                        46.

      Molly stiffens and then, with all the fortitude she can muster --

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Do you think I'm a good person? 
                          (off his look)
                    I don't mean a good detective, but a
                    woman -- a mother, a wife.  You think
                    Gavin has done okay or do you think
                    he can do better? 
                          (eyes glisten, emphatic)
                    Call it what you want, but Gavin
                    respects you.  And I need to know --

      Molly, unencumbered by ego that defines younger women, has
      spoken her mind to her boss, despite the costs -- emotionally
      and professionally.  Molly is too choked up to continue; Loo
      is too shell-shocked to respond.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                      I shouldn't have bothered you.

      Molly turns to leave, but the Lieutenant calls after her --

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    No promises.  But I'll talk to him. 
                    And for what it's worth, I think
                    he's damn lucky.

      Off Molly's satisfied smile --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      TRACK Brooke as she approaches Molly's office.  She pokes
      inside, to find Molly on the phone.  Molly motions her in.

                                      MOLLY
                          (on the phone)
                    ... Can you have them email the list
                    to me?  Great.  Thank you.

      Brooke waits uncomfortably.  Molly hangs up --

                                      BROOKE
                          (steels herself)
                    We gonna finish what we started?

                                      MOLLY
                    Not now. 
                          (all business)
                    That was the owner of Hornblower. 
                    They use an advertising firm to
                    promote their bachelorette parties. 
                    That firm made a deal with a dating
                    website called make-a-match.com.

                    When a member cancels, the website
                    sells them their personal information.

                    Both Chelsea and Kathy are former

                                      MOLLY
                    Yeah.  Make-a-match is sending us a
                    list of members who've been in contact
                    with both our victims.

      Off Molly, excited about the lead --

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:


      C/U -- LARGE COMPUTER MONITOR.  On the MONITOR -- a database
      with member profiles from make-a-match.com.

                      Thirty-seven men contacted both
                    Chelsea and Kathy.

      PULL BACK to include Brooke, the Lieutenant and Andrew.

                                      ANDREW
                    Do they all live in the county?

                                      MOLLY
                    All but two.

                                      ANDREW
                    Eliminate those profiles.

      As Molly scrolls down the list and eliminates the outliers --

                                      BROOKE
                    What about Solana Beach?  We believe
                    she was held captive in that vicinity.

                                      MOLLY
                    Two men from Solana Beach.  

      Andrew eyes Brooke's hand; he notices she's not wearing her
      engagement ring.

                                      ANDREW
                          (under his breath)
                    Where's your ring?

      Before Brooke can respond --

                                      MOLLY
                    Oh God --                                                                                        48.

                                      BROOKE
                    What?

                                      MOLLY
                    One of the two is Jonas Rendell,
                    manager of Hornblower.

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    He claimed he never met them.

                                      BROOKE
                    Maybe they rejected him on-line. 
                    Then he saw their bachelorette photo
                    albums and snapped.

                                      ANDREW
                          (eyes Brooke)
                    The wedding band on Chelsea's finger
                    would be consistent with that theory.

                                      MOLLY
                    He got the girl in death that he
                    couldn't get in life.
                          (then)
                    I've got his address.

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:

                          (pacing)
                    It's me.  In building the suspect's
                    profile, I dug into Rendell's
                      background.  Make-a-match canceled
                    his membership because several women
                      complained about harassing messages. 
                    Two days later, Chelsea Kettner held
                    her bachelorette party.                                                                                        49.

                    Thanks... Andrew?

                    Yeah?

                                      BROOKE
                    I'll be wearing the ring tomorrow.

                          (a smile)
                    Good.  Be safe.

      As Brooke clicks off, Molly turns to her.  

                                      MOLLY
                    Lights are on, but no one's home.

                                      BROOKE
                    I'll send in a unit.  And CSU's
                    already on its way.

      As they approach the house, OFFICER ELLIS, 20s, who was
      investigating the backyard, races up to them.  With urgency --

                                      OFFICER ELLIS
                      Detectives, back here.

      Molly and Brooke follow him around the back of the house. 
      As they step through mud, Brooke points out --

                                      BROOKE
                    Ground's muddy.  Perfect for the
                    bacterium found in Chelsea's blood.

      Molly nods, spots something in the mud.

                                      MOLLY
                    Fresh tire impressions.

                                      BROOKE
                          (yells out)
                    Officers, watch your step.  This
                    crime scene is hot.

                                      MOLLY
                    Two sets of two, with a wide track,
                      suggesting a truck.
                          (then, curiously notes)
                    And a second set of two, right next
                    to each other.

                                      BROOKE
                    A boat...  If it were hitched to the
                    truck, that could explain the pattern.                                                                                        50.

      They're led to an OLD SHED, several officers have gathered
      around it.  (Think: Jaycee Dugard compound.)


      Molly and Brooke push inside.  On the ground, amongst various
      detritus -- a PINK BLOUSE and JEANS.

                                      MOLLY
                    Chelsea's blouse.  The one she was
                    wearing in the surveillance footage.

                                      BROOKE
                          (updating their theory)
                    So Rendell brings his victims back
                    here.  Sedates them, redresses them,
                    and then takes them to a more secure
                    location.

      Officer Ellis sticks his head inside.

                                      OFFICER ELLIS
                      Detectives, CHP spotted Rendell
                    heading south on Black Mountain,
                    just past Ridgecrest.

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:


      We FIND Molly, in the passage seat, broadcasting orders.  As
      they begin to ascend up a HILL --                                                                                        51.

                    Air support unit is three minutes
                    out.  CHP has shut down all access
                    roads for the next ten miles.

      We PAN to Brooke, driving, on her bluetooth --

                                      BROOKE
                    ... Alright.  Makes sense.  Thanks.
                          (turns to Molly)
                    The owner of Hornblower mentioned
                    your phone call to Rendell.  Rendell
                    must've panicked and fled.

                                      MOLLY
                    He tried to stay off our radar by
                    taking the canyon road.  Nice try.

      As they get closer to Rendell --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Rendell eyes their approaching vehicle in his rear-view
      mirror.  Desperate, he reaches for his EMERGENCY TOW RELEASE. 
      CAMERA FLIES OUT HIS REAR WINDOW to the WINCH, where the
      truck DISENGAGES from the boat and begins to FREE FALL DOWN
      THE SLOPED ROAD TOWARD --


      Brooke sees the boat coming toward them.

                                      BROOKE
                    Oh God!

      As the boat is about to COLLIDE with them, the STERN hits a
      pothole.  Given the boat's velocity, the IMPACT with the
      pothole UPENDS the boat, PROPELLING it into the AIR.

      Seeing the boat go airborne, Brooke SPEEDS FORWARD, driving
      underneath the boat, which SMASHES onto the road, missing
      their car by inches!  Breathless, they remain in pursuit. 

      S/FX -- The unmistakable sound of a helicopter's propeller. 

      Molly looks up to see a Bell-12 rise over the bluff.  Molly
      talks into her radio.

                                      MOLLY
                    ASU, we have a visual.  How long
                    'til you're ready?

      CAMERA ANGLES up to the HELICOPTER.  And we PUSH INTO --

                                                                      INTERCUT CUT TO:                                                                                        52.


      The HELICOPTER PILOT communicates via radio.  (Note: They're
      all on the same frequency.)

                                      HELICOPTER PILOT
                    ASU is in place.

                                      MOLLY
                    Attention all units.  Reduce speed. 
                    I repeat, reduce speed and fall back,
                    now.

      The squadron of law enforcement slows down as the helicopter
      continues to hover, just ahead of Rendell's truck.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    ASU, you're good to go.

      ANGLE ON HELICOPTER -- AS IT RELEASES SEVERAL SPIKE STRIPS
      ONTO THE ROAD, IN FRONT OF RENDELL'S PICK UP.

      STAY with Rendell as he swerves to avoid the strips, but his
      LEFT TIRES are PIERCED.  Out of control, the truck crashes
      against the guard rail, grinding to a stop.  Law enforcement
      circles the disabled pick-up and emerge from their vehicles. 

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                          (on megaphone)
                    Put your hands on your head, and
                    slowly come out of the vehicle.

      As tension mounts, the door opens and he emerges.  Brooke,
      gun drawn, throws him against the truck, and cuffs him.

                                      BROOKE
                    Jonas Rendell, you're under arrest.

      Molly approaches.  She eyes the passenger compartment, which
      is empty.  Angry and demanding --

                                      MOLLY
                    Where is she?!  Kathy Lim.  Where
                    the hell is she?

      Rendell smiles, as if taunting: "Wouldn't you like to know?" 

                                                                              FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      Brooke sits across from a defiant Jonas Rendell.

                                      BROOKE
                    If we find Kathy before you start
                    talking, you're looking at the Chair. 
                    But if you tell me where she's at,
                    it could go a long way with the D.A...

      He just smiles back at her.  Offers nothing.

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Molly observes through the two way mirror.  (Note: There's
      also a closed circuit recording of the interrogation being
      broadcast in this room.)  Brooke tries another approach --

                                      BROOKE
                    Jonas, have you ever heard of Barbara
                    Harrison?
                          (off his look)
                    Barbara was the state's first female
                    homicide Detective.  In 1978.

      Under the above, the Lieutenant enters the viewing room.  He
      holds a file.  He turns his attention to the interrogation.

                    ... Before Barbara, if a woman wanted
                    to make detective, she was considered
                    crazy, mad, deviant.  All words that
                    people will use to describe you.

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                          (to Molly)
                    The press and the Chief are breathing
                    down my neck and "Smiley's" been
                    mute for over an hour.

                                      MOLLY
                    Give her time.  She's trying to
                    connect.

                                      BROOKE
                    ... So in some ways, you and I aren't
                    all that different.  And if you start
                    talking to me, I can help you.

      He remains stone-face.  The Lieutenant turns to Molly --                                                                                        54.

                          (re: file)
                    Got his medical records.  What're
                    you looking for?

                                      MOLLY
                          (purviews file)
                    Chelsea was drugged with Benazepril. 
                    I'm checking for a prescription.
                          (then)
                    And here it is.  He had a leaky heart
                    valve a few years back.

      As Molly reads, something else catches her attention.  She
      grows excited.  Hands the file back to the Lieutenant.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I have to go.

                                      LIEUTENANT ENRIQUEZ
                    Where?  What are you doing?

      Molly exits without an answer.  Off the Lieutenant's confusion --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      The RENDELL INTERROGATION broadcasts on her MONITOR as Molly
      enters and crosses to her fridge.  She finds "Ben's" lunch
      bag, from the day before.  She pulls out the peanut butter
      and jelly sandwich.  As she pries the slices of bread apart --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    ... You know, you could be a hero in
                    all this.  If Kathy's alive, you
                    tell me where she's at, you save her
                    life.  

      Finally, Jonas leans forward --

                                      JONAS
                    You think I'm an idiot?  I tell you
                    where she's at -- you're the hero. 
                    Lady, that ain't gonna happen.

      As he stares her down, Molly enters with two cups of coffee. 
      Brooke looks up at her, unsure why she's entered --

                                      BROOKE
                    Detective Collins --                                                                                        55.

                                      MOLLY
                          (offers)
                    Coffee.  It's gonna be a long night.

      Molly hands each of them a cup.  Jonas takes a sip, then
      another.  A small smiles creeps over Molly's face as she
      begins to pace.  She addresses Jonas --

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Too bad you didn't cooperate with my
                    partner.  She's the nice one.  She
                    tells good stories.  She follows the
                    rules.  Not me.  I'm older.  I got
                    less time.

      Brooke is unsure of Molly's tactic.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    You ever think about time, Jonas? 
                    Just last night, someone was talking
                    to me about losing time.  Sounds 
                    terrible, right?  Losing time. 
                          (off his look)
                    Anyway, I was in the other room, 
                    watching my partner talk to you --

      As she paces, she deliberately brushes her leg against the
      outlet, which connects to the closed circuit camera cord,
      disconnecting it.  As she does, she looks directly at the
      two-way mirror.  Follow her POV --

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      -- To the Lieutenant.  As the CAMERA is unplugged, the MONITOR
      goes dark.  The Lieutenant's confused but trusts Molly.

                                      MOLLY
                    -- And I started thinking, maybe I
                    can help speed things along.  Save
                    us all some time. 

      Jonas suddenly gags loudly, as if something is caught deep
      in his throat.  He tries to clear it.

                                      JONAS
                    I need some water.

                                      MOLLY
                    You got coffee.

      Jonas takes another sip.  Gasps again.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    It's good, right?                                                                                        56.

      Jonas gasps for air.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Used my secret ingredient, a spoonful
                    of peanut butter.

      Jonas eyes go wide.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, right... I read your medical
                    records, and in big red letters, it
                    says you have a "severe allergy to
                    peanuts."  Even the smallest amount
                    will constrict your airway.

      Jonas eyes Brooke and Molly catches it.  Molly reaches into
      her pocket and takes out an epi-pen.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Hey, I'm all you got.  And without
                    an injection of adrenaline, you're
                    gonna die.

      Jonas lunges at Molly, but he's cuffed to the chair, which
      is fixed to the floor.

                                      MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Tell me where you hid Kathy or don't. 
                    Either way, it's a win-win.

      Again, he eyes Brooke for support.  But Brooke jumps on board
      with Molly.

                                      BROOKE
                    Tick tock.

      Brooke slides the pad and paper toward him.  A beat.  Finally,
      he grips the pen and starts writing.  Off Molly's relief --

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:


      Brooke sits on her sofa drinking a glass of grape juice. 
      She crosses to a drawer and pulls out the engagement ring. 
      She puts it on her finger, and smiles. 

      S/FX -- KNOCK at the door.

      Brooke eyes the peephole and opens the door to reveal Molly,
      with a bottle of champagne.

                                      MOLLY
                          (meekly)
                    Surprise.

                                      BROOKE
                    What are you doing here?

                                      MOLLY
                          (blurts it all out)
                      I should've jumped up and down. 
                    Thrown confetti.  Andrew isn't Gavin. 
                    My relationship isn't yours.  I want
                    you guys to be crazy, silly, happy. 
                    And --
                          (a breath)
                    I want to help you register.

                                      BROOKE
                          (smiles)
                    Thank you.

      Brooke takes the champagne.  For the first time, their roles
      reverse and Brooke "mothers" Molly.  A beat, then --                                                                                        61.

                                      MOLLY
                    Gavin said "no way" to therapy. 
                          (choked up)
                    And he kinda kicked me out.

                          (dread)
                    Oh --

      Then, Molly finally lets it all out --

                                      MOLLY
                    He stopped asking about my day. 
                    Hardly looked at me when I came home
                    from a shift.  And don't get me
                    started on our sex life.  But I still
                    believed everything would be okay. 
                          (a beat, then)
                    I gotta figure out what I'm gonna
                    do. 

                                      BROOKE
                    We can figure it out together, but
                    not tonight.
                          (smiles; gets an idea)
                    You still have that guitar in your
                    trunk?  The one you bought for him?

      Off Molly's look --

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:
