            Stardate 41235.32. I am 
            concerned. Over a full day of 
            waiting with no response from... 

        (OPTICAL) 

        This enclosed, sanded area, walled in black, has an 
        ascetic, Zen-garden feeling with a pebbled center 
        enclosing a small, off-center fountain. A single, 
        simple, brilliant banner identifies this an important 
        place, and whatever design elements are visible reveal 
        an interest in the abstract, perhaps a Mondrian-ish 
        feeling. Two sentries are posted beside a doorway. 
        Picard and Troi BEAM INTO SHOT. Lutan and Hagon come 
        from inside the doorway and exchange the "empty hands" 
        ritual greeting with Picard. 

                LUTAN 
            Welcome to my Centerplace, Captain 
            Picard. Consider yourselves my 
            honored guests. 

                YAREENA (O.S.) 
            Every hospitality will be accorded 
            you. 

        ADJUST ANGLE to include YAREENA, who has just joined 
        them. She is petite by Ligonian standards and quite 
        radiant, a woman of visible nobility and keen 
        intelligence. Her only flaw being her passionate, 
        unreasoning love for Lutan. 

                LUTAN 
            This is my First One, Yareena. 

                PICARD 
            Lutan is a fortunate man. 

        She smiles graciously, but remains a bit behind him, 
        according to custom. 

                PICARD 
              (continuing) 
            You've met Counselor Troi. 

                LUTAN 
            Yes. 
              (to Picard) 
            As on your vessel, you have only 
            to name whatever courtesy we can 
            provide. 

                PICARD 
            Then, sir... the courtesy of 
            seeing Lieutenant Yar.  
                  STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87            26. 
 
      34   CONTINUED: 

                LUTAN 
            Lieutenant Yar will be returned 
            to you tonight at a banquet I have 
            arranged in your honor. 

                PICARD 
            I would like to see her now. 

                LUTAN 
              (thinks; then, to a 
               sentry) 
            Bring Lieutenant Yar. 
              (to Picard) 
            I find it odd, Captain, that a 
            man of your experience has such 
            difficulty in understanding 
            ordinary politeness. 

                PICARD 
            Such as saying "please" when 
            abducting someone? 

                LUTAN 
            The expression "please" is used 
            only when requesting the person 
            back. 

                PICARD 
            Yours is a different world. 

                LUTAN 
            With clear and simple ways deeply 
            rooted in our culture. If you 
            are willing to ask for Lieutenant 
            Yar's release tonight in front 
            of all, honor will be satisfied. 

                TROI 
              (to Picard) 
            One can see the importance of 
            "honor" here. 

                LUTAN 
            Honor is everything. 

        Picard and Troi exchange looks. 

                HAGON 
            There will be gifts for each of 
            you, to absolve the abduction.

        Tasha is brought to the doorway between four guards, 
        with every sign she would break free at the slightest 
        opportunity. One of the guards limps, a leg bandaged. 
        When Tasha sees Picard she calms down. 

                PICARD 
            Lieutenant, have you been treated 
            well? 

                TASHA 
            Fine, Captain... 
              (indicates bandaged 
               guard; smiles) 
            ... but they're showing some signs 
            of wear. 

                YAREENA 
            There isn't any need to be 
            concerned, Captain. She's being 
            well cared for. 

        Picard looks Tasha over, then turns to Lutan. 

                PICARD 
            My ship's company and I are 
            certain of your gentle wisdom in 
            that. 

        Lutan hesitates, takes another look at Picard. Then: 
 
                LUTAN 
            I thought for a moment I heard 
            a threat implied. 
              (shrugs) 
            But that would be foolishness. 

                PICARD 
            Something to be carefully avoided 
            I agree. 

                LUTAN 
            The festivities for her return 
            to you are in preparation. Shall 
            we retire until then? 

        Lutan gestures to the guards, who move to take Tasha 
        OFF, without resistance. CAMERA PUSHES IN on Picard as 
        he replies and considers what is ahead. 

                PICARD 
            Until tonight, Lutan.  
                  STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87            28. 
 

        Under a canopy, a juggler performs. Guests sit on floor 
        mats or cushions. All carry hand-held, delicately 
        carved ivory-like sticks which they tap together to 
        signal applause or approval. Tables are low and food is 
        plentiful. ESTABLISH Lutan and Yareena sitting on a 
        slightly raised dais, with Hagon next to him on floor 
        level, and Lutan's Supporters close around them. The 
        juggler drops something and suddenly stops. He has 
        committed an act of dishonor. 

      36   ANGLE ON PICARD AND TROI 

        Picard and Troi scan the room, hoping to see Tasha. A 
        sudden SCREAM from the direction where the juggler had 
        performed. 

      37   FULL SHOT 

        Picard and Troi whirl to look in that direction but 
        their line of sight is quickly blocked by gift bearers 
        who APPEAR, with Ligonian silks, works of precious 
        metal, and fine large gems. Picard is troubled by what 
        may have happened to the juggler but is distracted by 
        the gift bearers making presentations. Then the room 
        falls SILENT. 

                LUTAN 
            We present you gifts! 

      38   CLOSER SHOT 

        as Tasha is escorted in to approving IVORY-TAPPING 
        sounds from the Ligonians who face Lutan. Tasha is 
        seated next to Lutan and Yareena on an empty cushion. 
        She smiles at Picard and Troi. At FULL SILENCE Lutan 
        turns and fixes his gaze on Picard. The moment has 
        arrived. Picard rises and faces Lutan with great 
        dignity. 

                PICARD 
            Lutan, you have granted us 
            hospitality and the safety of your 
            Centerplace. The gifts you give 
            us are rare and precious. We 
            thank you. In accordance with 
            the customs of your ancestors, 
            which I honor and respect, I am 
            here in peace to ask for the 
            return of Lieutenant Yar.

      38   CONTINUED: 

        The Guests CHIME WILDLY now, nodding in enthusiastic 
        approval. Yareena is especially proud and pleased. 
        CAMERA TO LUTAN, who smiles and rises, CAMERA MOVING 
        SLOWLY BACK. 

                LUTAN 
            Well spoken. There are some among 
            my equals in this gathering who 
            were wary of my approaching the 
            Federation. I am proud to have 
            taken this first step towards a 
            treaty -- and proud we have 
            something of great value to offer 
            you -- a priceless life-giving 
            vaccine. 
              (beat) 
            The abduction I have done 
            according to our custom, for all 
            to see. 
              (great applause) 
            Your conduct in this matter has 
            been beyond exemplary, Captain 
            Picard -- 
              (glances at Tasha) 
            -- but now that the moment has 
            come, I find I cannot part with 
            her. 

        A ripple of astonishment flows through the crowd in the 
        room. Picard takes a step forward. Tension. 

                PICARD 
            You speak of a code of honor... 
            but what you are now saying is 
            called under our customs... an 
            act of war. 

                LUTAN 
            No, no, Captain! You do not 
            understand. 

                PICARD 
            Correct! I am now beyond 
            understanding! 

                LUTAN 
            This is not an act of war, but 
            of love. I want Lieutenant Yar 
            to become my First One.

      38   CONTINUED: (2) 

        There is general astonishment. Yareena is as shocked 
        and outraged as Picard and Troi. Hagon is also 
        disturbed. Yareena jumps to her feet. 

                YAREENA 
            I challenge your right of 
            supercedence! 

        The Guests in the room are stunned. 

                HAGON 
              (at Yareena) 
            No woman has challenged 
            supercedence for over two-hundred 
            years! 

                YAREENA 
            The right is mine -- and I will 
            have it! 
              (then to Tasha, furious) 
            Natasha Yar -- I challenge you! 
            A struggle to the death! 

        ZOOM IN and PAN to include QUICK REACTION SHOTS from 
        Tasha and Troi. Then, ZOOM BACK as Picard jumps to his 
        feet. 

                PICARD 
              (strongly) 
            NO! The challenge is 
            unequivocally refused! 

        There is a stunned SILENCE. Lutan rises to his feet, 
        eyes blazing. 

                LUTAN 
            Then you shall have no treaty -- 
            no vaccine -- and no Lieutenant 
            Yar!
