                                        ACT ONE

  FADE IN:

  EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

  The Manhattan skyline.  A violent STORM rains Hell down upon the 
  city.  CAMERA GLIDES over Central Park towards the West Side to 
  FIND the glowing lights of LINCOLN CENTER.  We can just hear the 
  warm strings of CLASSICAL MUSIC over the steady downpour...

  INT. LINCOLN CENTER - NIGHT

  Bows move in unison as the Philharmonic digs into a brooding 
  performance of Schubert s  Unfinished Symphony No. 8 in B 
  Minor ... First Chair Violinist MALCOLM HARTWELL (40s, in 
  glasses) plays with incredible focus, feeling every note, a 
  master of his art.  

  As the music SWELLS, we see small drops of BLOOD hitting the 
  floor.  

  Malcolm fumbles, MISSES a note, drawing a sharp look from the 
    conductor.  He refocuses, pushing through... 

  A thin stream of blood runs down his fingers as they slide over 
  the strings.  He finally notices, stops playing.  Examines his 
  fingers. 

  CLOSE ON HIS FINGERTIPS -- RAZOR-THIN CUTS run across them, 
  sliced by the violin s strings.

  Malcom reacts.  What s wrong with him...?

  IN THE BALCONY -- An elegantly dressed couple, GAVIN and OLIVIA 
  DORAN, 50s, watch the symphony.  Gavin fixes his piercing gaze 
  on Malcolm, eyes still as a serpent.  He doesn t appear 
  surprised by what s happening...

  INT. LINCOLN CENTER - BACKSTAGE - LATER

  Malcolm rushes offstage during the applause, carrying his violin 
  and bow, grasping a bloody handkerchief in his fist.  The STAGE 
  MANAGER approaches --

                                  STAGE MANAGER
                    We still got the encore --
                          (sees the blood)
                    The hell happened to you?  

                                    MALCOLM
                    Nothing --                                                                                      2.


  Malcolm pushes past him and enters a door marked  CONCERT 
  MASTER , which is a --

  SMALL DRESSING ROOM -- framed magazine profiles of Malcolm, 
  glowing reviews, and awards hang on the wall.  Malcolm quickly 
  puts the violin in its case and grabs his garment bag. He s 
  about to leave when he notices --

  An ENVELOPE sitting on the vanity.  Unmarked.  Weirdly ominous.  
  Malcolm picks it up.  Finds a NOTE inside.  

  CLOSE ON THE NOTE -- there s a small ARCHAIC SYMBOL (it almost 
  looks like a face...perhaps of a DRAGON) printed on it.  

  Malcolm pales.  SCARED.

  EXT. THE DRAKE - NIGHT

  An imposing stone building on the Upper East Side, christened 
   The Drake  in the year of its construction in 1923.  A yellow 
  taxi SCREECHES to a stop out front.  Malcolm jumps out and 
  rushes inside, past the DOORMAN on duty --

  INT. THE DRAKE - HARTWELL S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Malcolm blows into the well-appointed apartment.  Frantic.  He 
  moves to the --

  BEDROOM -- Goes straight to the closet.  Pulls a suitcase down 
  from a shelf and throws it open on the bed.  Quickly fills it 
  with clothes.  A few photographs.  PASSPORT.

  Then he opens his violin case and takes out his VIOLIN.  It s a 
  thing of beauty, despite the blood still smeared on its neck.  
  He regards it with a mixture of awe and disgust for a beat, then 
  suddenly --

  He SMASHES it to pieces against the wall.  Crushes it even 
  further under his heel.  When he stops, he hears the phone on 
  his nightstand RINGING.  

  Malcolm stares at the phone, unnerved, but doesn t pick it up.  
  He grabs his bag and rushes out of the apartment...

  INT. THE DRAKE - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

  Malcolm steps off the elevator.  The lobby doors stand wide 
  OPEN, the rain still coming down outside.  The Doorman is 
  nowhere to be seen.  There s an eerie EMPTINESS here all of a 
  sudden.  As he heads for the exit --

  The lobby doors suddenly SLAM CLOSED.  The lights FLICKER and 
  DIM.  He turns around, the elevator doors close as well.  He 
  taps the call button, but it won t stay on.  He s trapped.                                                                                        3.


  Malcolm STARTLES as the phone on the front desk RINGS.  And 
  keeps ringing.  Waiting for him.  He works up the nerve to 
  finally PICK IT UP.  A man s LOW VOICE is heard on the line. 

                                  GAVIN DORAN (O.S.)
                    Hard to believe it s been ten years, 
                    Mr. Hartwell.

  Malcolm recognizes him.  He struggles to keep his voice even.  

                                    MALCOLM
                    Not yet.  Please.  I need more time.   

                                  GAVIN DORAN (O.S.)
                    I m generous with a lot of things, my 
                    friend, but that is not one of them.

  INT. LIMOUSINE - DRIVING - NIGHT

    Windshield wipers work against the heavy rain, the sound filling 
  the chaufferred car.  Passing city lights strobe the shadowy 
  backseat where we FIND Gavin Doran (from the balcony) on his 
  cell phone.  Next to him, Olivia looks out the window.   

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Let me tell you about this guy I knew.  
                    Violinist with the New York Phil.  
                    Wanted to be the best, the toast of the 
                    town, but he d hit his limit.  The hard 
                    truth was: he just wasn t talented 
                    enough.  Now, what do you think he 
                    would ve given to be the best?

  Gavin speaks with a slick, menacing gravitas.  At times, 
  indelicate.  Always direct.  

  As we INTERCUT THE CALLERS:

                                    MALCOLM
                      ...Anything...

                                  GAVIN DORAN (O.S.)
                    Not anything.  Everything.

  Malcolm reels, silently screaming inside.  

  Olivia puts her hand on Gavin s thigh with a seductive smile, 
  sliding it up his leg as he continues talking.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN (O.S.)
                    And didn t I come through for you?  
                    Didn t I deliver all the adulation?  
                    The respect?  And you have the stones 
                    to tell me you need more time?                                                                                      4.


                                    MALCOLM
                    I m begging you... Please... Just 
                    another year --

                                  GAVIN DORAN (O.S.)
                    We have a binding contract.  You signed 
                    it.  Now it s time to settle up.

  Malcolm takes a beat, then drops the phone and rushes for the 
  lobby door.  He strains with all his muscle to pull the door 
  open a few inches and squeeeeeze his body through... 

  EXT. THE DRAKE - CONTINUOUS

  OOMPF!!  He lands hard on the wet concrete of the sidewalk.  
  Holy shit, he got out.  Malcolm stands up, takes a breath. 

                                    MALCOLM
                    ...oh dear God thank you...

  A NOISE behind him.  An eerie SQUEAK of metal.  He turns back to 
  the building.  Sees that the  JUDAS HOLE  (which is a small 5x7 
  inch door, set into the larger lobby door, like a peephole) has 
    mysteriously opened.  

  Malcolm freezes -- why the fuck did that little door just open?

  SUDDENLY -- Malcolm is LIFTED off the ground and PULLED right 
  through the tiny Judas hole in the door!!  

  And with that, we PULL BACK to see carved into the building 
  itself,  The Drake , and below that,  999 Park Avenue ... Then 
  the numbers slowly TWIST around to reveal that evil has an 
    address... TITLE UP:

                                   666 PARK AVENUE 

  EXT. THE DRAKE/CITY STREET - DAY

  The Drake rises over Park Avenue, historic, solid, imposing in 
  its magnificence.  It holds no hint of menace in the daylight.

  A JUNKER CAR, with patches of rust and Indiana license plates, 
  pulls up and parallel parks between a Mercedes and a Cadillac.  

  JANE VAN VEEN, 28, and HENRY MARTIN, 29, professionally attired, 
  climb out of the car.  She looks up at the building.

                                  JANE
                    Nice digs.  What do you think?  

                                  HENRY
                    I think we couldn t afford to rent a 
                    closet in this place.                                                                                      5.


  They share a wry smile.  Henry s good looks and easy smile 
  convey a confidence that belies his humble upbringing.  Jane s a 
  natural beauty, with the pluck of someone who s earned 
    everything she s gotten in life.  They make an adorable couple.

  As they head inside, we PUSH IN through the open Judas hole --

  INT. THE DRAKE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

  Jane and Henry walk into the large opulent lobby and immediately 
  react to what they see.  It s gorgeous.  Modern art on the 
  walls.  Two designer sofas surround a Noguchi table, in front of 
  a gas FIREPLACE.  Sunlight streams through windows, reflecting 
  off the polished marble floors.  

                                  JANE
                            (whispering)
                    Oh my God, I know this place.  It was 
                    in Architectural Digest last spring.

  They approach the FRONT DESK -- where the Doorman, TONY DeMEO 
  (30, Bronx accent), plays a game on his phone.  He puts it away 
  when he realizes Jane and Henry are standing there.

                                  HENRY
                    We re here to see Mr. Doran?

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    Of course.  Sign in for me please.  
                    What s the name?

                                  JANE
                    Jane Van Veen and Henry Martin.

  Tony picks up the desk PHONE and dials as they sign the visitor 
  log.  NONA CLARK, (14, green nailpolish, skinny jeans) steps off 
  the elevator and approaches Tony --

                                  NONA
                    Did my grandma s package arrive yet?

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                          (covering the handset)
                    I m on the phone...

  Tony waves Nona off.  Nona turns to Jane and Henry --  

                                  NONA
                          (wry)
                    He s so busy.

  Tony hangs up, turns to Jane and Henry.                                                                                        6.


                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    Mr. Doran s ready to see you.  The 
                      penthouse.

  Jane and Henry head for the elevator.

                                  NONA
                    Hope you get the job...

  Jane smiles, reacts -- she didn t tell Nona why they were here.  
  Strange.  They step on the elevator.  Henry hits the  P  button.

  INT. THE DRAKE - PENTHOUSE - DAY

  DING! The elevator doors open.  Jane and Henry step into the 
  FOYER of a luxurious penthouse apartment.  Up ahead, in the 
  LIVING ROOM, they see two laborers struggling to hang a heavy 
  SCULPTURE (a Murakami-esque pop piece) on the wall.  Directing 
  them is OLIVIA DORAN (the striking woman we saw in the teaser).  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Higher.  Get a ladder if you can t lift 
                    it, it needs to go higher.

  Olivia is maybe 55, but seems ageless.  She s coldly beautiful, 
    sophisticated, and still has a potent sexuality about her.  She 
  finally notices Jane and Henry standing nearby --

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Can I help you?

                                  HENRY
                    We have an interview?  Henry Martin, 
                    Jane Van Veen.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Of course, for the manager position.  
                    Welcome.  Can I get either of you an 
                    espresso?  Sparkling water?

                                  JANE & HENRY 
                    No thanks / I m fine.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Let me tell Gavin you re here.
                          (to laborers)
                    Put it down.  Gently please, that s a 
                    Yoshi Takakami!

  The laborers carefully set the piece of art on the floor.  
  Olivia moves to a CLOSED DOOR and enters, leaving it slightly 
  OPEN.  We see Gavin Doran pacing behind his desk, on the phone --                                                                                      7.


                                  GAVIN DORAN (INTO PHONE)
                    -- I got every two-bit slum lord and 
                    his brother throwing their tenements at 
                    me.  I m not interested in getting tied 
                    up in court for the next ten years 
                    trying to evict old ladies and welfare 
                    mothers.  I need the wrecking ball 
                    swinging the minute we close --

  JANE S POV -- Olivia touches Gavin s back, an intimate gesture, 
  as she whispers to Gavin.  He looks up and meets Jane s eyes.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN (PRE-LAP)
                    The Resident Manager handles the day-to-
                    day running of the building, managing 
                    the books, collecting the rent, general 
                      maintenance and upkeep.

  INT. THE DRAKE - PENTHOUSE - GAVIN S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

  Jane and Henry sit across from Gavin as he looks over their 
    application.  Nearby, his associate YURI (50s, hard look), works 
  in front of several COMPUTERS displaying stock and bond markets.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    It s not full-time, most managers keep 
                    their day jobs.  Where are you living 
                    now?

                                  HENRY
                    Queens.  We have a sublet on a one 
                    bedroom.  Short term.

                                  JANE
                    We were looking for a new apartment on 
                    Craig s List, actually.  Then I saw 
                    your ad and thought: hey, we could do 
                    that.  We re responsible and...

                                  HENRY
                    ...Handy.

  Jane covers her amused look -- handy?  Gavin turns to Henry, 
  reading off the application.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I see you work for the Mayor.

                                  HENRY
                    City Planning, actually.  Deputy 
                    Counsel.  But I liason with the Mayor s 
                    office on certain projects.  I just 
                    started last month.                                                                                      8.


                                  JANE
                    Henry was hand-picked by the Mayor s 
                    Chief of Staff right out of law school.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Is that right?

                                  HENRY
                    It wasn t a big deal.

                                  JANE
                    Actually, it kinda was.

  Henry shoots Jane a look.  Jane shrugs -- sorry, it was.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    How about you, Jane?  Are you working?

                                  JANE
                      Presently, no.  I mean, I had a job 
                    lined up at an architectural firm here 
                    in the city.  Nichols & Rourke.  But it 
                    kinda fell through at the last minute.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Marty Nichols is a great architect.  
                    Too bad it didn t happen.  But I 
                    wouldn t take it personally, not in 
                    this economy.

                                  JANE
                    I ve had interviews at other firms, but 
                    there s not a lot out there right now.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    What can I say?  This is New York.  Not 
                    everybody gets to make it.  

  Gavin s comment knocks Jane down a bit, but she covers it well.  
  He studies her reaction for a beat, then --  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Where are you from originally?

                                  JANE
                    Indiana.  Kokomo.  And nothing against 
                    Kokomo, it s lovely.  But I want to 
                    design real buildings, so this is where 
                    I need to be.  Frankly, it s the only 
                    place for me to be.
                          (beat)
                    And obviously because Henry s work is 
                    here as well...                                                                                      9.


                                  HENRY
                    ...What Jane means is that we re 
                    committed to staying in New York.  This 
                    is our home now...

  Gavin makes a few more notes as Jane watches nervously.  Shit, 
  is she blowing this for them?  A beat, then --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Look, you re not the first people to 
                    move to this city with some grand 
                    ambition.  It s the essential truth of 
                    who we are: we all want something.  But 
                    to be blunt, I m not in the charity 
                    business.  I need people who know what 
                    they re doing.

  Gavin takes a beat, then sets their application aside and stands 
  to dismiss them.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Thanks for coming in...

                                  JANE
                    I was wondering.  When did you have the 
                      foundation retro-fitted?

  That gives Gavin pause.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                      Retro-fitted.  Why would I do that?

                                  JANE
                    Well, because the Drake was built in 
                    1923, right?  The Mob controlled 
                    concrete back then, the Morello gang I 
                    believe, and they cut corners to skim a 
                    profit.  Like with steel rebar --  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    And you know this how?

                                  HENRY
                    She has degrees in architecture and 
                    historic preservation.  She s kind of a 
                    nut about this stuff.

                                  JANE
                    That s why a lot of New York buildings 
                    from that time now reinforce their 
                      foundations.  Just in case.  If this 
                    city ever got hit with an earthquake, 
                    or hurricane, or some other nasty Act 
                    of God... Well... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    10.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    Shame on me if I didn t say something.

  Gavin studies her for a beat, then breaks into an ironic smile.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    A nasty Act of God.  Heaven forbid.
                          (beat)
                    Maybe I dismissed you too quickly.

  Jane and Henry trade an excited look.

  INT. THE DRAKE - HALLWAY - DAY

  Doorman Tony DeMeo leads Jane and Henry down the long hallway, 
  filling them in on the particulars of the building as they walk.

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    The Drake s got twelve floors, with the 
                    Doran s penthouse on the thirteenth.  
                    Forty apartments, full up.  Total of 63 
                    residents in the house.  

                                  HENRY
                    I thought every building around here 
                    had gone co-op.

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    We re the last rental building in the 
                      neighborhood.  Mr. Doran likes to 
                    approve every tenant himself.  
                    Obviously whatever you said won him 
                    over.  I was sorta lobbying for the job 
                    myself, y know.

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  Sorry.

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    What re you saying sorry for?  Mr. 
                    Doran s choice, not yours.  Not like 
                    you took the job from me.

  But there s a sting in Tony s voice.  Henry changes the subject.

                                  HENRY
                    A lot of families live here?

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    A few.  Mostly yuppies like you two.  
                    Some artsy types.  A few working-class 
                    folks living under rent control.                                                                                    11.


  They cross paths with BRIAN LEONARD (33, handsome, disheveled 
  hipster) as he carries a bag of trash down the hall.  

                                  BRIAN
                    The trash chute s clogged again, Tony.  
                    I had to walk down three flights.  

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    I ll get someone right on that, Mr. 
                    Leonard.

  Tony turns to introduce Jane and Henry.

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    Our new Resident Managers, Jane and 
                    Henry.  Meet Brian Leonard, our 
                    resident Shakespeare.

                                  BRIAN
                    We re up on six.  Me and my wife.

                                  JANE
                    What do you write?

                                  BRIAN
                    I m working on a new play.

                                  JANE
                    Broadway?  

  Tony CLEARS his throat.  A dig.  Brian shoots Tony a look.

                                  BRIAN
                    More off-Broadway. 
                          (re: his trash bag)
                    I better get rid of this.  Welcome to 
                    the building.

                                  JANE & HENRY
                    Thanks... / Nice to meet you...

  Brian heads for the trash chute.  Jane and Henry follow Tony 
  towards the door at the end of the hall.  

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    Here we go.  Apartment 3-B.

  Tony unlocks the door, pushes inside --  

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

  Tony leads them into their new apartment.  Henry and Jane enter 
  the living room and react, stunned --                                                                                    12.


                                  JANE
                    Oh. My. God.

  REVERSE -- the apartment is HUGE.  Tastefully furnished.  
  There s a gourmet kitchen, large living room, sunlight through 
  large windows (in fact, it s the same apartment that the former 
  resident manager, Malcolm Hartwell, used to occupy). 

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    Living room and small study.  Gourmet 
                    kitchen.  Two bedrooms, two full baths.  
                    Gas fireplaces in the master bedroom 
                    and living room.  

                                  HENRY
                    Are you sure this is our apartment?

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    Comes with the job.

                                  HENRY
                    What happened to the previous manager? 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, why would anybody ever want to 
                    leave this?

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    As I understand it, Mr. Hartwell moved 
                    someplace warmer.  Arizona, I think.  
                          (beat)
                    I gotta get back to the front desk.  
                    Your keys...

  He hands Jane two apartment KEYS and tips his hat as he leaves.  
  The moment he shuts the door, Jane and Henry turn to each other 
  with incredulous smiles -- 

                                  JANE
                    Welcome home...

  Henry pulls Jane close.  They stand together in the middle of 
  the room, taking it in.  Holy shit.  It s perfect.  

  EXT. THE DRAKE - PENTHOUSE TERRACE - DAY

  Gavin and Olivia have coffee on their terrace aerie, overlooking 
    a picture-perfect view of Central Park.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    The girl seems nice.  Tragically 
                      provincial, but I like her spirit.  And 
                    she s beautiful.                                                                                    13.


                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I like her just fine.  
                          (beat)
                    She s how we get Henry.  

  INT. THE DRAKE - BRIAN S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

  Framed MAGAZINE COVERS (Vogue, Elle, etc) hang on the walls.  
  Brian uses his key to let himself into the apartment, entering --    

  THE KITCHEN -- where LOUISE LEONARD (35, stylish, intellectual) 
  talks on the phone.  Professional cameras and lenses are spread 
  out on the nearby counter.

                                  LOUISE (INTO PHONE)
                    ...Yeah, the 21 millimeter for the wide 
                    shots, but I ll shoot a lot of it with 
                    the 120... She ll be wearing the 
                    Marchesa for that, yeah...
                          (to Brian)
                    Honey, will you pick up some soymilk 
                    when you go out today?  And some other 
                    things, I made a list.

                                  BRIAN
                    I wasn t planning on going out.

                                  LOUISE
                    Brian, please, I don t have time...
                          (into phone)
                    ...yeah, the 2400 ringflash.  Great.

                                  BRIAN
                    You know, I work too.

  Louise hangs up.  She moves to Brian, affectionate --

                                  LOUISE
                    You re right.  I m sorry.  
                          (she kisses him)
                    It s a short list.

  Louise kisses his neck.  Brian knows she s trying to manipulate 
  him.  He finally gives in.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Fine, I ll take care of it.

  Louise smiles, then begins packing up her photo equipment.  
  Brian grabs a mug and pours himself a coffee, then moves to --

  HIS OFFICE -- a small room off the living room with a single 
  window.  Brian sits down at his laptop and opens his E-MAIL.                                                                                    14.


                                  BRIAN
                    By the way, I met the new managers.  A 
                    couple.  When I took out the trash.  
                    They re about our age.  

  A casual glance out the window suddenly gets his attention.

  BRIAN S POV -- a young WOMAN in the apartment across the street.  
  She s brunette, sexy.  He has a perfect view of her through her 
  open shades.  She pulls off her sweatshirt...  

                                  LOUISE (O.S.)
                    Do they have names?

                                  BRIAN
                          (watching the woman)
                    Jane and...Steve, maybe?

  BRIAN S POV -- the young woman peels off her sweaty workout 
  clothes, the angle of the blinds barely obscuring her nudity... 

                                  BRIAN
                    It was either Steve or... Harry, I 
                    think.

                                  LOUISE (O.S.)
                    Steve or Harry.  

  BRIAN S POV -- the young woman heads for the shower. 

                                  LOUISE (O.S.)
                    You don t miss much, do you...

  Brian reluctantly turns back to the laptop.  He opens a WORD 
  file, where we see he s managed to write two words:  Act One  --  

  INT. THE DRAKE - GARAGE/FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

  Henry carries the last box into the freight elevator.  Jane 
  closes the door on the back of the U-haul truck.

                                  JANE
                    Take the elevator up and start 
                      unloading.  I ll close up.

                                  HENRY
                    A glass of wine will be waiting.

  Henry steps on the elevator as the doors close.  Jane padlocks 
  the back door and then locks up the cab.

  She turns to see a MAN enter the garage through a side door, 
  using a KEYCARD to enter.  He s out of breath, sweaty.  He 
  STARTLES when he sees Jane there.                                                                                      15.


                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Oh.  You surprised me.

                                  JANE
                    Hi, I m Jane.  The new resident 
                    manager.

  She offers her hand to JOHN BARLOW (40s, cagey, with a haunted 
  look on his hangdog face).  He moves to shake Jane s hand --

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    John Barlow --

  Jane looks down and reacts -- there s BLOOD on Barlow s hand.  
  It s smeared on his palm and fingertips.  It appears FRESH.  
  Barlow pulls his hand away, wiping it on his pant leg.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Excuse me.  I cut my hand.  

  Jane s a bit creeped out, but manages a polite smile.  

                                  JANE
                    Wash that with soap.  Don t want it to 
                    get infected...

  But Barlow quickly heads into the building.  Off Jane --

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Boxes are everywhere, in various states of unpacking.  Jane and 
  Henry make the bed together, stretching sheets over the mattress 
  and filling the duvet.  They re both in t-shirts and underwear. 

                                  HENRY
                    He cut his hand.  It happens.

                                  JANE
                    It was covered in blood, Henry.

                                  HENRY
                          (amused)
                    You said it was a little bit of blood.

                                  JANE
                    It was enough that I noticed.  And then 
                    he noticed that I noticed and wiped it 
                    on his pants.  And he looked guilty.

                                  HENRY
                    So he was drenched in blood and looked 
                    guilty?  What does guilty look like 
                    again?                                                                                    16.


                                  JANE
                    Do you mind not being a lawyer for a 
                    second and parsing every word I say?  
                    My point is: you tend to notice when 
                    you cut yourself that bad.  It s a 
                    different story when it s not your 
                    blood.

  Henry falls into bed, exhausted.  Jane crawls on top of him.

                                  JANE
                    Y know, we re not in Kokomo anymore.

                                  HENRY
                      Definitely not.  This is way better.

  He smiles.  Jane kisses him seductively.  She gently bites his 
  nose.  He pulls her down to the bed.  They begin to make love...

  INT. THE DRAKE - BARLOW S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Barlow hunches over his kitchen sink, guilty tears in his eyes, 
  scrubbing his hands under steaming water.  He briefly inspects 
  his hands, satisfied they re CLEAN.  No blood, no cuts.  He 
  turns off the water.  Grabs a towel and dries them off.  But 
  then he looks down at his hands again and RECOILS --

  BARLOW S POV -- there s BLOOD on his hand again.  Just like 
  before.  Like he didn t wash it off at all.

  He reacts, horrified.  He cranks the faucet back on and begins 
  furiously scrubbing the blood off his hands again.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    ...Please God forgive me... 

  As he scrubs harder --

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Dark.  Stillness.  As the CAMERA moves through the different 
  rooms of the apartment, slowly things begin to HAPPEN...  
  Fleeting WHISPERS emanate from the SHADOWS.  Doors quietly OPEN 
  by themselves.  The walls begin to PULSE.  We move into --

  THE BEDROOM -- where Jane and Henry now soundly sleep, spooned 
  together.  We hover above them...as the whispers build in 
  volume, competing to be heard...the SHADOWS close in on our 
  sleeping couple...almost touching them...

  But they can t.  Not yet.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    17.


                                        ACT TWO

  INT. THE DRAKE - PENTHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

  Jane meets with Gavin over an elegant breakfast.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    My attorney s drawing up employment 
                    contracts for you two.  I ll let you 
                    know when I have them...
                          (then)
                    This should keep you busy for awhile.

  Gavin hands Jane a typewritten TO DO LIST.  She scans it.

                                  JANE
                          (off list)
                    What s wrong with the elevators?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    They can be tempermental.  The Drake s 
                    an old building.  Our water s still 
                    heated by a gas boiler.  Half the 
                      plumbing s still galvanized pipe.

                                  JANE
                    It shouldn t be too hard to replace all 
                    that with copper.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I ll be gutting the basement and 
                      renovating some of the upper floors to 
                    modernize things, later this year.

                                  JANE
                    Let me know if you need any help --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I have someone already, but...I ll let 
                    you know.

  It s a soft rejection.  Jane covers her disappointment.

                                  JANE
                    Sure, anything you need.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Take your time and settle in.  Meet the 
                      residents.  I think you ll find it s a 
                    friendly building.

                                  JANE
                      I actually met someone last night.  A 
                    man named John Barlow...?                                                                                    18.


                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Yes, Barlow, in 8B.  An accountant.  
                    His lovely wife Mary died recently.

                                  JANE
                    Oh, that s sad.

  Jane s about to press further, when Olivia glides into the room 
  in a red silk kimono, delighted to see Jane.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Jane, you re here!  I was so happy when 
                    Gavin said you and Henry were joining 
                    us.

  Olivia regards the SILK SCARF Jane has tied fashionably around 
  her neck.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    That is a gorgeous scarf.

                                  JANE
                    Thank you.  It was my grandmother s, 
                    actually.

  Jane self-consciously adjusts the scarf.  Olivia turns to Gavin.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Gavin, the Crawfords canceled on us.  
                    What do you want to do?

  Gavin nods to Jane --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    We could invite them. 

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    That s a great idea.  
                          (to Jane)
                    Tomorrow night.  It s a cocktail party 
                    for patrons of the Philharmonic.  And 
                    there s a performance afterwards.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    It s formal.  Does Henry own a tux?

                                  JANE
                    He could rent one I guess.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    He s what...a 44 regular?

                                  JANE
                    That sounds right.                                                                                    19.


                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Then borrow one of Gavin s.  He has an 
                    Armani that d look perfect.

                                  JANE
                    That d be great.  We d love to go. 

  Off Jane, pleasantly surprised --

  INT. CITY GOVERNMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY/HENRY S OFFICE - DAY

  Chaotic.  Ringing phones.  Stacked secretary boxes and file 
  cabinets line the halls.  Henry, tie loose, shirt-sleeves 
  rolled, strides through the cubicle maze with a CO-WORKER.

                                  HENRY
                    ...Let them try to get the injunction 
                    lifted, Judge Lewis stands behind us 
                    all the way on this --

                                  CO-WORKER
                    Not anymore.  My God, Henry.  Don t you 
                    read the paper?

  The Co-Worker grabs a New York Post off a nearby desk as he 
  passes, hands it to Henry.  Henry scans it, stunned.  

  CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE:  JUDGE SLAIN, killer on the loose ...  

                                  HENRY
                    Police have no leads...?

                                  CO-WORKER
                    Not to be insensitive here, but we 
                    don t have any support at the bench 
                    level now.  

                                  HENRY
                    Okay, look.  Tell them we will enforce 
                      environmental regs for any waterfront 
                    property, which means the Greenpoint 
                    Towers Project still has to comply.  If 
                    they want a fight, they ll get one.

  They walk into --

  HENRY S OFFICE -- which is a mess of stacked files and boxes.  
  The only personal item on view is a framed photo of Jane.  As 
  Henry moves to answer the RINGING phone --

                                  HENRY
                    And get the judge s address?  We should 
                    send flowers.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    20.

                                  HENRY (CONT'D)
                          (answering phone)
                    This is Henry.

                                  JANE (OVER PHONE)
                    We have a date Saturday night.

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

  Jane enters the apartment, phone to her ear, carrying a garment 
  bag (with the borrowed tux).

                                  HENRY (OVER PHONE)
                    We do?

  As we INTERCUT THE CALLERS:

                                  JANE
                    With the Dorans.  A black tie thing at 
                    Lincoln Center.  And I said we d love 
                    to go...because we d love to go, right?

  Because it s not like she checked with him first.  But Henry s 
  the kind of guy who rolls with it.

                                  HENRY
                    Of course.  But I don t have a tux.

                                  JANE
                    You re wearing one of Gavin s.  Just 
                    try it on when you get home.

                                  HENRY
                    What are you gonna wear?

                                  JANE
                    Hell if I know.  

  The Co-Worker pops his head into the office.  Henry holds up a 
  finger -- one minute.

                                  HENRY
                    Babe, I gotta roll.  Why don t you just 
                    go buy something?

                                  JANE
                    Because I have eleven dollars in my 
                    checking account, Henry. 

  Henry digs into his pockets, comes up with several crumpled 
  bills.  He tries to smooth them out.                                                                                    21.


                                  HENRY
                    Well, I have... seven...eight bucks in 
                    my pocket.  Yours if you need it.  I ll 
                    just skip lunch --

                                  JANE
                          (smiling)
                    I ll figure it out.  Goodbye.

                                  HENRY
                    Call you later.

  They hang up.

  INT. THE DRAKE - BRIAN S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

  CLOSE ON A BLACKBERRY -- it VIBRATES with an incoming call.

  WIDEN -- Brian and Louise make love under the sheets... Louise 
  peeks her head out from under the covers, glancing towards her 
  Blackberry.  Then Brian, on top of her, peeks out, begins 
  kissing her neck.  She tries to get back into it, then --

                                  LOUISE
                          (whispers in his ear)
                    I m good.  Can you finish?

                                  BRIAN
                    Did you --

                                  LOUISE
                    I m not gonna.  
                          (off his look)
                    It s okay.  I got a lot going on, 
                    that s all.

  Brian isn t happy about it.  Her Blackberry VIBRATES again -- 
  this time she reaches for it, but Brian grabs it first --

                                  BRIAN
                    You need a 12-step program for this.

  As Brian throws the Blackberry across the room, into a pile of 
  clothes on the floor, we TIME CUT TO:

  LATER --  Brian walks out of the bathroom with a towel around 
  his waist, hair wet.  He finds Louise sitting up in bed, staring 
  at her Blackberry, horrified -- 

                                  LOUISE
                    No no no no she can t do this to me --

                                  BRIAN
                    What s wrong?                                                                                    22.


                                  LOUISE
                    My God I don t believe this -- Amy quit 
                    on me.  In an email, that bitch!

  Louise pulls on her robe and storms out of the bedroom.  Brian 
  follows, still in his towel.  She moves into --

  THE KITCHEN -- where her laptop is open on the counter.  Louise 
  begins tapping and punching the keys aggressively.

                                  LOUISE
                    I can t believe she s gonna leave me 
                    hanging like this. If she posts 
                    anything about me on Twitter, I ll kill 
                    her I swear --

                                  BRIAN
                    It s gonna be fine --

                                  LOUISE
                      Everything s not going to be fine, 
                    Brian!  I m screwed, do you get it?

  Louise looks like she s on the edge of tears.  Brian softens.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Look, you can handle this.  You have 
                    time to find somebody.  I ll help you.

  Brian pulls Louise close to him, trying to reassure her.  She 
  takes a breath.  A beat, then she pushes Brian away. 

                                  LOUISE
                    I gotta make some calls.  You need to 
                    brush your teeth.

  She heads into the other room, checking her Blackberry --

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah.  Thanks.

  Brian moves to his desk and opens his laptop to check his email.  
  His eyes reflexively flick out the window, across the street --

  BRIAN S POV -- Her blinds are open.  He finds the young WOMAN 
  asleep in bed wearing nothing but a tanktop and underwear.

  Brian stands at the window, in his towel, watching her... 

  Suddenly, the woman sits up and looks straight back at Brian.  
  Her reaction inscrutable.  She doesn t look away.

  Brian steps away from the window, embarrassed at getting caught.  
  Shit.                                                                                    23.


  INT. THE DRAKE - HALLWAY - DAY

  Jane walks the hallway with a clipboard in hand, noting any 
  small needed repairs.  She checks a FIRE EXTINGUISHER, when it 
  suddenly GOES OFF -- Jane jumps back with a YELP!  

  A white cloud hangs in the air.  Jane collapses against the 
  wall, catching her breath, quietly laughing at herself.

                                  NONA (O.S.)
                    This place ll keep you on your toes.

  Jane turns to find NONA CLARK approaching, earbuds in, iPod on. 

                                  JANE
                    Let s pretend you didn t see that.

                                  NONA
                    A couple boys in the building like to 
                    play pranks.  Mostly harmless.  
                          (then)
                    I m Nona.

                                  JANE
                    Jane.  Nice to meet you again, Nona.
                    Anything else I need to know?

                                  NONA
                      Well...there s a thief in the building.  
                    It s not like TVs getting stolen or 
                    anything.  Just small stuff.

                                  JANE
                    I ll keep an eye out.

                                  NONA
                    I gotta get to school.  I like your 
                    scarf.

                                  JANE
                    Thanks.  See you later.

  Jane watches Nona disappear down the hall toward the elevator. 

  INT. THE DRAKE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

  Another floor.  Jane enters through the stairwell and continues 
  her survey of the hallway.

  She crosses paths with HANNAH FLETCHER (39, divorced, attractive 
  and cool, works as a magazine editor) and her son, TOMMY (8), as 
  they leave their apartment with briefcase and backpack.                                                                                    24.


                                  HANNAH
                    Oh hi, you must be Jane.  

                                  JANE
                    My first day and people already know 
                    who I am.

  Tommy runs ahead to the elevator, while Hannah pauses to speak 
  with Jane.

                                  HANNAH
                    Gavin emailed the residents last night.  
                    I m Hannah.  That crazy kid is Tommy.

                                  JANE
                    Nice to meet you, Hannah.

                        HANNAH*TOMMY
      It s a great building.  Lotta 
      nice people ---- Come on, Mom.

                                  HANNAH
                    We re late, I gotta run.  Welcome.

  Hannah hurries to the waiting elevator...

  INT. THE DRAKE - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

  Hannah steps on with Tommy and the doors close.  Already in the 
  elevator is another resident, DR. SCOTT CORWIN (42, a charming 
  but driven surgeon).  Hannah s surprised to see him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Hannah.  Hey.

                                  HANNAH
                    Dr. Scott.  Where have you been hiding?

                                  SCOTT
                    Out west.  Sort of a work thing. 

                                  HANNAH
                          (teasing)
                    A work thing out west.  Sounds...vague.

  The elevator suddenly STOPS between floors. 

                                  SCOTT
                    This can t be good.

                                  TOMMY
                    Mom?  Are we gonna die?                                                                                    25.


                                  HANNAH
                    We re going to be fine, Tommy.  They 
                    keep saying they re going to fix this 
                    thing...

                                  SCOTT
                          (flirting with her)
                    Should I climb through the roof and 
                    shimmy up the cable to get some help?

                                  HANNAH
                          (smiles)
                    You d do that for us?

                                  SCOTT
                    I would, yes.

                                  TOMMY
                    You should definitely do that.

                                  HANNAH
                    How about you use the emergency phone.

                                  SCOTT
                    That works too.

  Scott opens up the door panel and picks up the elevator phone.  
  A beat, then --

                                  SCOTT (INTO PHONE)
                    Hello?  Tony?  Yeah, we re stuck...  
                    Okay... Thanks.

  Scott hangs up the phone.

                                  SCOTT
                    Our dutiful Doorman is working on it as 
                    we speak.  Something about restarting 
                    the system.  He sounded like he knew 
                    what he was doing.

                                  HANNAH
                    Well it s nice to have company.

                                  SCOTT
                    Nice to have your company.

  Hannah likes that he s flirting with her.  A beat, then the 
  elevator starts up again.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Guess we re saved.

  Hannah covers her disappointment.                                                                                    26.


  EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER

  Hannah and Tommy walk up the street.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Dr. Scott likes you, Mom.  I can tell.

                                  HANNAH
                    What do you know?  You re eight.

  But we sense that Hannah hopes he s right.  She playfully ushers 
  Tommy along.

  INT. THE DRAKE - HALLWAY/BARLOW S APARTMENT - DAY

  Jane examines a strange STAIN on the wallpaper in the hall.  She 
  makes a note on her clipboard... And that s when she notices -- 
  she s standing at the door of APARTMENT 8B.

  Jane hesitates, then KNOCKS on the door.  A long beat, then JOHN 
  BARLOW opens the door.  He looks at Jane with suspicion at 
  first, then covers with a polite smile.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Yes?

                                  JANE
                    I just wanted to see if you were okay.  
                    Your hand...

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    I m fine, thanks...

  Barlow shows Jane a large BANDAGE he has around his hand.  

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    ...Like I said, I cut myself on some 
                    glass.  It s nothing --

                                  JANE
                    Good.  I was concerned.  

  Jane clocks a nervous look in Barlow s eyes.  Is he hiding 
    something?

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                      I appreciate you checking on me, but 
                    I m fine.  Have a good day.

  Barlow closes the door.  Jane stands there for a beat -- that 
  was strange.  Jane moves off --                                                                                    27.


  INT. THE DRAKE - BASEMENT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

  Dim and creepy, with old clutter.  A massive STEEL BOILER fills 
  one corner.  Washers and dryers sit against the opposite wall.  
  A large BULLETIN BOARD hangs nearby, covered with fliers and 
  notices.  Several mention personal items that have gone missing 
  or been stolen by the elusive building thief: a zippo lighter, 
  bifocals, a charm bracelet, a wristwatch.

  Jane enters with a carton of new lightbulbs.  She finds an old 
  LADDER against the wall and sets it up.  She selects a lightbulb 
  and climbs the rickety ladder as it shakes with her weight.  She 
  unscrews the bulb, plunging the room into DARKNESS.  Suddenly, a  
  NOISE from the shadows STARTLES her --  

                                  JANE
                    Hello...?  Who s there...?

  No response.  She quickly screws in the new bulb, illuminating 
  the room with a stark bright light.  Behind her --

    A ghostly-pale WOMAN in a long white nightgown, hair frayed and 
  unkempt, stands in the middle of the room.  Jane doesn t see 
  her, but WE DO, and it scares the shit out of us!!

  As Jane climbs down from the ladder --

                                  JANE
                          (to herself)
                    Henry s doing the laundry.

  When she turns around, the ghostly-pale woman is now GONE...

  Jane moves to fold up the ladder, when something about the floor 
  catches her eye.  She kneels down to examine some of the small 
    multi-colored FLOOR TILES that are cracked and loose.  She pulls 
  up old linoleum to expose more of the tiles, then quickly climbs 
  back up the ladder --

  HIGH ANGLE -- only now (in the bright light) does she notice the 
  HUGE MOSAIC TILE DESIGN set in the floor beneath her.  It s 
  crumbling and largely concealed by boxes, but we can make out 
  the dark lines of a DRAGON S FACE -- the same ARCHAIC SYMBOL 
  Malcolm found on the card (in teaser).

                                  JANE
                    ...Oh my God...

  Jane looks thrilled by her discovery.  Off the dragon mosaic --

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Coming home from work, Henry drops his briefcase and jacket on 
  the table.  Sifts through mail.                                                                                      28.


                                  HENRY
                    Jane?

  No answer.  Henry heads down the hall, to --

  THE BATHROOM -- where he finds Jane taking a bubblebath.  

                                  HENRY
                    Hey.  

                                  JANE
                    Wanna hop in?

  Henry begins to undress.

                                  HENRY
                    I ran into Gavin in the lobby.  He 
                    invited me to play golf in the morning.

                                  JANE
                    Sure, go play, I don t care.  

                                  HENRY
                    Really?  I don t have to beg a little?

                                  JANE
                    This time, no.  Because guess what?  I 
                    found something really cool in the 
                    basement today.

                                  HENRY
                          (wry)
                    Dripping with blood I hope.

  Henry climbs into the tub and sinks down into the water.

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, I saw Barlow again, he did cut 
                    his hand.  Don t you dare say a word 
                    about it.

  Henry smiles as he lifts her foot out of the water and begins 
  massaging it.

                                  HENRY
                    So what s this cool thing you found?

                                  JANE
                    A mosaic in the floor.  It s cracked 
                    and dirty and covered with clutter and 
                    old linoleum.  Obviously nobody s seen 
                    it in years.  It s some kind of symbol.  
                    It almost looks like a dragon.                                                                                      29.


                                  HENRY
                    Original to the building?

                                  JANE
                     Drake  means dragon, so it s a good 
                    bet.  It wasn t unusual for architects 
                    of that time to choose a motif.

                                  HENRY
                    Why put it down there?

                                  JANE
                    Depends on what that room was used for 
                    back then.  In 1923, who knows?  

                                  HENRY
                    You should tell Gavin.

                                  JANE
                    He kinda shut me down when I offered to 
                    help with the renovation.  I get the 
                    sense he thinks I m out of my depth.

                                  HENRY
                    So you re going to prove to him that 
                    you re not?

                                  JANE
                    Maybe.  There are things about the 
                    Drake that have been forgotten for 
                    years.  Maybe I can convince him to 
                    preserve some of it and not rip the 
                    heart and soul out of this place.  

  Henry studies her for a moment.  She s serious.

                                  HENRY
                    Just don t get fired for being nosy.  I 
                    like this apartment.

  Off Jane, with a smile --

  INT. THE DRAKE - BARLOW S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINE --  JUDGE SLAIN, killer on the 
  loose ...  

  WIDEN -- Barlow sits alone at his kitchen table, the New York 
  Post spread out on the table before him.  It s midnight.  Quiet.  
  He grows more emotional as he reads, unconsciously rubbing the 
  reddish STAIN on the palm of his hand.  His reaction to it 
  suggests his own guilt.  Tormenting him inside.  Suddenly --                                                                                    30.


  The phone RINGS.  Barlow looks at it with apprehension -- who d 
  be calling him at this time of night?  He picks up.  We hear the 
  familiar LOW VOICE of Gavin Doran.

                                  GAVIN DORAN (OVER PHONE)
                    How you doing, John?

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    It s in all the papers.  They re 
                    looking for me... His blood on my 
                      hand...won t wash off --

                                  GAVIN DORAN (OVER PHONE)
                    We made a deal.  You kept your end, I 
                    kept mine...
                          (beat)
                    Check the bedroom.

  CLICK.  Gavin disconnects.  Barlow hangs up the phone.  A beat, 
  then he hears a NOISE in the bedroom.  Footsteps?  He rises, 
  moves down the hall to investigate.  He enters --

  THE BEDROOM -- but what he sees in here STOPS him at the door.  
  He can t believe it.

  BARLOW S POV -- it s the GHOSTLY-PALE WOMAN we saw in the 
  laundry room before.  She sits on the bed, her back to him.  

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                      ...Hello...?

  She slowly turns to him -- and the moment she does, she CHANGES -
  - her wiry hair is suddenly auburn and full, her sallow skin now 
  flush, her eyes have a light behind them.  It s his wife, MARY 
  BARLOW, 35, beautiful, ALIVE.  

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Mary...?

  Barlow steps towards her.  Tentative.  Fearing she ll leave him 
  again.  She reaches out to him.  He touches her, pulls her to 
  him.  Both of them tearful as they embrace.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    ...You came back to me...

  Barlow holds his wife in his arms, an emotional and spooky 
  reunion.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    31.


                                      ACT THREE

  EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - GOLF COURSE - WESTCHESTER, NY - MORNING

  THWACK!!  Henry hits a perfect drive straight down the fairway.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    That s a serious swing.  

                                  HENRY
                    I put myself through law school working 
                    as a caddy, found some time to work on 
                    my game.  But I played mostly municipal 
                    courses.  Nothing this nice.

  Gavin steps up to the tee and sets his ball down.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Ever play for money?

                                  HENRY
                    I ve never been much of a gambler.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    But you moved to New York, got a job in 
                    the Mayor s office.  That s ambitious.  
                    With ambition, there s risk.  

                                  HENRY
                    So I m gambling with my life?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                          (with a smile)
                    Always.

  Gavin lines up, then confidently SWINGS the iron -- THWACK!  

                                  HENRY
                    Nice hit.

  Gavin s confident look -- of course it was.  Off this --

  INT. THE DRAKE - BASEMENT LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

  Washers and dryers churn in steady rhythm.  Nearby, Jane sets up 
  the ladder on the edge of the tile.  She hauls some of the 
  clutter out of the way to expose more of the mosaic. 

  She pulls out her iPHONE, takes a photo, then climbs the ladder.

  HIGH ANGLE -- Jane stands precariously on the top step, almost 
  losing her balance as she holds the iPhone and snaps a couple 
  photos.  But the mosaic is still obscured by clutter.                                                                                    32.


  Jane climbs back down the ladder and begins dragging boxes out 
  of the way, revealing more detail of the tile design.  

  A TALL STACK OF OLD NEWSPAPERS proves more challenging to move. 
  She picks up a few at a time.  Restacks them out of the way.  As 
  she lifts another few papers, the exposed HEADLINE stops her --

  CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINE:  BELLEVUE SUICIDE .  A PHOTO 
  taken at the scene shows a ghostly-pale woman in a white dress 
  standing on the edge of the hospital roof, about to jump.  The 
  name in the photo caption: MARY BARLOW.

  Jane reacts -- John Barlow s wife, Mary.  She killed herself.

  She studies the INSET PHOTO OF MARY, in happier times, a lovely 
  woman with beautiful auburn hair (the same woman who appeared in 
  Barlow s bedroom).  Jane skims the article --

                                  JANE
                          (reading to herself)
                      ...involuntarily committed...

  How did she wind up in a mental hospital?  Why did she commit 
  suicide?  Jane s phone RINGS, startling her.  She answers --

                                  JANE (INTO PHONE)
                    Hello?  Hi, Tony... No, the phone 
                    startled me, that s all... She is?  
                    Okay, I ll be right up...

  Jane hangs up the phone.  Sets the newspaper aside.  As she 
  moves off --

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

  Jane enters to find OLIVIA DORAN already waiting in the 
    apartment.  Olivia s elegantly dressed (as always) with her 
  purse and jacket hung over her arm.

                                  JANE
                    Olivia?  What a surprise.

                                  OLIVIA
                    The door was open.

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  I thought I locked it.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Let s go, I m taking you dress 
                    shopping.  Get cleaned up, you re 
                    filthy.  And change your shoes.  
                    Something with heels --                                                                                    33.


                                  JANE
                    I was going to go shopping later...

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    I m taking you someplace special, Jane.  
                    Hurry, I only have the morning...

  Olivia pushes Jane along to get ready.

  EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - GOLF COURSE - WESTCHESTER, NY - DAY

  Gavin and Henry walk up to the putting green of the 11th hole.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I bought the place in 1977, and it s 
                    doubled in value what, a dozen times?  
                    It was my first property.  I was still 
                    Resident Manager then.  

                                  HENRY
                      Impressive.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Not bad for a college dropout, eh?  

  As Gavin takes a knee behind the ball, surveying the green --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    The entire city was going to Hell back 
                    then.  Lotta crime.  Riots.  But real 
                    estate was relatively cheap.  The place 
                    was falling apart from neglect, but I 
                    could see it was a remarkable building. 
                    It just needed some attention.  

  Gavin lines up his putt.  He smoothly hits the ball, an arcing 
  shot that rolls toward the hole.  And drops in.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    The Drake s come a long way since then.  
                    But then, so have I.

                                  HENRY
                    Three for birdie.  Well done.

  Henry crouches behind his ball, eyeballing the shot.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI (O.S.)
                    Five hundred bucks says he misses.

  They turn to see DANIEL CAVANI, 40s, walking over from the 
  adjacent hole.  Cavani s a bulldog in pink golf shirt and 
  pressed khakis.  He shakes hands with Gavin, but we get the 
  sense these two men are NOT friends.                                                                                    34.


                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    You slice your shot over this far?  You 
                    know the club offers lessons --

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    I want to talk to you about my 
                      waterfront project.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Daniel Cavani meet Henry Martin, a 
                    friend of mine.  

  CAMERA POV -- a long lens finds focus as Henry and Cavani shake 
  hands.  CLICK CLICK.  Henry s unaware, but as Gavin looks 
  straight at the camera, it s clear he arranged the photo op.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    Nice to meet you, Henry.  

  REVERSE ANGLE -- we FIND Gavin s assistant YURI standing in the 
  treeline with a long telephoto lens, snapping PHOTOS of Henry s 
   meeting  with Cavani.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    I hear you tried to offer 30 mill in a 
                    short sale with the bank.  The real 
                    estate alone s worth twice that.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    It s not my fault you can t refi your 
                    loan, Danny boy.  You re in a pinch, I 
                    was just trying to help.

  Cavani pulls Gavin out of earshot of Henry.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    I don t need your help, Gavin.  I need 
                    you to back off and let me work it out.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Work what out?  I hear the city s not 
                    budging on the environmental regs and 
                    now you re three months behind.  Looks 
                    to me like you re over-leveraged and 
                    hanging on by your fingertips.  Now, 
                    you want a lifeline?  I ll go 40 mill 
                    and you get to keep your shirt.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    I d rather go bankrupt than sell to 
                    you.

  Cavani turns to leave.  As he walks past Henry --                                                                                    35.


                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    You seem like a nice kid, Henry.  You 
                    should keep better company.

  Cavani moves off.  Worried, Henry turns to Gavin --

                                  HENRY
                    I m sorry.  Was he just talking about 
                    the Greenpoint Towers complex?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    In Brooklyn.  You know it?

                                  HENRY
                    Gavin, I work for City Planning.  We re 
                    in a legal dispute over that property 
                    right now.  It s highly improper, 
                    possibly even illegal, for me to have 
                    any contact with Mr. Cavani.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I didn t realize that, I m sorry.  I 
                    don t want to get you in trouble...  

                                  HENRY
                    It s alright, don t worry about it.  
                    You didn t know.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    It s your putt.

  As Gavin covers his smile --  

  EXT. DESIGNER BOUTIQUE - SOHO - DAY

  The Doran s limousine is parked out front.  A driver leans on 
  the hood reading the paper.

  INT. DESIGNER BOUTIQUE - DAY

  Jane poses in front of a mirror as a TAILOR takes her 
    measurements.  A SALESWOMAN holds different dresses up to her.  
  Jane can t help but smile, relishing the fantasy of it all.  
  Olivia stands nearby, evaluating.   

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    She ll try on the two Chanels.  And the 
                    blue strapless one as well.
                          (to Jane)
                    Any others you like, Jane?

                                  JANE
                    They re all so beautiful, I don t know.                                                                                    36.


  Jane points to a stunning RED DRESS.  

                                  JANE
                    I like the red one.

                                  SALESWOMAN
                    The Lanvin.  It s the best one here.  

  Olivia stares at the red dress for a beat, then --

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    That was Sasha s favorite color.  My 
                      daughter...

                                  JANE
                    I didn t know you had a daughter.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    She died a long time ago.

  Olivia reflexively TEARS UP.  She does her best to cover.

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry.  I didn t know.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Sorry, it snuck up on me.

                                  JANE
                    I don t need to try on the red one --

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Don t be silly.  See how it looks.  I 
                    insist.

  Olivia wipes an errant tear away, embarrassed.  Off this, we 
  TIME CUT TO:

  THE DRESSING ROOM -- Jane stands in her bra and underwear in 
  front of the mirror.  She holds the red dress up to her -- God, 
  it s gorgeous.  But then she checks the pricetag --

  CLOSE ON THE PRICETAG -- $4,000.  Holy shit.

  Jane quickly pulls on her clothes and walks out of the dressing 
  room.  She finds Olivia perched in a linen slipper chair.

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry, Olivia, but these cost way 
                    too much.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Oh please.  I m buying the dress for 
                    you.  You like the red one, right?                                                                                    37.


                                  JANE
                    No, Olivia, really.  It costs more than 
                    my car.  I can t...

  Olivia processes this for a moment.  She s not happy.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Well then.  I guess I ll let you find 
                    something more to your liking.

                                  JANE
                    Please don t take offense --

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Why would I?
                          (looks at her watch)
                    I m going to be late for my 
                      appointment.  You ll get yourself back 
                    to the Drake?

  Jane nods.  Olivia picks up her things and walks out of the 
  boutique.  Jane trades an embarrassed look with the saleswoman.

  INT. THE DRAKE - BARLOW S APARTMENT - DAY

  Bright sunlight shines through open windows, glaring off stark 
  white sheets, under which John and Mary Barlow make desperate 
  love to each other... Off this, we TIME CUT TO:

  LATER -- John wakes up to a NOISE in the bathroom.  He sees that 
  the door s closed.  Mary isn t in bed anymore.  He pulls on his 
  shorts and gets up.  He KNOCKS on the bathroom door.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Honey?  Are you alright?
                          (no answer)
                    Hon?  I m gonna come in, okay?

  John opens the bathroom door.  He finds Mary sitting on the edge 
  of the tub, distraught.  She holds two PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLES 
  in her hands.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Mary...?  What are you doing?

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    My name s on these prescriptions.  
                      Stelazine?  Fluoxetine?  I can t 
                    remember what they re for...

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    They re old.  You shouldn t take them 
                    anymore.                                                                                    38.


                                  MARY BARLOW
                    I saw my name on these and realized, I 
                    can only remember...pieces of who I am.  
                    I know this is our apartment.  I know 
                    that you love me.  But there s so much 
                    that s not there...
                          (a beat, then)
                    Why can t I remember...?

  John doesn t know how to respond.  Mary suddenly EXPLODES with 
  rage, throwing the pill bottles to the floor, pills spilling 
    everywhere... She charges, beating her fists against his chest.

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    Why can t I remember anything, John?!!

  John grabs her wrists and holds her, calming her down.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Y-You-- You were sick.  Very sick.  It 
                    damaged some of your memory.  
                          (beat)
                    You were in the hospital.  But...now 
                    you re home again.  With me.  Okay?  

                                  MARY BARLOW
                          (calming down)
                    ...Okay.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    All that matters is we re together 
                    again.

  John pulls her close and tenderly kisses her.  Off Mary, a lost 
  look in her eyes --

                                  HANNAH (PRE-LAP)
                    You look lost...

  EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

  Jane stands on a busy corner looking at a pocket map of the 
  city.  She s surprised to see Hannah Fletcher approaching.  

                                  JANE
                      Hannah...?

                                  HANNAH
                    I work around the corner.  What are you 
                    doing here?                                                                                    39.


                                  JANE
                    Trying to find the public library.
                          (off her map)
                    Does the Six Express stop near there?

                                  HANNAH
                    Only if the library moved to the Bronx.  
                    You can take the B train and get off at 
                    42nd street.  It s only couple blocks 
                    from there.

                                  JANE
                    I m glad I ran into you.

                                  HANNAH
                    I don t know if you re busy, but you 
                    wanna grab lunch?

  INT. SOHO CAFE - DAY

  Lunch dishes are cleared as Jane and Hannah talk.

                                  JANE
                      ...Someone s supposed to fix it today.  
                    God, I d freak out if I got stuck in 
                    the elevator.

                                  HANNAH
                    It wasn t that bad.  I had Dr. Scott 
                    Corwin keeping me company.  

                                  JANE
                    Dr. Corwin, I haven t met him yet.  
                    He s --

                                  HANNAH
                    -- Gorgeous --  

                                  JANE
                          (smiles)
                    -- a resident of the Drake, I was going 
                    to say.

                                  HANNAH
                    Sorry.  He s up on nine.  We flirt in 
                    the elevator now and then.  

                                  JANE
                    He s never asked you out?

                                  HANNAH
                    Well, I have a long history of hooking 
                    up with bad boys.  Case in point: 
                    Tommy s father.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  HANNAH (CONT'D)
                    So I m trying to listen to that little 
                    voice inside my head that says  slow 
                    down .  Get to know him a little bit 
                    better first.

                                  JANE
                      I understand.  

                                  HANNAH
                    I m dating someone now.  Not a bad boy, 
                    for sure.  His name s Adam.  He s nice.  
                      Successful.  Stable.  He likes Tommy...  

                                  JANE
                    There s a  but ?

                                  HANNAH
                    Let s just say nobody ever fell head 
                    over heels in boredom.
                          (off Jane s smile)
                    I m kidding, he s a nice guy.  A good 
                    example for Tommy.  He needs that.
                          (beat)
                    What are you and Henry doing tonight?

                                  JANE
                    The Dorans are taking us out to some 
                    black tie function at Lincoln Center. 

                                  HANNAH
                    Wow.  Fancy.

                                  JANE
                      I actually went dress shopping this 
                    morning with Olivia.

                                  HANNAH
                    God, she s intimidating, isn t she?  I 
                    see her now and then in the building.  
                    She doesn t really socialize with the 
                    first twelve floors.  

                                  JANE
                    I was trying on dresses.  Out of the 
                    blue, she mentioned her dead daughter 
                    and got really emotional.  I felt 
                    terrible, but it was... weird.

                                  HANNAH
                    I think it was about ten years ago.  
                    Olivia s daughter steered her Porsche 
                    into head-on traffic.                                                                                    41.


                                  JANE
                    Oh my God.  She didn t tell me...

                                  HANNAH
                    They say she was trapped alive in the 
                    car while it burned...

  Off Jane, stunned --

  INT. THE DRAKE - LOBBY - DAY

  Tony the Doorman opens the door for Brian as he carries in two 
  large bags of GROCERIES.  He finds a REPAIRMAN working on the 
    elevators.  

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                      I apologize, Mr. Leonard.  Your 
                    timing s real bad.  We had to shut all 
                    the breakers off to work on them. 

                                  BRIAN
                    They re all out of order?

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                          (to Repairman)
                    How much longer?

                                  REPAIRMAN
                    About forty-five minutes.

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    Sorry, Mr. Leonard.  You re gonna have 
                    to take the stairs.

                                  BRIAN
                    Six flights?  You gotta be kidding me.  

  Pissed, Brian lugs his grocery bags and pushes through the door 
  marked  STAIRWELL  and heads upstairs.  The door SHUTS --

                                  REPAIRMAN
                    The freight elevator s still working. 

                                  TONY THE DOORMAN
                    Yeah, you mentioned that earlier.

  They both begin to chuckle.

  INT. THE DRAKE - BRIAN S APARTMENT - DAY

  Brian enters, sweaty from climbing six flights, and drags the 
  grocery bags into the kitchen.  As he pulls the cartons of 
  soymilk out of the bag and puts them in the fridge --                                                                                      42.


                                  BRIAN
                    I want it entered into the record, Lou, 
                    that I just climbed six flights so your 
                    soymilk wouldn t spoil.

  Louise calls back from the other room.

                                  LOUISE (O.S.)
                    Soymilk doesn t spoil, honey.

                                  BRIAN
                    Oh.  Good to know.

                                  LOUISE (O.S.)
                    The freight elevator s still working, 
                    by the way.

  Brian realizes that Tony was fucking with him.

                                  BRIAN
                    Tony doesn t like me, does he?  

                                  LOUISE (O.S.)
                    Brian, come here.  I want you to meet 
                    my new assistant.

                                  BRIAN
                    You found someone?  See?  I knew you 
                    would.

  Brian closes the fridge and heads into --

  THE LIVING ROOM -- 

  Brian enters and finds himself face-to-face with the young WOMAN 
  from the other building, the same girl he s been spying on.  Her 
  name s ALEXIS BLUME, 26.  

                                  LOUISE
                    This is Alexis.  An editor I know at 
                    Elle hooked us up.  And can you believe 
                    it, she lives in the neighborhood.

  Brian covers his shock as they shake hands.  Alexis betrays no 
  recognition of him.  

                                  ALEXIS
                    Nice to meet you, Brian.

  Off Brian, utterly FUCKSTRUCK.  

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    43.

  EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - 5TH AVE & 42ND - DAY

  Stone lions kneel before the high columns of the majestic 
  building.  Jane makes her way up the wide steps and enters.

  INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - MAIN READING ROOM - DAY

  Jane pores over a stack of reference books on architecture and 
  New York history, tracking obscure names and dates, identifying 
  turn of the century projects long forgotten.  As she scrawls 
  notes in a small moleskin notebook...we CUT TO:

  BALCONY / UPPER BOOKSHELVES -- Jane runs her finger along the 
  spines of books until she finds the volume she wants.  She makes 
  a quick check of the index for the page number, then quickly 
  flips through the book... What she finds STARTLES her --

  CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH -- SIX MEN in ceremonial robes pose 
  stiffly for the photo, stone-faced, sitting on chairs arranged 
  around the DRAGON MOSAIC from the basement of the Drake.

                                  JANE
                          (reading to herself)
                    ... Order of the Dragon , 1927...

  Then something else in the photograph draws Jane s attention 
  closer -- clearly seen behind the six men is a SMALL DOOR.

                                  JANE
                    No way...

  Off Jane, intrigued --

  EXT. CITY STREET - UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

  John and Mary Barlow walk down the street holding hands.  Mary 
  suddenly stops, looking ahead --

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    That cafe.  I ve been there before.

  Mary stares at a small cafe on the corner. 

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    It s where we had our second date.  Do 
                    you remember?

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    I think so... You kissed me over 
                      dessert... You were nervous...                                                                                    44.


                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    I was a wreck.

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    You said you loved me... And I could 
                    see it in your eyes... No one had ever 
                    looked at me that way before...

  Barlow nods.  But then a dark cloud descends over her.  She 
  looks scared.  He pulls her close. 

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    What s wrong?

  Then -- a trickle of BLOOD falls from her nose.  Barlow notices 
  it.  Mary touches her nose.  Sees the blood on her fingers.  

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    I feel cold, John --

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Let me take you home --

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    What s happening to me?

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Mr. Doran will know what to do...

  As they walk away, RACK FOCUS to the REFLECTION in the store-
  front window -- Mary is nowhere to be seen.  Barlow is ALONE.  

  Over this startling reveal, we PRE-LAP:

                     The mind is its own place, and in 
                    itself can make a Heaven of Hell, or a 
                    Hell of Heaven.   

  INT. THE DRAKE - BARLOW S APARTMENT - DAY

  Barlow stands in the doorway to his bedroom, PHONE to his ear, 
  looking in at Mary asleep in bed.  She looks pale and weak.

                                  GAVIN DORAN (OVER PHONE)
                    Ever read Paradise Lost, John?

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Please-- I can t lose her again...

                                  GAVIN DORAN (OVER PHONE)
                    You know there s only one way to cheat 
                    death.                                                                                    45.


                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    I have to...hurt someone else?  
                          (beat)
                    You only said one --

                                  GAVIN DORAN (OVER PHONE)
                    -- and now I m saying another. 
                          (beat)
                    You re only renting this life, my 
                    friend.  Make the payment or she s not 
                    long for this world.  Neither are you.

  That LANDS on Barlow.  He looks at the reddish-stain still on 
  his hand.  Dear God, what has he gotten himself into?

                                  GAVIN DORAN (OVER PHONE)
                    Make a Heaven of your Hell, John, and 
                    you and Mary can be together forever.
                          (beat)
                    Look for an envelope under your door.

  Barlow holds the phone, stunned.

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - DAY

  Jane enters the apartment with a shopping bag.  She finds Henry 
  working on his laptop at the dining table, work-related files 
  piled in front of him.  

                                  HENRY
                    Hey.  How was shopping?

  Jane pulls a simple BLACK DRESS out of the bag and holds it up.  
  It s a rather uninspired piece of fashion.

                                  JANE
                    It was cheap.  Does it look cheap?

                                  HENRY
                    No, it looks nice.

                                  JANE
                    You re a lousy liar.  
                          (beat)
                    This is what I want to show you.  I did 
                    some research at the library today...  

  She digs in the bag and pulls out a PHOTOCOPY of the  Order of 
  the Dragon  photo.  She sets it in front of Henry.

                                  JANE
                    ...It s from 1927... They were a 
                    fraternal brotherhood called the  Order 
                    of the Dragon .                                                                                     46.


                                  HENRY
                    Nice robes.

                                  JANE
                    Funny.  Look a little closer.  At the 
                    floor.  That s right here in this 
                    building, Henry.

  Henry studies the photo closely for a beat -- so it is.

                                  HENRY
                    Okay, cool.  So the basement was their 
                    man-cave.

                                  JANE
                    I m serious.  Look behind them.  
                    There s a door there, right?  Compare 
                    that to this...

  Jane pulls out her iPhone and scrolls through the photos she 
  took of the mosaic in the basement.  She shows one to Henry --

                                  JANE
                    I took this photo yesterday.

  CLOSE ON THE iPHONE -- a wide angle of the mosaic frames the 
  room clearly -- we see that the door is no longer there.

                                  HENRY
                          (off iPhone)
                    No door?

                                  JANE
                    It s a solid concrete wall.  

                                  HENRY
                    Sealed up?  Why?

                                  JANE
                    I m wondering that myself.

  Henry studies the old photograph for a beat.  Jane picks up her 
  iPhone and checks the time -- oh shit.

                                  JANE
                    Ohmygod, why didn t you tell me what 
                    time it is?  I ve only got thirty 
                    minutes to get ready!  I gotta take a 
                    shower -- 

  Jane heads for the bedroom.  We FOLLOW Jane --                                                                                    47.


                                  HENRY
                          (calling after her)
                    Hey, a package arrived for you while 
                    you were out.  It s on the bed.

  She enters --

  THE BEDROOM -- to find a beautiful designer GIFT BOX sitting on 
  the bed.  Jane finds a NOTE tucked under the silver ribbon.  
  Opens it.

  CLOSE ON THE NOTE -- Handwritten in perfect cursive.  I m not 
  good at taking no for an answer.  xo Olivia  

  Jane opens the box to discover the RED DRESS she tried on at the 
  boutique.  The four thousand dollar red dress.  Jane s stunned.  

                                  JANE
                    Oh boy.

  But as she lifts it out of the box, a small smile on her lips 
  suggests a secret wish has just been fulfilled.  Off this --

  INT. THE DRAKE - LOBBY - NIGHT

  Gavin and Olivia wait near the lobby door, formally dressed for 
  their evening out.  As the elevator doors open... 

  THE MOMENT SLOWS -- Henry steps off the elevator first, looking 
  sharp in his tux.  He turns and holds the door for his date -- 
  Jane looks absolutely STUNNING in her new dress.  She steps out, 
  brushing her hair over her shoulder.  Take your breath away.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Well done, my dear.

  As Henry and Jane join Gavin and Olivia --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                          (to Jane)
                    You look absolutely lovely.

                                  JANE
                          (re: dress)
                    Thank you so much, Olivia.  I don t 
                    know what to say...

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    I think that dress says it all.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Shall we go?                                                                                    48.


  Tony opens the lobby door for them, staring at Jane as she 
  passes.  The Doran s limousine waits at the curb.  As Yuri opens 
  the car s rear door for the couples --

  INT. LINCOLN CENTER - PATRONS CIRCLE - COCKTAIL PARTY - NIGHT

  Elegant reverie.  Members of New York high society stand 
  mingling and drinking.  Gavin works the room with a smile, 
  introducing Henry to the city s rich and powerful.  As they grip 
  and grin with a distinguished OLDER GENTLEMAN --

                                  HENRY
                    ...Nice to meet you, sir.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                          (re: Henry)
                    I m telling you, Mike, the kid s a 
                    star.  He ll be moving into Gracie 
                    Mansion before he s forty.

                                  OLDER GENTLEMAN
                    I m sure if you have anything to do 
                    with it...

  As they share a laugh, we TIME CUT TO:

  LATER -- Jane talks with Olivia.  The drama at the dress store 
  behind them, they re having a good time.

                                  JANE
                    -- Absolutely not!  He didn t need to 
                    cheat in law school --

  As Henry joins them, with a fresh cocktail for Jane --

                                  HENRY
                    Despite her distracting beauty, Jane 
                    knew how to motivate me to study.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    She withheld sex.

  Jane and Henry laugh, embarrassed.  Exactly.

                                  JANE
                    Don t you dare tell her what I gave you 
                    for an A.

  Gavin returns to pull Olivia away.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I just need Liv for a moment, excuse 
                    us...                                                                                    49.


  Gavin and Olivia move off to talk to a wealthy couple.  

                                  HENRY
                    I hate to say it, but I could get used 
                    to this...

                                  JANE
                    Enjoy the fantasy while it lasts.  We 
                    turn back into pumpkins at midnight.

  As they CLINK glasses --

  INT. THE DRAKE - HANNAH S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Tommy and Nona (his babysitter) play cards on the floor.  

                                  TOMMY
                    You re looking at my cards!

                                  NONA
                    I m good at guessing, Tommy.

                                  TOMMY
                    You haven t had to Go Fish once.

  KNOCKKNOCK.  As Tommy tosses his cards down and gets up to 
  answer the door -- 

                                  TOMMY
                    I m not playing anymore.

  Tommy opens the door to find ADAM DELANEY (40s, a clean-cut 
  corporate lawyer, still in a suit).  

                                  ADAM
                    Hey Tommy -- 

                                  TOMMY
                          (calls out)
                    Mom?  Adam s here!

  Hannah walks out of the bedroom, looking hot and gorgeous in a 
  slinky dress.  One thing s very obvious: she s much cooler than 
  he is.  Adam greets her with a small kiss.  

                                  ADAM
                    Wow, you look terrific.

                                  HANNAH
                    You re sweet.                                                                                      50.


                                  ADAM
                          (checks his watch)
                    Should we get going?  We can have a 
                    drink at the bar if we re early.

  Hannah gives Nona the rundown.

                                  HANNAH
                    Nona, please make sure Tommy brushes 
                    his teeth.  You have my cell phone.  
                    Emergency numbers are on the fridge.

                                  NONA
                    I got it, Ms. Fletcher.

                                  HANNAH
                    In bed by ten.  And no X-Box.

  Hannah kisses Tommy goodnight and heads out on her date.

  INT. THE DRAKE - LOBBY - NIGHT

  As the elevator doors open --  

                                  HANNAH
                    -- I m sure Tommy likes you fine.  Kids 
                    tend to be stand-offish.

                                  ADAM
                    Maybe I should take him to a Knicks 
                    game.

  Hannah steps out first, then Adam follows, when suddenly --

  The elevator doors suddenly SLAM SHUT, crushing Adam in the door 
  with a sickening CRUNCH!!  

  Adam SCREAMS in pain, his chest and leg PINNED, unable to pull 
  himself free, the elevator doors holding tightly closed.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Oh my God!!  Adam!!  
                          (calling out)
                    Somebody help!!  Tony!  Help!!

  DR. SCOTT enters the lobby, returning from work.  He hears 
  Hannah s shouts for help and rushes to the elevators.

                                  SCOTT
                          (to Hannah)
                    Call 911!

  Hannah rushes over to the front desk phone and dials 911.                                                                                    51.


                                  SCOTT
                    Hold on, let me get the door open --

  Scott strains to pull the doors open, but they won t budge.  
  Instead, they press HARDER on Adam s shoulder and chest, his 
  ribs CRACKING.  Adam swims in pain, now struggling to breathe.

  Scott grabs a FIRE-AXE from a glass case on a nearby wall.  He 
  rushes back to Adam -- he ll chop the doors open if he has to -- 
  but before he swings --

  DING!  Just like that, the doors OPEN.  Adam crumples to the 
  ground, unconscious, his body CRUSHED.  

  Scott tosses the axe aside and drops down next to Adam to 
  examine him.  As he does this --

  A LARGE ROLL OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS falls out of Scott s pocket 
  and hits the floor.  Easily ten grand there.  Why the hell s a 
  doctor carrying that much cash?

  Scott quickly sweeps up the money and tucks it in his jacket 
  pocket, just as Hannah runs back.  She didn t see the money.  

                                  HANNAH
                    The ambulance is on its way --

  Scott checks Adam s vitals.  Not good.

                                  SCOTT
                    Pulse is erratic.  He s going into 
                    arrest --

  Scott begins CPR chest compressions.

                                  SCOTT
                          (to Hannah)
                    Lose his tie, open the shirt.

  Hannah frantically pulls off Adam s clothing as Scott works.

                                  HANNAH
                    Oh God, Adam... Hold on...

  SIRENS can now be heard in the distance, getting closer.  Scott 
  continues CPR.  Off Hannah s shock --

  INT. LINCOLN CENTER - NIGHT - LATER

  The Philharmonic performs a compelling (TBD) classical CONCERTO.

  IN THE BALCONY -- Jane and Henry sit in the front seats of the 
  balcony, with Gavin and Lynne directly behind them.                                                                                      52.


  We PAN ACROSS their faces, the MUSIC hitting notes of mystery 
  and sorrow... Pain and hope... Of fear... They listen, rapt...

  The MUSIC SWELLS, as we CUT TO:

  INT. THE DRAKE - HANNAH S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  CONTINUE MUSIC.  Nona takes a last look at Tommy fully engrossed 
  in the X-Box, then quietly slips out the front door of the 
    apartment.  Tommy has no idea she s gone...

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  CONTINUE MUSIC.  The lock on the front door is turned.  The door 
  opens.  Using a stolen master key, Nona enters the dark 
    apartment.  Pads quietly through the living room...the 
    kitchen... She then moves into --

  THE BEDROOM -- Scanning the empty gift box and discarded tissue 
  paper... Her fingers brushing over Jane s jewelry on the 
    dresser... Henry s photo ID and badge... Finally settling on -- 

  Jane s SILK SCARF.  Nona picks it up and rubs the smooth fabric 
  between her fingers.  Then she does something odd -- she closes 
  her eyes and takes a deep breath... And suddenly, we --

  FLASH TO -- a rapid CASCADE of images of JANE -- in her car.  In 
  a hallway at the Drake.  At the window of her apartment.  With 
  Henry in bed...and then just as quickly --

  Nona shakes out of the vision, blinks it away.  We now 
    understand that this is what she can do -- she has a nascent 
   second sight  ability that allows her to see the future.

  Nona takes the scarf and quietly makes her exit...

  INT. THE DRAKE - BARLOW S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  A large manilla ENVELOPE slides under the door.  Barlow 
  retrieves it.  He opens the envelope with trepidation.

  CLOSE ON THE CONTENTS -- a MAP with a location circled.  A time 
  he s supposed to be there.  A name and PHOTO: of DANIEL CAVANI.

  Off Barlow --

  INT. THE DRAKE - BRIAN S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  CONTINUE MUSIC.  Brian works at his desk as Louise watches TV in 
  the other room.  His attention is drawn out the window to the 
  other building.  

  A LIGHT goes ON in Alexis  apartment.  The blinds are OPEN.  
  Brian steps off to the side of the window, out of view.                                                                                    53.


  BRIAN S POV -- watching as ALEXIS enters her apartment.  She 
  locks the door and dumps her bag on a side table.  She pulls off 
  her jacket, kicks off her shoes.  She begins to slowly 
    disrobe... First a belt, then a shirt, then her jeans... Then --

  Alexis turns to the window and looks straight back at Brian.  
  She knows he s watching her.  She SMILES seductively at him as 
  she pulls off the rest of her clothes.  

  He moves in front of the window, so she can see him.  He can t 
  tear his eyes away --

  EXT. MANHATTAN DOG PARK - NIGHT

  CONTINUE MUSIC.  Barlow stands alone in the shadows, trenchcoat 
  pulled tightly around him, hands thrust in his pockets, head 
  down in troubled thought.  Then, someone approaches --

  BARLOW S POV -- DANIEL CAVANI walks a small dog into the park. 

  And now we see -- Barlow holds a long KNIFE at his side, intent 
  on claiming the remedy to Mary s failing health... 

  Cavani gets closer, Barlow steels himself.  Then -- 

  Barlow BLITZES Cavani as he passes, knocking him to the ground.  
  Stunning him.  The dog begins frantically BARKING.  Barlow 
  raises the knife, about to stab -- and he FREEZES.  A sickened 
  look on his face.  He can t bring himself to do it... 

  Cavani scrambles away, SHOUTING for help, as Barlow breaks down 
  in tears.

  INT. THE DRAKE - BARLOW S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

  CONTINUE MUSIC.  Barlow enters to find Mary asleep in bed.  Her 
     sickness  has worsened.  He sits at her bedside, despondent...

  Mary puts her hand on top of his.  She opens rheumy eyes.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                          (a whisper)
                    I m sorry...I couldn t do it again.

  She drifts.  It s not clear she knows why he s apologizing.

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    ...It s okay...

  Then something catches John s eye, something he didn t notice 
  before.  His face falls.

  There s a SMALL ENVELOPE sitting on the nightstand.                                                                                      54.


  He picks it up.  Opens it.  Finds a NOTE inside.  Printed on the 
  note is that same small ARCHAIC DRAGON SYMBOL.  

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Oh God, what s going to happen to us?

  Off Barlow, we CUT BACK TO:

  INT. LINCOLN CENTER - THE BALCONY - NIGHT

  CONTINUE MUSIC, as it BUILDS.  The Philharmonic brings the 
  concert to a powerful and emotional CLIMAX...

  At that moment, Jane looks unsettled... Not by what she hears, 
  but by what she feels...  

  ANGLE -- CLOSE -- Gavin is there right behind her, his face 
  close, his breath on her bare neck.  It s an unnerving moment 
  for Jane.  Beat.  Finally -- She can t bear it any longer, she 
  turns around suddenly to look at him --

  But Gavin sits casually in his own seat behind them, perfectly 
  still as he watches the concert.  It d be impossible for him to 
  move that fast.  What the fuck?  

  A beat, then Gavin turns to look at Jane.  Their eyes meet.  His 
  mouth curves into a sly smile.

  Off Jane, disturbed --

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    55.


                                        ACT FIVE

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Henry helps Jane into the apartment.  She steadies herself 
  against the wall.  Henry covers a smile.

                                  HENRY
                    I think you ve just become the poster-
                    child for Upper East Side decadence.

                                  JANE
                      Apparently, the Patrons Circle likes 
                    their cocktails quite strong.  
                          (then)
                    Unzip my dress please?

  Henry unzips her dress.  She pulls it off right there, then 
  hangs it over a chair and stumbles down the hall in her bra and 
    underwear.  Henry follows her, into --

  THE BEDROOM -- Jane collapses on the bed, climbs under the 
  covers.  Henry lies down next to her.  Off her look --

                                  HENRY
                    What s wrong?

                                  JANE
                    During the concert.  I don t know... 
                    Gavin gave me this look...
                          (beat)
                    Do you get a weird vibe from him?

  Henry processes what she says for a moment, then --

                                  HENRY
                    You had a few drinks, you ve been 
                    really stressed lately.  Moving to New 
                    York, getting this job, moving in here 
                    and meeting the Dorans... Everything s 
                    just been really intense lately.  
                    Wonderful and amazing, too, but also 
                    maybe kinda overwhelming...

  Henry pulls Jane into his arms and holds her.

                                  JANE
                    Henry?  Are we gonna be okay here?

  Off Jane, unsettled --                                                                                    56.


  INT. THE DRAKE - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

  Gavin and Olivia step off the elevator, where they find Yuri 
  waiting with a large envelope.  Gavin takes the envelope --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Let s see what we ve got...

  He opens it, pulls out several 8x10 PHOTOS --

  CLOSE ON THE PHOTOS -- A series of shots showing Henry shaking 
  hands with Daniel Cavani on the golf course.  Oddly enough, 
  Gavin is nowhere to be seen in these photos, despite having 
  stood between the two men when Yuri took the pictures... 

    Satisfied, he hands the photos back to Yuri.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Stick them in the file, in case we need 
                    them later.
                          (beat)
                    I have some business to attend to, Liv.  
                    Back in a few.  

                                  OLIVIA
                    I ll be waiting.

  Olivia moves off towards the bedroom.  Gavin steps back onto the 
  elevator.  As the doors close, we TIME CUT TO: 

  THE BEDROOM -- Olivia emerges from the bathroom in her red 
  kimono.  She looks troubled, a dark cloud hanging over her.  She 
  sits at her VANITY MIRROR and stares at her reflection for a 
  moment.  Then she reaches into a lower drawer and pulls out a 
  FRAMED PICTURE.  Her eyes well with tears as she regards it --

  CLOSE ON THE PHOTO -- it shows Olivia laughing, obviously happy, 
  with her arm around a young woman about 25 years old, pretty 
  with dark hair, wearing a bright red blouse.  We may guess this 
  is her daughter, SASHA, the one who died.  But what s most 
    disturbing is her face: she looks exactly like JANE.  

  Olivia finally sets the picture on the vanity and moves off.

  When she does, the daughter s face SHIFTS before our eyes, 
  changing to look nothing like Jane at all...

  INT. THE DRAKE - BARLOW S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Barlow stirs from a deep sleep, reflexively reaching for Mary 
  next to him.  She s not here.  But someone else is -- 

  GAVIN DORAN sits on a chair at the foot of the bed.  We see the 
  bedroom door is BARRICADED with a dresser.                                                                                    57.


                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    How d you get in here?  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    You disappoint me, John.

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Where s Mary?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    She s going back where she belongs.
                          (beat)
                      I certainly expected more out of you.  
                    I guess this isn t going to work out.

  That LANDS on Barlow.  Is this the end?  He s suddenly scared.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    C mon John, how d you think this was 
                    gonna go?  

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    It s not right, what you do...

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    What I do is fulfill needs.  Make 
                    dreams come true.  Nothing wrong with 
                    that.  You wanted to be with your wife 
                    again, I made that happen.  I told you 
                    what to do to keep her here, but you 
                    didn t think the price was worth it.  
                    That s your choice.  It was a fair 
                    deal, while it lasted...  

  Gavin rises, replacing the chair against the nearby wall.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    ...Now it s time to settle up.

  The walls of the bedroom begin to VIBRATE.  Fleeting WHISPERS 
  emanate from the SHADOWS.  Dozens of hands, elbows, and faces 
  press against the wall from the inside like it was made of 
  rubber.  Barlow begins to PANIC.  What the fuck is happening?!

  Gavin pushes the dresser out of the way, opens the door, and 
  walks out of the room.  As he leaves --

  Barlow is suddenly lifted off the bed and thrown against the 
  wall, the hands inside the wall grabbing him, then slowly 
  pulling him into the building itself...

  As the Drake slowly  consumes  Barlow, his terrified SCREAMS 
  carry us into --                                                                                    58.


  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Jane suddenly SITS UP in the dark room.  Wide awake.  Scared.  
  She turns to Henry, who sleeps next to her.

                                  JANE
                    What was that?  Henry?  

  Henry barely stirs, sound asleep.  Jane climbs out of bed and 
  walks out of the bedroom --

  INT. THE DRAKE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

  Jane looks up and down the empty hall.  It s not clear what 
  she s doing out here or what she s looking for.  

                                  JANE
                      ...Hello...?

  No answer.  Suddenly -- a FIGURE WIPES FRAME.  

  Jane turns quickly -- but finds no one there.  Strange.  Jane 
  moves down the hall in her bare feet, towards the --

  INT. THE DRAKE - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

    Flickering lights cast an unsettling pall.  Jane pushes into the 
    stairwell, the door closing behind her.  Looks up and down 
  through the center of the staircase, but it s quiet.  No one 
  there.  She turns back to the door.  Finds it LOCKED.  Shit.

                                  JANE
                          (calling out)
                      Henry...?!  Somebody...?!

  No answer.  Jane takes a beat, which way to go -- up or down?  
  She heads DOWN the stairs, disappearing into the dim light...

  INT. THE DRAKE - BASEMENT LAUNDRY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

  The stairs lead her to the basement, which is eerily dim and 
  quiet.  Jane moves to the elevator and hits the call button.  
  The elevator can be heard groaning to life as it slowly descends 
  to the basement.  Jane waits anxiously... 

  But then she turns around and what she sees scares the fuck out 
  of her --

  The room has CHANGED.  The clutter and laundry machines are now 
  gone.  The DRAGON MOSAIC appears perfectly restored -- all the 
  tiles in place, not a crack to be seen.  

  Jane realizes -- the room looks the way it did in the old 
    photograph from 1927.  Which means something else as well --                                                                                    59.


  THE SMALL DOOR on the far wall is now there as well.

  With some trepidation, Jane moves toward the door, walking 
  across the face of the dragon mosaic, as though crossing some 
  ominous threshold of the old building itself...

  She reaches the door.  Turns the antique knob.  It opens.  She 
  steps through... And inexplicably finds herself --

  EXT. THE DRAKE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

  Jane steps out onto the rooftop.  It s the middle of the night.  
  A chilly wind blows.  How the hell did she get here?  She turns 
  around to go back -- but the door is now GONE.  

  Then Jane sees something else that startles her --

  MARY BARLOW walks across the rooftop.  She wears her long white 
    nightgown.  Bare feet.  Moving like a lost soul.  Jane studies 
  her, a slow moment of stunned recognition from the news photo -- 
  could it really be her?  How s that possible?  

                                  JANE
                    ...Mrs. Barlow...?  

  JANE S POV -- Mary moves to the edge of the roof and climbs up 
  on the ledge.  She stands there, a ghostly figure in white, 
  reminiscent of her leap from the roof of Bellevue.  

                                  JANE
                    Mary?!  Don t... Please...

  Mary slowly turns to Jane, a lost look in her eyes...  

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    You shouldn t have come here...

  Jane takes cautious steps forward, trying to get closer... 

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    They re never going to let you go...

  Mary stretches out her arms, leans back, and lets herself FALL -- 

  Jane rushes forward to grab her, hand outstretched, but MISSES -- 
  watching in horror as Mary drops to the street below -- 

  We FOLLOW MARY as she FALLS... time SLOWING DOWN to an 
    impossible crawl as Mary FLOATS dream-like towards the ground... 
  A WISP on the wind... Her nightgown wrapping around her like a 
  death SHROUD... 

  As Mary SLOWLY passes each window, we catch fleeting glimpses of 
  the residents inside their apartments, in FROZEN MOMENTS:                                                                                     60.


  -- BRIAN works at his desk in front of the window as Louise 
  brings him a cup of coffee, then kisses him.  RACK FOCUS to see 
  REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW, Alexis now watches them from her 
    apartment...

  -- Hannah stands in the doorway of Tommy s bedroom, pensive, 
  watching her son sleep...

  -- DR. SCOTT places a large stack of CASH and a GUN in a 
    lockbox...

  -- NONA sits on her bed, holding Jane s SCARF... Arranged around 
  her: a zippo lighter, bifocals, a charm bracelet, a wristwatch.  
  Items posted on the bulletin board as  missing ...

  -- HENRY sleeps, unaware that GAVIN DORAN sits in the shadowy 
  corner of the bedroom, watching him, eyes like onyx...

  And as the ground rises up to meet Mary, we SMASH TO:

  INT. THE DRAKE - JANE & HENRY S APARTMENT - MORNING

  Jane WAKES with a start, shaken by what is now revealed to have 
  been a dream.  The sun streams through the windows.  She sits 
  up, stretches, as Henry enters with a mug of coffee.   

                                  HENRY
                    How re you feeling?

                                  JANE
                    Like I need coffee.

  Henry hands Jane the mug.  She takes a sip.

                                  JANE
                    I had the strangest dreams all night...  
                    This place seemed so... dark.

                                  HENRY
                    That s your guilty conscience telling 
                    you there s a lightbulb to change 
                      somewhere...

                                  JANE
                    Funny.  

                                  HENRY
                    Gavin called.  Those contracts from his 
                    lawyer are ready for us to sign.  You 
                    wanna hop in the shower?

  Jane nods.  Henry moves off.  She gathers herself, then peels 
  back the covers and climbs out of bed.  We notice something she 
  doesn t --                                                                                     61.


  The soles of her feet are DIRTY...

  INT. THE DRAKE - HANNAH S APARTMENT - DAY

  Hannah answers the door, surprised to find Scott in the hallway.  

                                  SCOTT
                    Hey.  I just wanted to see how your 
                    boyfriend was doing.

                                  HANNAH
                    Adam s still in the ICU.  I m heading 
                    back to the hospital in a few.

                                  SCOTT
                    I ll check on him during my shift 
                    tonight.

                                  HANNAH
                    That d be great, thanks.
                          (beat)
                    I keep seeing the whole thing in my 
                    head.  It was awful.  Thank God you 
                    walked in when you did.  You saved his 
                    life.

                                  SCOTT
                    Lucky coincidence.  I d forgotten my 
                    wallet, I had to come back. 

  An awkward moment.  Like they d both like to say more...

                                  SCOTT
                    Anyway, I gotta go.  See you around?

                                  HANNAH
                    I hope so.

  Scott moves off.  Off Hannah, hopeful, watching him go --

  INT. THE DRAKE - PENTHOUSE - DAY

  CLOSE ON A LEGAL CONTRACT -- a single page, which reads  Term of 
  Employment  at the top.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    It s fairly boilerplate.  Standard one 
                    year with an option for another.  

  WIDEN -- Jane and Henry read over the contract.  Gavin stands 
  behind his desk in front of the window.                                                                                    62.


                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    The second contract there is your 
                      residential lease.  

                                  HENRY
                          (reading)
                    We can quit anytime we want?  Without 
                    penalty?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Quit or get fired, it just says I don t 
                    have to pay you anymore.

                                  JANE
                    I don t think we ll be quitting, Mr. 
                    Doran.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Good.  In that case, you can help me 
                    find a new tenant for 8B.

                                  JANE
                    Mr. Barlow s apartment?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    He moved out this morning.  Said he was 
                      relocating to Singapore for work.  
                    Fresh start and all that.

  Jane reacts, surprised.  Gavin hands her a FOLDER.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    That s a waiting list of prospective 
                    tenants.  Their applications are 
                    inside.  I d like to meet with each of 
                    them personally, if you ll set that up.

                                  JANE
                    I ll start calling today.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    One more thing, Jane...

  Gavin picks up a set of rolled BLUEPRINTS from the credenza.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Henry tells me you ve been studying the 
                    history of the Drake.   Digging deep  
                    were his words.

  Jane shoots a look at Henry --                                                                                    63.


                                  HENRY
                      I might ve mentioned it last night 
                    after a couple drinks.  Sorry.

                                  JANE
                          (to Gavin)
                    I ve been doing some research on the 
                    side, yeah.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I don t think these new plans preserve 
                    enough of the building s style or 
                    design.  I want the Drake restored to 
                    its original glory....

  Gavin hands the blueprints to Jane.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Take a look.  I d be interested to hear 
                    how you d do it.

  Jane refuses to get emotional, but it s tough -- after all the 
  jobs that fell through, the false starts, the dashed hopes, 
  she s finally close to doing what she loves.  

                                  JANE
                    Thanks, Gavin.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Now sign the contracts and get out of 
                    here.  You ve got a lot of work to do.

  Henry SIGNS, then hands the SILVER PEN to Jane.  Gavin watches 
  as Jane presses the pen to paper and SIGNS on the line...

  Off Gavin s smile --

  INT. THE DRAKE - NONA S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Nona sits on her bed with her legs crossed.  Eyes closed in 
    concentration.  She clutches Jane s SCARF in one hand, fingers 
  twisting around the fabric.  Her breathing quickens as a 
  powerful VISION grips her --

  FLASH TO -- a dark room, a single sickly yellow lightbulb hangs 
  from the ceiling, under which we see -- JANE tied to a chair in 
  her RED DRESS, head slumped down... As we PUSH IN -- Jane looks 
  up, revealing her lovely face bloodied and beaten... 

  Off this forboding and possibly prophetic vision of the future --

  SMASH TO BLACK.
