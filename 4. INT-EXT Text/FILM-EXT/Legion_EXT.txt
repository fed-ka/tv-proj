A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly
he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have
been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,
deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a
fight.
His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.
He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick
walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?
A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.
Seems
to motivate him.
Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in
time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,
SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.
He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash
dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
past.
Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a
MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.
Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor
sharp.
Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare
chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK
TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.
As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK
WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,
and then...
...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO
WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.
The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.
A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...
...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...
...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...
CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,
SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...
3.
Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out
of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront
across the street.
"GUN & SPORT WORLD"
Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly
out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store.
5.
ESTEVEZ (O.S.)
Freeze!
Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car,
crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael.
ESTEVEZ
Drop the bags! Hands on your head!
In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO
CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE.
"Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!"
The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.
MICHAEL
(sensing their unease:)
It's starting. There isn't much
time.
The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what
the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.
BURTON
Shut the fuck up and drop the bags
now!
Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.
ESTEVEZ
Hands on your head!
On your head!
Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.
BURTON
Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
Michael slowly turns around.
Calm.
Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,
FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible
decision made.
And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!
In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him
helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's
Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off
with Burton.
Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.
BURTON
Let `em go!
6.
ESTEVEZ
Take the shot, Burton!
BURTON
I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--
Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his
throat like a skipping record.
ESTEVEZ
Burton!?
THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the
confusion.
Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY
QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive
pressure were building inside him.
And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH
BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE
CLOWN!
His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully
in control.
Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice
GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.
BURTON
What are you doing, Michael?
These
weren't your orders.
Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.
ESTEVEZ
What did you say?
Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.
MICHAEL
I'm following my own orders now.
BURTON
Then you will die along with the
child.
ESTEVEZ
Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops,
leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's
faster, already FIRING back.
Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!
The squad car window
SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!
7.
And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing.
Smoke rising from his gun.
With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags
and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car.
He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the
FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a
wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...
SMASH CUT TO:
JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS)
Bolts awake.
Breathing hard.
Covered with sweat.
A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the
eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the
trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in
decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the
trailers roof lines, marking the season.
One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily
out into the cool western morning. Home.
Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a
two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that
Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.
Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign
glows like a beacon in the darkness:
"PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB"
A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.
CHARLIE (O.S.)
You okay, Jeep?
Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about
twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep
from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's
strikingly beautiful.
8.
JEEP
Sorry to wake you, Charlie.
CHARLIE
(stepping out of the
trailer, hands on her
BELLY)
Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a
storm all night. Must know
somethin' I don't.
She approaches Jeep.
Sees the strain in his eyes.
CHARLIE
Another bad dream?
He struggles for a moment, nods.
CHARLIE
It's just stress, Jeep, that's all.
You do too much worryin'. About
this place. About your dad.
(BEAT)
About me...
A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face.
JEEP
You're the only thing I like
worrying about.
CHARLIE
See what I mean? You're worried
about a girl eight months pregnant
and it isn't even your baby. Now
that's enough to give anybody
nightmares.
Jeep turns away, dejected.
JEEP
Go ahead, make fun of me.
Everybody else does.
CHARLIE
(turns him back around)
C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You
know how much I appreciate
everything you and Bob are doing
for me, but a month from now, this
baby'll have a new family and I'll
have to start thinkin' about what
the hell I'm doin' with my life.
This is not news Jeep wants to hear.
9.
JEEP
So you're still going through with
it...?
CHARLIE
Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama.
Christ, I can barely take care of
myself as it is.
JEEP
I could help you. We could do it
together, you know? I want to.
Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but
this just isn't where she's at.
CHARLIE
You gotta stop carryin' the weight
of the world on your shoulders.
Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.
CHARLIE
(rubbing her arms)
Now can we go back in? I'm
freezing my ass off out here.
JEEP
Go on.
I'll be right there.
Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the
trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the
clank of the door, she's gone.
And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of
FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.
JIMMY STEWART (V.O.)
I don't know whether I like it very
much being seen around with an
angel without any wings.
CUT TO:
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV
Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his
guardian angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in
and out. We hear a WHACK, which causes the image to
momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.
CLARENCE (ON TV)
Oh, I've got to earn them and
you'll help me, won't you?
10.
The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the
lonely row of old gas pumps.
Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in
the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.
Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and
rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the
SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.
The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK
parked in front of the garage with its hood up.
Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and
flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around.
Which way is north?
13.
KYLE
Darren, your fuckin' directions
suck, man.
He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way
out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in
search of a pay phone.
The good news is that he finds one.
The bad news is that
it's been broken for ten years.
Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing
a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her
very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look
is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name
tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".
KYLE
Hey...
She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.
KYLE
You know that shit right there
ain't good for the baby.
She lets out a long slow exhale.
CHARLIE
Guess I should think `bout quittin'
then.
KYLE
Now hold on, girl, let me bum one
before you do.
CHARLIE
You can buy a whole pack inside.
KYLE
Tell ya what. You let me have one
of yours, and I'll give you two
from the new pack you're gonna sell
me.
She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette.
Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle
takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.
KYLE
Am I in the right place?
CHARLIE
(peers at the map)
Only if nowhere's right, `cause
that's where you are.
14.
KYLE
Sonuvabitch. There another phone
around here? You know, one that
works?
CHARLIE
Bob'll probably let you use the
diner phone if you ask him real
nice...And pay `im somethin'.
KYLE
I can handle that.
You got
pancakes here?
CHARLIE
Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for
three seventy-five. We also got
french toast for four dollars if
you're into that. I personally
like the pancakes though.
JEEP (O.S.)
You okay, Charlie?
They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing
mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie
quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted.
CHARLIE
Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just
lost.
Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he
shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette
back up to her lips. An awkward beat.
KYLE
Three seventy-five, huh?
Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right
alongside him, not giving up.
BOB
How long you gonna follow her
around like a puppy dog? Cleanin'
up the messes she makes while she
steps out with every guy around
here other than you?!
Jeep stiffens.
Turns to his father:
JEEP
Don't say that about her!
She's
not like that!
18.
Bob gives Jeep a hard stare.
Yeah, she is.
BOB
You really think she's gonna stick
around here after that baby's born
and off her hands?
Jeeps shakes his head, burns.
JEEP
Look, I know it doesn't make any
sense to you, but it's just
something I have to do.
Bob sighs, feels for his boy.
BOB
(points up at the PARADISE
FALLS sign)
See that up there? Your mother
thought I was crazy for wanting to
buy this place, middle of
nowhere...But I just knew this was
what I was supposed to do. Told
your mom, "just wait." Told her
when they finally ran the freeway
through here like they were
plannin' on, this place would be
like Grand Central Station.
(BEAT)
But I was wrong. The freeway never
came and now the only people who
ever stop here are the ones who are
lost.
(BEAT)
And your mom? Well she got tired
of waitin'.
JEEP
C'mon Dad. You can't blame
yourself for what she did--
BOB
Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're
about to make the same damn mistake
I made, believing in something
that's never gonna happen...Or
someone.
(BEAT)
It's time for you to move on from
this place, Jeep. I don't wanna
see you wake up one morning old and
pissed off, realizing you're lost
just like everybody else who stops
here.
19.
Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily.
A
tough pill to swallow.
BOB
Now get to work on that truck. I
wanna have these people on the road
by nightfall.
Bob walks back into the diner.
Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices
something off in the distance.
Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a
living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north.
Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the
distant mountains. A storm is coming.
Jeep is buried under the Uhaul's hood, working at something
with a socket wrench. It's not going well.
JEEP
Damn it!
He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands.
The
sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention.
He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off
the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery
how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that
windshield.
After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN
ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal
frame and wheels of a walker.
The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on
the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner
with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches
her disappear inside.
He then looks toward the horizon again.
The WALL OF DARK
CLOUDS are growing ever closer.
Kyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his
neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade.
The Escalade fishtails onto the highway.
Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the
plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily
eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.
35.
BOB
I don't get it.
Why don't they
come closer?
KYLE
How the fuck am I supposed to know,
man? You askin' me to explain the
behavior of a motherfuckin'
pestilence.
A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped
to the ground.
JEEP
(holding up the keys)
You guys!
GLADYS' CUTLASS SUPREME
Its windows are completely caked with dust. The men WIPE
AWAY a layer of brown from the glass, allowing them to peer
inside the car.
BOB
You see anything?
KYLE
No Twilight Zone shit if that's
what you mean.
Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door.
Unlocks it.
BOB
Careful. Old lady could have some
kind of rabid poodle locked up in
there.
Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell
hits them.
KYLE
Agh!
What the fuck is that?
Bob covers his nose.
BOB
Jesus.
Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.
Dark, dirty.
But
nothing unusual.
KYLE
Nothin' here.
36.
JEEP
How `bout the trunk?
They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.
Jeep slips the key
in.
The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.
ROTTING.
MAGGOT INFESTED.
Bob quickly slams the trunk closed.
The guys are reeling
with disgust.
Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose.
KYLE
Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats
in her hoopty! What the fuck is
wrong with white people?!
BOB
Least now we know where that smell
was coming from.
KYLE
Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin'
necessity we figured that out, man.
JEEP
(sees something up the
ROAD)
Hey...
They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze.
A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild
stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust
clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug
splattered windows.
BOB
Okay, now we're talkin'.
JEEP
Wait a minute. Check it out. It's
LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way
out here?
Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.
KYLE
I'm from Nevada, man.
They consider the police car a moment more. See the
SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS.
37.
BOB
Give me the shotgun.
Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.
The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the
diner.
The three men see her moving toward the car.
Jeep's face
goes slack.
JEEP
Charlie, wait!
The men begin to run toward her...
While out of the police car steps...
MICHAEL
Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those
piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her,
as if she was exactly who he expected to see.
In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in
front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.
BOB
Take one step closer and I'll drop
you right here.
A long beat as Michael considers Bob.
Icy cold.
MICHAEL
That how you greet all your
customers?
BOB
Mister, after what we've been
through here today, you're lucky we
didn't shoot you first and greet
you later. Now let me see your
teeth.
Michael stares at him blankly.
38.
BOB
Your teeth goddamn it!
Lemme see
`em!
Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well
kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others
ease slightly.
JEEP
No, shark teeth, Pop.
Bob lowers the gun.
BOB
Okay... Suppose you tell us your
name then.
MICHAEL
Michael.
BOB
Sorry about all that, Michael.
This old lady just went crazy
inside my place here. She had
these teeth. Never seen anything
like `em. Practically bit a man in
half.
Michael remains silent.
Doesn't seemed shocked in the least
by what he's heard.
BOB
So what are you doin' out here?
Gotta say you don't exactly look
like a police officer. Even one
from L.A. Then again, you have to
be, right? I mean, who the hell'd
be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in
kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the
shotgun again.
Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to
the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic
table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:
MICHAEL
You don't know, do you?
KYLE
Know what?
39.
CHARLIE
We don't know anything. Nothing's
working here. The TV, the radio,
the phone...
Michael just shakes his head.
MICHAEL
I'm running out of time.
Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob
blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.
BOB
Back off, fella...
(BEAT)
Now, I don't care if this is the
second coming of Jesus fucking
Christ, I say it's time for you to
either get talkin' or get the hell
outta here!
In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's
hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find
himself holding air.
He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun
pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.
KYLE
Easy!
Easy!
Michael's expression is totally calm.
Merciless.
JEEP
C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry.
Tell `em you were only kidding!
But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared.
He squeezes his
eyes closed.
CHARLIE
Let `em go!
Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction.
Considering her.
The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand
and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra
and Audrey.
Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.
40.
PERCY
Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna
go spillin' blood for no good
reason in front of all these decent
people, do ya? Our friend Bob here
ain't worth the trouble it'd cause
ya.
(BEAT)
So whaddya say `bout just lettin'
`im go and then you can be on your
way? Nice `n' easy.
But Michael doesn't seem to register this plea.
It's not
looking good.
No one BREATHES. That's when Kyle notices something out in
the direction of the road.
DOZENS OF TINY HEADLIGHTS APPEARING IN THE DARK HAZE.
APPROACHING.
KYLE
What the--?
Michael turns, sees the lights.
MICHAEL
They're here.
Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it
back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun,
speechless.
MICHAEL
You're going to need this.
Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser.
Pops it, revealing a staggering ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY.
HE BEGINS TO LOAD GUN AFTER GUN.
Percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.
PERCY
Lord, have mercy.
(waving back Audrey and
SANDRA)
You ladies best get back inside.
SANDRA
What is it? What's happening? Who
is this man? Why's he driving a
police car?
AUDREY
Shut up, mom!
41.
Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner.
Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle. Another one
goes to Percy. Finally he places a third one in Jeep's
hands, who stares down at it anxiously.
BOB
Wait. I don't think that's such a
good idea.
JEEP
Dad, I can handle it.
BOB
(to Michael)
He's just a kid --
JEEP
I said, I can handle it!
Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.
MICHAEL
He can handle it. He doesn't have
a choice.
Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked
everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the
men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.
MICHAEL
If you want to live, you'll do
exactly as I say.
He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.
He cocks a
Glock and hands it to her.
MICHAEL
When you fire, you keep your thumb
off the slide. Don't hesitate.
Don't do anything brave. There's
no safety.
He gives her a hard look.
She nods nervously.
Trusting him
but not sure why.
Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the
others, then he bolts after Michael.
Percy follows.
Then Charlie.
Now it's only Jeep and his father left.
BOB
C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!
42.
And Bob rushes into the diner.
A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road.
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.
CLOSER.
He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.
JEEP
Fuck it.
And races after his father.
CUT TO:
A DEAD BOLT
Thrown.
Locking the diner door.
A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy
and Kyle. They quickly take their places behind the
"Paradise" sign. Pitch black surrounds them.
The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone, leaving only the RUSH OF THE
WIND coming up off the desert.
KYLE
Where the hell did they go?
Bob turns to Michael sharply.
BOB
Alright, Rambo. You got us up
here. Now you mind explaining what
the fuck we're fighting?
Michael is about to answer, when:
PERCY
Listen!
Over the wind, another sound becomes audible.
The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.
PERCY
You hear what I'm hearing?
BOB
Yeah...The hell is that?
The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct.
Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.
But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with
dread.
44.
PERCY
It sounds almost like...
KYLE
Ice cream.
TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the
darkness. And sure enough, an
ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly
toward the diner. The EERIE
CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from
a speaker on its roof. It's too
dark to see who's behind the
wheel.
KYLE
You've got to be fuckin' kidding
me.
MICHAEL
Alright. There's a safety switch
on the side of your gun. Push it
all the way down. Two clicks.
The men quickly do as they're told.
MICHAEL
Now when this starts, you hold on
tight, you hear me? If you don't,
you're going to blow your hand off.
Understand?
Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.
PERCY
The fuck y'all lookin' at me for?
The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights
facing the diner.
Everyone aims their guns at the truck.
Tense.
From the Ice Cream Truck...a DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the
ground.
MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to
reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. Say
hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN.
He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he
steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even
more clearly.
He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him.
And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like
taffy. If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him
for some kind of spider. He surveys the diner, the garage,
the roof -- assessing the situation.
On the roof, the men wait for something to happen.
KYLE
(WHISPERS)
Ah, he don't look that bad.
The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof.
He heard.
KYLE
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING
TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST! ROW
AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening
sound of CRACKING OF BONES.
From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth
shattering HOWL.
Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with
fear.
MICHAEL
Get ready!
And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING
SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal
man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT.
Michael aims.
46.
BLAM!
BLAM!
BLAM!
Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on
his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching
mess.
Michael keeps his aim.
Waits.
The CALLIOPE music continues
to play.
KYLE
Is that it?
Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A
freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the
wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE
COMMUTERS.
MICHAEL
Now!
Shoot now!
The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.
WINDSHIELDS SHATTER!
TIRES BLOW OUT!
ENGINES EXPLODE!
Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE!
DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering.
In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS
PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL
FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many
mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness.
MICHAEL
Spread out! Don't let them get
close to the windows!
The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions.
They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't
actually touch the ground.
From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow
Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight.
Their faces lighting up with each FLASH.
SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from
a sprinkler.
BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't
seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in
their sheer numbers.
With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the
diner.
47.
ON BOB firing madly.
Then...
CLICK!
CLICK!
Oh, no.
He's
out of ammo.
BOB
Shells!
Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch
and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.
BOB
Fuck!
With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down
for the ammo. Stretching... Further...
A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM
BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers
before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in
tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she
clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT.
Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts
to slip down toward her. She's coming fast!
Percy sees his friend in trouble.
PERCY
Bob!
Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the
bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide
even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he
can't stop!
BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!
She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something
akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM!
The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing
force halts Bob's slide.
PERCY
(extending his hook)
Grab my hand!
Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays
on.
But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more.
Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!
BOB
Gun!
48.
Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly
catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman
pounces on him.
BOB
(jamming the gun in her
MOUTH)
Fuck off!
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body
goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him.
BOB
Pull me up!
Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.
Percy is swivelling left and right, firing like mad.
PERCY
Come on, motherfuckers!
Come on!
Closer and closer the creatures come.
Most are eviscerated
by the fire from the rooftop.
49.
The tide is turning. The men seem to have gotten their game
on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back.
KYLE
They're running!
We got `em!
Kyle turns happily to Michael.
Gone.
Kyle looks around the
roof with alarm.
The faintest glint of sunlight through the dark red dusty
haze. A new day has forced itself into existence.
TITLE:
"December 24th - 6:05am"
Michael is searching the horizon in front of the diner for
movement. His expression focused, determined.
On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to
stay awake. The beer taking over. His eyes droop closed.
The ROAR OF WIND ripping off the plain is all that can be
heard. ON BOB as his head drops down with drunken fatigue.
Sleep.
RISING OVER HIM TO SEE...
Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below.
Percy's body lies covered on the table. Bob stares ruefully
at his dead friend. A broken man. Tears stream down his
face. He rolls the Zippo between his fingers.
Jeep watches his father from the doorway.
JEEP
We should get back out there...
BOB
Just gimme another minute with him,
okay?
Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead
friend.
CUT TO:
SANDRA'S FACE
Catatonic.
Sand and wind.
The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking.
Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping
watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5.
KYLE
...Then you just flip this --
Audrey flips the safety.
AUDREY
Yeah, I got it. All the way down.
Two clicks.
She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding
one all her life.
Off Kyle's surprised look:
AUDREY
Dated this guy last summer. A
marine. Had a thing for guns.
Parents hated him.
KYLE
I bet they did.
After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.
Hands
the gun over to Kyle.
Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her
expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years
overnight.
AUDREY
My parents hate everything I do.
That's why we were moving.
KYLE
Yeah?
69.
AUDREY
They thought a more "wholesome"
environment would help me "change
my ways." So fucked up. Only
reason they care at all is cuz they
don't want to be embarrassed in
front of their friends at the
country club.
Kyle considers her thoughtfully.
KYLE
The only time my old man ever paid
attention to me was when I was
doing somethin' bad. So you know
what I did?
AUDREY
What?
KYLE
I got really good at being bad.
She smiles at this confession.
Can obviously relate.
He
wipes a tear from her cheek.
She leans in.
Kisses him.
Passionately.
Desperately.
His hands trace over her body.
She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control.
She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up.
It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over.
She moves down his chest.
Further.
Kyle leans his head
back. Further.
Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come
to life.
The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant
red word "Paradise" illuminated above them.
Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.
The station's
FLUORESCENTS flicker on.
The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you
didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business
as usual. Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the
dramatic change.
AUDREY
Is it over?
KYLE
I don't know.
HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.
KYLE
(raising his gun)
You better get downstairs.
AUDREY
No, I can handle it.
Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face.
Then he
pulls out his silver 45.
KYLE
(handing her the gun)
Just in case.
The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off
the highway to stop at the pumps.
KYLE
Get ready.
They aim their weapons at the vehicle.
A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car.
He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the
coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and
YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.
71.
He races around to the gas pump.
KYLE
(lowering his gun)
Wait a minute.
AUDREY
Kyle, are they...
A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look
out over the back side of the diner.
AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast.
Kyle looks urgently back at the family.
The father lifts the
pump. Flips the lever.
KYLE
It's a trap. They saw them coming
and turned on the lights. It's a
fucking trap!
Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.
KYLE AND AUDREY
Hey! Get back in your car!
It's a
trap!
But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING
WIND as he pumps the gas.
Kyle fires his gun in the air.
BLAM!
BLAM!
BLAM!
At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the
roof.
His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO
HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but
he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe.
Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner.
AUDREY
They're not gonna make it.
The father dashes to the driver's side.
He throws open the
door.
But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time
to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM.
His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows.
Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that
surround the vehicle like swarming insects.
The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from
the vehicle by skeletal hands.
72.
AUDREY
(pushing his barrel down)
Wait! You'll hit them too!
So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto
the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the
ground in front of the diner.
AUDREY
Kyle!
Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the
woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on.
He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything
that comes at him.
The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably
agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display.
He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures
huddled around them.
He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively
covering his face.
Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms.
73.
KYLE
I got you!
Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening.
The creatures have stopped coming at him.
In fact, they're just standing there watching him.
Waiting.
Kyle freezes.
CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly
wrong.
YOUNG BOY (O.S.)
Mister...
Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms.
GHOSTLY WHITE EYES
stare back at him.
YOUNG BOY
(WHISPERS)
Fooled ya.
A FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT.
Kyle drops to his knees.
Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls.
AUDREY
Kyle!
The young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life
drain from his body.
The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears
suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to
her.
74.
YOUNG BOY
I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to!
AUDREY
Fuck you!
Audrey raises the 45 and ...
CLICK.
CLICK.
CLICK.
She keeps pulling the trigger.
Nothing.
The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an
eerie calm for someone so young.
YOUNG BOY
You're gonna die now.
The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body.
Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the
diner. Blocked by advancing creatures.
They're everywhere.
She's trapped.
She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.
And so she BOLTS.
Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly
closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK!
She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press
against the windows. A nightmare come to life.
With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps.
IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK.
She's running out of time.
Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at
the minivan. What's he up to?
The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if
they've just now noticed him.
And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait,
there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his
other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE!
The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames.
Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through
the night.
The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of
glass.
Michael drops the gas pump.
He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and
unlocks the door.
Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED
BY A RING OF FIRE.
MICHAEL
Come with me.
Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car...
Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle.
MICHAEL
Run.
76.
And together they run toward the open diner door.
BEHIND THEM THE MINIVAN EXPLODES.
A BALL OF FIRE ROARS AT
THEM!
PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT
Inky darkness.
A flickering light emanates from within the
diner.
TITLE:
"December 25th - 3:33am"
The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to:
Bob and Jeep keep watch.
The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger
-- closer.
Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below.
BOB
What a way to bring a child into
the world.
(looks over at Jeep)
She ever tell you his name?
JEEP
She's never said. I just assumed
it was Joe Danvers. You know how
she's always had a thing for bad
boys.
Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.
80.
BOB
Jeep, sooner or later she'll
realize you're the best thing
that's ever happened to her.
JEEP
I thought you said I should move
on?
BOB
Can't a father be wrong sometimes?
Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound...
A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as
if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.
JEEP
What was that...?
The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold
numbers.
Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the ARMY OF CREATURES has
closed within a hundred yards of the diner. Their ranks
stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness.
JEEP
We're not gonna make it outta here,
are we?
Bob looks at his son.
The agony stretched across his face.
BOB
I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be
happening to you...
Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob
pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears
filling his eyes.
DRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABY'S CRIES
reverberate up and down the ranks. They begin to look about
frantically, agitated by the sound. Some even begin to back
away from the diner.
DISSOLVE TO:
Off in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light
above the plain. It could almost be mistaken for a stable in
a desert town a long time ago.
THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky.
All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of
the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the
further away from the diner we get.
HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP
In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of
creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the
truck stop.
The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND.
AND WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE.
LIKE A
BIRD CIRCLING ITS PREY.
Audrey and Jeep help Charlie quickly move around the side of
the diner where the cruiser is parked. They are buffeted by
winds and sand.
Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat
while Audrey hustles in back.
91.
Jeep rounds to the driver's side.
Hops in.
The cruiser PUNCHES through the burning "Paradise" sign,
smashing it into fiery pieces!
The cruiser charges on down the endless highway, burning bits
of sign swirling in its wake.
Burning wreckage everywhere.
DRIFTING THROUGH IT until we settle on the SPIKE-SCEPTER
stuck firmly in the ground. Flames ring the handle.
The cruiser blazes down the highway.
GABRIEL SMASHES DOWN ON THE CRUISER'S ROOF WITH MASSIVE
FORCE!
USING HIS MIGHTY WINGS FOR BALANCE HE BEGINS TO STOMP ON THE
ROOF, CRUSHING IT DOWN AS IF IT WERE A SODA CAN!
Gabriel takes a direct hit in the thigh, causing him to slide
off the roof and onto the trunk where he grabs a hold of the
rear window frame for support.
The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and
careening into a large rock formation.
This ride is over.
Jeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the
long climb up the ridge.
Charlie looks up.
STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky.
Breathtaking.
CHARLIE
How can this happen?
JEEP
What?
CHARLIE
How can this happen in a world so
beautiful?
Jeep follows her gaze to the sky.
Endless stars.
Confounding.
Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.
101.
JEEP
C'mon, we're almost there.
They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --
GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM!
Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way
just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up
a cloud of dust.
Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has
done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away.
Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including
a large part of his head, revealing that under his human
visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE.
Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM!
Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's
hand.
Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin,
rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel
knocks Jeep savagely to the ground.
Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at
Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt
again.
Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.
Raises his
fists. This kid will simply not give up.
Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,
shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear
off the ground.
GABRIEL
So brave. So pointless. You
should have worried more about
saving yourself.
Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at
Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope.
Charlie watches in horror.
CHARLIE
Stop!
Please! Don't kill him!
But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing
consciousness. The battle is lost.
GABRIEL
Go to sleep...
Jeep's eyes flutter.
He's almost gone.
102.
CHARLIE
Stop it!
I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY!
This gets Gabriel's attention.
Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to
him.
CHARLIE
I don't want this responsibility!
Tears run down her face.
She's dead fucking serious.
Gabriel lets go of Jeep.
He falls to the ground, gasping
desperately for air.
JEEP
Charlie, no!
Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.
GABRIEL
"And as the child's cries are
extinguished, an eternal darkness
at last descended upon the world."
He peels the cloth back, revealing...
THE GRENADE.
He spins around to face Charlie.
She's holding the pin.
KABOOM!
GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS.
The creature is gone at last.
The sound of a BABY COOING.
Charlie picks the child up out of the brush.
She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make
their way to the top of the ridge.
Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below.
ON THEIR FACES, reacting to what they see.
Charlie takes Jeep's hand in hers.
103.
JEEP
We made it.
CHARLIE
Yep, we sure did.
And now we see it too:
THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
Vast.
Barren.
No signs of life.
No resistance force.
No nothing.
ON JEEP AND CHARLIE
Taking it in.
Breathing hard.
JEEP
I'm sure they're just over the next
ridge.
He glances at Charlie.
Worry in her eyes.
CHARLIE
What if we're on our own now?
JEEP
Don't be afraid.
We'll be okay.
(BEAT)
Believe me.
At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes.
Sees a
confidence in them she's never seen before.
And she leans in and kisses him.
Tender.
When they part, Jeep stares back at her with surprise.
Then
the surprise melts into a smile.
And they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a
view once again of --
THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains. The
unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat.
And we're back where we started.
A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.
Solemn.
Weary.
Determined.
104.
IT'S CHARLIE'S VOICE.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Someday when my son is older, I
will tell him about the time of his
birth when all the world was
covered in a great darkness...
DISSOLVE TO:
