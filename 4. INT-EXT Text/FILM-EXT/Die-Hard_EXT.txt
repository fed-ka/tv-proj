Argyle climbs out of the limo and stops by the trunk.
ARGYLE
So, you go on upstairs to the party,
your lady sees you, you run into each
other's arms.
Music comes up, you
live happily ever after, that it?
MCCLANE
It's corny, but I could live with it.
ARGYLE
What is it don't work out that way?
Where you gonna stay?
MCCLANE
I'll find someplace.
He looks up at the highrise lit by huge spotlights, then
back at Argyle who's made no attempt to open the trunk.
ARGYLE
Tell you what.
I'll pull into the
parking garage and wait.
You score
with your wife give me a call on the
car phone and I'll leave your bags
inside at the desk.
You strike out...
I'll get you to a hotel.
He hands McClane a business card with the number on it.
MCCLANE
(taking the number)
You're all right, Argyle.
ARGYLE
Just remember that when you sign
for the tip.
(pointing to the
building)
They're paying for it, so don't be
shy.
McClane grins, heads inside.

An Emory freight truck turns off Olympic into the underground
parking garage of Nakatomi.

McClane climbs to the heliport and leans against the leeward side
of a wall surrounding it.
Shielded from wind, he pulls out the
CB, turns to channel nine, and starts broadcasting.
MCCLANE
Mayday, Mayday!
Anyone!
Terrorists
have seized and Nakatomi building
and are holding 30 or more hostages!
I say again --

McClane moves around the roof, circling the helipad, making sure
he has a good enough view to avoid being ambushed.
He can't
see in all directions at once but he's doing the best he can.
MCCLANE
They've already killed one hostage,
and they're fortifying their positions
while we're bullshitting!
Now, send
police backup ASAP!
SUPERVISOR'S VOICE
Sir, I've already told you, this is
a reserved channel.
If this is an
emergency call, dial 911 on your
telephone.
Otherwise I will report
you to the police --
MCCLANE
(to the radio)
-- fine!
Report me!
Hey, come down
here and fucking arrest me!
Send
the police.
NOW -- !
Suddenly machine gun shells rip into the concrete wall in front
of him.
The noise is deadening as we:
CUT TO:
103
105
Running.
Tracer bullets rip into the wall behind him.
He
reaches the corner and sees the other two terrorists moving
toward him.
Before they see him, he leaps down to the next
level out of range of Karl.
106
107-A
Powell looks towards the horizon and up.
There it is, Nakatomi, in all its gleaming glory.
DISPATCH VOICE
One Adam Ten, do you copy?
Powell is already moving to the car.
He tosses in the twinkies,
hops behind the wheel.
POWELL
(into police
radio)
Roger, dispatch.
I'm on the way.
And he BURNS RUBBER leaving the store:
CUT TO:
108
108
running for his life, from Fritz and Franco, doesn't realize
he is being herded around the building toward Karl.
Suddenly
McClane turns a corner and sees Karl.
The big man fires a
burst and McClane ducks back stopping at the exterior door
to the pump room he used before.
It is locked from the inside.
He BLOWS the lock off with a burst from his machine gun and
slips into the darkness of the:
109
ELEVATOR SHAFT NEAR PUMP ROOM
109
Coming quickly out of the pump room, McClane picks his way
over the same ground as a few minutes before and opens the door
to the elevator shaft.
The dimly lit shaft yawns before him.
He starts down the ladder back to the catwalk, moves along
it -- STOPS.
The catwalk ends, and the elevator is gone.
109-A
143
The street is empty, quiet.
A lone police black-and-white
pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow
cruise toward the Nakatomi building.
144
ON POWELL
144
Driving, alone.
He starts up at the tower.
It seems calm,
its glowing lights matching the warmth of the holiday
decorations on the streets.
Powell slows to a stop and
scans the premises.
In the lobby we SEE Eddie, sitting behind
the desk.
Powell reports to his radio.
POWELL
Guard inside.
No signs of disturbance
...I'm going up for a closer look.
He pulls in and parks in the front.
145
146
The edge of the roof.
Suddenly a tall terrorist, James,
moves along the wall and looks over at Powell's car.
147
150
Powell tries the front doors.
Locked.
Eddie comes hustling
across and unlocks the door with the magnetic card.
EDDIE
Evening, officer.
What's up?
Powell steps in and looks around.
Bland HOLIDAY MUZAK filters
from Speakers here.
(LET IT SNOW)

POWELL
We got an emergency call that there
was a problem here.

James sees the glass whiten below him and shouts into his mike.

Sirens wail as the first few police cars arrive.
Powell sees
them, waves them back, points to the third floor.
168
173
Powell stands in front of his destroyed cruiser and looks
up at the building.
Behind him technicians, City Power and
Light personnel, SWAT officers in protective gear, etc., arrive
from all directions.
A trailer is being backed into a parking
lot, which will become the police center of operations.
It
is like watching a small town being constructed right before
your eyes.
POWELL
(to CB)
What's left of him.
Can you
identify yourself?
INTERCUT:

HANS AND KARL
173-A
Listening intently.
MCCLANE
Maybe later.
Just listen fast
because this is a party line and
the neighbors are trigger happy.
Now here's the skinny:
There's
thirty or so hostages on the
30th floor, with probably 2 or 3
guards to cover a group that size.
The leader here is named Hans,
and besides the pea shooter he
ventilated your car with,
*
they got machine guns and
*
sidearms up the yin yang.
On top
of that one of 'em had a big enough
chunck of plastic explosive to
orbit Kate Smith.

NOTE:
The following dialogue is said OVER McClane's.
FRANCO
We have to find him and shut him
up!
He's telling them everything --
HANS
(shaking his head,
calming)
The police are irrelevant.
We've

waiting for the FBI.
Until they

arrive, we can't finish out work.
Meanwhile, let this fool waste time

HANS
We must find those detonators.
They leave.
173-B
WITH MCCLANE
173-B
POWELL'S VOICE
How many are there?
MCCLANE
(thinking about it)
Figuring there's at least one to
cover the lobby, a couple with the
hostages...I'd say they came in
with about a dozen...but they're
down to nine now, including the
skydiver you already met.
These
guys are mostly Europeans, judging
by their clothing labels, and they're
well financed and very slick.
POWELL
How do you know?
MCCLANE
I've seen enough phoney ID's in
my time to recognize that the ones
they've got cost a fortune.
Add all
that up and I don't know what the
fuck it means, but these are bad
ass preps and they're here to stay.
We notice that everything McClane has said about "clothing"
and ID's and police jargon, etc., has set off a little buzzer
in Powell's brain.
POWELL
I hear you...
(on a hunch)
Partner.
And LA's finest are on it,
so light 'em if you got 'em.
MCCLANE
I'm ahead of you...partner.
POWELL
Uh, what do I call you?
A moment.
McClane smiles.
What the hell?
MCCLANE
'Roy'.
POWELL
Got it...'Roy'.
Now listen.
If
you think of anything else you think
we need to know, don't be shy, okay?
In the meantime I want you to find
a safe place and hole-up and let
us do our job.
Understand?
MCCLANE
(to CB)
They're all yours, Al.
Good luck.
McClane turns off his CB and sits against the wall.

An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from
Nakatomi building and a MAN in a sportcoat climbs out.
Stocky, his hair a little too perfect, the very fact that
he is the Deputy Chief of Police Operations on a Christmas Eve
gives some evidence to his position in the pecking order.
His
name is DWAYNE T. ROBINSON and he moves brusquely past police
technicians and goes to the forward group of officers.
ROBINSON
Who's talking to them?
Powell turns around
POWELL
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
ROBINSON
Dwayne Robinson.
Well, what have
you learned?
What do they want?
POWELL
The terrorists?
Don't know, Sir.
We haven't heard a peep from them.
ROBINSON
(puzzled)
Then who the hell have you been
talking too?
POWELL
We don't exactly know, Sir.
He won't
give us him name.
He appears to be the
man who called in the report...he's
killed one of the terrorists for sure
and claims he capped two others.
ROBINSON
(exasperated)
He claims?
Powell, has it occured
to you he could be one of the
terrorists, pulling your chain?
Or some kind of nut case who --
POWELL
I don't think so, Sir.
In fact...
I think he's a cop.
Maybe not
LAPD, but definitely a badge.
ROBINSON
How do you know?
POWELL
A hunch.
Things he said.
Like,
knowing how to recognize a phony
ID --
ROBINSON
(exasperated)
-- recognizing phony ID's?
Christ,
Powell, he could be a fucking
bartender for all we know!
Something draws Robinson's attention.
He looks at:

Hans examines building plans at Holly's desk.
Behind him
the TV is ON, the sound muted.
TV cops triumph over oafish
bad guys.
Hans looks up as Fritz brings in Holly.
HOLLY
I...have a request.
HANS
Oh?
What idiot put you in charge?
HOLLY
(evenly)
You did.
(on his look)
You murdered by Boss.
Now...
(waving towards
the hostages)
They're looking to me.
Personally
I'd pass on the jab.
I don't enjoy
being this close to you.
Hans is impressed by her candor.
And she's easy enough
on the eyes.
HANS
Go on.
HOLLY
We have a pregnant woman out there --
(on his look)
-- relax, she's not due for two
weeks, but a marble floor isn't
doing her back any good.
I'd like
permission for her to more to one
of the offices where there's a sofa.
HANS
No.
But I'll have a sofa brought
out to you.
Good enough?
HOLLY
Good enough.
And unless you like
is messy, you'd better start taking
us in groups to the bathroom.
HANS
(nods)
Yes, you're right.
It will be done.
He nods to one of his men, and she is waved to the door:
As she goes:
HANS
Mr. Takagi chose his people well,
Mrs...?
HOLLY
Gennero.
Miss Gennero.
He nods, thoughtful.
She goes out.
Hans suddenly notices:
180
CLOSER - TV

A slide "SPECIAL BULLETIN" has appeared.
This changes to a
SHOT of the Nakatomi building with "LIVE" supered over it.
Richard Thornburg is in front. The CAMERA TIGHTENS ON him.
THORNBURG
This is Richard Thornburg, speaking
to you live from Century City...
where Los Angeles has joined the
sad but world wide fraternity whose
only membership requirement is the
awesome spectre of International
Terrorism...

As Thornburg Continues, we PULL BACK.
We're WITH Argyle in
the back seat of the limo.
ARGYLE
(reaching for the

What else is new...?
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the Nakatomi Building rise
up in the b.g. behind Thornburg.
ARGYLE
(stunned)
Holy shit...
THORNBURG
We're told that the situation began
some two hours ago when an
unidentified party of men took over
the building and sealed off all of
its entrances and exits...
Argyle is already bailing out of the car.
182

Argyle looks at the metal gates, swallows.
He JUMPS back
in the car.
183
BACK INSIDE
183
Argyle pours himself a stiff drink.
THORNBURG
(on TV)
Since all the telephone lines have
been cut, the only contact with the
building had been through the use of
CB communicators which the terrorists
brought with them.
Strangely enough,
so far the terrorists have not
communicated directly with the police...
but an unidentified man has had
several conversations which seem to
indicate...
Argyle nearly spills his drink as he leans over the front
seat and turns on the CB.
CUT TO:
184
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - SAME TIME
184
Signs of activity along the edges and shadows of the area.
Men and vehicles.
The SNAP of weapons and breeches.
Footsteps running in unison.
Powell picks up on this, turns
to Robinson, who is standing with the SWAT Captain, MITCHELL.
POWELL
What's going on?
ROBINSON
What's it look like?
We're going
in.
POWELL
(flabbergasted)
Going in...are you out of your mind?
There's 30 hostages in there -- for
all we know --
ROBINSON
-- all we know?
We don't know shit,
Powell.
If there's hostages why
hasn't anyone asked for ransom?
If
there's terrorists, where's their
goddamn list of demands?
All we know
is that someone shot up your car, and
it could be the same flake you've been
talking to on the radio!
POWELL
What about the body that fell out of
the window -- ?
ROBINSON
Who the hell knows?
Maybe he was a
stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones
and opted for early retirement!
MITCHELL
Chief, we're ready.
ROBINSON
I'm coming.
MITCHELL

Rivers.
RIVERS

Yo.
MITCHELL
Begin your reconnoiter.

Inside the building, sadly realizing that the Marlboro pack
has only two more to go.
He savors the dregs of his current

He moves to the window.

Powell stiffens.
Robinson looks at him warningly, shakes his
head.
POWELL
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of
busy.
Let's talk later, okay?
MCCLANE
Al, what's wrong?
Did something --
(realizing)
-- Oh, God.
You're coming in!
That's
it, isn't it?
Christ, Powell, I told
you what you're dealing with here --
POWELL
I said we'll talk later, Roy.
If
you're what I think you are you should
know when to listen, when to shut up...
and when to pray.
Hating himself, Powell DISCONNECTS, watches LIGHTS snaps on in
the parking lot to illuminate the area.
Also hating himself, McClane does the same thing.
Pale, he
moves to a window to watch what he knows is going to be brutal.

Suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building.
ROBINSON
(worriedly)
They're shooting at them
MITCHELL
(calmly)
It's panic fire...they can't see
anything.
POWELL
(under breath)
They're shooting at the lights.
More shots ring out from the building going over the SWAT
officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the
spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head.
The glow fades.
A moment later the next light twenty feet
away dies.
ROBINSON
They're going after the lights!
The two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up
as their cover starts to disappear.
ROBINSON
Call them back.
MITCHELL
No, they're almost in.
Suddenly the third and fourth lights are shot out and the SWAT

An armored car wheels toward the building and starts toward

A blast ROARS from the third floor window and the shell hits

One spotters say you got two with

Before Powell can answer Robinson comes running up to him.
ROBINSON

POWELL
Yessir.
ROBINSON

CB)
Give me that.
(angrily at McClane)
Now, listen to me, mister, I don't
know what you think you're doing,
but demolishing a building doesn't
fall under the definition of 'help'!
There's hundreds of people out here
and you covered half of them in
pieces of glass --
MCCLANE
Glass, my ass!
Who the fuck is this?
ROBINSON
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T. Robinson, and I'm in
charge of this situation.
McClane leans tiredly against the elevator door.
MCCLANE
Well, from up here, it looks like
you're in charge of shit, Dwayne.
I haven't seen such a fucked up
operation since the
Bride of Frankenstein.
Ask

POWELL
Christ, can't you read between the
lines!
He did everything he could
to save him...if he gave himself up
they'd both be dead!
ROBINSON
Maybe.
And maybe they'd at least
be talking to us!
Now tell your
'partner' to stay out of it, or so
help me if he lives through this
I'll put him behind bars myself!
POWELL
(amused)
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't
seen diddly-squat from us and you
think he gives a flying fuck about
what you're going to do to him?
Robinson, wake up and smell the shit
you're shoveling!

Speaking of cows, did you ever
hear so much bullshit in your life?
Two hours?
That doesn't even make
any sense --
POWELL
Don't tell me, partner.
I'm just
a desk jockey who was on the way
home when you rang.
MCCLANE
The way you drove that car, I
figured you for the streets.
POWELL
In my youth, partner.
In my youth.

As we saw on Theo's screen, the Johnsons and Robinson and
Powell are my a MANHOLE with a CITY ENGINEER.
A big CONTROL
BOX is there, cables snaking into the ground where another
CITY WORKER finishes WELDING a last connection.
GUY IN MANHOLE
We're spliced in down the line.
LITTLE JOHNSON
Do it...now.
The engineer THROWS GIANT LEVERS.
Inside the manhole, SPARKS
SIZZLE and massive contacts CLUNK.
295
THE BUILDING

One by one, all the light on all the floors GO OUT.
296
MCCLANE

in the bathroom, ripping off his shirt and tying it around his
foot, he REACTS --
MCCLANE

Powell?
What's going on?
INTERCUT:
297
OUTSIDE

POWELL
(watching the others)
Ask the FBI.
They've got the terrorist
playbook and they're running it, step
by step.
McClane reacts, worried; he knows better.
298
THE HOSTAGES
298
groan with this new problem:
299
THE VAULT ROOM
299
Theo and Kristoff and Hans huddle over the computer monitor
screen as if it was a warm fireplace.
Theo points to the
computer screen; all they can do is wait.
We HEAR the HUMM of a portable generator.
The lights go OFF.
The computer screen stays ON.
Theo looks over at the safe.
300
SAFE LED READOUT
300
It still reads "FIBER OPTIC TIME LOCK CANNOT BE DISARMED AT
THIS LOCATION.
TERMINATE SEQUENCE (Y/N)?"

KRISTOFF
Damn!
It didn't go!
THEO
They're on the building circuit...
it's too local.
HANS
Encourage them to be bolder.
THEO
The only thing left for them is the
City Grid...
(worried, typing)
...They may not do it.
302
302
Just as the Johnsons are looking SMUG...all the floors GO
BACK ON, one by one!
LITTLE JOHNSON
Shit!
(turning, to the
Engineer)
Cut it again.
Go wider.
ENGINEER
I can't go wider here...
(to Robinson, looking
for help)
...I'd have to call downtown have
them take down one of the city
grids...you're talking ten square
block --
ROBINSON
-- ten blocks?
(to Big Johnson)
Are you crazy?
It's Christmas Eve,
thousands of people -- the Mayor'll
scream bloody murder --
BIG JOHNSON
(ignoring Robinson,
to the Engineer)
We must shut down the building.
Go
wider --!
ENGINEER
I need authorization --
BIG JOHNSON
Authorization?
How about the
United States Fucking Government?
Lose the grid or lose your job!
The engineer looks at Robinson.
No help.
The engineer looks
at his guy in the manhole, shrugs.
No choice.
ENGINEER
(takes phone)
Central.
This is Walt, out at
Nakatomi.
I want you to shut down
grid 212.
(listens)
No shit, it's my ass.
Just shut it
down now.
Pause...pause...AND THEN THE FLOORS OF THE BUILDING ALL GO
OUT AGAIN.
303
IN THE VAULT ROOM
303
EMERGENCY LIGHTING FLICKS ON.
An ALARM "beep-beep-beeps."

THE LED READOUT ON THE SAFE

With a dramatic HUM worthy of 2001, the vault door OPENS!
306
OUTSIDE

The FBI guys look at the dark building, than at the LAPD guys.
BIG JOHNSON
That should shake'em up.
With all
the power shut down, those bastards
are probably scared shitless.
307
IN THE VAULT ROOM
307
The safe door finishes its ponderous move, CLUNKS to a halt.
Theo and Kristoff LAUGH, give each other high fives.
Even Hans
loses his usual cool, slaps Theo on the back as Theo and
Kristoff CHEER.
CUT TO:

THORNBURG'S TV TRUCK

OUTSIDE THE NAKATOMI BUILDING

Powell looks up at the dark structure lit only by emergency
lighting.
He sidles over to the FBI men.
POWELL
(dryly)
What do we do now, arrest them for
not paying their electric bill?
LITTLE JOHNSON
(sharply)
We let them sweat awhile.
Then, when
they're expecting helicopters...
(pause)
...We give them helicopters...
BIG JOHNSON
(nodding)
Right up the ass.
(into another communicator)
This is Johnson...no the other one.
I
want that air support ready to lift off
in five minutes...Damn right fully
armed.
We're on our way.

Attention in the building.

Hans talks while Theo and Kristoff tackle the problem of
unloading the racks and racks of bonds and transferring them
to the black cases.
HANS
This is Hans...
BIG JOHNSON
This is Agent Johnson of the FBI.
The State Department has arranged for
the release of your comrades.
The
helicopters you requested are on the
way.
HANS
I hear you, FBI.
We'll be ready.
He disconnects, smiles at Theo.
HANS
When they touch down and we blow the
roof, they'll spend a month sifting
through the bodies and rubble.
By the
time they figure out what went wrong...
(smiling at the
irony)
...we'll be earning twenty percent
like nice fat Capitalists.
BIG JOHNSON
(disconnecting, grinning)
By the time he figures out what hit him
he'll be in a body bag.
The Johnsons exit.
Powell and Robinson look at each other,
unhappy.
Powell's CB HISSES --
MCCLANE'S VOICE
Powell, listen...
Powell moves off to be alone.

Powell is beside one of the radio monitoring officers.
POWELL

Roy?
Hello?
Hello?

I did.
He said something about a,
a double cross...

Karl hovers over McClane, who hasn't moved a muscle.
KARL
(quietly)
We're both professionals.
But this
is personal.
You...are done.
WHAM!
McClane DRIVES his elbow into Karl's face.
320
NEW ANGLE

Karl's weapon clatters on the floor.
McClane follows his first

Eddie turns from a window, where the chopper lights loom closer.
EDDIE
They're coming.
CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office, where
Hans nods, stands.
THORNBURG'S VOICE FROM TV
-- I know you're proud of your daddy...
322
CLOSEUP - HOLLY
322
She's speechless, watching in shock as:
323
THE PORTABLE TV
323
shows Thornburg at Holly's house!
He's squatting down with his
microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.
His voice
is soft, comforting.
THORNBURG
(to the children)
...because he's a very brave policeman.
And your mom has shown just as much
courage.
But is there something you
would like to say to them if they're
watching?
John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera.
LUCY
Come home.
324
HOLLY
324
She struggles to stay composed...can't.
She slowly turns her
head, looks at Hans.
325
HER P.O.V. - HANS
325
He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on
her desk.
He turns back and looks at her.
He smiles.
HANS
Mrs. McClane.
How nice to make your
acquaintance.
He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,
making everyone jump!
HANS
(shouting)
On your feet, everyone!
Upstairs,
now!
(quietly, to Uli)
You'll lock them up there and come
right down...
Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs.
Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.
CUT TO:
326
THE MACHINE FLOOR
326
McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the other
up, each looking over the terrain.
MCCLANE
Better this way, isn't it?
I mean,
any faggot can shoot a gun.
This time Karl doesn't take the bait.
Then, when he
does charge, it's unexpected.
The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial
training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.
327
NEW ANGLE

MCCLANE
You should've heard your brother
scream when I broke his fucking

Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.
McClane twists free,
slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.
Karl backs off, circles
McClane with new respect.
CUT TO:

INSIDE AN FBI CHOPPER - IN FLIGHT
328
THROUGH THE CANOPY we SEE another flanking chopper.
Johnson
and Johnson are here, helmets and mikes on.
Big Johnson checks
aerial maps while Little Johnson checks ammo clips for his
sniper scoped assault rifle.
BIG JOHNSON
(shouting, to the pilot)
Stay low.
They're expecting transports,
not gunships.
LITTLE JOHNSON
(shouting over the noise
of the rotors)
What do you figure on breakage?
BIG JOHNSON
I figure we take out all the terrorists,
and lose 20 percent of the hostages...
25, tops.
LITTLE JOHNSON
I can live with those numbers.
CUT TO:
329
VAULT FLOOR
329
Theo and Kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried
all their gear when they entered.
As Hans and Eddie come in they
look curiously at Holly.
HANS
A little bonus for us.
(shoving her forward
violently)
A policeman's wife might come in
handy.
He picks up a CB, speaks into it.
HANS
McClane!
McClane!
I have some news
for you...McClane?
330
THE MACHINE FLOOR
330
TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed.
Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their
tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct.

Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few
out.

LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS

They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash
shaking the trees.

POWELL AND ROBINSON

Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion.
335
HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF
335
They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly
copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.
Uli smiles to
himself, moves towards the door:
336
VAULT ROOM
336
Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of
the room.
Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.
HOLLY
(to Hans, scornfully)
After all your posturing, all your
speeches...you're nothing but a common
thief.
HANS
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.
And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping,
you should be more polite.
He SLAPS her.
337
MACHINE FLOOR
337
Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.
Another one.
McClane is staggering.
He gets in one hard punch and then Karl
charges at him.
McClane falls backwards, drives his legs
upwards, propelling Karl into the air:
338
LOW ANGLE
338
Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes
entangled.
339
MCCLANE

jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.

KARL
340
is JERKED upwards by the neck.
He TWITCHES like a captured
fish -- starts to turn blue:
341
MCCLANE

Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.
McClane
snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.
CUT TO:
342
CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR

We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this

Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.
BIG JOHNSON
Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?
PILOT
My kind of town.
CUT TO:
343
THE ROOF
343
The door rattles.
His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,
OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.
Smoking Baretta
in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped
twitching.
As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches
up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.
He charges
through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.
She
meets him halfway.
MCCLANE
Where's Holly --
GINNY
The took her -- after they saw the
kids on television --
MCCLANE
What?
God --
He looks off to the choppers.
Closer yet.
He turns, SHOUTS.
MCCLANE
Listen to me!
All of you, get down
to the lower floors -- you're all
in danger.
HOSTAGE
What are you, crazy?
We're being
rescued!
Those helicopters --
MCCLANE
-- there won't be shit for those helicopters
to land on, because the whole top of this
building is wired with explosives!
Now
get below --
SECOND HOSTAGE
But...we're safe up here --
MCCLANE
Safe, my ass!
This ain't a helipad,
it's a launching pad!
And he FIRES over their heads!
They SCREAM, head for the door
as he hoped!
He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.
They really haul ass.
MCCLANE
GET BELOW!
NOW!

IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR
344
A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.
YOUNG FBI

out the door)
Flight leader, this is Wing.
I think
they're on to us.
One of the terrorists
is firing on the hostages.

INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER

LITTLE JOHNSON

Roger, Wing.
We copy.
(to the pilot)
Swing around.
(raising his rifle)
Give me a clear shot.
The pilot nods.

The police are scrambling for cover.
Powell and Robinson are
open-mouthed.
376
IN THE BASEMENT
376
Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed
animal held over his head as much for company as protection.
As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from
under the fur...and sees:
377
HIS P.O.V. - THEO
377
at the delivery truck.
He steps into a white paramedic's
jumpsuit and zips it up.
He hops into the cab and pulls the
truck away from the loading dock.
378
MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR
378
He creeps forward, looks carefully into:
379
HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM
379
They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.
Suddenly
the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.
380
BACK TO SCENE
380
McClane's face shows his anguish.
He checks the weapon he took
from Uli.
One bullet!
MCCLANE
(under his breath)
Shit...
He checks his Baretta.
One bullet.
He thinks, desperate.
Decides.
He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to
the Baretta clip.
He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.
Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a
tape dispenser.
He thinks again...steps towards it:
380-A
IN THE BASEMENT
380-A
Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into
the back.
A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.
381
ARGYLE

Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.
382
THE GARAGE
382
A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier
delivery truck.
Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into
the van, which CAREENS into the wall.
383
CLOSER

Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.
ARGYLE
(looking around)
Where's the camera when you need them?
CUT TO:
384
THE VAULT ROOM
384
HANS
Let's move.
The last of the money is piled on.
Hans hangs onto Holly while
Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.
Kristoff goes to the
door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a
rifle butt.
385
WIDER
385
McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still
tumbling down from the roof above.
He holds the machine gun
ready.
MCCLANE
Hans!
Hans turns, not that surprised.
Grinning, he yanks Holly into
view.
No words need be said.
HOLLY
John!
MCCLANE
Holly, we have to stop meeting like
this.
(taking in the vault)
So that's what it was.
A fucking
robbery.
(thinking)
So why nuke the building, Hans?
HANS
(with a shrug)
When you steal six hundred dollars,
you can disappear...but when you
steal six hundred million, they will
find you...unless you play dead.
(tight smile)
Which happens to be your next role...
drop your gun, please.
McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,
really hurting her.
Eddie quickly raises his weapon.
HANS
(to Eddie)
Nein, dies ein ist mein.
(to McClane)
This time John Wayne does not walk
off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
MCCLANE
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
HANS
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it
between the eyes!
MCCLANE
(slowly putting down
his gun)
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
HANS
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?
Now
you are fucked.
He aims:
MCCLANE
Holly, now...!
Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!
386
MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT
386
At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta
from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS
Hans high in the chest!
The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind
him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.
Even while this is
happening, McClane SPINS:
387
EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS
387
Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.
388
BACK TO SCENE
388
Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood
in shock.

MCCLANE
389
MCCLANE
You were right about us Americans.
(he blows smoke
from his pistol
barrel)
We are cowboys.
390
VAULT ROOM - WIDER
390
Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and
disbelief.
He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to
TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward
place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:
391
HOLLY'S WRIST
391
and she is YANKED off her feet!
392
BACK TO SCENE
392
Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!
McClane
LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the
last minute!
393
393
The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the
window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto
Holly as Hans drags her out!
McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to
pull Holly closer.
With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with
her inside hand.
McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins
to INCH towards Holly's wristband.
394
HANS' HAND - WIDEN
394
A death grip on the watchband.
We WIDEN, SEE that, blood
flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand
to bring up the gun he is still holding!
395
MCCLANE
395
Holly's SCREAM alerts him.
Hans locks eyes with McClane one
last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:
396
VERY CLOSE
396
McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!
The overtaxed
metal SNAPS, links flying:
397
WIDER
397
Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch
suddenly drop.
We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.
McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.
MCCLANE
It's okay, babe.
It's okay.
He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband
he's still holding.
MCCLANE
You got a warranty on this?
She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.
DISSOLVE TO:

Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.
Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.
399
CLOSER
399
A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.
We
SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by
SWAT men.
As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane
breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into
the crowd.
MCCLANE
(calling out)
Al?
Al, you here -- ?
The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and
McClane knows it's him.
They stare at each other, ten feet
apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.
But
somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other
like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,
is the truth.
MCCLANE
(emotional)
Al.
Man, you were my rock.
I
couldn't have made it without you.
POWELL
Bullshit.
MCCLANE
I'm serious.
Hey, this is my wife...
Holly Gennero.
HOLLY
(taking Powell's hand,
correcting)
Holly McClane.
Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.
*
POWELL
(to her)
A pleasure.
I guess John doesn't
need me to give you that message
anymore.
HOLLY
(puzzled)
Message?
McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's
direction.
POWELL
You know, about him being such a
jerk -- and how he's really sor --
(seeing McClane)
-- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill
you in.
Just then Robinson barges forward.
ROBINSON
I want you for debrief, McClane.
You've got some things to answer
for -- Ellis' murder -- property
damage -- interfering with police
*
business --
A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.
400
HIS P.O.V.
400
There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.
Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his
machine gun.
401
401
As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with
McClane and levels his gun.
McClane throws Holly to the
ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinson's sidearm.
But he doesn't get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl --
knocking him back through the doorway.
McClane looks back to
see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his .38.
His hand is rock steady.
He sees McClane's look.
POWELL
(shrugging)
You were right.
You couldn't have
made it without me.
They smile.
Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan
onto them.
Thornburg pushes his way forward, mike extended
like a weapon.
THORNBURG
Mr. McClane...Mrs. McClane...any
comment on your incredible ordeal?
What are your feelings now that it's
all over?
Without a beat, Holly PUNCHES HIM in the chops.
He FALLS,
dropping the mike with an electronic SQUEAL.
McClane looks at
his wife, amazed.
Behind them, Thornburg sits on the ground, *
nurses his lip, turns to his camerman.
THORNBURG
(eager)

Did you get that?
McClane and Holly continue on, turn towards:

ARGYLE'S LIMO
402
It's a little smashed up, but still running.
Argyle is
standing beside the open door.
McClane and Holly get in and
Argyle closes the door.
ARGYLE
(getting in the
front)
If this is their idea of Christmas
I gotta be there for New Year's.
CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW the read window where McClane and
Holly are kissing.
As they drive off, we:
