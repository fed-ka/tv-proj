CAR WASH. -- NIGHT
From the peaceful tableau of the sleeping family, the scene
shifts to a vehicle entering a car wash.
The image is shot
through the windshield, from the driver's point of view.
The car enters the lathered world of spinning felt wheels
and gushing water.
CUT TO
The phone booth is located in a rundown area of a large
city.
A young woman, ZOE, enters the booth and lifts the
receiver.
CUT TO
The blues number continues as the camera cranes down to the
bandstand of a country fair.
A local band is rehearsing.
Around the practising band, various carpenters and
technicians are making final preparations for that evening's
big event.
One of the people watching the band is SAM BURNELL, a man in
his early forties.
He watches his daughter, NICOLE, as she
sings into the microphone.
NICOLE is sixteen.
NICOLE stares at her father as she sings.
ANGLE ON
SAM looking back at his daughter.
He is intensely proud of
her.
SAM is a carpenter, working on at the fair site.
He
gets back to his work, hammering a supporting beam into the
grandstand.
CUT TO
SAM and NICOLE wander through the fairground.
Various rides
and concession stands are being set up.
SAM has his arm
around NICOLE.
SAM
That was great.
NICOLE
Really?
SAM
You're going to blow everyone away.
NICOLE
You mean it?
SAM
Of course.
NICOLE
You don't sound like one hundred
percent absolutely sure.
SAM
I am.
Really.
It was awesome.
NICOLE assesses SAM.
Sensing his sincerity, she throws her
arms around him in a gesture of unabashed excitement.
NICOLE
I'm so happy, Daddy.
CUT TO
MITCHELL STEPHEN'S car pulls into the parking lot of this
run-down roadside motel.
In the fading light, a magnificent
mountain range is seen in the background.
CUT TO
A group of men are setting up the ferris wheel for the
country fair.
SAM and NICOLE walk into the shot, eating ice
cream cones.
SAM waves at someone he recognizes in the
distance.
SAM
Let's sit down.
NICOLE nods, her mind elsewhere.
CUT TO
SAM and NICOLE are sitting at an outside table, finishing
their cones.
A school bus pulls up into the fairground.
NICOLE watches
as young children spill out of the bus and gather outside.
NICOLE smiles at this scene.
SAM notices, turns around to
see the children, then turns back to NICOLE.
SAM
What's so funny?
NICOLE
Just the way Dolores gets so excited
about bringing the kids to check out
the animals.
It's like the biggest
thing in her life.
ANGLE ON
DOLORES DRISCOLL, a warm and cheery woman in her forties,
leading the young children into the large exhibition barn on
the fair site.
DOLORES
Alright, kids.
I want you all to
listen to me.
Rule number one
No
one is allowed to stick their
fingers into the cages.
I don't
care how cute some of these animals
may be, the fact is they don't like
being here, no matter how many
ribbons some of them have won...
CUT TO
MITCHELL speaks into his cellular phone.
MITCHELL
Zoe...Zoe, where are you?
CUT TO
WANDA and HARTLEY OTTO are waiting for the school bus with
their adopted son BEAR.
The bus arrives, and the door opens to reveal DOLORES
DRISCOLL, who is driving.
DOLORES
Good morning, Wanda.
Hi, Hartley.
WANDA
Hi, Dolores.
DOLORES watches as WANDA and HARTLEY OTTO affectionately say
goodbye to their boy.
WANDA gives BEAR a photograph, which
has strong psychedelic influences.
BEAR shows it proudly to
DOLORES.
WANDA (CONT'D)
What do you think?
DOLORES
Well, it's certainly what you'd call
interesting.
WANDA
(laughing)
You hate it.
DOLORES
I didn't say that.
WANDA
I could wrap it up.
Protect the
other kids.
DOLORES
I'll just strap it on the roof.
WANDA
It's for the school bazaar.
DOLORES
Oh, it's bizarre alright.
C'mon
Bear.
Let's get you out of here.
WANDA
Away from your crazy Mom.
DOLORES
(voice over)
The Ottos always waited for the bus
with Bear.
They were the only
parents who did that, together like
that.
I guess they're what you
might call hippies.
MITCHELL
(voice over)
What do you mean by that, Mrs.
Driscoll?
CUT TO
The camera is outside the bus, looking at BEAR as he
finishes waving to his parents.
ANGLE ON
BEAR'S P.O.V. of WANDA and HARTLEY disappearing as the bus
pulls away.
CUT TO
JESSICA and MASON are seen waving at...
BILLY ANSEL, driving behind them in his pick up truck.
He
waves back at his children.
DOLORES
(voice over)
Billy Ansel started honking at us up
around Upper Hat Creek.
He always
started to do that when he caught up
to the bus.
He'd wave at his kids,
Jessica and Mason, who always sat at
the back.
Normally, he followed us
the whole distance over the ridge
towards the school.
CUT TO
Through the windshield, the camera fixes on BILLY'S face as
he stares at his children.
ANGLE ON
Inside the cab of his pick up, BILLY dials a number on his
cell phone.
He continues to wave at his children as he
speaks into the phone.
BILLY
(into the phone)
Hi...Can you talk?
I'm on my way to
work...I'm waving at them
now...What's that noise?
CUT TO
RISA is on a cordless phone.
She has just finished cleaning
a room.
WENDELL is hammering in the background.
RISA
Wendell's working on the roof.
He
thinks he's fixing a leak.
As far
as I'm concerned he's just punching
in a few new holes.
CUT TO
HELICOPTER AERIAL SHOT
The bus and the pick-up are travelling through a beautiful
mountain pass.
CUT TO
MITCHELL approaches the house of HARTLEY and WANDA OTTO.
He
gets out of his car and knocks on the door.
WANDA OTTO answers.
She has been crying.
The two stare at
each other.
MITCHELL
Mrs. Otto, my name is Mitchell
Stephens.
The Walkers told me you
might be willing to talk to me.
Pause.
MITCHELL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry for coming over
unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto,
but the Walkers said you would
understand.
I know it's an awful
time, but it's important that we
talk.
WANDA
Who are you?
MITCHELL
I'm a lawyer.
WANDA
You can't come here.
MITCHELL
Please, let me explain.
I'll only
take a moment of your time.
WANDA
No.
MITCHELL
Please.
WANDA pauses, stares at MITCHELL, then lets him in.
CUT TO
MITCHELL leaves the house and moves to his car.
He gets
inside and closes the door.
Once inside, MITCHELL opens his briefcase and takes out an
agreement for the OTTOS.
Something inside the briefcase
catches his attention.
ANGLE ON
A photograph of ZOE.
MITCHELL stares at this photograph.
MITCHELL
(voice over)
I've done everything the loving
father of a drug addict is supposed
to do...
CUT TO
BILLY is chasing his kids around the yard of their house.
NICOLE appears, and watching BILLY play with JESSICA and
MASON.
BILLY notices her, and runs up breathlessly,
BILLY
Hi, Nicole.
NICOLE
Hi, Mr. Ansel.
Hi, Jessica,
Mason...
BILLY
They just finished supper.
NICOLE
(to the kids)
Was it good?
The children shake their heads.
NICOLE and BILLY laugh.
BILLY
I'll be back around nine.
NICOLE
Okay.
CUT TO
BILLY is walking along a path behind the hotel, making sure
that he is not seen.
He sneaks into Room 11.
CUT TO
RISA'S DAYDREAM.
A montage of various events, watched from
the window in Room 11.
RISA is seen talking to BILLY on her
cordless phone (Scene 34), as well as going through various
activities.
Finally, RISA is seen putting her son, SEAN,
into the schoolbus.
As the bus pulls away, RISA waves
goodbye.
RISA turns around and walks to the camera.
She
stops in front of the lens and stares into it, her
expression calm and serene.
CUT TO
SAM drives up the driveway to the Burnell home.
He opens
the door, and takes a blanket from the back.
NICOLE gets
out as well.
The two walk towards the barn.
NICOLE
(voice over)
Once more he stept into the street,
And to his lips again
Laid his long pipe of smooth
straight cane;
And ere he blew three notes
such sweet soft notes as yet
musician's cunning
Never gave the enraptured air -
There was a rustling, seemed like a
bustling
Of merry crowds justling at pitching
and hustling,
Small feet were pattering, wooden
shoes clattering,
Little hands clapping and little
tongues chattering,
And, like fowls in a farm-yard when
the barley is scattering,
Out came the children running.
All the little boys and girls,
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,
And sparkling eyes and teeth like
pearls.
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily
after
The wonderful music with shouting
and laughter...
Inside the barn, SAM and NICOLE are engaged in a sexual
embrace.
The camera glides past them as NICOLE's voice
continues to read from the poem.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
(voice over)
When, lo, as they reached the
mountain-side,
A wondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern was suddenly
hollowed;
And the Piper advanced and the
children followed,
And when all were in to the very
last,
The door in the mountain-side shut
fast...
CUT TO
A HELICOPTER shot of the schoolbus making its way through
the winter terrain.
DOLORES' voice is heard over this
sweeping panoramic shot.
DOLORES
(voice over)
By the time I reached the bottom of
Bartlett Hill Road, I had half my
load, over twenty kids, aboard.
CUT TO
WINTER ROAD -- MORNING
The bus comes to a stop where a couple of children in bright
snow suits are waiting by the side of the road.
DOLORES
opens the door and the kids climb in.
OMITTED
DOLORES
(voice over)
They had walked to their places on
the main road from the smaller lanes
DOLORES
and private roadways that run off
it.
Bright little clusters of three
and four children - like berries
waiting to be plucked.
CUT TO
The bus pulls up across the road from the Bide-A-Wile Motel.
DOLORES watches as RISA walks her little boy, SEAN, across
the road to the bus.
DOLORES
(voice over)
Anyhow, my next stop was across from
the Bide-A-Wile, which is owned and
operated by Risa and Wendell Walker.
Risa walked her little boy, Sean,
across the road, which was
customary.
Sean had some kind of
learning disability.
DOLORES
He was behind all the other kids his
age in school and was too fragile
and nervous to play sports.
CUT TO
DOLORES opens the door for SEAN.
RISA is wearing a down
parka over her nightgown and bathrobe and is wearing
slippers.
RISA
Morning, Dolores.
DOLORES
Hi, Risa.
Aren't your feet
freezing?
RISA looks down at her slippers.
RISA
I guess they are.
SEAN gets to the landing of the bus, then turns around and
looks at his mother.
He extends his hands like a baby
wanting to be hugged.
SEAN
I want to stay with you.
Pause.
RISA stares at her son with great intensity and
feeling.
RISA
Go on now, Sean.
Go on.
SEAN turns away and looks into the bus full of children.
NICOLE
C'mon, Sean.
Sit next to me.
MASON is sitting beside NICOLE.
NICOLE whispers something
to him, and he makes his way for SEAN.
MASON goes to the back of the bus and sits beside his
sister, JESSICA.
SEAN moves tentatively towards NICOLE.
ANGLE ON
Back on DOLORES and RISA.
DOLORES
Is he okay?
RISA
I don't know.
DOLORES
Temperature?
RISA
No.
He's not sick or anything.
It's just one of those mornings, I
guess.
CUT TO
JESSICA and MASON, BILLY'S children, wave at their father
from the back of the bus.
CUT TO
BILLY waving back at his children.
His expression suddenly
changes as he sees...
CUT TO
From BILLY'S point of view, the schoolbus smashes through
the guardrail and the snowbank.
It plummets down the
embankment to the frozen-over pond.
Still upright, the bus slides across the ice to the far
side.
The ice lets go and the rear half of the yellow bus
is swallowed at once by the freezing water.
The sound of
the ice breaking is terrifying.
DOLORES
(voice over)
It emerged from the blowing snow on
the right side of the road.
It
might have been a dog or a small
deer or maybe even a lost child.
It
might have been an optical illusion
or a mirage.
Whatever it was, for
the rest of my life I will remember
that red-brown blur...
An eerie silence as the camera stares at the scene of the
accident.
CUT TO
An open sky.
BILLY ANSEL'S face appears in the frame,
looking down at the camera.
ANGLE ON
The camera is staring down at BILLY as he identifies the
bodies of his two children.
The camera is at a great height.
As BILLY walks away, the camera floats down, slowly moving
on his face.
CUT TO
BILLY's P.O.V. of his wife, LYDIA, tugging a sled through
the snow.
JESSICA and MASON are on either side of her.
The three figures are seen from behind, trudging their way
through the winter landscape.
This image has a ghostly quality to it.
It is filmed in
slow motion.
Suddenly, a snowball enters the frame and hits LYDIA on the
back of the head.
She turns around, laughing into the
camera.
CUT TO
MITCHELL is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder.
The bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact.
Most
of the windows in the rear have gone.
There is a ghostly
quality to this image, as though the video light is
searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck.
MITCHELL turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent
night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus.
He hears
a truck approaching the garage from the distance.
It's
BILLY ANSEL.
MITCHELL retreats to his parked car as BILLY
stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the
truck.
BILLY leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows
over the inside passenger seats.
BILLY stares at the bus a
long time.
MITCHELL approaches him.
MITCHELL
I'm here about your children, Mr.
Ansel.
BILLY takes a moment, then turns around to face MITCHELL.
The two men stare at each other.
MITCHELL (CONT'D)
My name is...
BILLY
Mister, I don't want to know your
name.
MITCHELL
I understand.
BILLY
No you don't.
MITCHELL
I can help you.
BILLY
Not unless you can raise the dead.
MITCHELL hands BILLY a card.
MITCHELL
Here.
You may change your mind.
BILLY looks at the card.
BILLY
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire,
would you be likely to sue me if I
was to beat you right now?
Beat you
so bad that you pissed blood and
couldn't walk for a month.
Because
that's what I'm about to do.
MITCHELL
No, Mr. Ansel.
I wouldn't sue you.
BILLY
Leave us alone, Stephens.
Leave the
people of this town alone.
You
can't help.
MITCHELL
You can help each other.
Several
people have agreed to let me
represent them in a negligence suit.
Your case as an individual will be
stronger if I'm allowed to represent
you together as a group.
BILLY
Case?
MITCHELL
The Walkers have agreed.
The Ottos.
Nicole Burnell's parents.
It's
important to initiate proceedings
right away.
Things get covered up.
People lie.
That's why we have to
begin our investigation quickly.
Before the evidence disappears.
That's why I'm out here tonight.
BILLY
I know Risa and Wendell Walker.
They wouldn't hire a goddamned
lawyer.
And the Ottos wouldn't deal
with you.
We're not country
bumpkins you can put a big city
hustle on.
You're trying to use us.
MITCHELL
You're angry, Mr. Ansel.
You owe it
to yourself to feel that way.
All
I'm saying is let me direct your
rage.
BILLY stares at MITCHELL with a cold intensity.
The cell
phone in MITCHELL'S car begins to ring.
MITCHELL (CONT'D)
That's my daughter.
Or it may be
the police to tell me that they've
found her dead.
She's a drug
addict.
BILLY
Why are you telling me this?
MITCHELL
I'm telling you this because...
we've all lost our children, Mr.
Ansel.
MITCHELL
They're dead to us.
They kill each
other in the streets.
They wander
comatose in shopping malls.
They're
paralyzed in front of televisions.
Something terrible has happened
that's taken our children away.
It's too late.
They're gone.
The phone continues to ring, as BILLY stares at MITCHELL.
MITCHELL turns to look at the ringing phone.
CUT TO
MITCHELL leaves the DRISCOLL house, watched by DOLORES.
NICOLE arrives at home.
The car pulls up in front of the
modest house.
SAM opens the door and puts the wheelchair up next to it.
He points out the ramp he has built for NICOLE.
The ramp is painted green.
SAM
How do you like it, Nicole?
NICOLE
The ramp?
SAM
Pretty slick, eh?
NICOLE
Very slick.
SAM
Do you like the colour?
NICOLE
It's okay.
SAM
And I had to widen a few doors.
You'll see.
CUT TO
NICOLE wheels her chair to the exterior porch, where she
watches her sister climb a tree.
SAM follows her outside.
SAM
It's because of the accident,
Nicole.
Most people in this town
whose kids were on the bus have got
lawyers.
A lot of people...well,
people in this town are very angry.
Us included.
NICOLE
But you didn't lose me.
MARY
No, honey.
And we will thank the
Lord for that every day and night
for the rest of our lives.
But you
almost died, and you were badly
injured, and you won't be...you
can't...
NICOLE
I can't walk anymore.
ANGLE ON
NICOLE'S P.O.V. of JENNY playing on a tree branch.
SAM
You're going to need special care
for a long time to come.
It's not
going to be easy.
Not for you, not
for any of us.
Because we love you
so much.
And it's going to cost
money.
More than we can imagine.
NICOLE
What about insurance?
Doesn't
insurance pay for these things?
SAM
Partly.
But there's a lot the
insurance doesn't cover.
That's one
of the reasons we have a lawyer.
To
make sure the insurance gets paid
and to help us look after the rest.
NICOLE
How will he do that?
SAM
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing
several families.
The Ottos, the
Walkers, us, and I think a couple
more.
Mr. Stephens is suing the
town for negligence.
He's sure that
the accident could have been avoided
if they had done their jobs right.
He's a very smart man.
NICOLE stares at her sister who's at the top of the tree.
JENNY turns to look back at NICOLE.
There's a tension, as it seems as though JENNY is going to
let herself fall.
NICOLE
(voice over)
That's the first thing I heard about
you.
That you were a smart man.
That you
were so smart that you
were going to sue the town, then
make us all feel better...
CUT TO
FLASHBACK to the scene outside the gas station between
MITCHELL and BILLY.
The cell phone in MITCHELL'S car has begun to ring.
The two
men stare at each other.
NICOLE
(voice over)
You're good at that.
Good at
getting people to believe you could
do something for them.
Something
they could never do for themselves.
MITCHELL breaks the silence.
MITCHELL
That's my daughter.
Or it may be
the police to tell me that they've
found her dead.
She's a drug
addict.
BILLY
Why are you telling me this?
MITCHELL
I'm telling you this because we've
all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
CUT TO
Back to the scene between BILLY and MITCHELL.
The cellular
phone is ringing.
MITCHELL breaks the stare with BILLY and
moves to his car.
The camera follows him, as BILLY moves back to his truck in
the background.
MITCHELL gets in his car and picks up the
phone.
MITCHELL
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
ZOE
Daddy?
CUT TO
MITCHELL
Yes.
ZOE
I'm calling because I've got some
news for you, Daddy.
Some big news.
MITCHELL
News?
ZOE
Don't you want to hear?
MITCHELL
Yes.
Give me your news, Zoe.
ZOE
You always think you know what I'm
going to say, don't you?
You always
think you're two steps ahead of me.
The lawyer.
MITCHELL
Tell me your news, Zoe.
ZOE
Okay.
I went to sell blood
yesterday.
That's how it is.
I'm
in this fucking city where my father
is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm
selling my blood.
MITCHELL
That's not news, Zoe.
ZOE
No.
But this is.
They wouldn't
take my blood.
CUT TO
MITCHELL drives up to the BURNELL home.
He gets out of his
car and walks to the front door.
SAM has repainted the ramp.
It is now red.
CUT TO
REPLAY of the scene of SEAN WALKER entering the bus.
He
turns around to face his mother.
SEAN
I want to stay with you.
RISA
Go on now.
Go on.
SEAN hesitantly turns to face the inside of the bus.
He
sees NICOLE BURNELL, who pats the seat beside her.
MASON leaves his place beside NICOLE to make way for SEAN.
NICOLE
C'mon, Sean, sit next to me.
ANGLE ON
DOLORES as she watches SEAN move towards NICOLE.
CUT TO
AERIAL VIEW of the bus as it makes its way through the
mountains.
NICOLE'S voice is heard reading The Pied Piper
from the scene with the ANSEL children.
NICOLE
(voice over)
For he led us, he said, to a joyous
land,
Joining the town and just at hand,
Where waters gushed and fruit-trees
grew,
And flowers put forth a fairer hue,
And everything was strange and
new...
CUT TO
BILLY pulls up to the BURNELL home.
He gets out of his pick
up and approaches the house.
CUT TO
BILLY walks to his car.
SAM and MARY watch him from the
porch/ramp.
SAM
(calling out)
We're getting on with our lives,
Billy.
Maybe it's time you got on
with yours.
BILLY turns around, looks at SAM one final time, then moves
to his pick up.
CUT TO
SAM is carrying NICOLE up the stairs of the community
centre.
There is no ramp, so the wheelchair is left at the bottom.
He is having difficulty, because NICOLE is keeping her body
stiff and won't hold on to him.
CUT TO
NICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre.
She
stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps.
NICOLE
(voice over)
Daddy took a long time.
I guess he
wanted to have a few words with you.
He must have tried to tell you that
I was lying.
Then you would tell
Daddy that it didn't matter if I was
lying or not, the lawsuit is dead.
As NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and
MITCHELL arguing is seen.
The movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE'S voice
over.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
(voice over)
Everyone's lawsuit is dead.
Forget
it.
Tell the others to forget it.
It's over.
Right now, Sam, the
thing you've got to worry about is
why she lied.
A kid who'd do that
to her own father is not normal,
Sam.
SAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down
at the driver's seat.
NICOLE stares at him as he starts the
car.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
(voice over)
But Daddy knows who lied.
He knows
who the liar is.
He knows who's
normal.
SAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
(speaking to SAM)
I hope he lets us keep the computer.
SAM turns to look at NICOLE.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
I'd like an ice cream.
CUT TO
SAM wheels NICOLE along a path away from the same concession
stand that was seen at the beginning of the film.
NICOLE is
licking an ice-cream cone.
Around them, people are setting
up the bandstand.
NICOLE
Daddy, can we come to the fair?
SAM
Yes.
NICOLE
How about Sunday night?
That's
always the best time.
SAM
Okay.
NICOLE looks at a team of men constructing a ride.
A school
bus pulls up, and a group of children spill out.
NICOLE
watches as the driver tries to form them into a group.
NICOLE
What's going to happen to Dolores?
SAM
I don't know.
NICOLE
Will the police do anything to her?
SAM
It's too late for that.
She can't
drive the bus anymore.
The school
board saw to that right off.
NICOLE
She'll move away.
SAM
There's talk of that.
NICOLE
Someplace where no one knows her.
(beat)
Someplace strange and new.
SAM is frozen.
NICOLE smiles to herself.
CUT TO
At the airport, in the arrivals bay, MITCHELL waits for his
limousine.
Across the road, a hotel minibus is parked.
The driver is
DOLORES.
The camera settles on her face as she stares at
MITCHELL.
MITCHELL catches her gaze, and the two stare at each other.
NICOLE
(voice over)
As you see each other, almost two
years later, I wonder if you realize
something.
MITCHELL'S limo arrives.
He gets inside.
CUT TO
BILLY watches as a crane lifts the demolished schoolbus onto
a flatbed truck.
NICOLE
(voice over)
A town of people living in the sweet
hereafter.
CUT TO
NICOLE and SAM driving home from the fairground.
NICOLE
(voice over)
Whether others defend us, protect
us, love us or hate us - they do it
to meet their own needs, not ours.
The camera leaves the car to look up at the sky.
CUT TO
Sunday night at the fairground.
NICOLE is staring at the
ferris wheel.
In her imagination, the swinging cars of the
slowly turning wheel are full of children.
The laughter and
noise is haunting.
NICOLE smiles as she stares at this private apparition.
NICOLE
(voice over)
This is what I learned.
This is
what I found out.
CUT TO
