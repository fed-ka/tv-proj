      THE MISSING CASKET

      rolls along, resting on a tractor-drawn CARGO-DOLLY, the
      heavy Empire-style ground-seasoned casket comes to rest in
      front of

      JOE DAWSON

      watching solemnly as a CUSTOMS MAN tests the SEALS on the
      casket, then hands Dawson a shipping-form.  Dawson isn't in
      the greatest frame of mind as he signs and returns the papers.

                                      DAWSON
                    Let's get this over with.

      As the CUSTOMS MAN walks off --

                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    If I'd known, I would have sent
                    flowers.

      Dawson turns to see MacLeod and Richie watching him.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    My sympathies.  Anyone we know?

      Dawson is taken aback to see them, then tries to recover his
      poise.

                                      DAWSON
                    This is personal business, MacLeod. 
                    It doesn't concern you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think it does.
                          (harder)
                    Anything to do with Horton concerns
                    me.

      Dawson sees he's caught.

                                      DAWSON
                    His daughter moved to Chicago.  She
                    wants her father buried there.  I'm
                    helping her out.
                          (beat)
                    It's a family thing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A family thing.
                          (beat)
                    Then why hide it from me?

                                      DAWSON
                    Because I know what Horton did to
                    you.  I know how you felt about him.

      MacLeod moves casually to the coffin.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Very considerate.

                                      DAWSON
                    What's with you?  The guy was my
                      brother-in-law.  His daughter wants
                    his body brought home.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then she's going to be disappointed.

      Dawson looks at Richie.

                                      DAWSON
                    What the hell's his problem?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I saw him, Dawson.  I saw Horton.
                          (beat)
                    He's alive.

                                      DAWSON
                    What?
                          (beat)
                    Horton is dead, MacLeod.
                          (a low hiss)
                    You killed him yourself!  Remember,
                    I was there.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He looked pretty healthy last night.

                                      DAWSON
                    This is insane!  Whatever's left of
                    Horton is lying in that box!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Really.
                          (grim)
                    Then let's wish him bon voyage.

      He grabs a metal PRY-BAR from the DOLLY and starts to RIP
      OPEN the seals.

                                      DAWSON
                    MacLeod, what the hell are you doing!

      MacLeod moves around the dolly, WRENCHING the seals open,
      working his way along the lid.

      BYSTANDERS and MAINTENANCE WORKERS watch in horror, except
      for

      AN ENORMOUSLY FAT MAN

      who seems amused.  On his finger, a ring with a large RED
      stone that seems to GLOW in reflected light.

      A WHISTLE sounds and several SECURITY GUARDS approach.  The
      Customs Man grabs MacLeod's arm.

                                      CUSTOMS MAN
                    Monsieur!

      MacLeod shakes the man off, snaps the last seal, THROWS OPEN
      the casket lid -- and steps back in surprise.

      ANGLE - THE OPEN CASKET

      and the shocking reveal of the NEAR-MUMMIFIED REMAINS of a
      man in a faded suit.

      SECURITY GUARDS grab MacLeod's arms.  He doesn't resist as
      they start to pull him away, past the fat man with the RED
      ring.


      MacLeod and Richie wait outside the glass-walled VIEWING
      ROOM where a SHEET-DRAPED CORPSE lies on a gurney.  A bald,
      black, bizarre-looking male, in his thirties.  No visible
      trauma.

      The MEDICAL OFFICER frowns at MacLeod as he removes his
      gloves.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    A murder victim?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He was brought in late last night. 
                    I need to find out who he was.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    I'm sorry, monsieur... but there
                    were no murder victims last night.

      MacLeod and Richie trade looks.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There must be some mistake.

                                      RICHIE
                    A man, about sixty, medium height,
                    grey hair... ?

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                          (beat)
                    Ah, the one who collapsed by Notre
                    Dame.  Jason Landry.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then you did see him.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    He was identified just this morning.
                          (beat)
                    But there was no murder.  Death was
                    due to natural causes.

      BEAT.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But I saw the marks on his throat...
                      bruises... the man was strangled!

      The Medical Officer is losing patience.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    Monsieur, I examined the body myself. 
                    Jason Landry died of a stroke.
                          (cold)
                    There were no marks of any kind.

      MacLeod is starting to feel the walls closing in.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Could I see the body?

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    I'm afraid not.  It was claimed by
                    his granddaughter for cremation.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (under his breath)
                    How convenient.

      He starts to turn away.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER
                    Did you say something?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I was wondering if you had an address. 
                    I'd like to pay my respects.

      The Officer weighs this, shrugs.  He turns to a desk, bending
      to examine some forms.  As he bends down --

      MacLeod's gaze travels to the VIEWING ROOM.

      MACLEOD'S POV - THE CORPSE

      lying on the gurney.  As MacLeod watches, the corpse's head
      slowly SWIVELS TOWARD him.  Then the eyes SNAP OPEN.  They
      are blood RED and staring directly at MacLeod -- it is
      WATCHING HIM.

      MACLEOD

      starts back, his hackles rising.

                                      MEDICAL OFFICER (O.S.)
                    Monsieur?

      A BEAT -- MacLeod realizes the Officer is holding a note for
      him, Richie is staring at him.

                    Mac?  Are you okay?

      MacLeod quickly looks back into the viewing room --

      MACLEOD'S POV - THE CORPSE

      the head is back where it was, the eyes closed -- all is as
      it was before.

      A wave of unreality sweeps over MacLeod.  He shakes it off.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let's get out of here.

                                      RICHIE
                    Twist my arm.

      Richie sees MacLeod's concern and reacts.  He grabs the piece
      of paper from the Medical officer and hurries after MacLeod.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    First thing in the morning we'll
                    check out the old guy.  Talk to his
                      granddaughter.
                          (beat)
                    Whatever it is, we'll figure it out.


      MacLeod moves to the bar and pours himself a drink, looks
      out the porthole at the Quai.  Wondering if he imagined all
      this.  Time to get a grip.

      Then, a REFLECTION in the porthole, over his shoulder:

      KRONOS

      in his Bronze Age Horseman garb and face paint, looking every
      bit the Ancient Evil that he is.

      MACLEOD

      whirls.  Kronos leans casually against the counter, regarding
      MacLeod.

                                      KRONOS
                    Did you really think you could kill
                    me, MacLeod?  I am the apocalypse.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (tight)
                    You're not real.

      Kronos lifts his nasty-edged modern-day sword.

                                      KRONOS
                    Try me.

      MacLeod pulls his katana without looking.

      He feels something wrong in his hand.  He looks down and
      finds he is holding

      HORTON'S MUMMIFIED HEAD

      by the hair.  He throws it across the room.  But what hits
      the wall of the barge is not the head but his katana.

      There is the sound of mocking laughter from outside as MacLeod
      looks up to find Kronos gone.

      MACLEOD

      snatches up the fallen katana and races outside.


      ALLISON LANDRY, early 20's, sits over a cup of tea, in a big
      sweatshirt, torn jeans, her shock and grief written all over. 
      MacLeod paces, agitated.

                                      ALLISON
                    You're telling me you think someone
                    killed my grandfather?
                          (dubious)
                    The police said it was a stroke.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know what they said.  But I was
                    there.  Someone attacked him.
                          (beat; trying to do
                            this gently)
                    Did he ever mention a man named James
                    Horton?

      She shakes her head.  MacLeod sketches hastily on the back
      of a piece of paper, shows her a CRUDE SKETCH of the Watcher
      symbol.  The sound of a police SIREN echoes in the distance.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    What about this symbol?  Do you know
                    it?

      He watches her reaction.  Her denial seems genuine:

                                      ALLISON
                    No.

      She looks at him a moment, reacting to his intensity.  There's
      something she's not saying.

                                      ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    Before he died... did he say anything?

      She holds her breath, both anticipating and fearing his
      answer.  MacLeod reacts, sensing there's a revelation coming.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What kind of thing?

                    What did he say?

                    He told me the time was at hand.  He
                    said "he" was coming.
                          (off Allison's look)
                    Who did he mean?  Who was he afraid
                    of?

      Allison rises, starts pacing.

                                      ALLISON
                    You won't believe it.  No one would.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You'd be surprised what I'll believe.

                    My grandfather was an archaeologist.

                    could see it.

                    He traveled to India, and Egypt, and
                    Iraq, searching ancient texts for
                    some kind of warning, some hint of
                    how to defeat this great evil he
                    thought was coming.

                    "You must stop him... you alone."

      Allison stares at him in wonder and shock.

                                      ALLISON
                    He said that to you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He was upset.

                                      ALLISON
                    He was desperate.

                    Come with me.

      MacLeod follows her into --


      A large room, shelved with books, decades of study and
      diligent collection.  On other shelves and on the walls STONE
      CARVINGS, fragments of CLAY TABLETS with ancient writing. 
      Against one wall, a TELEVISION and VCR.  The TV is on. 
      Pictures of the faces of African famine are in black & white,
      replaced by pictures of terrorism in the Middle East.  In
      both segments, we catch glimpses of something RED and glowing
      from a window or a passing car.

                                      NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                    The United Nations High Commission
                    for Refugees estimates there will be
                    an additional eight million refugees
                    this year, more than half children.
                          (beat)
                    In Jerusalem, a terrorist bomb
                    exploded on a busy street.

      As Allison turns off the TV, MacLeod is thumbing through
      various books on the table.

                                      ALLISON
                    I keep it on just for noise, but I
                    think the news just makes me more
                      depressed.

      There's a battered, leather-bound NOTEBOOK on the table. 
      Landry's journal.  MacLeod leafs through it, his eyes falling
      on various entries.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Chaldean, Babylonian... that one's

                      Zoroastrian myths of ancient Persia
                    held the truth about a cycle of evil
                    that visits the earth every thousand
                    years.

      MacLeod stops leafing through the book, staring at the final
      entry.

      INSERT - THE PAGE

      A drawing of an ancient tablet, in an ancient language. 
      Landry's translation scrawled in the margins: "THE NEXT
      WARRIOR???"  And below it, the CAMERA PANS DOWN to find
      Landry's last note, heavily underlined, one word:   
      "MACLEOD."

      ON MACLEOD

      reacting.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Where would your grandfather have
                    found my name?

      Allison looks over his shoulder, sees what he's looking at.

                                      ALLISON
                          (awed)
                    It is you.  He found you.

                                      MACLEOD

                    What are you talking about?  Where
                    is this from?

      She picks up a VIDEO CASSETTE from the table and slides it
      into the VCR DECK by the TV.

                                      ALLISON
                    Right out of the "X-Files."

      CLOSE - THE TV SCREEN

      it displays a HAND-HELD VIDEO of --


      A HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA follows LANDRY as he moves down a
      murky STONE CORRIDOR holding an electric LANTERN aloft.

                                      ALLISON (O.S.)
                    This was six months ago, in Iraq.

      Light flickers eerily over the walls, highlighting STRANGE
      SCRIPT and RELIEF CARVINGS depicting WINGED BULLS and other
      fantastic animals.

                                      LANDRY
                    He knows we're here.

      We hear the voice of the unseen British CAMERAMAN named FOSTER
      making a joke.

                                      FOSTER (O.S.)
                    I hope he's made lunch, because I'm
                    bloody hungry.

      As they reach a section of wall --

                                      LANDRY
                    You're a fool, Foster.  You make
                    jokes when the fate of the world is
                    at stake.

                                      FOSTER (O.S.)
                    Better a fool then a lunatic.  What
                    we have to be afraid of is the damn
                    Iraqi army.

      Landry raises his light to a section of WALL where we see --

        A RELIEF-CARVING

      of a HEAD, distorted and monstrous in the flickering shadows --
      in the center of its forehead is a third, almost glowing,
      RED EYE.  The demon holds a large barbed arrow in each hand.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

      THE SAME CARVING

      No longer on video.

                          (awed)
                    Would you look at that.

      NEW ANGLE

      Landry and Foster stand in the dim tomb, lit only by Landry's
      flashlight and the light atop the camera.

                                      LANDRY
                    You see?


                                                                (CONTINUED)96518      "Archangel"      22.      Final Shooting Script 1/22/97

                                      FOSTER
                    What the hell is that thing?

      Landry raises his light: on either side of the CARVED HEAD,
      there are rows of SYMBOLS resembling cuneiform script.  (This
      is the tablet that was drawn in the final journal entry.)

      Landry runs his hands over the symbols, deciphering as he
      does --

                                      LANDRY
                      Ragmaith... alopa...
                          (then, with quiet awe)
                    Ahriman.
                          (beat)
                    It's him, Foster.  It's him.

      Landry turns away from the carved demon and moves to a loose
      section of STONE inscribed with ancient writing, starts to
      pry it out with a chisel.  Foster follows him.

                                      LANDRY (CONT'D)
                    Are you afraid, Foster?  We should
                    all be afraid.
                          (beat)
                    The thousand years are up.  The demon
                    is coming...
                          (grim)
                    And the dead will rise.

                                      FOSTER
                    You got an vivid imagination, old
                    man.
                          (irritated)
                    C'mon, get what you want and let's
                    get the hell out of here.

      Landry fingers the carved symbols as he works the stone free.

                                      LANDRY
                    You're not the first one to doubt
                    me, Foster.
                          (beat)
                    But it's real.

      As Landry talks

      FOSTER

      suddenly screams in pain, the camera dropping from his hands.

      Landry whirls --

                                      LANDRY
                    Foster!

      He kneels over the stricken man who has a large barbed arrow
      in his chest, not noticing that the light from the fallen
      camera illuminates

      THE CARVED DEMON

      still grinning evilly, but now gripping only a single stone
      arrow.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

      The image of the demon on the TV screen FLICKERS and then
      goes BLACK.


      RESUME MACLEOD

      as he turns from the TV MONITOR and runs his hands over the
      SAME STONE FRAGMENT we see lying on the table.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You believe this?

                          (re the notebook:)

                                      MACLEOD
                          (not buying it)
                    And he thought I was the one who
                    would defeat this thing.

                                      ALLISON
                    He was afraid it would kill him before
                    he found you.

      And off MacLeod's reaction, looking between Allison's earnest
      face and the telling journal in his hand --


      Richie pages through Landry's journal.  MacLeod's been up
      all night, and he's starting to look it.

                    night reading how I'm some kind of
                    champion who's supposed to defend
                    the whole world from who-knows-what?

                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    Maybe this is for real.

                    Don't start.

                    Look, Cassandra said there was some
                    kind of prophecy about you defeating
                    a great evil, right?  Four hundred
                    years ago, she knew who you were,
                    she knew what would happen.
                          (beat)
                    Maybe there's more to it.

      He flips open the NOTEBOOK.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Maybe you are the chosen one.  Maybe
                    this was all meant to happen.

      MacLeod looks at him a long moment.  Wants to laugh off the
      idea, but he can't.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What if I don't want to be chosen? 
                    I don't believe in fate and
                      prophecies.  I never did.

      ON THE NOTEBOOK

      On the open page is a charcoal sketch of the monstrous head
      we saw in the tomb.  Its middle eye glows.

      A shelter hollowed from rock, a couple of thick BRANCHES
      hiding the entrance.  MacLeod staggers in, looking for
      shelter.  As he does --

      THE BUZZ

      MacLeod doesn't know what it is or what it portends.  He's
      only felt it once before, from Kanwulf.

      MacLeod moves deeper into the cave, drawn by the unnerving
      sensation of the BUZZ, and finds --

      THE HERMIT

      A leathery older man, silver-haired and lean.  He sits by a
      small fire, a rabbit roasting on a spit.  On the floor beside
      him, a casting circle, and inside it a scattering of
      KNUCKLEBONES.

      The Hermit looks up mildly as MacLeod enters.

                    It took you long enough.

      MacLeod gives him a strange look.

                    Come by the fire.  It's not fit out
                    there for man nor spirit.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Aye.

      MacLeod moves forward hesitantly.  The Hermit gestures to
      the roasting rabbit.

                                      HERMIT
                    Help yourself.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Thank you.
                          (tearing off a piece)
                    I'd no idea anyone lived in these
                    parts.

                                      HERMIT
                    It's a good place for a man to lose
                    himself.

      MacLeod stops mid-chew.  Staring at this strange old man.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What d'ye mean?

                    You've been clanless and homeless
                    for three years.  But that's over
                    now.  Soon, he will find you, the
                    one who will teach you what you need
                    to know.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What one?  What are you talking about?

                    Connor MacLeod is a legend.

                    and I know your destiny.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No man knows that.

                                      HERMIT
                    What we are is written in the wind,
                    long before we walk this world.  The
                    roads we take... and where they lead
                    us.

                    For six hundred years, I have waited

                    You think I'm a mad old man, don't

                    Remember it well.  Sometimes the
                    truth sounds like madness.

      The Hermit reaches out and scoops up the BONES.  He shakes
      them and scatters them in the circle.

                                      HERMIT (CONT'D)
                    You are blessed and cursed.
                          (beat)
                    You will have time to prepare.  And
                    when your time comes, you must be
                    ready to face an evil beyond any you
                    can imagine.  And evil isn't black,
                    it's the color of blood.

      The words hang ominously in the air.  MacLeod is dubious,
      yet drawn in by the Hermit's intensity.  He rises to his
      feet.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What evil?  Tell me its name?

      The Hermit stands also, meeting MacLeod's gaze across the
      fire.

                                      HERMIT
                    It has no name.  None I can speak.

                    he must be fought.

      He pulls aside his cloak, baring his neck, and --

                    Raise that blade, and strike here. 
                    Take my head.  Taste the truth of
                    what you are.  When the time comes,
                    you will need my strength.

      MacLeod steps back.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I have no quarrel with you.

                    No!

      The Hermit reacts swiftly, raising his own sword.

                                      HERMIT
                    You must kill me, Highlander -- or
                    die.

      He attacks, driving MacLeod back with surprising strength. 
      MacLeod is on the defensive, hard-pressed.  And then, he
      sees an opening, and swings --

      The old man falls, beheaded.

      And MacLeod is engulfed in a Quickening.96518      "Archangel"      29.      Final Shooting Script 1/22/97

      As MacLeod and Richie share a look.


      Allison sits alone, turning the pages of a photo album,
      remembering better times.  She reacts as she hears voices
      from her grandfather's study.  She rises and moves toward
      them.


      Allison enters the study to find the voice is her
      grandfather's and it is coming from the television.

      She removes the tape from the VCR.  But the image keeps on
      playing.  It turns directly toward her.

      find

      LANDRY

      sitting behind her in his chair.  He pats the arms.

      that crashes shut.  She screams.

      ALLISON

      moves back to the door, grabs hold of the knob.  She tears
      at it, her fear now hysteria.  She is screaming.

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod enters the barge, looking like hell, moves to pour
      himself a drink.

                                      ALLISON (O.S.)
                    Having a hard day?

      MacLeod looks up to find

      ALLISON LANDRY

      dressed seductively in a night gown and waiting in his bed. 
      She wears a gold chain and on it a RED stone that almost
      glows in reflected light.  She raises the covers seductively.

                                      ALLISON
                    Join me.

                    Isn't it obvious?

      She gets out of bed and moves toward him.

      The phone RINGS.  MacLeod picks it up.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)

                          (looking at Allison)
                    You're sure?

      He hangs up the phone.

                    Does it matter?

      He closes his eyes tight for a moment as if to shut her out.

      He opens them again and sighs with relief to find

      THE BED

      empty.  Suddenly.

      PAIR OF FEMININE HANDS

      reach up from behind him and cover his eyes.

                                      ALLISON
                      Peek-a-boo.

      Revulsion and fear fills MacLeod as he tears her hands away
      and pushes her across the barge.  She falls into a large
      vase.  It breaks into pieces.

                                      ALLISON (CONT'D)

      She takes a step toward him, reaches out and rips the shirt
      off him.

                    Nice pecs.

      MacLeod stumbles back and picks up his sword.

      As she approaches him, he backs away, raising his sword. 
      With a smile, she offers him her neck.

      MacLeod leans on the counter.  Before him is Landry's book. 
      MacLeod is in a state of deep turmoil, unsure of his footing,
      not knowing what has happened to his world.  He holds the
      book in his hand.

      MacLeod moves to the fireplace.  Inside the fireplace --

      Flames.  Maybe the best thing would be to burn it.  He
      hesitates, the book in his hand, torn between wanting to
      destroy this thing, get it out of his life, and understanding
      it.  Finally --

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.

      As he stands there, he gets the BUZZ.

      MacLeod reacts, instinctively reaches for his sword -- then
      he forces himself to wait as the door opens --

      Methos and Dawson step in.  There's a moment of awkward
      silence broken by --

      MacLeod stares at him.

                    You think I'm in trouble?

      He starts to laugh at the absurdity.

                                      METHOS
                    You need help.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I've been reading, hearing... thinking

      The phone RINGS.  MacLeod picks up.


      A dark tunnel filled with dripping water, flickering light.

      MACLEOD

      moves warily along it, tense, not knowing what he'll face,
      what form it will take.  Then ahead of him... the BUZZ.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96518      "Archangel"      42.      Final Shooting Script 1/22/97

      He steps carefully into the main catacomb chamber --


      Richie is there, sitting slumped on a rock.  His head is
      lowered, he's leaning on his sword.  He looks exhausted or
      wounded.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Richie?

      Richie doesn't answer.  MacLeod lowers his sword and moves
      to help him.  As he comes closer, bends to help him --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Are you all right?

      Richie suddenly straightens -- and SWINGS at him.

      MacLeod dodges back -- and the sword sings past his head,
      missing him by inches.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Richie, it's me!

      Richie moves back, taking a stance.  He holds MacLeod's eyes.

                                      RICHIE
                    I know.

      There's no apology there, no remorse in his eyes.  Just cold
      hate.  It's Richie's voice -- but subtly ALTERED (IN POST)
      into a rasp infused with a cold malevolence.  MacLeod knows
      instantly what it is.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's you.

      The "False Richie  smiles with contempt.

                                      RICHIE
                    "Me?

                    You don't even understand your place

      He suddenly moves in, swinging, driving MacLeod back.  He
      fights with will and hate -- using Richie's skills, but
      sharpened and driven by an evil will.

      MacLeod backs off, trying not to engage.  Whatever his senses
      tell him, this looks like Richie he can't bring himself to
      swing.

                    Having trouble?

      The False Richie feints and swings and --

      MACLEOD

      takes the blade in the shoulder.  He steps back, clutching
      the wound, the pain searing through him.

                                      RICHIE
                    Some champion.

      MacLeod's hesitation vanishes.  This is evil he's fighting,
      and he knows he has to win.  He charges and they lock swords. 
      As they fight through the catacomb chamber

                                      MACLEOD
                    What the hell are you?

                                      RICHIE
                    I am your friend.  I am not your
                    friend.
                          (beat)
                    I'm the man you can't kill.

      There's an eerie alteration in his voice.  In his face.  For
      a moment, he looks and sounds like Horton -- the man who
      originally said that.

      MacLeod attacks with renewed vigor, driving the False Richie
      back toward the wall.  He has the advantage -- and there's a
      moment of fear on the face of his opponent.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (adamant)
                    Everyone can die.  One way or another.

      He cuts the False Richie across the midsection and the demon
      reacts to the blow with a howl of pain -- he's not
        invulnerable after all.  MacLeod raises his sword to score a
      decisive blow --

      When he's suddenly alerted by the SOUND of another sword
      cutting the air behind him.

      He whirls, changing the cut to a parry, just in time to
      deflect the sword coming toward his neck.  He finds himself
      facing

      KRONOS

      Decked out in his Bronze Age gear, but with his nasty-edged
      modern-day sword in his hand.  Death incarnate.  He may not
      be real, but he's damn good with a sword.

      MacLeod is on the defensive, barely deflecting Kronos' attack. 
      Behind him, the False Richie is recovering, healing, raising
      his sword to rejoin the battle.


      The REAL RICHIE heads warily along the tunnel, his sword
      out.  Then he hears it, coming from down the tunnel -- the
      CLASH OF SWORDS.  His heart drops.

                                      RICHIE
                    MacLeod.

      He raises his sword and hurries down the tunnel.


      MacLeod manages to duck under Kronos' head shot and take
      cover behind a stone pillar.  As Kronos comes after him,
      MacLeod rears back and slices through the pillar, sending a
      shower of stone and dust down on his opponent, delaying him.

      Before he can celebrate his momentary reprieve --

      BANG!

      A bullet catches him in the side.

      JAMES HORTON

      emerges from the nearest tunnel, gun in hand.

      On MacLeod's other side, the False Richie and Kronos are
      emerging from the settling cloud of pulverized stone.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What the hell are you?!

      He's got his back pressed to the wall, sword up, desperately
      trying to be ready to defend himself against the three armed
      opponents stalking toward him.

                                      HORTON
                    I am Set.  I am Ahriman.  I am

                    and I shall go on existing when time

                    you cannot stop me.

      The False Richie feints at MacLeod.  MacLeod falls back
      against the wall.  The False Richie swings, and MacLeod dodges
      aside -- the sword strikes the wall where his head was.  The
      False Richie turns and slips away into the black tunnel.

      MacLeod charges after him.


      FOLLOWING MACLEOD

      as he races down the dark corridor, sword up and ready to
      swing.  He's in pain, desperate to catch this thing, knowing
      he must finish it -- that more rides on this victory than
      anything he has faced before.

      He reaches a CORNER in the tunnel, comes around it --

      RICHIE

      comes the other way, his sword raised and ready to swing --

      MACLEOD swings first -- and Richie falls.  Time stops.

      MacLeod looks down at the dead "demon."

      He should feel triumph -- but there is a wrenching, sickening
      sensation.  For a moment he thinks something terribly wrong
      has happened.  Then he sees --

      RICHIE, standing a few feet away at the mouth of the tunnel. 
      Watching him.

      MacLeod is flooded with enormous relief.

                      Richie....

      Then the other Richie LAUGHS.  It is a hollow, chilling laugh,
      and the truth hits MacLeod: the demon tricked him.  The demon
      won.  He has killed his friend.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    No! NO!

      Even as the QUICKENING starts to hit him, he staggers forward
      as if he's fighting through a storm, raises his sword and
      with a cry of rage, he SWINGS --

      But there is nothing there.  For a moment, we hear the sound
      of the things's mocking LAUGHTER echoing in the tunnel.

      As MacLeod's face fills with agony, he's hit full on by the
      QUICKENING -- an agonizing blast of energy that picks him up
      in its grip like a doll, and shakes him -- as images of
      Horton, Kronos and the False Richie look on, savoring their
      victory.  They fade out... MacLeod is left alone and we

      FADE IN:


      Methos and Dawson step slowly into the catacomb chamber.  It
      is eerily, utterly silent.  Ahead of them, in the center of
      the room

      MACLEOD

      kneeling over the body of Richie.  His katana lies beside
      him.  Whatever he feels is beyond expression, beyond words,
      unsharable.

      Dawson closes his eyes in pain.  They stay that way for a
      long moment, in silence.

      Methos moves slowly to MacLeod, gently places a hand on his
      shoulder.  There is nothing he can say.

      MacLeod doesn't acknowledge him.  He picks up his katana,
      holds it a moment -- then lowers his head, leaving his neck
      vulnerable and waiting.  Without looking, he hands the hilt
      to Methos.

      Methos knows what he wants.  Maybe what he needs.  He takes
      the katana, holds it a moment.  Then --

                                      METHOS
                    No.

      Methos draws the sword, and backs away.

      MacLeod waits that way a moment -- then seems to accept this. 
      His punishment is living.  He rises slowly, looks once more
      at Richie -- then he turns and walks out.

      His eyes are flat and lifeless, containing his pain, refusing
      to let it go.

                                      DAWSON
                    Mac... Mac...

      MacLeod turns and responds with an air of finality.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm done.

      He turns to walk away.

      Methos turns away, looking at nothing.

      Dawson watches MacLeod go.  Finally he looks down at Richie
      and he can't fight the tears any more.  He leans into the
      cold stone of the wall and lets them come.

      MACLEOD

      moves down the tunnel, away from them, framed in a dim halo
      of light, growing smaller in the distance.


      Spare, dimly lit, furnished with only a few rustic items --
      a low wood table, some quilted pillows -- it could be the
      quarters of a monk.

      A small OIL LAMP sputters on the table.  Seated on a rug
      before it --

      MACLEOD

      Motionless, he seems to be meditating.  On the table before
      him  - Landry s NOTEBOOK, tattered and yellowed with age.

      As he sits, he gets the BUZZ.  He looks up, but does not
      rise.  He waits calmly.  A moment later, POUNDING at the
      door.  Then from without --

                                      METHOS (O.S.)
                    MacLeod?

      MacLeod doesn't move.

                                      METHOS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    I know you re there.  I'm not going
                    away.

      MacLeod closes his eyes, says nothing.  He pushes a button.

      THE DOOR

      opens upward pneumatically, into the ceiling admitting a
      shaft of light.  A shadowed figure moves into the room, behind
      MacLeod -- it is Methos.

      They stay that way a LONG BEAT.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96518      "Archangel"      49.      Final Shooting Script 1/22/97

1839CONTINUED:1839

                                      MACLEOD
                    What do you want?

      Not unfriendly, just disinterested -- a man keeping people
      at bay.

                                      METHOS
                    Me?  Nothing.
                          (beat)
                    But I brought someone to see you.

      As he says this, there's a LOW SCRAPING SOUND as someone, or
      something, enters.

      MacLeod finally opens his eyes.  He turns now, and we see --

      JOE DAWSON

      sitting in a wheelchair.  His hair is now SILVER -- we can
      see he's over sixty years old.  There's a CLOTH-COVERED OBJECT
      across his legs.

      Dawson looks at MacLeod quietly.  There's no recrimination,
      no accusation.

                                      DAWSON
                    Hello, MacLeod.  It's been twenty
                    years.

      (NOTE: Please also shoot as:

                                      DAWSON
                    Hello, MacLeod.  It's been a long
                    time.

      END NOTE)

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    Why did you come?

      Dawson slowly unfolds the cloth, revealing MacLeod's KATANA. 
      He raises it in two hands, holds it out to MacLeod.

      And OFF this, as they face each other, the sword between
      them --

      ALTERNATE SCENE:


      Spare, dimly lit, furnished with only a few rustic items --
      a low wood table, some quilted pillows -- it could be the
      quarters of a monk.

      A small OIL LAMP sputters on the table.  Seated on a rug

                    MacLeod?

                                      MACLEOD
                    In here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Around.
                          (beat)
                    Did you bring it?

                                      METHOS
                    I brought a friend.

      As he says this, there's a LOW SCRAPING SOUND as someone, or

      MacLeod turns and we see --

                    And now I'm ready.

      Dawson slowly unfolds the cloth, revealing MacLeod's KATANA. 
      He raises it in two hands, holds it out to MacLeod.  As
      MacLeod takes the sword --
