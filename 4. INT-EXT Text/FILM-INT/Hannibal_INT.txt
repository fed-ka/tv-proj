MRS. PAZZI
Dr. Fell.
You are not Italian.
FELL
Sadly, no.
And I find that birth is one
of the few things in life which study
and a pleasant attitude can not amend.
What do you think?
MRS. PAZZI
And how do we account for the interest
of such a charming man, an interest in
Torture?
PAZZI
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination
by the Studiolo.
FELL
Indeed I am.
And the connection,
between Dante, and, in fact, between
your illustrious forebears... if you'd
come with me, I could show you...
HE HOLDS UP THE ROPE, AS TO LEAD THEM BACK INTO THE
EXHIBIT.

indulgence," and you are going to put
them aside.
And get on with your job.

their subsequent deaths by hanging.
Ah
Commendatore Pazzi...
ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE SPEAKS TO PAZZI, HALF-SEEN IN THE DOORWAY.
FELL (cont'd)
You are welcome.
Since you are closest

Chewing
in Dante:
Count Ugolino, chewing the
back of the archbishop's head--Satan,
with his three Faces, chewing Judas,
Brutus, and Cassius... all three
traitors.
Is it not?
Thank you all for

IT IN THE PROJECTOR)
This one will interest you:
let me see
if I can improve the focus...
WE SEE THE IMAGE OF A HANGED MAN APPEAR ON THE DROPCLOTH.
THERE IS A PLAQUE DRAPED AROUND THE NECK OF THE HANGED MAN.
FELL (CONT'D)
Can you make it out, can you make out
the name on the plaque?
FELL WALKS UP TO THE IMAGE DISPLAYED ON THE DROPCLOTH, PAZZI
WALKS BEHIND HIM.

FLOOR POLISHER, DRAWING IT TOWARD HIM.
FELL (cont'd)
Yes.
Your Wife.
Laura.
L'Orange, which
is the topnote of her skin, wouldn't you
say?
Or do I grow too personal?
but
that is what I think of, when I think of
her.
And how could I but think of her?
I haven't had a bit all day.
The kidney
and the liver would be su1table for a
dinner tonight.
But the rest of the meat
should hang for a week, in these cool
conditions.
Wouldn't you say?
Nod once
for yes.
(PAUSE)
If you tell me what I need to know,
then it would be convenient for me to
leave without my meal.
And Mrs. Pazzi
will remain unscathed.
I'll out the
questions to you, and we'll see:
I
saw at the theatre you had betrayed me.
And, when the police didn't come, it was
clear you had sold me out.
Was it to
Mason Verger?
Blink one for yes.
ANGLE ON PAZZI.
BEAT.
THEN HE BLINKS ONCE.
FELL (cont'd)
Thank you.
And now:
Are his hit men
waiting outside?
(PAZZI BLINKS ONCE)
Was that a single blink?
Yes.
Thank
you.
FELL FINISHES HIS COILING OF THE ROPE, AND WE SEE HE HAS
FASHIONED A HANGMAN'S NOOSE.
FELL TAKES OUT A STILETTO, AND IT OPENS.
HE ADVANCES TOWARD
PAZZI, WHO TRIES TO RECOIL.
FELL (cont'd)
No, no.
I'm going to take the tape off.
Please do not scream.
Do you think you
can keep from screaming?
(HE TAKES THE TAPE OFF)
...would it help if I were to cut your
BOWELS OUT...?
WE SEE HIM MAKE A SWIPE AND HEAR PAZZI START TO SCREAM.
FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE SALON, WE SEE PAZZI, TAPED TO

...but will that satisfy you?
VERGER
Why should you care?
LECHTER
It is not that I care for you--but
that I posses an enquiring mind.

will you do when I am gone?
When you
have nothing to occupy your thoughts,
save the memory of your own folly, and,
more to the point, stupidity.

ARE YOU DONE?

SURPRISED)
