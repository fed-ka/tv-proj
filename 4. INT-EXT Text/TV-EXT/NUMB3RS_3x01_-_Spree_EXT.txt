  CRYSTAL, 30, drives.  She wears an easy, unpretentious

  BUCK, 17, has his head in her lap.  Buff, all-American, and 
  barely ready to shave.  Looking up at her with puppy love; 
  she smiles back down at him...

  ... touching his arm, and a FRESH TATTOO on his bicep.  A 
  heart, clearly Crystal's name.

  The two of them enjoy the wordless bliss; the open road, the 
  fresh air, each other.  They pull into a --


  A small gas station-convenience store, sitting on a desolate 
  desert crossroad.  Crystal parks next to a BMW CONVERTIBLE

  carrying a six-pack, chewing on a frozen burrito.

  Now a crime scene.  MEGAN and EDGERTON examine the 
    bloodstained pavement, Brenner s body covered by a sheet, and 
  the abandoned BMW.

                Pierce Brenner, 52.

                His name on the sign.  Let everyone 
                out around 8:15, locked up.  
                Salesman forgot his wallet, came 
                back and found the body just before

                              EDGERTON
                Makes sense -- they've been 
                changing cars every day or two --

                              MEGAN
                -- but always subordinate to a more

                I don t know what you re talkin  
                about.

  DAVID comes across the street. Holding open a BAG FULL OF 
  DOPE.

                The things people leave under

                Nope.  Not any more.

  On Lydia, as Colby and David lead her away.

                                    ACT FOUR


  Where EDGERTON along with MEGAN watch the house.  Lying low, 
  checking the area through binoculars.

                              EDGERTON
                      (into Nextel)
                You're clear to extract. 

  EDGERTON S POV -- as FBI AGENTS lead RIVERS' COUSIN and his 
  GIRLFRIEND out the back door, through the backyard.  Low 
  profile, no one handcuffed.

                              EDGERTON (CONT'D)
                Even with Charlie s math, your 
                psych profiles... we re putting a 
                lot of eggs in this basket.

                              MEGAN
                We know Crystal s been on the 
                streets looking for Rivers -- 
                talking to all the same people we 
                have. 

                              EDGERTON
                Amazing how someone who starts with 
                all the advantages -- good home, 
                good parents -- ends up here.   NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         49.



                              MEGAN 
                She didn t want advantages; she 
                wanted to see what was out there. 

  Edgerton looks at Megan --

                              EDGERTON
                Little advice? When you get inside 
                heads like theirs -- make sure they 
                don t get in yours, too.

                              MEGAN
                      (considers)
                Maybe you re right -- you know how 
                some cases ring bells that others 
                don t --

                              EDGERTON 
                      (attention moving)
                Camaro coming up Vineland! 

  The CAMARO passes by -- Buck alone behind the wheel --

                              MEGAN
                      (into Nextel)
                We've got Winters -- looks like 
                he's alone.

  watch the CAMARO crawl PAST THE HOUSE...

  ... and park a few houses up.

                              MEGAN
                      (into Nextel)
                Camaro's parked two houses away.

                              EDGERTON 
                She's got to be in a second car -- 
                they never split up...   NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         50.



  Megan scans street.

                              MEGAN
                Streets are empty -- she's not in 
                the zone.


  BUCK gets out of the car.  Looking around, then ducking 
  between two houses...


  as Buck climbs a fence, into a backyard.

                              EDGERTON
                      (into Nextel)
                He's going through the backyard...


  SWAT TEAM -- guns out and moving quietly through a parallel 
  backyard --


  SWAT pick up the pace, pushing through some hedges --

                              MEGAN (ON NEXTEL)
                  Everybody go!  Now!

  FLASHLIGHTS hit the yard -- AGENTS emerge, guns drawn --

                FBI!  Don't move!  NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         51.



  BUCK -- turns and freezes, like a startled deer.  Looking at 
  the GUN held loosely at his side.  His body arches, ready to 
  make a move...

  ... and a RIFLE SHOT CRACKS.  The pistol SHATTERS in his 
  hand...

  ... and Colby and David SMASH open the kitchen door -- 
  tackling him to the ground and cuffing him.

  Colby looks up at EDGERTON; a SHADOW on a rooftop -- maybe 
  some gunsmoke visible against a streetlight --

                              COLBY (ON NEXTEL)
                That was a hell of a shot.


  Megan and Edgerton scanning the streets -- still no sign of 
  Crystal.

                              EDGERTON
                Better than he deserves.
                      (beat)
                But we still need something out of 
                him.

                                    ACT FIVE


  As BUCK is led out of the building, in arm and leg irons, by 
  MEGAN, COLBY and DAVID. Put in a car and driven away...

  ... past CRYSTAL, who is parked across the street, watching 
  from the front seat of a BROWN MINIVAN...


  ON LARRY and MEGAN as they exit the roadside cafe

                              MEGAN
                Well, be sure to give me a call 
                when your orbit brings you back 
                around.  Maybe even to my place...  NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         57.



  LARRY smiles, kinda, then they go their separate ways. Larry 
  getting into his car and driving off...

  ... as Megan crosses the street...

  Pull back to reveal... CRYSTAL -- waiting beside a BROWN 
  MINIVAN.  

  Megan passes her... 

  CRYSTAL POV -- ON MEGAN Taking out her keys as she approaches 
  her car -- 

                              CRYSTAL
                Not exactly the kinda guy I would 
                have pictured for you.

  Megan turns, SEES Crystal -- reaches for her purse -- her 
  PISTOL visible inside --

                              CRYSTAL (CONT'D)
                I really wouldn t, if I were you.

  Crystal holding up a HAND GRENADE...

                              CRYSTAL (CONT'D)
                You know who I am, so you know what 
                I m capable of.
                      (pulls the pin)
                We live or we die. Your choice. 

  Crystal motions for Megan to toss the purse to her on the 
  ground, which Megan does --

                              MEGAN
                What... do you want? To live... or 
                die?

  Crystal picks up Megan s PURSE -- a PISTOL, NEXTEL, HANDCUFFS 
  inside -- 

                              CRYSTAL
                What I want --

  -- takes out the car keys and hands them to Megan -- tosses 
  them back to Megan

                              CRYSTAL (CONT'D)
                -- is for you to get in the car, 
                and drive.

  Crystal takes a step toward her, as Megan gets behind the 
  wheel of her car.  NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         58.



  Crystal gets in the back -- and, as they drive away --
