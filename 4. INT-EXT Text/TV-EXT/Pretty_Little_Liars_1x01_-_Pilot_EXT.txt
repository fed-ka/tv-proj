      Rosewood is a picture-perfect portrait of suburban America.   
      Boutiques, restaurants, thriving businesses, and seemingly 
      happy CITIZENS flourish in the charming town.  As the sights 
      and SOUNDS of the town overlap WE HEAR a radio report coming 
      from a parked car.    

                                  DISC JOCKEY (V.O.)
                    Labor Day weekend marks the 
                      unofficial end of summer but it 
                    also marks the unsettling 
                      anniversary of the tragedy that 
                    still haunts everyone of us in 
                    Rosewood.  



      The tree lined street is flanked by traditional, two story 
      houses.  The picket fences are white, the lawns are green and 
      flowers are abundant.  A NEWSPAPER BOY delivers the local 
      paper to a home and we catch a glimpse of the HEADLINE - 
      STILL MISSING. 



      Aria pulls the family s blue Honda Civic to the curb and Mike 
      hops out.  Aria calls after him -

                                  ARIA
                    What time am I picking you up?

      As he runs off - 

                                  MIKE
                    Six -



      Aria reacquaints herself with Rosewood.  She drives down a 
      tree lined residential street.  She stops in front of a 
      pristine Victorian home.  She looks at the name on the 
      mailbox - DiLaurentis.  Aria looks back up to the house.  The 
      curtains are drawn, the flower boxes are empty, and the porch 
      is bare.  The house is vacant.    

      After a moment of reflection, Aria drives on.  She glances at 
      the clock.  It s only 4:15.  Aria picks up her cell phone.  
      She scrolls through her address book and lands on the name 
      EMILY.  After a moment of reluctance, she hits the call 
      button and the phone RINGS.                                                                                          4.



                                  EMILY  (V.O.)
                    It s Emily and you know what this 
                    means.  

      The sound of her friend s voice brings a slight, unknowing 
      smile to Aria s face.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    You ll have to leave a message. 

      We hear the BEEP.  Aria contemplates her words but before she 
      talks the phone BEEPS again.  We hear - 

                                  COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
                    If you are satisfied with your 
                    message you may hang up now.  

      A tentative Aria hangs up without trying again.



      Aria drives past the local university.  She stops at a red 
      light.  As Aria glances toward the sidewalk a stunned look 
      registers on her face. 



      Aria remains stunned and transfixed.  We follow her gaze to 
      see - 

      CLOSE ON: A MISSING PERSONS flyer attached to a pole.  On the 
      flyer are two pictures of a blond girl.  On the left she is 
      13 and on the right is a rendering of how she would look 
      present day at 16.  The name under the photographs reads: 
      ALISON DiLAURENTIS and we recognize her from the flashback. 

      Aria is snapped out of her stare when a group of barely legal    
      COLLEGE KIDS walk between her car and the poster.  They laugh 
      and cut up as they walk into SNOOKERS BAR.  Aria glances at 
      the clock - it s only 4:45.  She looks back to Snookers.                                                                                        7.





      As Aria somberly watches her father drive away we CUT TO:



      As Aria remembers, the flashback is shot in her POV. - The 
      year is 2006 and it s a bright summer day.  Aria and Alison 
      eat frozen yogurts as they walk down the sidewalk.  MONA 
      VANDERWALL calls to them from across the street.  At 13, Mona 
      was the styleless chubby girl that was always trying to hang 
      out with them.    

                                  MONA
                    Alison!   

      Alison makes an  ugh  face.

                                  MONA
                    Aria!

      Alison grabs Aria s arm and pulls her into an alley. 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      They successfully avoided Mona and head down the alley.

                                  ALISON
                    Is she ever going to get a clue? 
                    What a dork.  Switch?

      They trade cups.  

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      Alison notices something up ahead.  We (ARIA) follow her gaze 
      to a familiar Honda Civic which is parked in a no parking 
      zone. 

                                  ALISON
                    Isn t that your dad s car?

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -                                                                                    17.



      Looking into the car, we recognize Aria s father but not the 
      pretty twenty-one-year-old COLLEGE GIRL sitting next to him. 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO -

      The college girl leans in close to Byron and he kisses her on 
      the mouth.  FADE TO WHITE -



                                  EMILY (O.S.)
                    Aria?!

      Aria snaps out of her reflective moment and turns to see an 
      extremely surprised EMILY walking toward her.  At sixteen, 
      Emily Fields works hard to maintain an athlete s body.  Her 
      sense of style is J-Crew sporty.  A competitive swimmer, she 
      looks and lives the part. 

                                  EMILY
                    When did you get back?

                                  ARIA
                      Yesterday.

      Emily and Aria share an affectionate hug. 

                                  EMILY
                    I almost didn t recognize you.  I 
                    think the last time we saw each 
                    other you had a pink stripe in your 
                    hair.  

                                  ARIA
                    Yeah well, when your parents preach 
                      individuality and you don t know 
                    who you are... 

                                  EMILY
                    You wore it well.

      First BELL RINGS.  They both walk toward the entrance.

                                  EMILY
                    You should have called.  It s so 
                    weird just running into you here.

                                  ARIA
                    We kind of lost touch, Emily.  
                    Remember?

      She hits a nerve -                                                                                    18.



                                  EMILY
                    Maybe that made it easier to keep 
                    our secrets.   

      They exchange a look of understanding and guilt.   

                                  ARIA
                    I saw a poster of Alison yesterday.  
                    Of what she d look like now.

                                  EMILY
                    It s awful.  I mean...

      A mournful resignation comes over her.

                                  EMILY
                    We all know she s dead. 

      Aria tosses her a look.  

                                  EMILY
                          (looking for reassurance)
                    Right?

                                  ARIA
                    I ve just never heard anyone say 
                    it.  



      Emily, holding the welcome basket, stands on the sidewalk and 
      stares up at the house.  It is the same house Aria stopped in 
      front of on her first day back.  A moving truck is parked in 
      the driveway of the Victorian home.  When she breaks her 
      gaze, Emily notices a huge pile of trash on the street curb. 

      Emily recognizes an old overstuffed bedroom chair, clothes, 
      notebooks and school books.  Something in particular grabs 
      Emily s attention.  She reaches down and picks up a sixth 
      grade swimming medal. 

                                  MAYA (O.S.)
                    You want that? 

      Emily spins around.  MAYA (16) sticks out her hand. 

                                  MAYA
                    Maya St. Germain.  Aka  new girl .                                                                                     24.



      Emily quickly sizes her up.  Maya has tawny-colored skin and 
      wild, black-brown curly hair.  She wears a yellow tank top 
      that intentionally reveals bits of her orange bra underneath.

                                  EMILY
                    I m Emily.  

      She hands her the basket.

                                  EMILY
                    Welcome to the neighborhood.  

      Maya looks at the basket and facetiously delivers -

                                  MAYA
                    Foie gras and cornichons, my 
                      favorites.  

                                  EMILY
                    It s from my mother.

                                  MAYA
                      I figured.  
                          (she gestures to the curb)
                    That stuff was in my room.  You can 
                    have anything you want.

                                  EMILY
                    It all belonged to Alison.

                                  MAYA
                    Is she a friend of yours?

                                  EMILY
                    She was.  A long time ago.  

                                  MAYA
                    That s all I get?  No details?

      Emily is surprised by Maya s forward questions and attitude.

                                  EMILY
                    There were five of us who used to 
                    hang out.  But we don t anymore. 

      Maya looks up at her bedroom window then back to Emily.

                                  MAYA
                    Would it be outrageous of me to ask 
                    if you ll help with my last few 
                    boxes?                                                                                       25.



                                  EMILY
                    Yes.

      Then Emily surprises Maya with a receptive smile -

                                  EMILY
                    But I don t mind.   



      Spencer stands off to the side of the entrance and smokes a 
      cigarette.  When the restaurant door opens, she hides the 
      Marlboro.  When she sees that it s Wren, she pulls the 
      cigarette back to her lips.  

                                  WREN 
                    Do you have an extra smoke?

                                    SPENCER
                    Shouldn t you know better?  You are 
                    a med student, right?  

                                  WREN
                    You re a bit of a smart ass.

                                    SPENCER
                    A bit?

      He throws her a  stop messing with me  look.  She gives him a 
      cigarette.  She watches him light it and take a deep drag.

                                    SPENCER
                    Does my sister know you smoke?

                                  WREN
                    Does she have to know everything?

      He looks at her and smiles.  She thinks he might be flirting 
      with her. 

                                  WREN
                    So why are you the black sheep?                                                                                    32.



                                    SPENCER
                    I m captain of the field hockey 
                    team, maintaining a 4.0 G.P.A. and 
                    president of my class.  The 
                    Hastings don t breed black sheep. 

      He detects the sadness in her ironic tone.  

                                  WREN
                    I m sorry we re moving into your 
                    loft.  If you want me to say 
                      something.

                                    SPENCER
                    It wouldn t make a difference.  But 
                    thanks for being sorry.

      Wren hands Spencer her lighter back.  

                                    SPENCER
                    You re not like Melissa s usual 
                      boyfriends. 

      Their hands touch for longer than they should. 

                                  WREN
                    How am I unusual?

      As much as Spencer would like to pursue this -  

                                    SPENCER
                    We better get back.

      Finally, she walks away.  When she reaches the door, she 
      turns back to him.  

                                    SPENCER
                      I actually like you.  That s what s 
                    unusual.

      She tosses him a sexy look then heads inside.  On his look of 
      intrigue we FADE OUT.  

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    33.



                                  ACT THREE



      It s early.  The school is empty.  Almost.



      Emily and Maya walk down the sidewalk.  Emily notices that 
      their hands keep bumping into each other.  She notices Maya s 
      soft skin.  Her eyes.  Her lips.  

                                  MAYA
                    Thanks for walking me home.   

                                  EMILY
                    It s no big deal. 

      When they approach Maya s house, Emily sees a work CREW 
      tossing Alison s old stuff into a dumpster.  Maya reads the 
      disquieted look on her face.

                                  MAYA
                    Are you okay?

      Emily turns to Maya -

                                  EMILY
                    It s hard for me to talk about.                                                                                      37.



      Maya listens, patient and engaged.  

                                  EMILY
                    I didn t tell you everything about 
                    the girl who used to live here.  

                                  MAYA
                    Alison. 

                                  EMILY
                    She disappeared during the summer 
                    of seventh grade.  She s still 
                    missing.  

                                  MAYA
                    That must have been awful for you.

                                  EMILY
                    I used to think if I didn t talk 
                    about her I wouldn t think about 
                    her.  

                                  MAYA
                    But you still do.   

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah.  

                                  MAYA
                    I m sorry. 

      Maya leans over and gives Emily a kiss on the cheek.  When 
      she goes to kiss her other cheek their lips almost touch.  

                                  MAYA
                    I ll see you tomorrow.

      Emily watches Maya walk into the house.  As she turns to 
      leave, a BLACK SEDAN slowly drives along side her.  The 
      windows are tented very dark.  Unnerved, Emily picks up her 
      pace.  The car speeds up to meet her pace.  At the 
      intersection, Emily turns right.  The car turns left.  
      Relieved, Emily smiles at her misguided paranoia.  



      On the warm summer night, Spencer, wearing a bikini that 
      leaves little to the imagination, relaxes in the jacuzzi.  
      She looks up when she hears -  

                                  WREN (O.S.)
                    Oh.  

      Wren stands above her, naked except for his sexy, boxer-brief 
      underwear.  

                                  WREN
                    I ll come back. 

                                    SPENCER
                    It s a big jacuzzi.  

      He drops his towel and steps into the water.  

                                    SPENCER
                    I thought you guys were moving in 
                    next week.  

                                  WREN
                    Melissa thought we should get 
                    settled before classes start.  

      She massages her shoulder.  

                                  WREN
                    Tough day at school?

                                    SPENCER
                    Tough field hockey practice.

                                  WREN
                    I rowed for Oxford.

                                    SPENCER
                    That looks good on a Med School 
                    app.

                                  WREN
                    I did it because I loved it.

      She massages her shoulder again.                                                                                      41.



                                  WREN
                    You probably have some fluid build 
                    up in your bursa sac.

                                    SPENCER
                    I bet you say that to all the 
                    girls.

                                  WREN
                    I can help.   

                                    SPENCER
                    Okay, Doctor Wren -

      He reaches over and massages her shoulder.  She relaxes into 
      it.

                                  WREN
                    Better, right?  

                                    SPENCER
                    Wow, that s awesome.

      He massages a little deeper.  She releases a pleased moan.  
      His hand reaches to the front of her shoulder.  Near her 
      chest.

                                    MELISSA (O.S.)
                    Wren? 

      He immediately backs away from Spencer.  They both know how 
      it looks.  Spencer climbs out of the jacuzzi.  She doesn t 
      say a word.  As Melissa approaches from the barn, Spencer 
      slips inside the main house.  



      Emily takes her Lit book to the white porch swing.  As she 
      sits on the swing Emily opens the book.  She pulls out the 
      note she found in her locker.  As she rereads it she feels 
      like throwing up. 



      Still Spencer s POV. - Spencer follows Alison out of the 
      house.

                                  ALISON
                    You kissed your sister s boyfriend, 
                    Spencer.  It s going to haunt you 
                    until you make it right.    

      Spencer turns back to see Hanna who is just out of view from 
      the window.  When her  friend Alison  isn t looking, Hanna s 
      hand reaches for the cookie. 

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO:                                                                                    45.



                                  ALISON 
                    Either you tell her, or I do.

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO:

      Spencer s hand has a tight grip on Alison s arm.

                                  ALISON
                    Is that a threat, Spencer?

      FADE TO WHITE THEN SMASH CUT TO:

                                  ALISON
                    You have as much to lose as I do.  
                    We both know you d never tell about 
                     the Jenna thing.      

      Off of Alison s spiteful look WE CUT BACK TO -



      Aria and Emily are alone on the porch.

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry for just stopping by.

                                  ARIA
                    Anytime, Em.  You know that.                                                                                    47.



                                  EMILY
                    Somebody left a note in my locker.

      Aria reads Emily s worried tone -

                                  ARIA
                    From  A? 

                                  EMILY
                    You, too?

                                  ARIA
                    Do you really think it s her?  Is 
                    it possible?

                                  EMILY
                    Only Alison could have known -

      Emily hesitates.

                                  ARIA
                    Known what?  

                                  EMILY
                    It was...

      Aria reads Emily s reluctance -

                                  ARIA
                    Personal?

                                  EMILY
                    I really believed she was dead.  

                                  ARIA
                    We all did.  

      Behind Emily - The shade is drawn, but Aria notices the light 
      in her father s den turn on. 

                                  EMILY
                    Could she really be back? 

      Aria locks eyes with Emily.

                                  ARIA
                    I think she s playing with us.     

                                  EMILY
                    Why would she do that?                                                                                         48.



                                  ARIA
                    We re talking about Alison here.  
                    Wasn t that her favorite sport?

                                  EMILY
                    Should we tell someone?  

      As Byron walks across his den, his shadow crosses the window 
      shade.

                                  ARIA
                    I don t know about you, but I 
                    can t.

      Emily thinks about her message from  A. 

                                  EMILY
                    I m glad you re back. 

                                  ARIA
                    It s funny.  Even though I grew up 
                    here, I feel like a total outsider.  

                                  EMILY
                    Me, too.

      Off of Aria s surprised look WE CUT TO:



      Ashley walks down the front steps of the building with Hanna 
      on her heels.  Up ahead, WE SEE Wilden climb into a police 
      cruiser.  He hits the LIGHTS as he speeds away.  

      Hanna is desperate to know what happened but is smart enough 
      to keep her mouth shut.  She silently follows her mother to 
      their new Mercedes Benz.  Ashley unlocks the car and they 
      both climb inside. 



      Emily walks home.  An ambulance, SIREN SCREAMING, buzzes past 
      her.  Emily rounds the corner and stops in her tracks.  She 
      can t believe what she sees. 

      Police cars (lights flashing) flood the street.  DOZENS of 
      NEIGHBORS and TOWNSPEOPLE stand around, watching and 
      wondering.  POLICE OFFICERS move a barricade and the 
      ambulance pulls into Maya s driveway.

                                  EMILY
                    Maya -                                                                                    54.



      Emily panics.  She pushes through the swarm of people.  
      Scanning the crowd for Maya s face, she finally reaches the 
      front walk of the old Victorian. 

                                  MAYA (O.S.)
                    Emily!

      Emily turns - she s relieved to see Maya making her way 
      toward her.  They give each other a spontaneous hug.  

                                  EMILY
                    I thought something might have 
                    happened to you.  

                                  MAYA
                    I tried to call you.  

                                  EMILY
                    What s going on?

                                  MAYA
                    They found your friend.   

      The news doesn t surprise her. 

                                  EMILY
                    I knew she was back.

      Emily looks past Maya.

                                  EMILY
                    Is she inside?  

                                  MAYA
                    Emily -

      Just then the CORONER wheels a gurney around the side of the 
      house.  The deceased is zipped in a body bag.  

                                  MAYA
                    I m sorry.  They found Alison s 
                    body.  

      The CROWD buzzes with a disturbed sadness as Alison s body is 
      wheeled toward the coroner s van.  A bewildered Emily stares 
      at the body bag in disbelief. 



      Aria walks away from her car, heading toward the scene.  She 
      looks over towards the Hastings house.  She sees Spencer 
      watching from her driveway.   



      Spencer, alone, watches the scene from her front lawn.  She 
      glances over and sees Aria walking up the long drive.  
      Surprising even herself, Spencer almost cries.  They silently 
      take it all in. 

      In the sea of strange faces, Aria sees Hanna standing with 
      the crowd.  

                                  ARIA
                    I heard the cops took Hanna to the 
                    police station today.

      Spencer, with steel eyes, turns to Aria.  

                                    SPENCER
                    She d never talk about -

      Hanna overhears them as she approaches from the driveway -

                                  HANNA
                    -  The Jenna thing?   

      Startled, Spencer and Aria turn to her.

                                  HANNA
                    We made a promise.



      News vans line the street as a flood of PEOPLE make their way 
      into the chapel.   

                                  REPORTER
                    The discovery of her body has 
                    rocked this community and today 
                    hundreds of mourners are saying 
                    goodbye to Alison DiLaurentis.                                                                                     57.



      ANGLE ON - Emily and her parents approach the chapel.  The 
      Hastings see the Fields .  Rocked by the events, the parents 
      embrace each other.  Emily and Spencer also hug hello.   



      Mourners leave the chapel.  Emily, Spencer, Aria, and Hanna 
      all walk out together.  Officer Wilden approaches them.  He 
      wears a dark suit.  He looks them over -

                                  WILDEN
                    Emily, Spencer, Aria and Hanna.  

      Hanna avoids his gaze and looks down at the ground.  

                                    SPENCER
                    Do we know you? 

      As he reaches into his breast pocket the girls get a glimpse 
      of his gun.  He pulls out a business card and hands it to 
      Spencer.  

                                  WILDEN
                    I m Officer Wilden.  I understand 
                    you were all good friends with the 
                    victim.  

                                  ARIA
                    We were.

                                  WILDEN
                    I m going to need to talk with each 
                    of you.  

                                    SPENCER
                    We talked to the police when Alison 
                    went missing.                                                                                     62.



                                  WILDEN
                    And I intend to go over every one 
                    of your statements.  This is no 
                    longer a missing persons 
                      investigation.  It s a murder.  And 
                    you can be assured, I will find out 
                    what happened that summer.   

      He walks away as Jenna and Toby exit the chapel.  Toby guides 
      Jenna to a waiting car.  Emily sets her eyes on the black 
      sedan with tinted windows.  Was that the car following her?    

      The girls watch Jenna leave.  For a few seconds they forget 
      to breathe.  Aria notices Wilden watching them.  

                                  ARIA
                    Do you think he knows about...
