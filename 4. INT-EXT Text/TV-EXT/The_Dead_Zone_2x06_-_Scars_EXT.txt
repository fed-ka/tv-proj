          Greg strolls down the walk, to a CAR that's waiting for
          him on the street.  He gets in the passenger seat, next
          to SONNY ELLIMAN.

                        Smart woman.

                        Did you ask her about John Smith?

                                        GREG
                        Decided not to.  Old wounds, and
                        all that.

                                        SONNY
                        We have to deal with this, Greg.

                        You really have it in for this
                        Smith guy.

                                        SONNY
                        He's been asking questions about
                        you.

                        Not just that. It's like he already
                        knows what he's looking for&

          The way Sonny says this makes Greg look at him, bemused.

                        The psychic thing freaks you out,
                        doesn't it?

                        I'm just saying we have to deal
                        with this.

                                        GREG
                        Relax, Sonny.  I'm way, way ahead
                        of you.

          Sonny shakes his head, starts the car, they drive out of
          frame.



          WALT stows his jacket in the trunk of his car.  Sarah
          leans up against the car.

                        All this because you gave him a
                        piece of your mind at the "Meet
                        the Candidates" rally?

                        I don't know what I said, but it
                        must've been brilliant.

                        I'm really considering his offer.

          Walt leans against the opposite counter.  Looks at her.

                        I used to be involved, Walt.  In
                          college.  Politics, protests... a

                        with that.  Now I'm just an
                          "armchair activist."  Sitting on

          Walt puts his arms around her.

                        I like your cookies.

          The "Town Hall" style debates are literally being held in
          Bangor's town hall building.  Johnny's jeep pulls up.



          Five HOOCHES/HUTS.  The armed men stealth into the village,
          led by Johnny.  He signals for them to stop and the line
          freezes as a VIETNAMESE MAN exits one of the huts, yawning. 
          His back to the group, he begins to urinate.  Slung round
          his back is a Chinese Model AK-47 (no stock).  Johnny
          looks back to his COMMANDER, who gives a kill signal. 
          Johnny then sets down his rifle and unsheathes a gleaming
          combat knife.  He stealths to the Man's back, who finishes
          his business just as Johnny strikes, pulling him close
          and jamming his knife into the brain stem.  *

          Too late to spot THE SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY in the hut,
          watching his Father get killed.  The boy's MOTHER comes
          out of the hut and SCREAMS.  She throws herself over the
          body of the dead man.

          More SCREAMS as PEOPLE begin running from the other
          hooches.  And we INTERCUT fractured hand-held moments of
          chaos with EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of JOHNNY'S EYES and FISHER'S
          EYES back in the light of the campaign office.  We see
          Women and Children rounded up and thrown together.

                                        JOHNNY/FISHER
                                (looking around)
                          Where're the men?  Where're the
                          weapons?  These are civilians.*

            Johnny/Fisher addresses his COMMANDER.  

                                        COMMANDER
                        Fisher, cover the forest. *

          The Commander moves off into the darkness.  Johnny/Fisher
          looks down at the group of terrified WOMEN on the ground
          in front of him.  One of the SEALS, MULVERT, spots a woman*
          trying to hide a metallic object underneath her hat.*

                                        MULVERT*
                          Grenade!*

          He opens fire, killing the woman.  Johnny/Fisher steps*
          forward to look at the body.  The hat has blown aside,*
          and he can see the "grenade" was a simple C-RAT can.*

          Johnny is about to open his mouth when Terrified VILLAGERS*
          begin to run for their lives.  The SEAL team opens fire,*
          begins taking them down before they can escape the village. *
          An atrocity in the making. *

                                          JOHNNY/FISHER*
                        Stand down!  Stand down!*

          But no one can hear him over the sound of the gunfire.*

                                                                                                *

          ECU - Johnny/Fisher's eyes, wide with terror, as muzzle*
          flashes dilate his pupils...



          Johnny's Jeep parked out front...          DEAD ZONE: SCARS - ACT TWO - 11/26/02 YELLOW          28.



          Johnny steps up onto the porch.  He hesitates, then musters
          his will and rings the doorbell.  A beat as he looks around
          the porch, then Sarah opens the door.

                                        SARAH
                        Hi.  I didn't know you were coming
                        by.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, well, I was around, and I
                        wanted to ask you something, in
                        person.

                                        SARAH
                                (cautious)
                        Okay...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's nothing serious.  I saw you
                        last night at the debates at town
                        hall, and you were sitting with
                        Greg Stillson's people...

                                        SARAH
                        I guess you could say I'm working
                        for his campaign now.
                                (leading)
                        What were you doing at town hall? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just observing.

                                        SARAH
                        Because I heard some people saying
                        you joined Harrison Fisher's
                          campaign.  I knew I had to hear
                        that wrong...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who told you that?

                        Just the word at the Stillson
                        camp.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Has Greg Stillson been asking you
                          questions about me?

                                        SARAH
                        Why would he ask about you?  Better
                        yet, why are you asking about
                        him? 

          Johnny thinks about how to answer that.  Stalls.

                        Is this true about Harrison Fisher? 

          Johnny nods.  Sarah can't believe it.

                                        SARAH

                        You're not using your powers to
                          influence this election, are you? 
                        'Cause that'd be wrong, Johnny.

                        What reasons?

          Johnny shakes his head, looks down, and sees THE VIETNAMESE
          BOY from the vision step out from behind Sarah, and stare
          up at him.  

          Johnny takes a step back, alarmed.  Sarah turns around.

                        What is it?

                        gonna take off.

          Sarah watches him go.           DEAD ZONE: SCARS - ACT TWO - 11/25/02 PINK            30.



          ...and right into Vietnam.  Instead of assuming the role
          of  Harrison Fisher, Johnny is still in his tux.  He
            stumbles, disorientated.  

          Suddenly two VIETNAMESE WOMEN run past him and MACHINE-
          GUN FIRE roars and lights up the dark jungle.  Johnny
          falls to his knees again, throwing his hands over his
          head for cover.  

          Silence.  Shaking, Johnny keeps his head covered.  Then,
          he hears a soft crunching of leaves and twigs.  Someone
          is walking up behind him.  Crunch.  Crunch.  Crunch.

          And sees Sonny Elliman walking up to him.  Behind Sonny
          are the lit pillars of the Governor's mansion.  Johnny
          looks around.  He's in the parking lot of the Governor's
          Mansion, crouched on his knees.  Johnny gets up.

          He gets right in Johnny's face.

                                        SONNY
                        Do not stand against Greg Stillson,
                        or anywhere near him, or your
                        family will suffer.

          Johnny violently pushes Sonny away from him - VISION FLASH
          on a SPINNING WHEEL - Sonny stumbles back.

                                        SONNY
                        I was hoping you'd do that. 

          He takes two steps forward and DECKS Johnny.  As his FIST
            connects, Johnny is literally KNOCKED into a vision he
          gets off Sonny's knuckles...



          Johnny, rubbing his cheek, looks up at Sonny, and smiles.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And I was hoping you'd do that.

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
