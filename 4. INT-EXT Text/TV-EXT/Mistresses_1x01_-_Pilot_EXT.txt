      Katie has made a fast getaway to her car, shaking with

                    I was his son.  I would have liked 
                    to have said good-bye as well.

                    All those doctors around?  And no 
                    one saw it coming?  What was his 
                      emotional state like?  Did you feel 
                    he was giving up?

                                  SAM
                    Yes, I know.  Your relationship was 
                      sacred.  More than I can say for 
                    his and mine, I guess.

      from across the street.  Sam leaves her.    MISTRESSES Steinberg  Network Draft 1/28/1214.

                    with my mother.

      Before Katie can ask what he means, Savi and April are there.  
      Katie turns to them, spinning:  

                                    KATIE
                    Savi?  April?  Oh my God!  Hi!


      Katie sits with John in the empty bleachers, in their casual 
      clothes, looking over the field.  They rock into each other 
      like teenagers, smiling.

                                    KATIE
                    Thank you for bringing me here, for

                    Then when it's time, will you help 
                    me die?

      She looks at him.  Does he mean what she thinks he means?

      Katie's bathroom.  She opens her eyes at the sound of her 
      front door BUZZING.  She pads downstairs.  She looks at the 
      security monitor and sees a face&. Can it be&.?  It is.  It's

      Katie s LONG PRETTY LEGS get out of her car.  She takes a 
      breath and faces the day.


      From across the street, THROUGH SOMEONE S SPYING EYES, we see 
      April get out of her car and head to a door.  April knocks.  
      Richard answers.

                      Katie. Come in.


      Katie and Sam get out of her car, she leaves her headlights 
      on, shining on the empty baseball field.  (The same one from 
      the Act One FBwith Katie and John.) They walk to the field.

                                    KATIE
                    I m not supposed to do this.

                    to see you in so much unnecessary 
                    pain.

      Sam looks at the field, it feels familiar.

                    In his final month your father was 
                      opposed to any of my therapeutic 
                      attempts to help him face his 
                      death. All he wanted to do was 
                      revisit the happiest moments of his 
                    life.   

      Sam recognizes the field, sees where Katie is going with

                    His last few weeks, he came back 
                    here once a day.  

      Katie puts a hand on Sam's shoulder.  He turns to her, 
      embraces her. Katie feels his reluctance to let go...

                    rest doesn t matter.

      Then as he pulls away... she feelshis cheek next to hers and 
      his breath lingering in her hair for a moment too long.  


        A HEADLIGHT goes out with the quieting of an engine.  From 
      her car, Savi looks at her house, hesitant to go in.

      Katie gets out of her car.  Walks up her path.  Sees Sam at 
      her door.  He's drunk.

      He grabs her and kisses her on the lips, then walks away, 
      down the street. Katie is rocked, quivering with feeling.

      She catches her breath, and heads back to her car.  Where is 
      she going?
