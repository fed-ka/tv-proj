      JANE TIMONEY is running. From a distance she looks pretty 
      good but up close - it s not going well. Her body is tense, 
      her breathing is ragged. She s focused on something - and 
      some distance ahead we can SEE a mid40s MAN sitting on a 
      bench, sweaty after his own run, talking on a CELL. This is 
      MATT WEBB. As he hangs up and STANDS, Jane SLOWS, then STOPS 
      completely, clutching a stitch in her side. Matt starts to 
      speak - but she holds up a finger -

                                  MATT
                          (sympathetic)
                    Aw, no, you re kidding. Really?

      - then looks away and DRY-HEAVES once, then takes as deep a 
      breath as she can muster and lets it out, panting. 

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    That half banana I tried to made 
                    you eat seeming like a pretty good 
                    idea right about now, huh.

                                  JANE
                    First mile or so was all right... 
                    Then the wheels came off.

                                  MATT
                    So what, you re out here. That s 
                    not nothing. And the more the 
                    nicotine works out of your system, 
                    the easier it ll be. 
                          (gesturing)
                    You ll be Dustin Hoffman-ing all 
                    over this damn park.

      Jane doesn t reply. She SPITS some phlegm into the bushes.  

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    So... Tricia just said she wants to 
                    stop by tomorrow now. 

      - then rolls her eyes.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Sorry. But I just figured let s get 
                    it over with already.

                                  JANE
                    Sure, if this is gonna do that.                                                                                      2.


                                  MATT
                    She says it is. She says she just 
                    doesn t want Owen to be staying 
                    over someplace she s never seen.

                                  JANE
                          (shrugs)
                    Makes sense.

                                  MATT
                    Yeah. Or, it s just more of her 
                    holding me over a barrel with my 
                    own kid - And dragging you into it 
                    too now -

                                  JANE
                    She s just flexing her muscles, 
                    Matty. She s got nothing else to 
                    flex them about. So we just have to 
                    let her. Just bite down and let her 
                    til we get what you want.

                                  MATT
                    Right on. I hope.

      Jane is distracted suddenly. She turns her head sharply -

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    You gonna come home and shower, or 
                    go there and do it?

                                  JANE
                    There.

      - and we SEE a MAN approaching nearby, smoking a CIGARETTE. 
      Jane takes a deep satisfying LUNGFUL of the secondhand smoke, 
      then one more -

                                  MATT
                    Wow, that doesn t seem like the 
                    best idea. 

      - then catches the man s eye.

                                  JANE
                    Hey - No smoking this part of the 
                    park.

                                  MAN
                    Yeah? Go find a cop. 

      Jane unzips the iPod arm pocket of her jacket and produces - 
      a DETECTIVE BADGE. As the man reacts -                                                                                      3.


                                  JANE
                    Yeah? Go put it out.

      As the man steps on the cigarette, then hurries away -

                                  MATT
                    ... Maybe try one of the patches 
                    today, huh? I don t think the gum s 
                    getting the whole job done -

                                  JANE
                          (turning to him)
                    You want some of this?

                                  MATT
                    Hell no? Love you. 

      They kiss. Then Matt smacks Jane on the ass and runs off 
      south toward the Great Lawn. Jane watches him go, then turns 
      and contemplates the reservoir path. As she steels herself, 
      then starts jogging again, toward the North Meadow...


      - to Korilko, behind the wheel. An African-American man sits 
      in the back. This is ROBERT MOSS. Moss is surprisingly 
      dressed in a button-down, argyle vest, penny loafers and 
      slacks with cuffs. Now the passenger door OPENS and Jane gets 
      in. She hands a soda and a candy bar to Moss.

                                  JANE
                    Those all right, Robert? You good? 

      Korilko PULLS AWAY from the curb abruptly. Jane ignores him.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You know, I was gonna say before, 
                    Robert - You are looking stylish.

                                  MOSS
                    They got a bin for the lost and 
                    found, I just got em out of there.

                                  JANE
                    What re you apologizing for? Don t 
                      apologize. Those pants have cuffs. 
                    I just - wasn t expecting somebody 
                    so well-dressed, and articulate.
                          (she faces forward)
                    ... Night and day from your 
                    brother. Amazing.

                                  MOSS
                    You what?

                                  JANE
                    Well, I mean, you come with us like 
                    a man. Not whining and screaming 
                    like he did - They almost had to 
                    restrain him, you know? 
                          (turns and smiles)
                    But not you. You re a gentleman. 
                    Detective Korilko here s got cuffs 
                    on his pants too - But not like 
                    yours. Yours say classy, all the 
                    way. Classy with an edge.                                                                                     21.


      Moss sits back. He likes this, and Jane.

                                  MOSS
                    Classy with an edge, huh. Yeah. So 
                    where we going now.

                                    KORILKO
                    Back to the squad so we can talk. 

                                  MOSS
                          (suddenly nervous)
                    My brother gonna be there? 

                                    KORILKO
                    You don t need to worry about that.

                                  MOSS
                    Cause maybe he cry like a bitch 
                    with you all but that ain t how he 
                    is with me.

                                    KORILKO
                    Yeah, well, you re gonna tell us 
                    all about how he is with you.

                                  MOSS
                    Yeah, well. Maybe I m confused now.

                                    KORILKO
                    ... You what?

      As Korilko starts to turn around in his seat, still driving -

                                  JANE
                          (suddenly)
                    Let s just go to the roof. It s not 
                    that much further than the squad. 
                    We could go there, and you could 
                    show us what happened at the scene. 
                    Instead of tell us at the squad. 
                    Want to do that?

                                  MOSS
                    ... Maybe. Maybe, yeah.

                                  JANE
                    Don t waste Detective Korilko s 
                    time here, though, Robert. And he s 
                    gonna have the DA s office meet us 
                    there, so don t waste theirs 
                    either. We all take this trouble 
                    going to that roof? You re gonna 
                    show us what happened.                                                                                    22.


                                  MOSS
                          (enthusiastic)
                    I will. I ll show you.  

      Jane ignores Korilko s resentful eyes.

                                  JANE
                    Field trip.


      We SEE roof and skyline through a VIDEOCAMERA, which now 
      turns its EYE on Jane. 

                                  JANE
                    Detective Jane Timoney, Manhattan 
                    North Homicide. And we ve also got -

      Off her gesture, the CAMERA swings to each one in turn -

                                  ADA COLLINS
                          (rookie, startled)
                    I, ah, Drew Collins, Assistant 
                    District Attorney. Are we -

                                    KORILKO
                    Detective Don Korilko Manhattan 
                    North Homicide.

                                  CAMERAMAN
                    Mike Mannion on the camera.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    And last but of course not least -

                                  MOSS
                    I m Robert Moss.
                          (leans in)
                    I m the killer.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    ... So Robert, you want to talk 
                    about what happened here with you 
                    and your brother and Lola Arzuaga?

                                  MOSS
                    Okay, so I stay out in Brooklyn but 
                    I came in to see my brother and his 
                      girlfriend. That s Lola. I had a 
                    little money, we got a bottle and 
                    came up here. My brother found a 
                    jay he had, so it was like, let her 
                    drink while we go smoke this.                                                                                     23.


                                  JANE
                    And where did you go to do that?

      The camera follows Moss over to another part of the roof.

                                  MOSS
                    Here, and we re talkin about maybe 
                    go down the street find somebody - 
                    you know. To rob or whatever... But 
                    so we go back to get a drink, and 
                    she had finished the bottle. Lola.

                                  JANE
                      Seriously? And you re out of money, 
                    and you re six flights up?

                                  MOSS
                    And my brother s got this temper, 
                    even when we re kids - so Lola, he 
                    punches her in the face. Knocked 
                    her out cold. And he was in like a 
                    rage, he goes, Let s throw this 
                    bitch off the roof.

      Back on Jane in the flesh. As she starts to speak, Korilko 
      suddenly STEPS forward. He s taking back his case.

                                    KORILKO
                    What d you do when he said that.

                                  MOSS
                    If I m gonna be honest? First off I 
                    was thinking, I m just outta jail. 
                    So I was gonna ask like his 
                      permission, to make love to her 
                    first. But then I don t know how 
                    he s gonna react. He s already mad.

                                    KORILKO
                    So you didn t say anything.

                                  MOSS
                    Uh-uh. I just carry the heavy part. 
                    You know, the head. We go to the 
                    wall, and it was like Uhhh - and we 
                    just throwed her over like that.

      The camera WATCHES Moss mime hurling an invisible body off 
      the roof. It FOLLOWS the arc up and over to SEE - there s an 
      actual BODY-SHAPED OUTLINE in the leaves and branches of the 
      TREES below. As we HOLD on the outline...                                                                                    24.



      - Jane on the roof. Watching Robert Moss. 

                                  MOSS
                    We go back downstairs and Russell 
                    goes into some hallway and punches 
                    some guy, takes his money, and we 
                    went and got another bottle. And 
                    then I went back to Brooklyn.

                                    KORILKO
                    Anything else you want to say?

                                  MOSS
                    Yeah - I m Robert Moss... And I m 
                    looking for work.

                                    KORILKO
                    Okay, DeNiro. That s a cut. 

      Korilko hustles Moss to the access door. Collins watches them 
      go, stunned. Then he looks at Mannion, who is also stunned. 
      Then the two of them look at Jane - who is gazing OFF.

                                    MANNION
                    Janie? Whose case is that?

                                  JANE
                    It s a made case. 
                          (as they follow her gaze)
                    Wow. Right?

                                    MANNION
                    Excuse me for not being in the mood 
                    after we just had to listen to that 
                    guy like he s people.                                                                                    26.


                                  JANE
                    So I guess if I bought you a hot 
                    dog right now you wouldn t eat it? 

                                  ADA COLLINS
                          (suddenly)
                    I d eat it.

                                  JANE
                    Two for you.

      As Jane precedes the two men to the access door, REVERSE 
      ANGLE to SHOW - the magnificent SUNSET behind them...


      The sedan is at the curb. Jane is heading for the front 
      steps, Carter behind her, trying to conceal his frustration.

                                  CARTER
                    Why didn t you just say to Reg you 
                    wanted to see the crime scene?.. 
                    What m I supposed to tell him about 
                    the housekeeper?

                                  JANE
                    Tell him she s a loose end.

                                  CARTER
                    ... Right. How long we gonna be.

                                  JANE
                    Don t know.

                                  CARTER
                    Well - You just want to look the 
                    place over, or what are we doing?

      Jane RINGS the doorbell. She looks at Carter.

                                  JANE
                          (mild)
                    Were you there when Keating talked 
                    to the kids the first time?

                                  CARTER
                    You re gonna try to interview the 
                    kids now? -

                                  JANE
                    You were. It was Keating, and you 
                    and the kids.
                          (as he shrugs yes)
                    But not a child psychologist. 
                    Right?
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    36.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (off his face)
                    There s no psych report in the 
                    file. Did he even call one? 
                          (off his face)
                    No. Did you? No. Right? 
                          (off his face)
                    So whatever they d ve told you, 
                    it d be open to saying it was 
                    coerced -

                                  CARTER
                    - Didn t end up mattering. They 
                    said they didn t know anything. 
                    They said they never saw the guy.

                                  JANE
                    And you were satisfied with that.

                                  CARTER
                          (bravado)
                    Yeah. We were. 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah - Somebody needed not to be.

      As Carter stares at Jane - the townhouse door suddenly OPENS 
      to REVEAL the nanny, GISELE CLARKE. As she stares at Jane, 
      then at Carter, recognizing him, Jane holds up her BADGE.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Hello, I m Detective Timoney, I m 
                    the new detective in charge of the 
                    case. Can we come inside, please.

                                  GISELE
                          (worried)
                    Okay. But - I have to call Dr. 
                    Edgerton. You need to talk to him.

                                  JANE
                    I agree a hundred percent.

      As Gisele disappears from the door, Carter s CELL starts to 
      RING. Jane doesn t look at him. She holds a card out to him.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    When you re done call this guy. Dr. 
                    Kevin Hynes. Tell him we re here, 
                    and he should come now... And tell 
                    Duffy I said hi. 

      Jane goes inside. As Carter slowly answers his phone...                                                                                    37.



      On Jane as she stands alone in silence on the pavement. She 
      sniffs, then turns to see the DOORMAN of a nearby building 
      cupping a lighter to a CIGARETTE. As she shakes her head, 
      denying a thought, Carter approaches. Beat. Then -

                                  CARTER
                    All right, so, we were wrong. You 
                    found the angle, and you worked the 
                    kid. Good job -

                                  JANE
                    Let s go. 

      Carter stares at her. Then, as he unlocks the car -

                                  CARTER
                            (conversationally)
                    Hey, you ever worry someone s gonna 
                    drop a house on you?

                                  JANE
                    This car s not gonna drive itself. 

      As Jane gets in the car and SLAMS the door -


      - a war zone. Unmarked sedans parked everywhere there aren t 
      QUEENS EMERGENCY SERVICES TRUCKS. The EMS guys (think SWAT) 
      are strapped up with heavy vests. They ve set up in the front 
      and back of 2299 Ditmars Boulevard. As one EMS guy SMACKS 
      another on the helmet with adrenalined enthusiasm and the 
      entire phalanx erupts with similar gestures -

      - PULL BACK to find Jane, Evrard and Rowe, crouched behind 
      their car across the street. Duffy, Korilko and the others 
      are fanned out nearby. Jane is eyeing the EMS guys.                                                                                     56.


                                  JANE
                    ... Those Queens guys don t blink a 
                    whole lot. You ever notice that?

      Evrard and Rowe chuckle. Rowe keys the radio.  

                                  ROWE
                    Homicide CO to CO Queens 
                      Emergency... All units in position?

      A pump-action SHOTGUN RACKS somewhere in the darkness as an 
      answer, followed by another further off. The radio crackles. 

                                  RADIO (V.O.)
                      Affirmative Homicide - all ESU

                                  JANE
                    Make the call, Ev. 

      Evrard dials a cell phone. Someone picks up.

                                  EVRARD
                          (in subtitled Spanish)
                    Evening ma am this is Detective 
                    Evrard Velario NYPD. Is this Idalis 
                    Ayala?
                    Nothing s wrong. We just need to 
                    speak to your son Victor. 
                    We just need to. Is he home?
                    It s not about him doing anything.
                    We re not looking to hurt anyone. I 
                    would not lie to you on that. 

                                  JANE
                    What s happening.

                                  EVRARD
                          (hand over mouthpiece)
                    Mama s giving me some grief. 
                          (subtitled Spanish)
                    We don t want to come in. Please 
                    just tell him come out? 
                    We ll explain everything then. 
                    Yep, we re all here, waiting out 
                    front. You can t miss us. 
                          (hand over mouthpiece)
                    She says he s coming out. 

                                  ROWE
                          (on radio)
                    Tell everybody stand by, he s 
                    coming out.                                                                                     57.


      A tense long beat. Nothing. Another one. Nothing. Jane stares 
      at the front door of the building, which remains closed. 

                                  JANE
                    Ask her where he is. 

                                  EVRARD
                          (subtitled Spanish)
                    We re waiting. What s the hold up.
                    Listen, don t jerk me around, okay? 
                    I said we need him out here now. 
                          (to Jane)
                    She says he came out. She says he s 
                    standing right in front waiting.

      Jane stares back, suddenly filled with horror. Beat. Then -

                                  JANE
                    ... Ask her what their address is.

      Evrard holds Jane s gaze as -

                                  EVRARD
                          (subtitled Spanish)
                    Ma am, what s your address? Your 
                    street number address.
                          (to Jane - shit)
                    2929. 2929 Ditmars. Seven blocks 
                    away, maybe six -

      Jane KICKS the side of the sedan, enraged - then leaps to her 
      feet, as does Evrard. Rowe scrambles to follow.

                                  ROWE
                    What s going on?

      Jane is already getting behind the wheel, Evrard next to her.

                                  JANE
                    Somebody misread the directory -

                                  ROWE
                          (into radio)
                    Guys - Stand down. Wrong house. 
                    We re moving. Correct address is -

                                  EVRARD
                    - 2929 -

                                  ROWE
                    2929 Ditmars. Repeat, stand down. 
                    Wrong house. Actual address 2929.                                                                                    58.


      The radio and every walkie immediately ERUPT with responders 
      screaming for information. But there s no time to remobilize. 
      OFF the car as Jane takes off with squealing tires -


      - in time to see a young dark-haired Hispanic MAN sprinting 
      down the sidewalk into the darkness. It s VICTOR AYALA.

                                  EVRARD
                    You got him? You see him?

                                  JANE
                    Yeah - Does he see us?

      She BRAKES and HORNS as a CAR tries to pull out ahead -

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch! 

      - and as Jane hits the gas again, we SEE Ayala suddenly dart 
      across the traffic up ahead, heading for the concrete island 
      that runs down the boulevard. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Keep your eyes on him -

                                  EVRARD
                    ... He s on the island - He s gonna 
                    try for the other side -

      Jane lays on the horn as she tries to get into the leftmost 
      lane next to the island -

                                  EVRARD (CONT D)
                    He s going for it - 

                                  JANE
                    Please God, someone wing him -

                                  EVRARD
                    He s over. He made it. 

      Jane immediately CUTS the wheel. The sedan leaves the left 
      lane and goes UP on the island, almost fishtailing amid the 
      sound of screeching metal. Evrard hangs on, his face set.

      Jane, laying frantically on the HORN, finds an opening in the 
      opposite traffic and takes the car at speed down off the 
      island into the lane - at which point a front TIRE and the 
      right rear TIRE both EXPLODE.                                                                                    59.


      On the far sidewalk, a still running Ayala looks over his 
      shoulder at the derailed sedan grounded in the middle of 
      traffic. It doesn t stop him even for a second. OFF Jane 
      through the windshield, pounding the steering wheel -

      - then suddenly EXPLODING out of the car, the driver s door 
      ramming off an SUV that s come to a stop alongside. Ignoring 
      the cursing driver she TAKES OFF after the vanishing Ayala -

      - as another car comes to a rubberburning halt too close to 
      Evrard s door. He can t open it. As he struggles across to 
      the driver s side, he grabs the walkie and YELLS into it -

                                  EVRARD (CONT D)
                    Manhattan North Homicide to

                                  EVRARD
                    My partner is in pursuit on 
                    foot - Unknown if suspect is armed - 
                    33rd Street and Ditmars Boulevard!

      As Evrard struggles out of the car -


      - Jane is running. From a distance she looks good but up 
      close it s all adrenaline. In a minute she ll hit the wall. 

      Up ahead Ayala s got a good lead but he s still visible. He 
      glances over his shoulder, dodging the few people out on the 
      pavements. Jane squints to keep him in sight, then pushes 
      herself harder. As her breathing gets more ragged - up ahead 
      Ayala takes a sharp angle and DISAPPEARS.  

      Jane s body wants to stop. Her lungs are burning. With no 
      time to stop she turns her head and SPITS - forcing herself 
      to drain the tank and follow her last glimpse of Ayala into -


      Narrow between two apartment buildings, illuminated only by 
      the street light out on the boulevard and a few lamps in 
      windows above. Jane takes the corner at speed but slows down 
      after twenty feet, her eyes adjusting -

      - and out of the dark comes Ayala, running full-tilt STRAIGHT 
      FOR HER. Before Jane can even react - he TACKLES her at 
      midline and takes them both DOWN flying hard to the pavement, 
      Jane taking the brunt of the impact for them both.                                                                                     60.


      Jane BLINKS, stunned. Above her Ayala curses, having come 
      down on an elbow. He s almost unaware of Jane struggling to 
      move. But as he tries to sit back on his heels and stand -

      - Jane GRABS his CLOTHES and holds him tightly to her. 

      At first Ayala is confused. Then he realizes why he can t 
      move. He looks down at Jane and SMACKS her almost matter-of-
      factly across the FACE with all the strength of his unhurt 
      arm. Jane reacts, whining with pain. But she DOESN T LET GO. 
      She clutches him to her like grim death. The way no woman 
      Ayala has put in this position ever has. 

      Now Ayala is whining too, desperate with the urge to flee. As 
      the two of them struggle, locked together in the dark -

      - suddenly Ayala is YANKED OFF Jane. By Evrard. A walkie hits 
      the deck and skitters away. As he lays into Ayala, Jane tries 
      to roll on her side. She can hear the walkie nearby.

                                  RADIO (V.O.)

                    - 21st Ave and Steinway Street.

      Running footsteps. Queens EMS now in the alley. Evrard 
      appears on his knees next to Jane. As she focuses on him -

                                  EVRARD (CONT D)
                    Want to go grab a few pops at 
                      McSorley s?

                                  JANE
                    ... Right behind you.

      Off Jane as she finally smiles...                                                                                    61.


                                        ACT FIVE

      In the BLACK we hear DRUMS.


      Keating s funeral. The department out in force. Color guard, 
      uniformed honor guard, and the pipe band, which now KICKS IN. 
      Uniformed, professional PALLBEARERS walk the CASKET on their 
      shoulders, their hands never touching it. The casket is 
      draped with the blue, green, white and gold flag of the NYPD. 
      It moves past our characters, threaded through the crowd. 

      Now the casket passes Rowe, standing with Keating s destroyed 
      family. Near them but not with them is Duffy, his face thick 
      with tears he has succeeded in holding back - almost. 

      PULL BACK to REVEAL Jane watching Duffy. She s still in pain 
      from the alley. But that s not why this is the only time 
      we ve seen her even close to crying. As she watches a man 
      unable to express emotion buckle under the weight of it... 


      Jane approaches Duffy, who is standing alone and looks lost. 

                                  JANE
                    Reg... Hey, Reg.

      Duffy blinks. They re both helpless. Then Jane gestures at 
      the Patrolmen s Benevolent Association canteen truck.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Lemme buy you a free coffee.

      Duffy doesn t answer. But he follows Jane to the truck. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You guys were friends a long time, 
                    huh. How many years?

                                  DUFFY
                    ... Since we re kids. Xavier High 
                    School  65. Then the Academy.
                          (beat, then)
                    One time on patrol we hear robbery 
                    in progress, this dive on East 51st 
                    - The boozebags are pouring out 
                    like rats and one of em yells 
                     They re still in there!  So I head 
                    for the door - and the guy that 
                    yelled pulls a gun and fires at me. 
                    Cause he was the  they . 
                          (still amazed)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    62.

                                  DUFFY (CONT'D)
                    Don t know how he missed me. But 
                    Gerry got him. He didn t miss. 

      Jane hands a cup to Duffy. He takes it and looks at her.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    This squad is my home. 
                          (serious)
                    You re invading it.

                                  JANE
                          (beat, then)
                    I know you miss your friend. Maybe 
                    try to figure out how much of this 
                    is really about that.  

      Duffy looks off, shaking his head. Jane follows his gaze to 
      see Carter approaching. Duffy addresses him.

                                  DUFFY
                    She thinks it s about Gerry.

                                  CARTER
                    It s not not about Gerry. 

      As Jane looks at Carter who s apparently with Duffy on this -

                                  DUFFY
                    Who knows - By the time you re 
                    done? You even might end up 
                      preferring me and Philly here. At 
                    least we re honest. 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah? Me too - You need a new home.

      Duffy behind-the-backs his cup into a nearby trash barrel. 

                                  DUFFY
                    You re not the man who s gonna give 
                    it to me. Skip.

      Duffy and Carter walk away without looking back. Jane watches 
      them go, then notices Detective Moore from SVU walking with a 
      somber group a little ways off. As she catches his eye - he 
      gives her the FINGER.

      As Jane turns away, almost smiling, Evrard is approaching. 
      He s holding a plastic bag full to bursting with a bow on it.  

                                  EVRARD
                    What s all that about.                                                                                    63.


                                  JANE
                    The Beef Trust.
                          (re: the bag)
                    What s all that about.

      Evrard hands Jane the bag. She looks inside. As we SEE it s 
      crammed with foilpacks of NICOTINE GUM -

                                  EVRARD
                    Some of those are from me... But 
                    not all of them.

      He blows her a kiss and exits. Jane s CELL suddenly RINGS. 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah... When? 
                          (she closes her eyes)
                    That is great. When is it?

      Off Jane and her bag of gum in the cemetery...
