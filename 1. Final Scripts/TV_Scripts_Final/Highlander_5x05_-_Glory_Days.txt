      FADE IN:

401401EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

      A distinctive building.  A sign over the door announces THE
      DELIO GROUP.

      The streets are empty.  A limo pulls up to the entrance. 
      THE DRIVER (BOBBY), a linebacker squeezed into a suit, gets
      out and opens the back door for DOMINIC DELIO, a ruthless
      businessman in a Sulka tie.

                                      BOBBY
                    First one here again today, Mr. DeLio.

      DeLio barely acknowledges him, Bobby rushes to get the
      building door for him.

402402INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR HALL - DAY

      A hallway featuring luxury brass and glass doors to the DELIO
      GROUP offices, closed and locked.  On either side of the
      doors are lush potted plants, spotlighted by track lights. 
      Above one of the plants, a puff of SMOKE swirls into the
      light.

      ANGLE - A PLANT

      in the shadow, a man leans against the wall.  JOHNNY KELLY
      appears tall, broad shouldered, long coat and gloves.  A
      fedora pulled low hides most of his face.

      He takes a leisurely drag off the cigarette in his free hand,
      keeping his eyes trained on the elevator.  Waiting.

403403INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

      DeLio and Bobby cross the lobby, passing the front desk,
      where the GUARD is dozing.  Bobby coughs loudly and the Guard
      snaps to attention, embarrassed.

                                      GUARD
                    Morning, Mr. DeLio.  Sir.

      DeLio glares and keeps moving to the elevator.  Bobby pushes
      the button.96504      "Glory Days"      2.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96



404404INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR HALL - SAME TIME

      ANGLE - THE ELEVATOR as with a BING the doors open, and DeLio
      and Bobby step out.

      Bobby sees waiting ahead of them by the plant -- JOHNNY.

                                      BOBBY
                    You know him, sir?

      DeLio looks, shakes his head, unconcerned.

                                      DELIO
                    Take care of it.

      Bobby starts for him.  As he does, Johnny casually drops his
      cigarette, crushes it out with his foot.

                                      BOBBY
                          (advancing)
                    What the hell you doing?

      Johnny calmly raises his right arm -- we now see he holds a
        silencer-equipped AUTOMATIC.

      Bobby freezes, his hand goes to his coat -- too slow.  The
      gun POPS -- Bobby spins and drops, leaving --

      DELIO exposed and afraid, backing away.

                                      DELIO
                    Whatever you want, it's yours.  Name
                    it... I'll pay it!

      DeLio runs to the elevator, frantically pumps the button. 
      As the elevator doors start to open --

      Johnny shoots: two POPS.  DeLio crumples into the open
      elevator.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (mocking; a cold
                            whisper)

      The Guard glances at his of video screens.  He freezes:

      DeLio lying half-in the elevator.  The Guard blinks.  Whips
      his head to another screen:

      The tall, well-built assassin lowering his gun.

      The Guard is up, racing for the elevator, pulling his gun as
      he does.

406406INT. OFFICE BUILDING - EMERGENCY STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

      CAMERA STAYS LOW as the killer bursts through the door. 
      Everything that follows is done with quick precision: THE
      TRENCHCOAT opens, revealing shorter legs strapped into a set
      of shoe-equipped STILTS with pant-legs attached.  The stilts
      come off.

                                                                                INTERCUT:

      THE GUARD

      At the elevator, pounding the button -- but DeLio s body
      jams the doors.  He yanks his walkie-talkie.

                                      GUARD
                    911!  911!

      RESUME - STAIRWELL

      TIGHT - THE KILLER'S COAT

      fitted with inflatable padding.  Plugs are pulled, air forced
      out as he moves down the steps, and next we see --

      A FLATTENED BACKPACK

      into which the gimmicks are quickly stuffed, followed by the
      HAT and WIG (one piece).  The silenced PISTOL next.  Still
      hammering down the stairs towards --

      KILLER'S POV

      as he races to the landing.  Then we HEAR the sound of ROLLING
      WHEELS, and we're heading straight for the DOOR to the lobby.

409409INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - SAME TIME

      Just as the Guard reaches the door, it SWINGS OPEN.  He levels
      his gun, ready to shoot as he faces --

409CONTINUED:409

      JOHNNY KELLY, in a baseball cap, looking younger than his
      years, is on a skateboard with a backpack and T-shirt -- no
      resemblance to the big assassin.  Seeing the gun, Johnny
      freezes in his tracks, stares wide-eyed.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Whoa.  Is that real?

      It's a light tenor voice -- no resemblance to the killer's
      rasp he used in the hallway upstairs.

      The Guard swings his gun away -- he almost shot a kid.

                                      GUARD
                    Son of a... !
                          (takes a breath)
                    You see a big guy on the stairs? 
                    Trench coat?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah.  He was running up to the
                    roof...

                                      GUARD
                    Get the hell out of here!

      The Guard slams through the doors, up the stairs.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (beat)
                    Whatever you say.

      Johnny smiles -- it's not the smile of a kid.  He hops on
      his skateboard and shoves off, treats himself to a spin around
      the lobby before pulling a sharp turn and wheeling out the
      door.  As he does, we hear his voice coming back: it's a
      Jolson tune.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                          (singing)
                    "When there are grey skys, I don't
                    mind those grey skies.  You make
                    them blue, sonny boy."

      Blues music wafting out.

411411INT. JOE'S - NIGHT

      Onstage, a BLUES BAND of fairly young musicians finishes its
      set with a slick guitar run and a drum flourish.  The crowded
      room breaks into appreciative applause.

      MacLeod is at the bar.  He turns back to Dawson on the other
      side.

                                      MACLEOD
                    They're good.  Where d you find them?

                    At a dump on the waterfront playing
                    for overweight lap-dancers.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So Dawson rides to the rescue.

                                      DAWSON
                          (beat)
                    I got a soft spot for strays.

      Dawson's distracted by someone coming through the door. 
      Staring.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Can't be.

      MacLeod sees his face, follows his look over to --

      BETSY FIELDS

      She's looking hesitant as she moves toward the bar, eyes
      scanning the room for a place to sit.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Something wrong?

      Dawson just shakes his head.  He's shocked, but it's a
      pleasant, unexpected shock.  He watches her, a mix of emotions
      on his face, as she moves along the bar, eyes searching the
      table area.  Then, as she passes close enough that Dawson is
      certain --

                                      DAWSON
                    Betsy?

      She stares back with the same look he has: surprise, then
      growing pleasure.

                                      BETSY
                    Joe?  Joe Dawson?

      She's searching his face.  Dawson nods, a gentle smile.

                                      DAWSON
                    Only one I know of.

                                      BETSY
                    Joe, it is you!

      Shock turns to delight.  She holds out her arms and clasps
      Dawson's hands over the bar.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    I can't believe this!  What are you
                    doing here?

                                      DAWSON
                          (wry)
                    You see the sign outside?

                                      BETSY
                          (re the place)
                    This is yours.
                          (off his nod)
                    This is great.

                                      DAWSON
                    It is.  It really is.
                          (beat)
                    Here, sit, let me get you something.

      Dawson busies himself behind the bar.  MacLeod pulls a stool
      out for her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Please.

                                      DAWSON
                    Sorry.  Mac, this is Bet Fields.

      She laughs delightedly at the pet name.

      Dawson can only nod, not taking his eyes off her.  MacLeod
      watches with amused interest.

                    I'd love to, Bet, but I'm a little
                    busy right now.

                                      BETSY
                    How about dinner?

      She's earnest, inviting.  Dawson evades her eyes.

                                      DAWSON
                    Tonight?
                          (off her nod)
                    Someone's got to watch the joint.

                                      BETSY
                    Lunch tomorrow, then?

                    The thing is... the beer tap's
                    leaking.  Gotta drive out to my
                    storage locker to get a spare part.

      He shrugs -- got no choice.  Betsy nods, biting back her
      real disappointment, managing to force a smile.

                                      BETSY
                    Sure... Okay, some other time, maybe.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Joe, I'll pick up the part.
                          (re: Betsy)
                    You've got better things to do.

                    I still have to fix it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I've been around a while.  Think I
                    can handle a beer tap.

      Dawson is trapped.  Tries to manage a smile.

                                      DAWSON
                    Thanks.

                                      BETSY
                      Wonderful.  So I'll come by here,
                    what -- tomorrow, around one?

                                      DAWSON
                    One it is.

      She flashes him a winning smile and moves off.  She's no
      kid, but she draws some appreciative looks.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think she likes you.

                                      DAWSON
                    Do me a favor?
                          (tight)
                    Next time, mind your own business.

      MacLeod does a doubletake.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Something I'm missing here?

      Dawson tosses MacLeod a set of keys.

                    yourself out.

      And he turns away, wiping the bar harder than it needs. 
      MacLeod lifts the keys, eyeing him, and OFF this --

      As Johnny slaloms down the concrete, reaches a door, stomps
      his board, flipping it up into his hands -- and keys open
      his padlock.  He disappears inside.

      Johnny snaps on the light, hangs his board up next to several
      OTHER SKATEBOARDS hanging in a row.

      ANGLE - FAR WALL

      Johnny's "office".  On one side: rows of COSTUMES, STAGE
      MAKE-UP, WIGS and DISGUISES.  On the other side -- WEAPONS. 
      German HUNTING RIFLES, telescopic SIGHTS, KNIVES, PISTOLS,
      various ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS used to make bombs.  Your full-
      service hitman.

      Johnny opens his sack, pulls out the disguise from the
      previous day.  He rubs his hands as he smiles over his
      equipment.

      He reaches up, switches on a BOOM-BOX.  Incongruous vintage
      Jolson pours out.  The kid is older than he looks.  Way older.

      ANGLE - A CLIPBOARD

      and two photos there: One is DOMINIC DELIO, the dead man. 
      Beside it, a man with similar feature: MICHAEL DELIO, standing
      in front of DeLio s Tool & Die.  Johnny takes Dominic's photo
      down, tears it up, tosses in a garbage can.

      along with the tape as he pulls out a comb, combs down his

415415INT. STORAGE FACILITY - JOE'S LOCKER - DAY - SAME TIME

      An array of JUNK in precarious piles: an old neon BEER SIGN,
      TOOLS, a DRESSMAKER'S DUMMY, an old GUITAR AMP, a box with
      TOY TRAIN TRACKS.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Unbelievable.  I'm 400 years old, I
                    don't have this much junk.

      He starts to claw through boxes, finds a FOOTBALL, puts it
      aside and finally stops at -- a TOOL BOX.

      He pulls it out -- an avalanche of JUNK comes at him.  He
      backs into the DRESSMAKER'S DUMMY, rights it gingerly before
      it topples.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I'm not even gonna ask.

      He moves out of the locker with the tool box.

416416EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - ROW B - DAY

      As MacLeod locks the door, he gets the BUZZ.  He looks around,
      alert -- coming from somewhere in the storage facility.  He
      lowers the TOOLBOX, and heads toward it.

417417INT. STORAGE FACILITY - JOHNNY'S LOCKER - DAY - SAME

      Johnny is whistling cheerfully, cleaning the AUTOMATIC he
      used to kill DeLio.  He removes the CLIP, about to put it on
      the wall -- he feels the BUZZ.

      He slaps the CLIP back in the practiced motion and puts it
      down.  He reaches the wall, takes down his SWORD, then picks
      up the gun, shoves it in his back belt.  A hard smile.

      MacLeod domes down an aisle, moving warily his hand on his

      comes face to face with --

      JOHNNY

      They stare at each other a BEAT, in recognition.

                                      JOHNNY

      MacLeod in a Poker game with a some local jamooks, BIG GINO,
      about 280 pounds, JIMMY THE WEASEL, and another guy.

      They're in shirt sleeves and  heavy curtains keep out prying
      eyes.  Big Gino has the biggest cigar, so he's the boss.

      The atmosphere is relaxed.

                                      MACLEOD
                    See you...

                    Call.

      But MacLeod is distracted as Johnny Kelly, same age as in
      the present, steps up and refills his glass with bootleg
      gin.  MacLeod eyes Johnny for a moment.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (defiant)

      Johnny shrugs moves to the next player.  Jimmy taps his cards
      on the table impatiently, prompting MacLeod.

                    Three twos.

      Jimmy spreads his own cards.

                    Ha!  Full house!

      Everybody groans.  Jimmy reaches for the pile of cash.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Hey, Gino.  For a sawbuck, I'll tell
                    you where he got that hand.  Whaddaya

                          (smartass)
                    An' it's connected to two eyes.

      Jimmy starts to rise angrily.  MacLeod quickly picks up the
      empty bottle, shoves it at Johnny.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Here.  Go get us a refill before you

      MacLeod's eyes are on Jimmy as he leaves the place.

421421EXT. GINO'S SOCIAL CLUB - NEW YORK - 1929 - DAY

      Johnny cruises down the street, carrying a brown bag.

      Jimmy steps from Gino's storefront, scowling, takes a pack
      of cigarettes out.

      Johnny sees him, ducks into a stoop.  He hasn't exactly made
      pals with this guy.  Down the street --

      A FORD PHAETON approaches, driven by TOMMY, a squash-nosed
      pug.

      Jimmy lifts the smoke, thumb-nailing a match with his other
      hand.  He sucks in smoke, looks up just as --

      THE CAR

      passes.  Windows go down,  black barrels of MACHINE GUNS
      slide out of the windows and SPURT FIRE, raking Jimmy.

      JIMMY

      bounces against the wall, clutching smoke and matches, body
      jerking with the hits, he's a spastic marionette.

      RESUME JOHNNY

      hidden in the doorway, staring as the cat speeds away.  He
      has a clear view of the driver: TOMMY.  Johnny steps from
      the stoop, stares down at Jimmy.  A low whistle.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Boy, are you dead.

      And OFF this --

422422EXT. STREET NEAR GINO'S - NEW YORK - 1929 - LATER

      A sheet over Jimmy's body.  The poker players and MacLeod
      hover over him, looking grim.  Two COPS have Johnny pinned
      to the wall.  One is O'GRADY.

                                      O'GRADY

                    law about takin' a leak?

      O'Grady slaps Johnny hard across the mouth.  A slim trickle
      of blood flows.

                                      O'GRADY
                    If I say there is.

      MacLeod steps in, placating, puts a hand on Johnny.

                    think about it.  Maybe something
                    will come to him.

      O'Grady eyes MacLeod, then turns to the kid.

                                      O'GRADY
                    I want to hear from you... soon.

      O'Grady and Malone move off, as well as the poker players. 
      MacLeod stays with Johnny, pulls him aside.

                    Just like 'em.  Nobody screws with

                                      MACLEOD
                    It doesn't have to be that way for
                    you, Johnny.

                    What are you, a priest or something?

      He starts away.  MacLeod puts a hand on his arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm trying to help you.

                    You wanna help?

      He shoves the brown bag into MacLeod's hand.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Give this to Gino.  Compliments of
                    Johnny K.  Tell 'im I quit.

      He pushes off.  MacLeod watches him go, shaking his head.

423423EXT. BROWNSTONE SPEAKEASY - NEW YORK - 1929 - NIGHT

      Johnny knocks loudly on the door.  The WINDOW SLOT opens to
      reveal a smash-nosed face: TOMMY.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Tell Mr. Luca that Johnny K wants to
                    see him.

                                      TOMMY
                    Get lost, pipsqueak.

      Tommy makes a face -- friggin' pipsqueak -- the window slot
      slams shut.  Johnny bangs on it.

                    He's gonna want to talk to me about
                    what happened outside Gino's today.

      A BEAT -- the door opens.  Tommy towers menacingly over
      Johnny.

                                      TOMMY
                    Nothing happened.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah, right.  And you were driving
                    when it didn't.

      Tommy grabs Johnny, lifts him right off the ground.  Johnny's
      scared but he doesn't back down.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Leggo the threads.

                    I come to tell you not to worry! 
                    Know how to do the right thing.

      Tommy holds his eyes, a BEAT, impassive.

                                      TOMMY
                    You're right.  I think Mr. Luca's
                    gonna wanna see you.
                          (beat)
                    C'mon.

      Johnny looks triumphant as Tommy puts his arm around him,
      draws him outside, around the corner.

424424INT. WAREHOUSE - NEW YORK - 1929 - NIGHT

      The door slides open -- Tommy steps inside, his arm still on
      Johnny's shoulder.  Johnny's eyes widen.  In the floodlit
      warehouse, a couple of HOODS look on as --

      MR. LUCA

      dressed in natty GOLFING KNICKERS, complete with socks,
      sweater, white shoes, brings back his woody, and with lovely
      form, drives a ball out into --

      A LARGE NET

      hanging from the roof.  Stenciled words are hung, spread out
      on the net's backside: TRAP, LAKE, ROUGH, FAIRWAY.  The ball
      hits into the FAIRWAY area.

      RESUME LUCA

      He gives a satisfied nod to his "caddy" who holds his golf
      bag.  His smile fades as he sees Tommy with Johnny.

                                    LUCA
                    The hell is this, Tommy?  I'm working
                    on my backswing here.

      Tommy moves forward, whispers in Luca's ear.  Luca's look
      changes.  He gives Johnny an interested look.

                                    LUCA (CONT'D)
                    So waddaya want?  You wanna be one
                    of my boys?

                          (shrugs)
                    Me, I don't care.  Cause I know how
                    to take care of business.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I heard that.

      Johnny stands between Luca and the net.  Luca motions for
      his bag.

                                    LUCA
                    Ever golf?  Ever been 170 yards out
                    over water?

      Johnny shakes his head.  Luca considers his bag.

                                    LUCA (CONT'D)
                    Five iron might do it.  Even a four.

      He reaches in the bag -- pulls out a SHOTGUN.  Johnny steps
      back in disbelief as Luca aims.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You can't!  I kept my mouth shut!  I
                    won't tell nobody... !

      BANG -- Luca blasts him.  Johnny flies back and down, hit in
      the gut.  He's dead.

                                    LUCA
                    This is true.

      Luca slides the shotgun back in the bag.  And OFF this --

425425EXT. ALLEYWAY - NEW YORK - 1929 - NIGHT - SHORTLY AFTER

      The FORD PHAETON drives along the street.  It slows, a door
      opens -- a BODY tumbles out onto the pavement.  It's JOHNNY. 
      The Phaeton squeals off into the night.

426426INT. GINO'S - NEW YORK - 1929 - NIGHT - SAME TIME

      MacLeod is shuffling cards when his senses start tingling:
      an IMMORTAL is coming into being nearby.  He passes the cards
      to his left.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Think I'll call it a night.

427427EXT. ALLEYWAY - NEW YORK - 1929 - NIGHT

      MacLeod searches the street, looking for the source of the
      BUZZ he's getting.  Then he spots, behind some garbage and
      boxes --

      JOHNNY, lying dead in the gutter, a wound in his belly. 
      MacLeod lifts his head up.

      A moment later, Johnny coughs back to life for the first
      time.  Disoriented and groggy at first -- then growing angry.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Leggo...!  That friggin' Luca -- he
                    shot me!  Tried to kill me!

                    He did more than try.

      Johnny feels his belly.  No more pain.  Baffled.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What gives?  He shot me, right here! 
                    I felt it!

                    I know.

      Johnny stares at him, freaked, scrambles to his feet.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You know what?!  What the hell's
                    goin' on?!  Who are you, anyway?

                    with a bullet, anyway.

                    He thinks he killed you, but he can't. 
                    No one can, unless they cut off your

                          (drawing his sword)
                    With one of these.

      Johnny goggles at the blade, backs off a step.

                                      JOHNNY
                    This is some kinda joke, right?

      MacLeod turns to go.

      Johnny doesn't waste a second.  The smile fades, he pulls

      MacLeod is hit.  He tumbles to the concrete, rolls painfully
      to his back.  Johnny is already standing over him with his
      sword out.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, MacLeod.  In my line of work,
                    nobody knows my face.
                          (beat)
                    And "nobody" includes you.

      He raises the sword, brings it down as --

      MACLEOD

      rolls clear, as the blade strikes the ground.

      JOHNNY

      winds up again for the death blow.  MacLeod can't even get
      to his feet.  He's done for.  SFX a truck approaching.

      Johnny freezes, looks up as --

      A RENT-A-TRUCK arrives, and two ROADIES get out: long hair,
      big, beefy, tattoos -- straight from the Meatloaf school. 
      From the truck radio, the grind of HEAVY METAL.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Your lucky day, MacLeod.
                          (beat)
                    Be seein' you.

      He slips away.  MacLeod struggles painfully over to the wall,
      tries to rise.  The ROADIES see him, come over, and help him
      to his feet.

                    Been better.

      MacLeod slumps against the wall, his wound hidden from them,
      manages a grimace.  The one with more tattoos, a Deadhead T-
      shirt, looks at him in sympathy.

                                      ROADIE

      FADE IN:

429429INT. STORAGE FACILITY LOCKER - DAY

      BLACKNESS.  A CRACKLING sound -- then a crack of LIGHT that
      widens, finally reveals Johnny's locker as the door opens
      and MacLeod enters a crowbar in his hand.

      MacLeod flicks on the light, moves around the room touching
      various items as he takes in the display of equipment.

      On the WEAPON WALL: A bristling array of weapons.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Well.  Now we know your line of work.

430430INT. JOE'S DAY

      MacLeod works with a wrench on the tap.  Dawson looks on.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He's unbelievable.  Talks like he's
                    still living in the twenties... and
                    that locker.  Weapons, disguises...
                    he's an assassin, Joe.  A pro.

                                      DAWSON
                    He was mentioned in the Chronicles
                    once or twice in the early years,
                    but after that --
                          (shrugs)
                    He pretty much disappeared.  I always
                    figured he got whacked, since nobody
                    saw him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Or nobody recognized him.  With those
                    costumes, he probably never looks
                    the same twice.
                          (beat)
                    And I almost let him take me.

      Dawson, on the other side of the bar, catches a washer that
      rolls toward him.

                                      DAWSON
                          (placating)
                    He shot you in the back.  Not exactly
                    kosher.

430CONTINUED:430

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't think "kosher's" in his
                      vocabulary.
                          (beat)
                    He was a punk in '29 and he's a punk
                    now.  I should have known he'd try
                      something.
                          (re the tap)
                    Try it.

      Dawson pulls the tap.  Nothing happens.

                                      DAWSON
                    Well.  At least it doesn't leak.

      MacLeod grabs the wrench, starts on it again.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Shouldn't you be getting ready for
                    lunch about now?

      Dawson gets off the stool, avoiding, uncomfortable.

                                      DAWSON
                    She's not coming.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    I got things to do.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You lied to her?
                          (Dawson says nothing.)
                    To get out of a date?

      Dawson moves down the bar, tense, fiddles with the ashtrays. 
      MacLeod goes after him.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Why?

                                      DAWSON
                    Let it go, Mac.

      It's clear Dawson doesn't want to deal with it.  A technician
      on stage is running a soundcheck... FEEDBACK NOISE.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                          (snaps)
                    Blow that amp and you're out of here.

      The steam blown off for a moment.  MacLeod and Dawson share
      a look and Dawson finally opens up.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    I was eighteen.  All County.

                    I'd run all day, and we'd dance all

                                      MACLEOD
                    Sounds pretty good to me.

                                      DAWSON
                    It was great.
                          (hardening)
                    It was thirty years ago.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So you're not eighteen anymore. 
                    What's the big deal?  Neither is
                    she.

                                      DAWSON
                    Yeah.

                    But she still has two legs.

                          (getting it)
                    She doesn't know?

                          (pointed)
                    No.  Not going to, either.
                          (beat)
                    Far as she knows, I just went away
                    to war.
                          (beat)
                    I want to leave it that way.

                    Joe... you've never let this stop
                    you before.

                          (musing)
                    You should've seen me, Mac.  I was

                    do anything.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Joe, call her.  Take her to dinner.

      Dawson looks away, refusing to acknowledge MacLeod.

                    You can handle this.

      Dawson looks at him.  Naked, open, honest.

                                      DAWSON
                    No.

      He turns away, his face in turmoil.  And OFF this --

431431INT. DAWSON'S CAR - PARKED - EVENING

      Dawson at the wheel.  He checks himself out in the mirror,
      not so much for his appearance as to steel himself.  He takes
      a breath.

                                      DAWSON
                    Get a grip, buddy.  Just like walking
                    point.  No big deal.

      But it is.  He puts a hand on the door, as --

432432EXT. BETSY'S HOTEL - EVENING

      Betsy, looking great, waits with anticipation as Dawson gets
      out of the car, comes around to open her door.

                                      BETSY
                    Hi!  Mmmm, you smell good.

      She gives him a kiss on the cheek, then notices the cane.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                          (light)
                    What happened, hurt your knee changing

                    Betsy.
                          (beat)
                    I can't hurt my knee.

      She looks at him, puzzled, not getting it.  Dawson tries to
      make light of it, but doesn't succeed.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)

      Betsy looks at him, at his legs -- for a moment, doesn't
      know what to say.

                                      BETSY

                          (beat, realizing)
                    That's why you never called?  Never

                    What did you think I'd do, Joe?

                    I thought you'd found someone else...
                    I gave up waiting.

                                      DAWSON

                    Look, if you don't want to do
                    dinner...

      Betsy regroups quickly.  He's misjudged her.  She pulls open
      the car door, looks him in the eye.  She is still the woman
      he once loved.

                                      BETSY
                    After all these years, you think I m
                    going to let you go now?
                          (off his look)
                    I don t know about you, but I'm
                    starved.  Get your butt in the car.

      She's waiting.  Dawson holds the door as she gets in, closes
      it for her.  A relieved breath: got that over with.

                    Who says she knew?  My god, Jimi
                    Hendrix, Neil Young, Country Joe and
                    the Fish... I'm surprised I remember
                    who played, the shape I was in. 
                    Five bathrooms for half a million
                    people, mud a foot deep...
                          (frowns)
                    Come to think of it, I don't think I
                    had all that much fun.
                          (beat, warmly)
                    But I wish you'd been there.

                                      DAWSON
                    Me too.
                          (wry)
                    Had a little mud of my own to wade
                    through.

      He means 'Nam.  She nods.  Downs her glass of wine and takes
      a deep breath.

                                      BETSY
                    Joe...
                          (beat)
                    I have a confession to make.

      She's serious, gearing up for something.  Dawson, fearing
      what she might say, tries to deflect it with a joke.

                                      DAWSON
                    You really liked the Monkees?

                                      BETSY
                    No.  Well, yes, but that's not the
                    point.
                          (earnest)
                    It wasn't an accident that of all
                    the gin joints in all the world, I
                    walked into yours.

      Dawson listens as he pours her a glass of wine.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    A couple months ago I saw an article
                    on an airplane about blues clubs in
                    different cities... one of them
                    mentioned your name.
                          (beat)
                    I decided I'd take a chance.

                                      DAWSON
                          (reacting)
                    You came way out here to see me? 
                    After all this time?  Why?

                                      BETSY
                          (beat, shyly)
                    Didn't think I'd need to say it.

      Dawson is silent, taking this in, his hand tapping along
      with the music.  Betsy grows anxious.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Joe?

                                      DAWSON
                          (suddenly)
                    You want to dance?

      She stares a BEAT, taken by surprise.

                                      BETSY
                    You don't have to, really...

                                      DAWSON
                    I know I don't have to.  Do you want
                    to dance?

      Betsy nods, smiling, uncertain how to handle this.  Dawson
      stands and takes her hand, pulls her up.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Nothing to it.  I'll lead.

      Betsy moves into his arms, tentative.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry, I won't step on your
                    toes.

      They look in each other's eyes.  The magic coming back.  He
      pulls her closer.  She melts into his shoulder.

      CAMERA CIRCLES around them as they move to the music.  Betsy
      is dreamy, and slightly sad.  Dawson's hand touching her
      hair.  His eyes close as he moves.

436436INT. JOHNNY'S PLACE - NIGHT

      It's a fleabag, rented by the week.  Lights are on, the phone
      RINGING steadily.

      Someone rattling the door.  Finally it opens: MacLeod,
      breaking into Johnny's apartment.

      He enters cautiously, but there seems to be nobody home.  He
      reacts to the ratty furnishings.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Johnny?

      ANGLE - A TABLE

      and Johnny's HAT thrown on it, the only sign he was here. 
      The phone still RINGS.  MacLeod hesitates, picks up.

                                      JOHNNY (V.O.)
                          (over phone)
                    Never went to school, MacLeod... but
                    I can read you like a book.  That's
                    why I left my address for you.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (sarcastic)
                    Nice place you got here.  I guess
                    it's true -- crime doesn't pay.

                                                                                INTERCUT:

                    I got money.  Guy in my line of work
                    doesn't like to put down roots.  No
                    face, no trace.  Nothin' to tie me
                    in.

      MACLEOD S EYES

      scanning the room, the windows.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Where are you, Johnny?

                    Read it in the funny papers.

      ANGLE - A TABLE

      and on it, a package wrapped in the Sunday cartoons.  Just
      enough warning.  MacLeod DIVES for the window -- goes through
      it.

438438EXT. JOHNNY'S PLACE - NIGHT

      As MacLeod sails out through the window into the street just
      as the window behind him EXPLODES OUTWARD from the force of
      the bomb.

      MacLeod gets to his feet, brushes off glass and dirt.  His
      car is a few yards away -- and the CELL PHONE inside it is
      ringing.  He moves to it, picks up the phone.

                                      JOHNNY (on phone)
                    Good reflexes for an old guy.
                          (beat)
                    That's good.  Wouldn't want you to
                    make it too easy.

                                      MACLEOD

                                      JOHNNY
                    Says who?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Last time.  It ends now or I find
                    you.

                    You got it wrong, MacLeod.  I'll
                    find you.

      He hangs up.  DIAL TONE.  And OFF MacLeod's look --

439439INT. BETSY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      Dawson and Betsy enter together, expansive, bubbling.

                                      BETSY
                    That was great.  I haven't had that
                    much fun since...

      BEAT.  She looks at him.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Since you.

                                      DAWSON
                    Believe me, the pleasure was all
                    mine.

                                      BETSY
                    Not all of it.

      A BEAT.  She leans up, hesitant, then, and kisses him lightly
      on the lips.  Lingering.  Finally Dawson breaks, trying to
      rein in his feelings.  Both surprised at the intensity.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Oh my.

                                      DAWSON
                          (taking a breath)
                    Betsy, I don't know... I mean, I
                    never expected...
                          (beat)
                    I think maybe I should go.

                                      BETSY
                    Why?  Is it past your bed time?

                                      DAWSON
                    No...

                                      BETSY
                          (teasing)
                    Some pressing engagement?  Midnight
                      auditions, maybe?

      Dawson is smiling in spite of himself.  She puts her hands
      on his chest, runs them lightly up and down his shirt.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Or is that beer tap acting up again?

      She starts to unbutton his shirt.

                                      DAWSON
                    Look, Betsy, it's just...

      He fights his desire, suddenly stops her moving hands.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    You know.

      As if this explains it.  Betsy holds his eyes.

                                      BETSY
                    No.  I don't know.

                                      DAWSON
                          (in turmoil)
                    This is... it's moving a little fast. 
                    Maybe it's not a good idea.

                                      BETSY
                    It is if we want it to be, Joe.
                          (beat)
                    Do you want this?

                                      DAWSON
                    It's not that simple.

                                      BETSY
                    Right now it is.
                          (beat; with emphasis)
                    Do you want this?

      She's looking into his face, searching.  Dawson looking back,
      seeing it all there.  Everything he missed, wanted -- it's
      all still there.

                                      DAWSON
                    Yes.

      He lifts her face to his and they kiss deeply.  She pulls
      his shirt open, running her hands down his chest.

      ANGLE - THE WALL

      as his cane comes up, taps the light-switch OFF.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      MacLeod looks out his window edgy.  The elevator gate opens,
      behind him.  Dawson enters, whistling, cheerfully.

                    want to see.

      MacLeod glances at him, sees the cheerful face.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You swallow a canary or win the

                    Betsy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm very happy for you.

                                      DAWSON
                    You were right.  You should have
                    seen her.  She was beautiful.  It
                    was incredible.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm glad, Joe -- but, I ve got a few
                    things on my mind.

                                      DAWSON

                                      MACLEOD
                    Seems he has plans.

                                      DAWSON
                    They include you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    A shorter version of me.

                                      DAWSON
                    That little snotnose punk.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He's hunting me!  First a pistol,
                    then a bomb.

                                      DAWSON
                    A bomb?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He likes to kill from a distance. 
                    And he s not playing by the rules.

                    Little bastard could be up on the
                    roof with a high powered rifle.

                                      DAWSON
                    Rifle?

      Dawson slides a little lower on the couch.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    You just going to sit here?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Oh, no.  I thought I d stroll outside
                    and let him shoot me.

      The phone RINGS.  MacLeod stays low, picks it up.

                                                                                INTERCUT:

      JOHNNY

      in a phone booth, anywhere.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                          (on phone)
                    How ya doin' MacLeod?  Hope you got
                    cable, 'cuz I can wait a long time.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)
                    I have books.  You ought to try
                    reading, Johnny.  You might learn
                      something.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You taught me all I need to know,
                    MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I have a proposition, Johnny.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You?  What have you got that I want? 
                    Besides your head?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're a hired gun, right?  What if
                    I hire you to point it somewhere
                    else?

      MacLeod gestures -- I know what I'm doing.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Maybe.
                          (beat)
                    For two hundred G's.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Too much.  One hundred.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I might consider it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Meet me at Christ Church at three.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're a smart guy, MacLeod.  You
                    know when to cut your losses.  But
                    I'm warning you, don't screw with
                    me.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I wouldn't think of it.

      He hangs up.  Dawson staring at him.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're actually gonna go through
                    with this?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You bet.
                          (beat)
                    So are you.

      And OFF Dawson's baffled look --

441441INT. CHURCH - DAY

      MacLeod waits under a stained glass window.

      Johnny comes sauntering in, all attitude.  He passes the
      FONT, pulls a comb from his pocket, dips it in the water,
      runs through his hair, he nods to MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Anyone ever tell you how to behave
                    on Holy Ground?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I never took too good to Sunday
                    School.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yeah, I remember.  You're Johnny K.
                    You were gonna be the toughest guy
                    in the neighborhood.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Not just the neighborhood, MacLeod. 
                    Luca learned that the hard way.
                          (a grin)
                    I got three grand for taking him
                    out.
                          (reveling)
                    You shoulda seen him.  The son-of-a-
                    bitch was on his knees begging.  He
                    was crying like a baby.
                          (beat)
                    I popped him and three of his boys
                    just for the hell of it.
                          (beat)
                    It was easy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because you felt nothing.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You kidding?  I felt great.  I felt
                    like God.
                          (beat)
                    I'm the master of life and death.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What you are is a pathetic little
                    punk, Johnny.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Watch your mouth, MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (goading him)
                    You know how I know what a big man
                    you are?  I asked all your friends.
                          (beat)
                    Excuse me... you don't have any
                    friends.
                          (beat)
                    Tell me, Johnny, you ever make love
                    to a woman you didn't pay for?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I don't need nobody.  Not friends...
                    Not women...  Not you.
                          (beat)
                    All I want's my money.

      He holds out his hand.  MacLeod pats his pocket.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How about that?  Must have left it
                    in my other jacket.

                                      JOHNNY
                    A regular comedian.  You know how
                    many guys I killed, funny man?  Two
                    hundred and forty-nine.
                          (flaring)
                    You don't get it, do you?  Nobody
                    screws with me.  Nobody.

      MacLeod grabs him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No, you don't get it, Johnny.  You

                          (beat)
                    Then we play a new game.

      He shoves Johnny away.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're a dead man.  Dead!

      He storms out.

442442EXT. CHURCH - DAY

      Johnny storms past a WEDDING PARTY having their pictures
      taken on the front steps.  The wedding GUESTS are laughing,
      throwing rice.  Among them --

      A PHOTOGRAPHER

      dark suit, snapping pictures.  As Johnny passes, he swivels
      the camera: he's been taking pix of Johnny.  He lowers his
      camera -- it's Joe Dawson.

443443INT. JOE'S - DAY - LATER

      Dawson is onstage, changing GELS on a spotlight when Betsy
      enters.

                                      DAWSON
                    Well, look who's here.

      He turns the light on her.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    My star.

      Betsy smiles, dazzled by the light.  Dawson swivels the light
      away so she can see.

                    You're early.  Just give me five
                    minutes to clean up.
                          (beat)
                    Then dinner, dancing, who knows what
                    else.

                                      BETSY

                          (beat)
                    I have to go home.

      Right out of left field.  Dawson's face falls.

                                      DAWSON
                    Whaddya mean?  I thought you were
                    here 'til Friday.

                                      BETSY
                      Something's come up.  Business... I
                    have to get back.

      She's not telling everything, it's clear to Dawson.  He turns
      aside so she can't see his disappointment.

                                      DAWSON
                    Oh right.  Sure.  Fine.

      She comes around the side of the light, peers at him.

                                      BETSY
                    If I could stay, I would.

                                      DAWSON
                    I know...
                          (flaring)
                    I said it was fine.

      Betsy takes a step back.

                                      BETSY
                    It was great, seeing you.

                                      DAWSON
                          (looking away)
                    Same here.

                                      BETSY
                          (beat, hurrying it)
                    I'll call you.

      She turns and heads quickly for the door.

                    You know where to find me.

      Eyes locked on nothing.  His hands take a GEL, slide it over
      the spot, and it frames his face in blue light.  Cold, lost,
      distant blue.  HOLD on this.

444444EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

      A DONUT AND COFFEE CART wheels down the street.  Pushing it,
      a guy with dark curly hair, white stained uniform over a big
      belly.  Johnny K, in disguise.

      He pulls the cart close to a building, bends down and pulls
      a brown bag out of the cart.  Pulls a knock-down RIFLE from
      it.  Screws in barrel, stock, slides it between milk cartons,
      hidden from view.  Sights through it.

      POV JOHNNY - THROUGH SIGHT - TELESCOPIC MATTE

      Across the street, a large storefront with a sign: DELIO
      INSURANCE.  On the street before it, a LIMO pulls up.

      Then a man, dark suited, exits the store -- it's the man
      from Johnny's second photo: MICHAEL DELIO.

      RESUME JOHNNY

      taking aim, getting ready.  His finger on the trigger.

      RESUME SCENE

      The Driver of the limo is blocking his target.

                                                                                INTERCUT:

      JOHNNY

      ready.  As soon as the Driver moves, DeLio is dead.

      JOHNNY'S POV - TELESCOPIC MATTE - DELIO

      as the Driver moves, a perfect target.  As Johnny's about to
      shoot -- a BLUE BLUR passes in front of him.  A BUS.

      RESUME JOHNNY

      No longer looking through the sight.  Frozen, an astounded
      look on his face as he stares at --

444CONTINUED:444

      THE BUS

      Across the street.  On its side is a huge PUBLIC SERVICE AD
      with a photo: a larger-then-than life JOHNNY K with the legend
      "Have you seen this boy?"

      RESUME JOHNNY

      turning white.  He looks to the side --

      A BILLBOARD

      with the same ad.  Across the street, ANOTHER BILLBOARD.

      Johnny looking around wildly.  On a lamp post -- a POSTER of
      his face.  Frantic, furious, he RIPS the poster off.  Sees
      ANOTHER, on the side of the building.

      He grabs he cart to push it, and sees on a milk carton --
      his PICTURE!  He's so rattled he knocks his gun loose, fumbles
      to catch it.  A CUSTOMER walks up to him.  Johnny scrambles
      to hide the gun.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (screaming)
                    I'm closed!

      She backs off, like, what's his problem?

      And HOLD on Johnny's seething hate.

445445INT. MACLEOD'S LOFT - DAY

      MacLeod is bent over some mechanical project.  He's
        industrious, humming as he works -- it's a TOY TRAIN, complete

                      Chattanooga Choo-choo...

      The phone RINGS.  MacLeod smiles and picks up.

                                      JOHNNY (V.O.)
                          (over phone)
                    I'm going to kill you, you bastard.

                    Took almost seventy years, Johnny K,

      The line goes DEAD.  MacLeod lowers the phone.

      FADE IN:

446446INT. MACLEOD'S LOFT - NIGHT

      MacLeod is rigging something to the kitchen phone, using the
      tools from Dawson's toolbox.  Dawson comes in.  MacLeod keeps
      working.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Grab a seat.

      Dawson doesn't.  He's unmistakably down.  MacLeod notices,
      but keeps working.  He has to finish.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (re the tools)
                    I'll drop them off tomorrow.

                                      DAWSON
                    Keep 'em.  It's not like I'm in a
                    hurry.
                          (beat)
                    The pictures work?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Like a charm.  Sent him right over
                    the edge.

                                      DAWSON
                            (distracted)
                    Great.

      MacLeod moves to the elevator, opens the gate.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Joe, you shouldn't be here.  This
                    won't be a safe place for a while.

      Dawson doesn't move.  Low:

                                      DAWSON
                    She's gone.  She's leaving me.

      BEAT.  MacLeod sees his face, lowers the gate.  Dawson is
      talking to himself.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    What the hell was I thinking?
                          (it's too painful)
                      I should've known.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Known what?


                                                                (CONTINUED)96504      "Glory Days"      44.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96

      Dawson angrily SMACKS his leg with his cane.

                                      DAWSON
                    What the hell do you think?!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat, quietly)
                    Did you talk to her?  Did you ask
                    her why she was leaving?

                                      DAWSON
                          (edgy)
                    What for?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because.  You owe it to her, Joe.
                          (beat)
                    And you owe it to yourself.

                                      DAWSON
                          (sarcastic)
                    Thank you, Dr. Ruth.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look, we can take this up later.
                          (grim.)
                    I'm expecting some target practice.

      Dawson moves toward the elevator.

                                      DAWSON
                    Maybe I'll get lucky and he'll hit
                    me.

      They're at the elevator.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Talk to her.

      And OFF Dawson's face --

447447EXT. ROOF ACROSS FROM DOJO - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

      From the dojo entrance, pan to the building across the street
      and up to the roof.

448448EXT. ROOF ACROSS FROM DOJO - NIGHT

      The roof is flat, with a chimney, a door to the stairwell. 
      Johnny stands by the ledge, facing the dojo.  He lowers a
      LEATHER BAG, takes out a RIFLE with a NIGHT-SCOPE, and scans
      the dojo.




                                                                (CONTINUED)96504      "Glory Days"      45.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96

      JOHNNY'S POV - TELESCOPIC MATTE - THE DOJO WINDOW

      Nothing.  Then, a quick shot -- MACLEOD'S SHADOW moves part
      way into the room, then turns and moves away.

      ON JOHNNY

      Satisfied with his view and his plan.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Sitting duck.

      He props his rifle on the ledge, peers through the scope.

      POV JOHNNY - TELESCOPIC MATTE - THE DOJO WINDOW

      Blurry and grainy, drawing into sharper focus.  Nothing. 
      Then -- MACLEOD'S SHADOW moves part way past the window --
      then back again.  Out of sight.

      RESUME JOHNNY

      Looking past his gun, pissed that he's lost his target.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (through his teeth)
                    Two seconds, you son-of-a-bitch...
                    Then you're dead.

449449INT. BETSY'S HOTEL ROOM NIGHT

      Betsy is zipping up her garment bag when there's a knock on
      the door.  She calls over her shoulder --

                                      BETSY
                    Tell the driver I'll be down in a
                    second!

                                      DAWSON
                    If you want.

      She turns in surprise.  Dawson at the door.

                                      BETSY
                    Joe...
                          (beat, awkward)
                    I wasn't expecting you.

                                      DAWSON
                    You mind?

                                      BETSY
                    No, but I... I have to finish packing.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96504      "Glory Days"      46.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96

449CONTINUED:449

      Feeling awkward, she goes to her bags.  Lays a red silk blouse
      on top.  The one she wore when they danced.

                                      DAWSON
                    I should have called first.

                                      BETSY
                          (a smile)
                    It's not like we're strangers, Joe.

                                      DAWSON
                    That's what I thought.

      He reaches into his pocket and removes a small box.  He hands
      it to her.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Something to remember me by.

                                      BETSY
                          (taking it)
                    Really, it's not necessary.

      Dawson doesn't look at her.  He turns toward the window,
      pulls the curtain aside to look out as he speaks.

                                      DAWSON
                    I think I know what's necessary.

      Betsy opens the box, takes out a gold pin.

                                      BETSY
                    It's beautiful.

      Betsy peering at him.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    Joe, are you okay?

                                      DAWSON
                    I thought I was.
                          (beat)
                    What I think is necessary for you...
                    I guess most people for that matter. 
                    What would be necessary would be --
                          (turning to her)
                    Legs.  At least one... preferably
                    two.
                          (beat)
                    Right?

      He's in pain, waiting for the answer.  She stares in
        astonishment -- the last thing she expected.

                    Betsy, I need to know.  Is that why
                    you're leaving?

      Betsy's expression changes.  Shaking her head, she understands
      the terrible mistake.

                                      BETSY
                          (beat)
                    No, Joe.  God, no.  That's the last
                    thing...
                          (she takes a deep
                            breath)
                    I should have told you from the start. 
                    I just... I couldn't.

                                      DAWSON
                    Told me what?

      He's waiting.  She takes her handbag from the chair, opens
      the change purse.

      ANGLE - BETSY'S HANDS

      She pulls out a gold WEDDING BAND.

                                      BETSY
                    This.

                    I'm not Betsy Fields anymore.  I'm

      Dawson stares.  The world is coming into focus.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're married?

                                      BETSY
                    All these years, Joe... all that
                    time, I never stopped thinking about
                    you.
                          (beat)
                    When I found out where you were, I
                    had to come.  It took me two months
                    to get up the nerve.
                          (beat)
                    I have a good life now...  Gonna be

                    that?  I needed... I needed you. 
                    Just for a little while.

      Dawson is flushed with emotion.

                                      DAWSON
                    If I'd known you were married...

                    You wouldn't have made love to me.

      Touching her face tenderly, a touch of humor:

                                      DAWSON
                    I don't know about that.

                                      BETSY
                    I'm sorry...

      He touches his finger to her lips.

                                      DAWSON
                    Don't be.

      There's a KNOCKING at the door.

                                      BETSY
                    I have to go.

      Dawson, without moving his eyes off her, calls over his
      shoulder.

                                      DAWSON

      He smiles gently.  She puts a hand on his cheek, smiles back. 
      That's a "yes."

450450EXT. ROOF ACROSS FROM DOJO - NIGHT

      Johnny has had it with trying to get MacLeod in his sight. 
      He reaches into his satchel, pulls out a cell phone, punches
      numbers.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Two seconds, man.  All I need.

      Leans into the rifle as OVER we hear the phone RINGING at
      MacLeod's place.

451451INT. MACLEOD S LOFT - NIGHT

      An ominous angle that includes the phone and the window beyond --
      the line of fire.96504      "Glory Days"      49.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96



452452EXT. ROOF ACROSS FROM DOJO - RESUME

      JOHNNY'S POV - TELESCOPIC MATTE - DOJO WINDOW

      As MACLEOD S SHADOW moves into the window and stops.

                                      MACLEOD (V.O.)
                          (over phone)
                    MacLeod here.

      JOHNNY

      as he FIRES, THREE FAST POPS.

      RESUME - DOJO WINDOW

      As the glass shatters, MacLeod spins over and down, hit every
      time.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Not any more.

      Whistling a Jolson tune, Johnny puts the gun down, opens the
      bag and takes out his sword.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Now for the slice 'n' dice.

      Then -- alarm fills his face: he's feeling the BUZZ.  He
      whirls around --

      ANGLE ON STAIRWELL

      MacLeod appears, unharmed, tapping his CELL PHONE.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I lost you, Johnny.  Think we had a
                    bad connection?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I got nothin' to say to you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Fine.

      Johnny starts backing to the ledge.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You think I'm scared?  I'm not.

      MacLeod shrugs.  Immaterial whether he's scared or not.

      Johnny lunges for the rifle -- but MacLeod kicks it out of
      the way.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not this time, Johnny.

      Johnny yanks a PISTOL from his jacket -- MacLeod chops it
      out of his hand.  The pistol flies off the roof.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    With swords, Johnny.  Remember? 
                    That's how we do it.

                                      JOHNNY
                    No problem.  If it kills, I know how
                    to use it.

      Johnny grabs his sword, and with the other hand, pulls
      something from his hip pocket: a KNIFE.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're a regular Swiss-army knife.

      Johnny swings.  MacLeod parries, and they move across the
      roof, clashing swords.  Johnny's good, but not good enough. 
      He takes a swing, misses then darts behind the chimney.

      MacLeod watches for him --

      Johnny blasts out, throws the knife, charging MacLeod as he
      does.

      MACLEOD

      ducks the knife, lands a blow in Johnny's side.  Johnny
      doubles over, gasping.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    How many people you kill?  Two-hundred
                    and forty-nine, was it?
                          (harder)
                    Not any more.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Make it two-fifty.

      Johnny swings wildly -- MacLeod counters -- Johnny's sword
      clatters to the ground.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Make it two forty-nine.

      MacLeod winds up and swings.  Johnny's headless body falls
      to the ground.  MacLeod stands for the quickening.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

453453INT. MACLEOD'S LOFT - NEXT DAY

      The kitchen is strewn with debris -- shattered glass, wires,
      a wig block.

      The old DRESSMAKER'S DUMMY from Dawson's locker, clothed in
      one of MacLeod's coats, is toppled on the floor, ripped by
      the bullets, with a network of LIONEL TRAIN TRACKS.

                                      DAWSON (O.S.)
                    I knew there was a reason I was saving
                    that thing.

      Dawson at the kitchen counter.  MacLeod is de-rigging the
        contraptions he used to fool Johnny.  He lifts model train
      tracks, detaches an ENGINE from the dummy stand.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                          (musing)
                    Funny.  I thought the risk was all
                    mine... Turns out I was wrong.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (turning)
                    Betsy?

                                      DAWSON
                    She's married.  Has a family.
                          (almost proud)
                    Thirty years later, and the lady's
                    still got it for me.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with a smile)
                    I think it's the beard.

      He straightens the dummy up, looks at the holes.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I can get you a new one.

                                      DAWSON
                    Not a chance.  That storage room's
                    never been so clean.

      He notices the FOOTBALL from the storage room sitting on the
      counter.  Picks it up, idly.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    What'd you need this for?

                          (careful)
                    Nothing really.

      Dawson weighs it in his hand a moment.  Smiles.

                                      DAWSON
                    Go long.

      He cocks his arm back to throw it and, as MacLeod goes racing
      for the other end of the loft, vaulting the couch, the ball
      spiraling overhead, we --

                                                                          FREEZE FRAME.
