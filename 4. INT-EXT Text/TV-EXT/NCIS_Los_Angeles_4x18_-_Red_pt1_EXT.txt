  A slow pull back from the Hollywood sign.   Iconic.  
  Familiar.  But then things start to get a little weird.   

  It begins to snow.  

  And just as we register how impossible this is, we reveal the 
  iconic panorama is actually a roadside billboard, emblazoned 
  with a tourist slogan:  'What Are You Waiting For?'  We crane 
  down from the sign, revealing we're in the middle of a 
  whiteout.  

  Suddenly a car launches off a snow bank into frame, already 
  airborne, just missing the billboard.  It slams onto the 
  road, cartwheels, skids to a stop on its roof. 

  The DRIVER of the car crawls from the tangled wreckage as 
  flames begin to spread from the engine.  His name is EDDIE 
  SHAW.  African-American, 30s, Marine strong.  He's dazed, 
  injured.  He staggers away from the wreckage, looks over his 
  shoulder as CAR HEADLIGHTS penetrate the snow storm.  

  Gripped with fear, Eddie turns, stumbles along the roadside, 
  trying to get away.  He reaches into his jacket, pulls out 
  his CELLPHONE, stumbles again.  The cellphone, jarred from 
  his hand, flies off into the snowbank.  Eddie scrambles to 
  his feet, keeps running.

  The DRIVER of the second car gets out.  A shapeless figure in 
  a heavy jacket.  A gloved hand reaches into the jacket 
  pocket, draws out a small handgun.  

  Eddie stumbles along the shoulder of the road, sees a slither 
  of hope - a roadside emergency phone.  

  He angles across to the phone, lifts the handset. Pushes a 
  button.  The storm intensifies.  

                                OPERATOR S VOICE
                Please state the nature of your 
                  emergency.

                              EDDIE
                      (panicked)
                Help me... I crashed my car... 
                  someone s after me...

                                OPERATOR S VOICE
                I m sorry, sir, you need to slow 
                down, it s a bad line - which 
                  emergency service do you require?

                              EDDIE
                Police, send the police --

  He looks around quickly, sensing someone's presence, can't 
  see anyone through the snow.  

                                OPERATOR S VOICE
                And what is the nature of your 
                  emergency, sir? 
                      (beat)
                Sir?  Are you there?  Sir?

  He drops the phone, takes a few steps, wheels around, trying 
  to locate the threat.

  The Shooter, still walking, raises the handgun...continues to 
  advance through the falling snow...

  ...Eddie, breathing hard, wheels in the other direction& 
  knows his pursuer is close, closing.

  TIGHT ON the hand-gun closing the gap, unstoppable&

  Eddie spins again, nothing behind him.  Suddenly knows he's 
  lost.  He clenches his fists, draws himself to his full 
  height, defiantly shouts into the storm:  

                              EDDIE
                Master Sergeant Edward T. Shaw, 7-3-
                  9-0-2-2-5-1-8, United States Marine 
                Corp.  Semper Fi you son of a 
                bitch.  

  BAM!  Eddie's lifeless body hits the ground.  A single neat 
  bullet wound in the back of his head.

  The Shooter rolls over the body, begins emptying Eddie's 
  pockets. Wallet, house keys, cigarettes, lighter, reading 
  glasses case.  Each item is discarded beside Eddie's body - 
  none of them the object of the search. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               3.

  CONTINUED: (2)11

  The Shooter straightens, hesitates over the body, empty- 
  handed.  In the background, the fuel tank in Eddie's wrecked 
  car explodes in a fireball.  

  A beat, then the Shooter turns away.  

  WIDE on the tableau. Eddie's body. The Billboard.  The 
  burning car.  The Shooter, in no hurry, trudging across 
  frame, back towards the waiting car. 

  And off this tableau, we smash to:

                is a letter of the alphabet.  *

                              CALLEN *
                I could call you by your initial.  *

                                PARIS *
                No thanks. *

                Has a certain ring to it -- *

                Yeah.  Very romantic. *

    A slightly awkward moment. Callen surveys the snowbank, which  *
  is churned up.

                                CALLEN
                Much snow yesterday?

                Heavy in the morning.  Eased off in 
                the afternoon.

                                CALLEN
                  Someone s been here since then.

                              PARIS
                No one from my team.

                                CALLEN

                              PARIS
                Handed the case over to us.  Can t 
                see why they d come back.

                                CALLEN
                Whoever it was spent some time 
                here.

                              PARIS
                Lot of tracks between where Shaw  *
                crashed and where he was shot. They 
                were looking for something.

                                CALLEN
                Maybe the same thing we re looking 
                for... 

  They exchange a look as Sam joins them.

                              SAM
                Santoso was staying in an apartment 
                with at least four others. Evidence 
                suggests they re geared up for a 
                fight.

                              DANNY S VOICE
                Guys...

  They trudge through the snow to join him as he carefully digs 
  into the snow, revealing a cellphone.  He takes out a CAMERA, 
  takes a photo as the others join him.  Paris pulls on a 
  glove, picks up the phone.

                              DANNY
                  Forty-eight hours in the snow. 
                Gonna need a new battery.    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               33.




  The METAL DETECTOR being put in the back of the SUV, the 
  tailgate slamming shut.

  Danny gets in behind the wheel.  Sam slides in beside him. 
  Paris and Callen climb into the back. 

                              PARIS
                We ve done a preliminary check of  
                his phone log. Mostly work-related 
                calls, few family calls... nothing 
                out of the ordinary.  

  Danny starts up, pulls out onto the road.

                              SAM
                Shooter spent valuable getaway time 
                  searching his body. 

                                CALLEN
                And possibly came back for a second 
                look once the crime scene was 
                  cleared...

                              SAM *
                It has to be the phone.

                                PARIS *
                Well, if there s something there, 
                our guys will find it -- *

  CRUNCH! as a SNOW PLOW T-bones the SUV at an intersection.

  With its engine roaring, the Snow Plow accelerates, pushing 
  the SUV down the road in a spray of snow, sparks and 
    protesting metal.  

  Chaos inside for a moment, then a beat as Sam realizes this 
  is no accident. He pulls out his SIG -- BAM! BAM! BAM! fires 
  up through the sunroof, exploding the glass.  He scrambles 
  onto his seat, rising up out of the sunroof, opens fire on 
  the unseen DRIVER.  The windshield shatters, the Driver 
  swerves the wheel violently.  

  The SUV spins across the road.  Sam drops back into the SUV 
  as it slams into a ditch.  

  A moment to recover.  

                              PARIS (cont d)
                Everyone okay?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               34.

                      (dazed)
                Think so... Go, go  - I m okay... *

  Sam scrambles through the sunroof, drops to the ground.  
  Callen and Paris force open their door, follow him out.

  Sam opens fire at the retreating Snow Plow.  Callen and Paris 
  join him, all three of them pouring fire into the Snow Plow.  

  Suddenly the back tire blows out and the Snow Plow swerves 
  violently off the road and into a snowbank.

  Sam reloads as he runs, Callen and Paris close on his heels.


  They slow as they reach the Snow Plow, close cautiously on 
  the cabin.  The door is open, the Driver gone.  In the 
  passenger s footwell is the BODY OF AN ELDERLY MAN, shot 
  neatly through the back of the head. He s wearing a JACKET 
    emblazoned with the Snow Plow logo.  The real Driver.  

  They move past the Snow Plow.  Tracks lead off into a dense 
  forest.

                                CALLEN
                What were you saying about no one 
                trying to kill you here, Sam?

  The sound of a CAR HORN being held down cuts through the air.   

                              PARIS
                Danny!

  She races back down the road towards the SUV. 

                              SAM
                Stay with her!  I got him!

  Callen turns back for the SUV as Sam heads into the woods.


  Paris sprints down the road, Callen behind her. The horn is 
  still blaring. She reaches the SUV, scrambles in beside the 
  unconscious Danny, gently lifts his head off the steering 
  wheel.  The horn stops. 

                              PARIS
                Danny...  It s alright Danny, I got 
                you... I got you...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               35.

  Behind her, Callen on the cellphone, talking fast.

                                CALLEN
                Kai, man down!  We need an  *
                  ambulance to our GPS location now! *

  He shoots a look at Paris, who is cradling Danny s head. *

  And off their concern...

                                  ACT THREE

  FADE IN:


  Kensi and Deeks pull up outside the house.  

                              KENSI
                I count at least three cameras.

                              DEEKS
                Only need one.  Come when I call.
                      (hastily)
                You know what I mean.

  And he s out of the car.    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               43.




  Deeks is unceremoniously thrown out of the house by the 
  Bouncer, landing in a heap at Kensi s feet.  

                              KENSI
                No happy ending?

  Deeks looks up at her.

                  I wouldn t say that...

  And he holds up the USB DRIVE. 


  A Learjet taxis up to a waiting Excursion and Caddy. Hetty, 
  Deeks and Kensi watch as the stairs are deployed.  

  Callen, Sam, Paris, Dave, Claire and Granger exit the jet.  
  Deeks throws open the back of the Excursion, revealing 
  weapons and NCIS vests.  

                              KENSI
                We ve located Spears.  He hired a  *
                car when he flew into LAX.  He 
                upgraded - got himself a car with 
                GPS.  

                                CALLEN
                Where is it?

                              KENSI
                Two blocks from here.

  Callen slams a magazine into his Assault Rifle.

                                CALLEN
                Both vehicles.  We re going in hot.

  Callen and his team and Paris and her team climb aboard the 
  Caddy and the Excursion.  Hetty turns to Granger.  

                              HETTY
                Sitting this one out, Owen?

                              GRANGER
                Not on your life.

  Hetty throws him a set of car keys.  

                              HETTY
                You drive.


  The Excursion and the Caddy pull up outside the condos, both 
  teams spill out.  

  Dave and Claire cover the back, the others enter through the 
  front...     EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               50.




  Both teams scramble for their vehicles.

                                CALLEN
                Eric, alert Burbank authorities to 
                lock down all vehicle access to the 
                airport.  And we need to know which 
                gate TSA personnel use to drive-on.

                              ERIC (V.O.)
                  Stand-by...


  The Excursion and the Caddy slide around a corner into a 
  street that runs alongside side the airport. 

                              ERIC (V.O.)
                Callen, end of the street, Gate 
                Three.


  A TSA VAN slows at the security gate, ROBERT SPEARS at the  *
  wheel. The TSA GUARD gives Spears  ID a cursory look, waves  *
  him through, as the phone rings... 

 








                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               52.

    CONTINUED:3838

  Spears  Van turns onto the perimeter road and the Excursion  *
  and the Caddy close fast on the gate, coming from the 
  opposite direction. They re separated from the TSA van by a 
  mesh security fence.  

  As the vehicles pass, Callen spots Spears at the wheel. *

                                CALLEN
                Sam! The blue van!

                              SAM
                Hang on!  Kensi - stay close!

                              KENSI
                Roger that!

  Sam accelerates, swings the Excursion off the road and 
  punches through the fence, the Caddy right behind.   

  In the TSA van, Spears reacts to the crash, sees the  *
  Excursion and the Caddy closing fast.  He accelerates, 
  crashes through a secondary gate into...


  The TSA van speeds between rows of air freight containers. 

  The Excursion closes, the Caddy drawing alongside, one row 
  across. The back doors of the TSA van suddenly swings open 
  and two of the TERRORISTS open fire with handguns.  Instead 
  of swerving away, Sam swerves towards them, accelerating 
  hard.  He rams the back of the TSA van, throwing the gunmen 
  to the floor.  

  Another hard hit from the Excursion and Spears loses control  *
  crashing through several freight containers before slamming 
  to a stop against a fence.

  The Terrorists scramble from the back of the van and scatter, 
  opening fire on the Excursion and the Caddy.

  Both teams spill from their vehicles and return fire.

  (NOTE:  The following sequence will be written to suit the 
    location.)

  In a running gunfight, four of the Terrorists go down, a 
  fifth is wounded and disarmed by Claire.

  Callen and Paris pursue Spears, but he vanishes into the  *
  terminal and all they find are his TSA coveralls.    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               53.




  A few minutes later, Callen and Paris rejoin the others.  
  Airport Police are beginning to cordon off the area.  Claire 
  and Kensi guard the cuffed surviving terrorist, ARI HAMAL.  
  Sam, Deeks and Dave are clearing the terrorists  weapons.

  Hetty and Granger survey the scene as Callen and Paris join 
  them.

                              GRANGER
                  Scorecard?

                              HETTY
                Spears among them? *

                                CALLEN
                Lost him in the terminal.

                              GRANGER *
                Don t count on it.  He got this 
                far.

  Granger turns away.
