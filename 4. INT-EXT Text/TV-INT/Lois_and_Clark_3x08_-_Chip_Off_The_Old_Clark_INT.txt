    find LOIS looking at it with a smile.  CLARK is at the 
    stove, cooking dinner.  Both are still basking in the 
    afterglow of having just gotten engaged.

                                   LOIS
                       (looking at ring)
                  Funny about this thing... I look 
                  down at it during the day... I'm 
                  always surprised to see it there...
                  And I think about what it means...
                  And about you...

                                   CLARK
                  ... And how long it took you to 
                  finally put it on...

                                   LOIS
                  That, too... We've been through a lot.

                                   CLARK
                  'A lot?' Lois, salmon swimming

                       (settling in to watch him
                        with a smile)
                  Yeah, but now we're just this old, 
                  almost-married couple... And we'll 
                  be like this forever.  You cooking, 
                  me watching.

                                   CLARK
                  You're never cooking?

                                   LOIS
                  It's not really something I do.

                                   CLARK
                  I thought it was just lack of time.

    Staffers, including JIMMY, watching in rapt attention.

                  ....'Course, he's got my nose and

                  times we live in when anyone can 
                  get media coverage with a cook and 
                  bull story like that.  We, by the 
                  way, won't be wasting ink on it.

    Clark, in a mood, has entered during this, gone to desk.

                                   JIMMY
                  What do you think, C.K.?  I mean if 
                  _I_ was Superman and had, you know,

                  ... Or not.  Probably not.

                  Could we get back to the _real_ 
                  news, here?  Clark, the President 
                  of Tanzor is in town for the 
                  signing of a peace treaty with 
                  Fostonia.

                                   CLARK
                  Yeah, they've been enemies for a 
                  century.  There are die-hards in 
                  both countries who don't want the 
                  treaty.

                                   PERRY
                  You and Lois get on it.

                  How _is_ this engagement thing,

                  Well, I think that's naive.  Our
                  job is to _expose_ this hoax!
                  _Prove_ to the world that...

                  Never.... _would_ never... Do what
                  this woman says he did.

                                   CLARK
                  Of course he didn't!  Uh, I
                  didn't... Trust me, this thing's
                  gonna die!

                                   LOIS
                       (evenly)
                  And I'll be the one to kill it.

    DING.  The doors slide open, we...

                  Hoax, hoax, hoax...

    She freezes, Clark bumps into her, they both stare, stunned:

    JESSE crosses the room, the sofa balanced in one hand.

                  Why do you keep saying everything
                  twice?!

    Lois and Clark peer back around the doorframe.  Leigh-Anne
    gestures to the sofa, which Jesse pats and leaves.  The room
    is a shambles from a long period of abuse: Cracked plaster,
    boy-shaped holes in the walls, splintered furniture. Lois,
    a bit awkward with children, approaches Jesse.

                                   LOIS
                       (so friendly)
                  Hi, Jesse.  I'm Lois. I'm here to
                  be your mommy's friend so she'll
                  tell me the _real_, _true_ story of
                  your life.

                                   JESSE
                  I don't like you.

                                   LOIS
                       (frozen smile)
                  I see.

                                   JESSE
                  I like him!

    He goes to Clark, grabbing his leg.  There's a soft metallic
    CLANK as their bodies hit.  Clark stares at Jesse, smiles
    weakly at Lois.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  Wow, he's usually shy with
                  strangers.  Shall we get started?

    She touches Lois' arm, they sit on the sofa, Lois glancing
    uncomfortably back at Clark and Jesse, then turning to
    Leigh-Anne.

    Clark moves across one end of the room, trailed by Jesse,
    surveys the damage, runs a hand around a boy-shaped hole.

                                   CLARK
                  So.  Jesse.  You're a pretty strong
                  boy.  How'd you get so strong?

    Jesse shrugs shoulders.  Clark picks up a little football.

                                   CLARK (CONT'D)
                  Ever play catch?

    Jesse BLURS down to the dining area, holds out hands, Clark
    starts toward him.

                                   CLARK (CONT'D)

                  Gee.  And you're really, really...
                  fast.

    A battered TV is on in the corner, from it:

    We are SHOOTING over TV onto Clark, who looks at screen.

                                   ANCHORPERSON (V.O.)
                  ... We're at the Tanzorian

                  he signs the peace treaty with
                  Fostonia, with whom his country has
                  a long history of hostile
                  relations.

    During this, Jesse has floated up into FRAME, also watching.
    Clark looks over at him.

    The HUM grows LOUDER.  Clark and Jesse reach for their ears.

                  Bad noise!

                  What noise?  I don't hear anything.

                                   CLARK
                  Uh, Lois... I'll be right back.

                  Oh, he spoiled me somethin' awful.
                  Cheese from France, chocolate from 
                  Switzerland... 'Course he can get

                  nice, but I want you to love me 
                  like an ordinary man.'

                  And you know what he would do?
                  He'd... cook for me.

    Lois dizzily reaches for a glass of water, sips.

                  junior high before you did any 
                  serious lifting.  And it was rarely 
                  furniture.  You leaned more toward
                  kitchen appliances.  The freezer, I think.

                                   CLARK
                  Maybe this kid's not from Earth!
                  Are you sure I'm the only one from
                  Krypton?  Help me out here!

                                   JONATHAN
                  Clark, don't make yourself crazy.
                  There's no truth to this.

                                   CLARK
                  So you're saying I should just sit
                  back and do nothing?!

                  Not at all, sweetheart.  We're here 
                  to stand by you and fight this 
                  little hussy with everything we've

                  Science is on your side, Clark.
                  The answer's as simple as D.N.A.

                  Stipanovic, the test will either 
                  show Superman to be the father or 
                  not.

                  Are you okay?  It's tough 
                  sometimes, isn't it, being 
                  different?  Sometimes it's scary.

                  be easy to hurt people because 
                  you're so strong.  But the cool 
                  thing is, we can do good for 
                  people.  And most people _are_ 
                  good, Jesse, even those crazy ones 
                  outside.  So... any questions?

                  Are you my daddy?

    Superman is stunned by the directness of the question.  The 
    awkward moment is broken by DR. KLEIN, who enters.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  Hello, Superman, Jesse.  We 
                  obviously won't be drawing blood 
                  from you.  I take it Jesse's skin 
                  is also impervious to puncture?

                                   SUPERMAN
                  Yeah, I'm afraid so.  Though why
                  that is, I don't know.

                                   DR. KLEIN

                  I _don't_ know.
                       (plucks hair from head)
                  Here.  You can trace D.N.A. from 
                  hair follicles, right?

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  That's right.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  I talked to Jesse, Dr. Klein, he'll
                  be glad to do the same.

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  Excellent.  We'll do our best to
                  rush the tests along, Superman.

                  This is all my fault.  All my

    She lurches away.  Clark watches sympathetically, then
    glances over at the dining area where one of Jesse's little

    at it sadly.

                  Strange... I mean, he's not my
                  son... But I do feel close to him.
                  In a way I can't explain.

                  I amaze myself sometimes.  I'm so
                  used to tracking down the truth...
                  Always so sure things aren't what
                  they appear to be... I forget that
                  sometimes truth is just staring me
                  in the face.

                                   CLARK

                                   LOIS
                  The truth is what you tell me.  And
                  what I tell you.  Because that's
                  the kind of relationship we have to
                  have.

                                   CLARK
                  Lois, the best day of my life was
                  the day you found out I was
                  Superman.  It meant no more

                  Clark, that electrical storm.  A

                  my power through the plane to
                  Jesse.  I've only known it to work
                  when I was touching someone, but

                       (then, more emotional)
                  I couldn't understand why I felt
                  close to him, Lois, and now I know.
                  I'm responsible for the way he
                  is.

    He dashes off as CAMERA MOVES IN on Lois, and we...

    The President is strapped to a chair near the computer

                  One more time, Mr. President.  I 
                  insist you give me your nation's 
                  nuclear launch codes.
                       (slaps him hard)
                  Pretty please?

                                   PRESIDENT
                  You are a crazy person!  Do what 
                  you want to me!  But there _will_ 
                  be peace between Tanzor and 
                  Fostonia!

                  Don't get me wrong, I couldn't care 
                  less about your little peace 
                  treaty.  However, I am being paid 
                  handsomely to level your 
                  opposition.

    The President gives Anonymous an icy stare.

                  Well, sir.  As much as I enjoy 
                  doing this the hard way, perhaps 
                  I'll have better luck doing this

                  Anonymous obviously has Jesse
                  completely in his control.

                  There's gotta be something on this

    She replays the scene.

                                   CLARK
                  Sshhh... Listen.

                                   LOIS
                  I don't hear anything.

                                   CLARK
                  I do.
                       (stops tape)
                  Just before Jesse flew off with the 
                  President, he said something.  It 
                  sounded like 'Red Choo Choo.'

                                   LOIS
                  'Red Choo Choo?' I don't speak 
                  'kid' very well, but wouldn't you 
                  think that means 'train?'

                                   CLARK
                  Red train?  Maybe they're leaving
                  by train?

                                   LOIS
                  Maybe Anonymous has him stashed at
                  a train yard?

                                   CLARK
                  It's a shot.  I'll check out every 
                  train and train yard on the coast.  
                  Don't go away.

    And he dashes off.  Leigh-Anne and Dr. Klein rush out of the
    elevator.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  Miss Lane!  Dr. Klein here has

                                   LOIS
                  He's helping Superman look for

                       (to Klein)
                  Sorry, Doctor.  But the D.N.A, 
                  results will have to wait... Right 
                  now we have to...

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  I don't have the results.  This is 
                  much more serious.  As I was 
                  analyzing Jesse's hair sample, I 
                  noticed that its molecular 
                  structure varied throughout the 
                  strand.  It seems there's been a 
                  gradual, yet steady...
                       (beat)
                  it's easier if I show you.

    Klein takes out a strand of hair, and a pair of scissors 
    from his lab coat.

                                   DR. KLEIN (CONT'D)
                  This end is about a year old.

    He tries to cut the end of the hair.  The scissors break.

                                   DR. KLEIN (CONT'D)
                  And now, the much _newer_ part...

    With scissors, he cuts the top of the hair easily.

                                   LOIS
                  What are you saying?  Jesse's
                  losing his super-powers?

                                   DR. KLEIN
                       (nods)
                  I'm afraid so...

                                   LOIS
                  Superman said the transfer was 
                  imperfect... So the results might 
                  be temporary...

                                   DR. KLEIN
                  And after this recent exertion... 
                  Miss Lane, Jesse is no safer right 
                  now than any ordinary child.

                  Leigh-Anne.  We think we know where
                  Jesse might be.  Jesse said 'red
                  choo-choo' just before he left with
                  the President.  Superman is
                  checking out the train yards as we
                  speak...

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  But that may not be the right place
                  at all!  'Choo choo' is Jesse's
                  word for trains.  But also for big
                  smokestacks.

                                   LOIS

                  They remind him of those old

                  No, Jesse.  That's not fireworks.
                  That's a bad thing.  Auntie Lois
                  will buy you candy if you don't
                  push it.

                  A big boom is better than candy,
                  kid.  Push it.

                                   LOIS
                  Auntie will buy you a bigger sofa

    Anonymous shoves Jesse forward and exits, SLAMS the heavy
    door.



    Anonymous breaks open a glass "EMERGENCY BOX."  He flips a
    switch.  A THICK CLOUD OF PURPLE SMOKE emanates from the lab 
    floor.  It rises VERY SLOWLY.  Lois' face appears in the 
    glass portion of the door.

    And he rushes off down the hall.



    The gas continues to rise.  Lois comforts Jesse in her arms,
    keeping his head above the cloud.  She also struggles to
    keep the groggy President standing.
