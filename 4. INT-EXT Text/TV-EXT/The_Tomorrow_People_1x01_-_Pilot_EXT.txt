      REAPPEARING ON THE STREET BELOW.  Only it s like he ran the 
      distance.  John staggers towards a SUBWAY ENTRANCE.  WHEN 
      LEAD AGENT APPEARS ON THE STREET BEHIND HIM.  Still trailing.


      CUT TO Stephen and Luca approaching the FRONT STEPS as GROUP 
      OF JOCKS spot Luca, waving him over.  This kid is popular.

                                    STEPHEN
                    See you after school...                                                                                      8.


      CONTINUE TRACKING WITH Stephen through the various high 
      school social strata.  He keeps his head down.  A loner.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Jesus, Stephen... 

      REVEAL ASTRID (18).  Classically beautiful, effortlessly 
      cool.  Friends with Stephen since the sandbox.

                                  ASTRID
                    You look awful.  Did you sleep in a 
                    ditch last night?

                                    STEPHEN
                    I wish. Neighbor s apartment, three 
                    floors up.  They almost called the 
                    cops... It s getting worse.

                                  ASTRID
                    Are you taking your meds?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Yes, Astrid, I m taking my meds 
                    like a good boy.  But, hey, maybe I 
                    need something a little stronger.  
                    A little electroshock?  Maybe an 
                    ice-pick lobotomy?

                                  ASTRID
                    Let me see your pills.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Why?

                                  ASTRID
                    I want to check to see if being a 
                    dick is a side-effect.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Cute.

                                  ASTRID
                    I m just worried about you. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    I know.  And I m just tired of 
                    everybody worrying about me.  
                    I wish I could be like them...  

      He motions to their carefree CLASSMATES, laughing, smiling.

                                    STEPHEN (CONT D)
                    You know?  Normal.                                                                                      9.


                                  ASTRID
                    I don t want you to be normal.
                          (taking Stephen s hand)
                    I just want you to get better.

        ESTABLISHING SHOT: UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.

      ANGLE ON A SIGN announcing a  visiting lecture series. 


      Jedikiah emerges to find Damian waiting.

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    Do we have a name yet?
                          (off his head shake)
                    I want a list of every psych case in 
                    the city who fits the profile.  This 
                    isn t just any break-out if John Young 
                    risked getting caught to find him...  



      CUT TO ASTRID, reacting to Stephen s news.

                                  ASTRID
                    I thought we were being serious?
                          (off Stephen)
                    You are serious.

                                    STEPHEN
                    I know it sounds crazy...

                                  ASTRID
                    That you re some kind of mutant or 
                    that you have paranormal powers?  

                                    STEPHEN
                    Just hear me out... It all makes 
                    sense.  They said it s some genetic 
                    mutation I inherited from my dad.

                                  ASTRID
                    They?  You mean, the merry band of 
                    runaways living down in the sewers?

                                    STEPHEN
                    Subway tunnels.  That s why you ve 
                    never heard of them -- because they 
                    -- me -- we re being hunted by a 
                    secret government program.                                                                                    29.


      Astrid has heard enough.  It s time for some tough love.

                                  ASTRID
                    Are you off your meds, Stephen?

                                    STEPHEN
                    It has nothing to do with that...

                                  ASTRID
                    You need to talk to your shrink...  
                    What if you re being treated for 
                    the wrong thing?  First the voices, 
                    now the paranoia.  Wasn t your dad 
                      a paranoid schizophrenic?  

      Stephen indicates a nearby football.  Raising his hand.  
      Doing the full-on  superhero using his powers  pose. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    You don t believe me?  Watch this.  
                    I can make the football fly with my 
                    mind.

      HE TRIES TO MOVE IT TELEKINETICALLY... But nothing happens.

                                  ASTRID
                          (scared for him)
                    You need help, Stephen...

                                    STEPHEN
                    Why do you think I came to you?  I 
                    thought I could tell you anything?

                                  ASTRID
                    You can...

                                    STEPHEN
                    What s the use if you don t believe 
                    me?
                          (then)
                    You think that I m insane. I m your 
                    little charity case, aren t I?
                          (off Astrid)
                    Don t pretend... We both know the 
                    only reason we still hang out is so 
                    you can feel good about yourself, 
                    like you re not the last of my 
                    friends to jump ship from my crazy.

      Astrid has heard enough.  She snaps back at Stephen.                                                                                    30.


                                  ASTRID
                    That is bullshit.  I ve stuck by 
                    you and your whole year of crazy 
                    because I care about you.  And just 
                    so you know, everyone didn t leave, 
                    you pushed them away.  Now you re 
                    trying to do it to me.  It s not my 
                    fault.  You re the one who changed.

      Astrid walks off.  Off Stephen, knowing he has changed.



      Bummed, Stephen rounds a corner, headed back to school, WHEN 
      HANDS GRAB HIM.  It s DYLAN, the bully who rolled him for his 
      meds.  Pinning Stephen up against a wall.  

                                  DYLAN
                    What the hell did you give me?  
                    Those were Ex-Lax, weren t they?   

      Stephen can t help it.  He stifles a GIGGLE.

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    You think this is funny?

                                    STEPHEN
                    No.  I didn t mean...

                                  DYLAN
                    What s your problem? Are you crazy?

                                    STEPHEN
                    That, or superior.  Can t be sure.

      Dylan thinks Stephen is joking, but he s not.

                                  DYLAN
                    Goddamn weirdo --

      WHAM.  HE PUNCHES STEPHEN.  HE GOES DOWN.  DYLAN KICKS HIM.

                                    STEPHEN
                    HELP -- !

      DYLAN JUMPS ON STEPHEN S BACK, GRABBING HIM BY THE NECK.

                                  DYLAN
                    Shut up, you little bitch.  No one 
                    can hear you.

      DYLAN GRINDS STEPHEN S FACE INTO THE GROUND.  Just when he s 
      about to SMOTHER him... AN INVISIBLE FORCE PULLS HIM OFF.                                                                                      31.


      ANGLE ON DYLAN:  FLOATING OFF OF THE GROUND.  LEGS KICKING.

      Stephen stands, and realizes his powers are working.  
      Narrowing his eyes, STEPHEN SENDS DYLAN FLYING INTO A WALL.  

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    Put me down.  Please.  Help -- !

                                    STEPHEN
                          (parroting Dylan)
                     No one can hear you... 

      ON STEPHEN, seeing red, he charges at Dylan who remains 
      SUSPENDED IN MIDAIR.  Stephen starts to PUNCH HIM.  Pent up 
      rage spilling out.  The fight turns ugly.  Primal.  Stephen 
      grabs Dylan by the throat...

      SUDDENLY, A DEAFENING ROAR INSIDE STEPHEN S HEAD.  Stephen 
      grasps his temples, collapses.  THEN BLACKS OUT.



      At their CAR, Stephen s mom fumbles with her keys.  Drops 
      them.  She just stares at them on the ground.  Frozen.

                                  MARLA
                    I m sorry, Stephen.  But I just 
                    can t do this again... What I went 
                    through with your father -- his 
                    delusions and his deception -- I 
                    know how it ends.  And I just can t 
                    bear to see you go through it.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    I m sorry.  I didn t mean ---

      He tries to comfort her.  It s not working.  She tears up.

                                  MARLA
                    I thought that if I just found you 
                    the right doctors and medications I 
                    could spare you.  But we just can t 
                    go on like this, honey.  Can t you 
                    see it s breaking our family apart?

      Her PHONE BEEPS.  She checks it.  Shakes her head.

                                  MARLA (CONT D)
                    I have get back to work. 

                                    STEPHEN
                    It s fine.  I can walk home.  
                          (off her hesitation)
                    Mom, it s five blocks... I m sure I 
                    can manage to stay out of trouble.  

      As Stephen s mother gets in the car.  And drives off... RACK 
      FOCUS ON A CAR PARKED IN THE DISTANCE.  



      CUT TO Stephen walking home as A CAR PULLS UP, STOPS.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Stephen Jameson?

      ANGLE ON JEDIKIAH.  Getting out of the car.  Playing nice.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Who are you?

                                  JEDIKIAH
                    You look just like him, you know... 
                    Your father.

      While Stephen is distracted with this, the henchman Damian 
      sneaks around and PULLS A BAG OVER STEPHEN S HEAD.  

      They toss him into the car.  It quickly pulls out, wiping 
      frame, REVEALING -- 

      CARA is right across the street.  She stares at the 
      retreating car in horror.

                                  CARA
                    They got him.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    36.


                                        ACT FOUR



      Stephen and John APPEAR outside Stephen s APARTMENT.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Thanks.

                                  JOHN
                    Want me to stick around?

                                    STEPHEN
                    For when I come home six hours 
                    late?  Trust me.  You don t want 
                    any part of this...

      Stephen heads for the door.  

                                  JOHN
                    Hey.  Just for the record... I 
                    haven t forgotten about how you 
                    saved my life today, so...                                                                                    51.


                                    STEPHEN
                          ( get over it )
                    You re welcome.

                                  JOHN
                    Look, I know it s messed up.  But 
                    this is who we are.  We re 
                      different, and we re not gonna 
                    apologize for it, you know?  If we 
                    stick together, we have a shot...

                                    STEPHEN
                    I know what you want from me, John.  
                    I just need time to think about it, 
                    all right?

      John nods.  He s not gonna press any further.  For now.



      REAPPEARING on top of the apartment building.  Manhattan 
      sparkles in the distance.  It s peaceful, romantic.

                                    STEPHEN
                    What are you -- ?

                                  CARA
                    You don t want to talk to me 
                      telepathically -- fine -- then we 
                    have to do it like this.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Why didn t you tell me that he -- 
                    Jedikiah -- was my uncle?

      She looks surprised that he knows, but recovers quickly.

                                  CARA
                    He s not your family.  Technically, 
                    you re related, but you re not like 
                    him.  You re one of us --

      But Stephen cuts her off.  Blurting out.  

                                    STEPHEN
                    He wants me to come work for him.

                                  CARA
                          (panicked)
                    What?  You wouldn t do that.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                                  CARA (CONT'D)
                    Can t you see, Stephen?  He only 
                    wants to use you --

                                    STEPHEN
                    Yeah?  Well, so do you.
                          (off Cara)
                    You say you re fighting some 
                     shadow war,  but what are you 
                    fighting for?  I mean, what s the 
                    worst that will happen if we all 
                    turn ourselves in and give up our 
                    powers and live like normal human 
                    beings?  What if Jedikiah s right?  
                    What if it makes the world safer?

                                  CARA
                    You want to admit that we re 
                    mistakes, freaks of nature who need 
                    to be  cured?  
                          (shaking head)
                    Nature doesn t make mistakes.  Yet 
                    Jedikiah will stop at nothing -- 
                    turning evolution on its head -- 
                    driving us extinct -- just to 
                    preserve the human race.

                                    STEPHEN
                    Which -- I m sorry, Cara -- I still 
                    consider myself a part of.

                                  CARA
                    Of course you do.  But to them... 
                    We re not. 
                          (off Stephen)
                    The tomorrow people -- the ones 
                    we ve found and the ones we re 
                    going to find, they re my family.  
                    I won t let anything happen to 
                    them.  And I won t let anything 
                    happen to you.  Come with me, 
                    Stephen.  Please.

      She reaches out her hand.  He looks at it, struggling with 
      his choice.

                                    STEPHEN
                    When you first started talking to 
                    me, the mysterious voice in my 
                    head, I trusted you.  I don t know 
                    why, I just did.  But now I need 
                    you to trust me. 
                          (meeting her gaze)
                    I m gonna find out what happened to 
                    my dad, Cara.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    58.

                                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                    I m gonna make my choice -- I m 
                    gonna pick a side.  And if you 
                    trust me in this, then I ll never 
                    let anything happen to you, either.  
                    Okay?

      A long beat, then Cara finally nods.  Okay.
