      EXTREME CLOSE UP ON LILY, twenties, pretty, a bit of an
      underdog but fights against it.  Her outlook is positive,
      determined, but there's something haunted behind her eyes. 
      She surveys the scene, then breaks into a smile. 

                                    LILY
                    Perfect. 

      And then we SEE what she sees - this outdoor "airport" is an
      overgrown field where a few LOCALS wait for charter flights
      into the jungle.  In front of Lily is a SMALL, RICKETY PLANE. 
      It's third world and foreign - not the locale that would
      excite most girls, but Lily's not most girls. 

                                      FEMALE VOICE  (O.S.)
                    Going to the clinic? 

      Lily turns to find MEENA dragging her bags over.  Twenties,
      sexy, Indian-American, grew up extremely poor but you'd never
      know it.  She's unapologetically arrogant, talks a really
      good game - her only sign of weakness is an asthma inhaler.

                                      MEENA
                    Figured with the whole...'George of
                    the Jungle' look you're rocking there.

      We SEE that Lily's indeed decked out in jungle safari gear
      one buys at a mall.  Lily nods, proud of the ensemble.   

                                    LILY
                    I like to be prepared.

                                      MEENA
                    Clearly, fashion be damned.  You a
                    doctor?

                                    LILY
                    Internal medicine, first year. 

                                      MEENA
                    And you're already leaving residency
                    for field work?   





                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        2.

                                    LILY
                    The world needs more doctors in global
                    health and I...needed a change.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Snow.  Cold.  We're CLOSE ON LILY'S FACE again.  We HEAR --

                                      MINISTER  (O.S.)
                    God giveth and He taketh away, but
                    when He takes a young person, a life
                    so promising...it changes us forever.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're at a funeral.  Mourners in black,
      a lot of YOUNG ONES.  Lily stares straight ahead, emotionally
      drained, just...numb.  Clearly changed forever.  And we...

                                                                          CUT BACK TO:


                                      MEENA
                    I'm Meena.  Mital. 

                                    LILY
                    Lily Brenner.  

      Meena takes a HIT OFF HER INHALER as A GUY with new Tumi
      luggage approaches.  Thirties, good looking, slick.  This is
      MANNY SILVA.  He's caught sight of the plane and isn't happy.

                                      MANNY
                    This is our ride?  Uh-uh.  Not okay.

                                    LILY
                    We're gonna be fine.  Planes are
                    much safer than cars -

                                      MANNY
                    Except that's not a plane, it's an
                    aluminum can with wings!

                                      MEENA
                    Have we met?  You look familiar.

                                      MANNY
                    Manny Silva, M.D.  Did I do your
                    boobs?
                          (Off Meena's look)
                    Nah, I don't mess with perfection. 
                    We probably just knocked it.



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        3.

                                      MEENA
                    The thought of that is even more
                    revolting than the boob job.

                                      MANNY
                    Give it time.  Out in the jungle,
                    it's all hot and sticky -

                                    LILY
                    Hey, guess that's not our plane after
                    all.

      Meena and Manny turn to see the rickety plane moving off to
      the field for take off.  Manny breathes a sigh of relief. 

                                      MANNY
                    Oh thank you, jesus.   

                                      MEENA
                    So which one's ours? 

      There's one plane left on the field - an even smaller, FOUR-
      SEATER death trap.  Makes the first plane look like a 747. 
      As they all realize what they're in for...

                                      MANNY  (PRE-LAP)
                    Oh man, I think I'm gonna --


      Hours later, middle of the night.  Our three doctors ride in
      the back of a pick-up truck driven by A LOCAL KID THAT CAN'T
      BE OLDER THAN 13, wise beyond his years, much of that wisdom
      gleaned from American t.v.  Torrential rain beats down.  

                                      MANNY
                    Hey, what's the driving age here? 

                                    KID
                    Don't worry, I work for the clinic. 

                                      MANNY
                    That's not what I asked.  
                          (beat, then)
                    I think there's vomit in my sock. 





                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        5.

                                      MEENA
                    At least you don't have bug bites
                    between your ass cheeks.  How do
                    they even get up there?

                                    LILY
                    What did you expect?  We're in the
                    rain forest.  Being a little tired
                    and itchy...there are worse things.

      Manny and Meena stare at her for a beat with dull eyes, then - 

                                      MEENA
                    I need a nap. 

                                      MANNY
                    This doesn't look like the website. 
                    Didn't they promise us beaches?  

                                    LILY
                    Did you come for a vacation? 

                                      MANNY
                    Of course not.  I...came to make a
                      difference.  For the children.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      A DOCTOR IN HIS THIRTIES, BEN HANLEY.  Ben is handsome, badass
      and charismatic and right now perturbed - cause he's trying
      figure out how to extract AN ENORMOUS, STILL WRIGGLING STING
      RAY from a BIG AUSSIE SURFER GUY'S LEG.  Assisting him is
      DR. OTIS ABBOT, a brilliant E.R. doc.  He enjoys being
      brilliant, the ladies, and a good dirty joke.  

                                    BEN
                    I need you to stay still --



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        7.

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                    You stay still when there's a FISH
                    INSIDE YOUR BODY!  I NEED DRUGS!

      Lily recognizes Ben, grins.  She nudges Meena and Manny.

                                    LILY
                    That's him.  That's Ben Hanley. 

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                    What kind of crazy ass witch-doctor
                    doesn't have drugs!? 

                                    OTIS
                    The kind that survives on donations. 
                    There's a box on your way out.

                                    BEN
                    We're just gonna have to do this the
                    old fashioned way, okay? 

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                    Fine.  Just get it out!

      Ben takes hold of the stinger.  The Surfer freaks from pain. 

                                      AUSSIE SURFER (CONT'D)
                    NO NO NO LEAVE IT IN LEAVE IT IN!  

      Otis sighs in annoyance, spots The Kid with the new doctors. 

                                    OTIS
                    Charlie, do I look like I have time?   

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'll bring 'em back later, Dr. Abbot.

                                    OTIS
                    Nah, they'll just mildew. 
                          (to the Doctors)
                    Don't just stand there.  Get in here.

      Lily, Manny and Meena drop their bags and move in.

                                    OTIS (CONT'D)
                    Hold his shoulders, brace the leg.

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                    NO!  Get off me, you assho - hey,
                    get the hell away from me -

      The Surfer struggles as Lily and Meena each grab an arm,
      Manny crouches down next to Ben, braces the leg.  



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        8.

                                    BEN
                    Okay.  On one, on two --

      Suddenly, the Aussie Surfer flails an arm, KNOCKING LILY
      violently BACK against the wall.  BEN AND OTIS EXCHANGE A
      LOOK, THEN - Otis taps the Surfer's shoulder, POINTS AT BEN.

                                    OTIS
                    Hey, look at that.

      The set up works perfectly - AUSSIE SURFER TURNS DIRECTLY TO
      BEN AT THE EXACT MOMENT BEN PUNCHES HIM SQUARE IN THE FACE,
      STUNNING HIM SILENT, MAKING HIM FORGET ALL ABOUT HIS LEG.

                                    BEN
                    Sorry, mate.  

      AND THEN BEN USES THE SURFER'S SHOCK TO DEFTLY TWIST AND
      PULL THE STINGER OUT.  Blood sprays everywhere. 

                                      AUSSIE SURFER
                        Aaaauuuuugghhhhh!!!!

      Ben rises, unfazed, holding the stingray, smiles charmingly. 

                                    BEN
                    Welcome, doctors.  You can start by
                    stitching him up.  And you...

      Ben tosses the WRIGGLING STINGRAY to the Surfer --

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Put this back where you found it. 

      Off Lily, taking it all in, ready for the challenge, we...

                                                                  FADE TO TITLE CARD.


      Manny exits, sees Charlie waiting for him in the truck.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    Getting stuck with a house call on
                    your first day.  What'd you do to
                    piss off Abbot?  

                                      MANNY
                    Charlie, right?  Could you just tell
                    me how I get to the village of...um...  

      Manny tries to read something off a PIECE OF PAPER.  Then
      gives up and just shows it to Charlie.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Climb in.  I'll take you.   

                                      MANNY
                    Abbot said his patient has virulent
                    TB, I'm not gonna expose you.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    How are you going to talk to the
                    patient?  I'm a translator.   

                                      MANNY
                    How old are you?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Trece.
                          (off Manny's stare)
                    If you don't know what that means,
                    you need me. 

      Manny relents.  As he climbs into the passenger seat...


      The Local Man, Lily and Zee rush out to find a YOUNG AMERICAN
      WOMAN, twenties, hippie type, getting out of the Man's car. 
      She's knocked up, arm bleeding, a little bruised.

                                    LILY
                    Can you tell me your name?

                                      ANNIE
                    Annie Fisher.  Don't worry about me,
                    our taxi driver got the worst of it. 

      And we SUDDENLY NOTICE that Annie's not the only one hurt -
      there's a TAXI DRIVER in the back of the car, looking CUT UP
      AND BLOODY, moaning a little.  Ben and Otis rush out.

                                    BEN
                    What happened? 

                                    ZEE
                    Car accident.  Two injured -

                                      ANNIE
                    My husband - he's still in the car,
                    we couldn't move him.  His leg looked
                    like it was broken.

                                    ZEE
                     - One still at the scene.

      As Ben rushes to get the Taxi Driver out of the car... 

                                      LOCAL MAN
                    I'll go back for him now, it's at
                    least a six hour drive, the roads
                    are flooded, driving's impossible -- 

                                    OTIS
                    You're taking a rescue team with
                    you.

                    Ribcage is cracked, lung could be
                      punctured.

                                    BEN
                    Let's get him inside.

       Lily suddenly NOTICES ANNIE IS PREGNANT.

                                    LILY
                    How far along are you?

      So Lily rolls up her sleeves too and they start practically
      carrying Annie into the clinic.  Off Lily, determined to
      succeed here...


      Manny and Charlie have been driving for a few hours now, the
      mid-morning sun beating down on them.  Manny wipes his brow.

                                      MANNY
                    So what kind of nightlife do you
                    guys have around here?  Where do you
                    go to...y'know, meet the ladies? 
                          (off Charlie's look)
                    Yeah, you're probably too young for
                    that. We've been driving for hours. 
                    How much further is this village?

                                      CHARLIE
                    We're done driving.  

                                      MANNY
                    Oh.  Great.

      Charlie suddenly stops the truck.  The road has BEEN WASHED
      AWAY - there's only tall grass and thick jungle foliage ahead. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Now we start walking.

      Off a less than thrilled Manny as Charlie hops out...


      Charlie leads Manny through a jungle path, dodging thick
      foliage.  A frustrated Manny struggles to keep up while not
      ruining his expensive boots in the deep puddles of mud.  

                                      MANNY
                    But you only know the stereotype. 
                    Good plastic surgery, it's an art.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    You're an artist.

                                      MANNY
                    Well, yeah. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Like Picasso.  He did many nose jobs.

                                      MANNY
                    Funny.  You're funny.  Look, it's
                    not just boobs and butts.  Plastic
                    surgery is beautiful, transformative. 
                    Makes people feel better. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Why do people have to feel better if
                    they're not sick in the first place? 

      Beat.  Manny doesn't have an answer for this one.

                                      MANNY
                    Could you slow down?  These are Armani
                    hiking boots!  

      Charlie turns around, sees Manny gingerly trying to step
      around a MUD PUDDLE.  Charlie REACHES DOWN, SCOOPS UP A BIG
      HANDFUL OF GUNKY WET MUD, DROPS IT SMACK DAB ON THE SHOES. 


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        17.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Now you can keep up.  


      Charlie and a dusty Manny arrive at a village, made of
      rudimentary SHACKS with corrugated aluminum roofs.

                                      CHARLIE
                    The patient Dr. Abbot was treating
                    lives here. 

      Charlie pulls out a MASK and GLOVES.  They mask up.


      ON THE BODY, WRAPPED IN A SHEET, NOW PLACED IN A SHALLOW
      GRAVE on a dirt-filled hillside.  REVEAL Manny standing over
      it, sweating bullets from the heat and the sheer exertion of
      lugging around a dead body.  Manny turns to Charlie.  

                                      MANNY
                    Maybe you should say something.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    Like what? 

                                      MANNY
                    I don't know.  Something in Spanish. 
                    Like a...tribal prayer or something. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'm not in a tribe. 

                                      MANNY
                    Look, I'm... I'm asking for a little
                    help here.  Okay?  I don't...I'm a
                    doctor, not an undertaker. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'm a translator. 

      Beat. Manny takes a deep breath, takes one expensive Italian
      shoe, shoe-shovels a clump of dirt onto the dead body, mutters -

                                      MANNY
                    Our father who art in heaven...

      It's dark and grim.  As another clump of dirt goes flying...  


      Manny follows Charlie as he leads the way back to the truck
      through thick brush.  They walk in silence for a long beat.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I was just giving you a hard time
                    before.  I get it.  Plastic surgery. 

                                      MANNY
                    Yeah? 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Makes people feel good.  That's
                      something. 

      Off Manny, angry at that father, angry at himself...


      Otis has a smoke outside, taking in the quiet beauty of the
      nighttime jungle, the symphony of sounds... Charlie and Manny
      pull up.  Grimy and exhausted.  Otis smiles.  

                                    OTIS
                    How was your field trip, Plastics? 

                                      MANNY
                    Your patient's dead.  

      Otis takes in this news, clearly stunned.

                                    OTIS
                    I've had her on clavulanate for two
                    weeks.  Her counts were improving -

                                      MANNY
                    And then her husband stopped the
                    meds.  The whole family's got TB
                    now, he doesn't want anyone treated.

      Manny pulls a SCRAP of PAPER out of his pocket - it's like a
      wrapper from the plane or something.  Some writing on it. 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    I didn't know the exact procedure
                    here, in terms of AMA's and stuff,
                    so I just had the guy sign this.

      Manny hands Otis the paper.  He reads it aloud.

                                    OTIS
                    "I am refusing treatment against
                    medical advice."

                                      MANNY
                    So at least you're covered legally.

                                    OTIS
                    This is a joke, right? 

                                      MANNY
                    It's a little makeshift but I think
                    it'll do. 


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        31.

                                    OTIS
                    I mean you.  Being a doctor.  It's
                    gotta be a joke. 

                                      MANNY
                    Hey - you don't even know me -- 

                                    OTIS
                    Really?  I don't?  You drive a BMW,
                    maybe a Lexus.  You screw all your
                    patients, the pretty ones between
                    the sheets, the rest on procedures
                    that don't make 'em look a minute
                    younger, just less human.  Your
                    practice is what, eighty percent
                    covering your own ass and twenty
                    percent medicine?  Ninety, ten? 
                    That's not how it works here.  It's
                    not about how much cash you can score
                    off a quick tit job, it's about
                    helping people survive.  Some of who
                    got dealt a hell of a bad hand --

                                      MANNY
                    This isn't my fault, she was your
                    patient, she died on your watch -

      Otis flinches, but won't let Manny see it affects him.

                                    OTIS
                    I screwed up, that's on me.  But
                    today, all those children you left
                    there, that's on you -

                                      MANNY
                    So I should've forced drugs on them? 
                    What was I supposed to do?

                                    OTIS
                    YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ACT LIKE A DOCTOR. 
                    You're supposed to treat people.  

      Otis puts out his cigarette and gets close into Manny's face.

                                    OTIS (CONT'D)
                    At first light tomorrow, you haul
                    your ass back there.  You save those
                    people's lives.  Every last one of
                    them.  Or don't bother coming back. 

      Off Manny, trying to resist the urge to punch him...

      The sun rises over the jungle.  Another gorgeous day in
      paradise.


      Yawning, Manny stumbles outside, finds Charlie again waiting
      for him.  He stops, suddenly awake.

                                      MANNY
                    You knew we'd be going back.

                                      CHARLIE

                      Translate.  I know.  

      And they take off.


      A sweaty, dusty Manny and Charlie arrive, once more, at the
      family's house.  They glove and mask up once more. 

                                      CHARLIE

                                      MANNY
                    My plan?  My plan is to...express
                    the dangers of refusing treatment.  

                                      CHARLIE
                    So pretty much what you did yesterday. 
                    'Cause that worked. 

                                      MANNY
                    You're a little bully, you know that? 
                    And they call us imperialists...

      Manny pushes through the front door.  As Charlie follows...


      Ben's quickly pushing through the jungle foliage, skillfully
      ducking leaves and branches.  Lily struggles to keep up.

                    Don't worry, I've done this more
                    than any other guy down here.   

      They reach some TALL COCONUT TREES.  Lily's flabbergasted.

                                    LILY
                    You have?  How many times?

                                    BEN
                    Once. 

                                    LILY
                    Oh.  Great. 

                                    BEN
                    Hope you played little league.

                                    LILY
                    What?  Why? 

                                    BEN
                    I throw, you catch.

      And as Lily watches, stunned, BEN TAKES A FLYING LEAP UP AND
      BEGINS TO CLIMB THE COCONUT TREE.  AND WE...

                                  END OF ACT THREE







                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        41.



                                        ACT FOUR


      Ben reaches the top of the tree - he's at least THIRTY FEET
      UP.  Lily's on the ground, breathless, petrified.  

                                    BEN
                    You ready for this?

      No.  But Lily nods anyway, holds her arms out to catch it. 
      Ben starts to drop it, hesitates, suddenly a little nervous. 

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    You can't miss, okay?  You gotta
                    catch it when I drop it. 

                                    LILY
                    I know.  If it breaks, it's unsterile. 

                                    BEN
                    Yeah, that's one of the reasons. 

                                    LILY
                    What's the other? 

                                    BEN
                    If it hits you in the head from this
                    height, you're pretty much dead. 

                                    LILY
                    Oh.   

                                    BEN
                    Okay, one...two...

      And it's so tense, both Lily and Ben sweating it out...

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Three.

      And Ben drops it, it WHOOSHES down...and against all odds,
      Lily CATCHES it.  Ben breathes a huge sigh of relief. 

                                    LILY
                    Oh my god!  I did it! 

                                    BEN
                    Good job.  Let's go for another...

      The SECOND ONE DROPS.  Lily fumbles, BARELY catches this
      one.  Ben winces.  Lily laughs, giddy with adrenaline. 


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        42.

                                    LILY
                    Hey, I rock at this!  I'm all like,
                    Willie Mays basket catch --

      Ben shakes his head, tries to hide a smile.

                                    BEN
                    Brenner. 

                                    LILY
                    Yes?

                                    BEN
                    We have ten more to go.  Keep it
                    together.

      As Lily's quickly nods...


      Charlie and Manny get back into the truck, on their way out. 
      Manny's feeling great, proud of what he accomplished. 

                                      MANNY
                    I just saved the lives of an entire
                    family.  No, y'know what - make that
                      a village, cause that crap's
                      contagious, yo -   

      Manny holds his fist out for a dap, then SEES SOMETHING. 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Hey - stop --

      And we SEE what he sees - the shallow grave they put the
      body in yesterday is now nicely shoveled in.  At the top
      there is a cross made out of wildflowers.  Manny eyes Charlie. 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Thought you were just a "translator".


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        47.

      Charlie doesn't answer.  Doesn't want to discuss it.  Manny
      knows not to tease him further.  It sits there a beat, then -- 

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.  For everything.  You're
                    good.  Maybe someday you'll translate
                    for the WHO or the U.N... 

                                      CHARLIE
                    I don't think so.

                                      MANNY
                    Why not, dream big.  Your parents
                    must be really proud of you.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I left home when I was nine.  And
                    someday I'm not going to be a
                      translator,  I'm going to be a doctor. 

      That shuts Manny up.  Charlie guns the engine.


      A makeshift lab where you spin blood with hand centrifuges. 
      Manny approaches Zee, who's doing just that with some samples.

                                      MANNY
                    Hey, I've got some labs for you. 

                                    ZEE
                    We don't "run labs", we spin the
                    blood down with a hematocrit
                      centrifuge, old school style.  And
                    by we, I mean you. 

                                      MANNY
                    Oh, okay, I didn't mean to -

                                    ZEE
                    Assume because I'm "one of the
                    natives" I'm at your beck and call?

                                      MANNY
                    Uh, no -

                                    ZEE
                    Because I'm a woman then. 

                                      MANNY
                    No! 

                                    ZEE
                    You got a thing against nurses? 

      To Manny's extreme relief, Otis enters. 

                                    OTIS
                    You get blood samples? 

                                      MANNY
                          (quick look to Zee)
                    I was just about to spin them down
                    now.  All by myself.  I was thinking
                    I'd go back tomorrow, check their
                    counts but they're all on antibiotics
                    now, so...that's good.

      Manny waits for some praise, but Otis just turns to leave.  

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Ass hat.

                                    OTIS
                          (stops, amused)
                    What did you call me?

                                      MANNY
                    ASS HAT.  I called you an ass hat. 
                    I've been busting my balls for two
                    days, I walked miles in three hundred
                    degree weather, got a sunburn, I
                    trashed my boots, would it kill you
                    to give me a little respect!?

                                    OTIS
                    I'll respect you when you do something
                    deserving of respect.  Today?  You
                    just did your job. 

      And Otis walks out, leaving Manny standing there.  Beat. 
      Then he looks down at the centrifuge, completely helpless. 

                                      MANNY
                    This thing come with directions or...  

      Zee taps a PAPER WITH SPANISH WRITING on the wall.

                                      MANNY (CONT'D)
                    Those are in Spanish. 
                          (off her look, quickly)
                    Y'know what, I'll figure it out.


      Meena and Manny sit on an adorable little patio on the
      clinic's tropical lawn, drinking beers.  Manny and Meena are
      watching as IN THE DISTANCE, Ben, Otis and MEDICS take Annie
      and her baby into the MEDIVAC HELICOPTER.  Lily plops down.  

                                    LILY
                    There's no way I'm getting on that
                    dinky little plane again.

      Meena smiles, gets it.  Nothing more has to be said, their
      friendship is established.  Manny offers Lily a beer.

                                      MANNY
                    I found beer in the lab.  You gotta
                    spin down your own blood, but you
                    can drink beer while you do it.

                                    LILY
                    It's warm. 

                                      MANNY
                      Everything's warm here.  Except the
                    showers.  And that guy.  



                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        55.

      He nods to Otis, who's stepping back with Ben as THE
      HELICOPTER WHIRS TO LIFE. 

                                    LILY
                    I guess this is it. 

                                      MEENA
                    Last call for civilization. 

                                      MANNY
                    So much for that beach.     

      But nobody moves.  They just watch the helicopter take off. 
      Lily spots BEN walking off, away from the clinic, towards
      the trees.  She makes a decision, stands up, follows him. 

                                    LILY
                    I'll be right back.

                                      MANNY
                    Careful, it's a jungle out there.  
                          (off Meena's eye roll)
                    Get used to it, I'm gonna use that
                    one a lot.

      Just then, the Old Woman and HER DAUGHTER approach.  The Old
      Woman's clutching the inhaler, holding it like a precious
      gem.  The Daughter holds a STRAW BAG, speaks accented English. 

                                      DAUGHTER
                    You're the one who treated my mother?

                                      MEENA
                    I'm sorry.  That she had to...almost
                    die to get my attention.

                                      DAUGHTER
                    My mother is 90 years old.  And 
                    today she took her first breath. 
                    She said because of you she finally
                    knows what it feels like to...breathe.

      The Daughter reaches into the bag and pulling out a LARGE
      CHICKEN.  A LIVE ONE.  WRIGGLING AND CLUCKING.

                                      DAUGHTER (CONT'D)
                    Thank you for saving her life. 

                                      MEENA
                    Ohhhhh no - no, no, no, please --
                    that's so kind, but very unnecessary --

      But the Daughter's pressing the chicken firmly into Meena's
      arms.  The Old Woman smiles at Meena, tears in her eyes.


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        56.

                                    OLD WOMAN
                    Gracias, doctora. 

      And she's so clearly moved and grateful that Meena can't
      possibly say no.  So she pastes a smile on her face. 

                                      MANNY
                          (as the chicken)
                    Meena, will you be my Mommy?

      As Meena glares at a laughing Manny - 


      It's mysterious at night, full of strange, exotic sounds. 
      Lily finds Ben sitting against a tree, looking at the sky.     

                                    LILY
                    She fed her baby.  Before she left.
                      Just...thought you should know. 

      Ben doesn't say anything.  So Lily turns to leave, then -

                                    BEN
                    You ever seen the Southern Cross? 

      Ben points up to the night sky.  Clear and vibrant, full of
      bright stars, the way we never get to see it in Los Angeles.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Right there, those five stars...they
                    say Magellan used it to find true
                    south when he got lost.  And it gave
                    him the strength to keep going. 

                                    LILY
                    I didn't get on the helicopter. 

                                    BEN
                    I see that. 

                                    LILY
                    I was going to.  Because everything
                    you said you don't want, that's me. 
                    You need doctors who are heroes,
                    like you - 

                                    BEN
                          (sharply)
                    Heroes take risks because they have
                    nothing else to live for. 

      Lily takes that in, knowing he's talking about himself,
      wondering what the hell happened to this guy.  


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        57.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    You don't have to be a hero.  Just
                    be a doctor who gives a crap.  

                                    LILY
                    Okay. 

      Lily notices Ben is suddenly moving towards her slowly,
      calmly, almost...seductively.

                                    BEN
                    Don't... move. 

                                    LILY
                    Oh.  Look, I'm in a strange
                      environment...not to mention I'm not
                    exactly ready for...it's not that I
                    don't find you attractive...you've
                    got that whole Indiana Jones jungle
                    vibe going on which is...  I don't
                      think...you should kiss me.

      Ben's now almost lip to lip with Lily, looking into her eyes. 

                                    BEN
                    No?

      Just as Lily closes her eyes in anticipation, Ben SUDDENLY
      REACHES BEHIND HER HEAD AND WITH ONE DEFT JERK PULLS OUT A
      LONG SNAKE, its tail thrashing about wildly.  Ben THROWS IT
      INTO THE TREES.  Color drains from Lily's face.

                                    LILY
                    You said HAIR DOWN!  YOU SAID HAIR
                    DOWN, NO NESTING!!

                                    BEN
                    That's insects.  Snakes like long
                    hair. 
                          (turns to go, then)
                    And if I was gonna kiss you?  Believe
                    me, you'd know it. 

      And Ben walks off.  Off Lily, not sure what to be afraid of -
      the snake or her attraction to her new boss...


      Ben comes outside to find Otis sitting there, smoking.  Ben
      pours both of them whiskeys, sets one down in front of Otis.

                                    BEN
                          (re: smoking)
                    You gotta cut that crap out.  You're
                    a doctor, for godsakes.  

                                    OTIS
                    This is so good for me it might as
                    well be a carrot stick. 

                                    BEN
                    How's that?

                                    OTIS
                    It keeps me from jamming a needle
                    full of something worse in my arm. 
                    Which I haven't in a long time. 

      Ben looks at Otis for a beat.  Makes the decision to trust
      him.  No more questions.  He raises his whiskey glass.

                                    BEN
                    To clean living. 

      It's an apology and Otis accepts, toasts Ben's glass with
      his cigarette. 

                                    OTIS
                    To those we've lost. 

                                    BEN
                    To those we've...

      But Ben can't finish the sentence.  His face is pained,
      haunted.  Otis sees it, immediately regrets his words.

                                    OTIS
                    Sorry.  

      But Ben just tosses his whiskey back and immediately pours
      another.  Doesn't want to talk about it.  A long beat.  And
      then Zee steps out onto the porch, beer in hand, points to
      OUR THREE DOCTORS WALKING ACROSS THE LAWN IN THE DISTANCE,
      HOLDING FLASHLIGHTS, HEADING TOWARDS THE JUNGLE. 

                                    ZEE
                    What the hell are those zonzos doing? 




                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        61.

                                    OTIS
                    Getting themselves killed.  Hundred
                    pesos says the bitchy one's anaconda
                    lunch.  

      Zee follows Otis' gaze to see he's watching Meena.  Maybe a
      little too intently.  Zee's a little hurt, looks away.

                                    BEN
                    Now that bet I might take. 

      As the three laugh...


      Meena, Manny and Lily tromp through jungle brush.

                                      MANNY
                    There are animals out here.  Big
                    ones with teeth.  Don't say they're
                    more scared of us then we are of
                    them - I guarantee I'm a bigger pansy
                    than the two hundred pound Puma.  

                                    LILY
                    Shhh -- do you hear that? 

      Lily suddenly takes off running through the darkness, the
      other two following, confused, until suddenly --


      They come upon a beautiful, untouched beach.  Waves breaking
      against rock, water glinting in the moonlight...

                                      MANNY
                    Jesus, it's a postcard.

                                      MEENA
                    It's better.

                                    LILY
                    It's ours. 

      They stare, in awe of the natural beauty.  Long beat.  Manny
      sees Meena staring at him, with a hint of a smile.  He grins. 

                                      MANNY
                    Told you.  A little time in the
                    jungle, I start to look pretty good --

                                      MEENA
                    Doctor Double-D.  The ads.  On the
                    subway, the bus stops...


                                                          Bans - OFF THE MAP - 1-15-10                                                                                        62.

                                    LILY
                    What?

                                      MEENA
                    He's "Dr. Double D" - biggest
                      sleazeball in New York.  I stared at
                    his face every day from 14th to 59th. 

                                      MANNY
                    You think if you travel 5000 miles...
                    whatever.  There's no clean slate.

      He sounds less ashamed than just tired.  Lily suddenly speaks
      up firmly, confidently, echoing Annie's words from earlier.

                                    LILY
                    Yeah, there is.  Look at this place. 
                    If there was ever a place to start
                      over...this is it.

      They all stare out at the untouched beauty of the ocean,
      where the possibilities do seem endless.  Long beat.

                                      MEENA
                    I do wish I'd taken Spanish though.

                                      MANNY
                    French impresses the ladies.

                                      MEENA
                    Trust me, it does not.

                                    LILY
                    Quelle dommage.

      As they wander towards the ocean, continuing to laugh and
      chat, we WATCH the ocean tide wipe the sand clean... then
      TILT UP to find the Southern Cross sparkling bright in the
      sky.  Guiding the lost and fortifying the weary.  And we --

                                                                                FADE OUT:
