      XCU - A MAN S BLOODSHOT EYE, as it scans something...

      WIDEN to find SAYID, sitting in the sand, alone -- staring at 
    a photograph in his hand, running his fingers over it.

      HIS POV - It s one of the retrieved photos from the fuselage 
      in  Walkabout  -- The mysterious ARAB WOMAN.

      EXTREME WIDE SHOT to see just how alone he is.  The beach is 
      empty as far as the eye can see as Sayid shoves the photo 
      into his nearby backpack, and stands...

      CLOSER AGAIN as he stares down the lonely stretch of beach 
      before him, then stops when something catches his eye:

    A SMALL LOOP OF CABLE, jutting out of the sand, the sun 
      GLINTING off exposed metal wiring where the coating s eroded.

      Sayid moves to it, reaches down to pick it up.  When he does - 
    A STAGGERING LENGTH OF CABLE bursts out of the sand, running 
      in a straight line from the ocean, running toward the jungle.

      ON SAYID -- he reacts, stunned.  What the hell?  He snatches 
      up his bag and begins to track the wire into the jungle.


      ON KATE, feeding wood into the signal fire Sayid created as 
      she stares off down the beach, keeping a kind of vigil...

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    Looking for someone...?

      Kate turns to see Jack coming up behind her.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    -- Or just admiring the view?

      Still harboring anger, Kate turns back toward the beach.

                                  KATE
                    It s been two days, Jack.

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  KATE
                    Two days since Sayid took off on *
                    his own.*
                          (beat)*
                    I keep thinking I m gonna look up *
                    and see him coming back.*

      ON JACK, registering that, and feeling badly about it.

                                  JACK
                    He ll come back when he finds what *
                    he s looking for.  The French *
                      transmission...*

                                  KATE*
                    He wasn t looking for anything -- *
                    He left because of what happened... *
                    because of what he did.*

      Jack shakes his head.  Got it from Sawyer -- now her too? *

                                  JACK
                    It was an accident --*

                                  KATE
                          (sharply)
                    -- Yeah, well, accidents happen 
                    when you torture somebody, Jack.

      Jack can only look at her, feeling ashamed.  Kate looks back 
      at him for a beat, maybe feeling a little sorry --*

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    I m worried about him.  He s out 
                    there.  Alone.

                                  JACK
                            (comforting)
                    Sayid s a trained soldier, Kate.  
                    He can take care of himself.


      WITH SAYID as he tracks the cable deeper into the jungle, 
      until he, suddenly, comes to an abrupt halt -- and slowly 
      lowers himself to a crouch in order to get a good look at 
      something at mid-calf level.

      REVERSE ON HIM as he leans in.  RACK FOCUS to reveal... A 
      TRIP WIRE - fishing line, stretched across his path.  Clearly 
    a booby-trap.

      ON SAYID - HOLY SHIT!  Somebody is or was here.  His head 
      snaps around, scanning the area, then rises.  After a beat, 
      he, carefully, steps over the wire and takes another step.

      CLOSE ON HIS FOOT as -- CLICK!

      SAYID looks down, realizing he s stepped on a pressure 
      trigger.  What happens next happens instantly: he curses  *
      himself under his breath --*

                                  SAYID
                    Ya Allah--

      -- as a noose under his foot ensnares him and he s yanked off  *
      his feet, into the air.  As the rope goes taut, his body 
      pendulums HARD into a tree.  SLAM! --

      QUICK CLOSE UP of his thigh getting impaled on a broken 
      branch jutting from the tree, causing him to cry out.  As he 
      swings away from the tree, he takes the branch with him...

      WIDE ON SAYID, hanging twenty feet off the ground, swinging  *
      upside down, the broken branch protruding from his leg -- His 
      SCREAMS piercing the quiet jungle...

                                                                        BLACK OUT.


                                    END OF TEASER





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"         (PINK)         10/5/04        5.


                                        ACT ONE


      WIDE ON SAYID, hanging upside down, impaled by the branch.  
      Nothing but his labored breaths and the sounds of the jungle.

      CLOSER as he, with great effort and GRUNTING IN PAIN, pulls 
      himself up, and tries to pry the branch from his leg.  
      Failing, after several agonizing seconds, he falls back.

      WIDE AGAIN, as his screams echo through the jungle.

      ON SAYID, as the pain subsides, he closes his eyes and begins 
      to mutter something.  We realize he s praying in ARABIC -- *

                                  SAYID*
                    There is no divinity except God.  
                    What God has willed must be --

      Suddenly there s a noise.  Twigs snapping.  Sayid s head 
      snaps around.  He looks into the dense brush, seeing nothing.  
      Then, another noise... A rhythmic rubbing sound...

                                  SAYID (CONT D)*
                      Hel--Hello?

      CLOSE ON the pulley rig responsible for suspending him.  TILT 
      DOWN to a GLOVED HAND cutting the taut rope with a machete.

      ON SAYID -- the instant he realizes what s happening -- The 
      rope is severed and he plummets downward.  WHAM!  Sayid 
      lands, his head slamming hard into the ground.  Barely  *
      conscious, head bleeding, he looks and sees:

      HIS POV - BLURRY - A FIGURE standing in the shadows at the 
      edge of the dense jungle, looking at him.

      SAYID registers that for a split second before he passes out.

      DISSOLVE TO WHITE... Under which we hear a VOICE -- sounding 
      distant, distorted, almost as if underwater -- asking 
        something... Gradually, the Voice becomes clearer and we 
      realize it s speaking RUSSIAN.  Then, PORTUGUESE...


      OMAR and SAYID exit the building.  An Iraqi GUARD stationed 
      at the door salutes Omar.  He returns the salute.  As they 
      walk, the CAMERA arcs around them, we see (through the magic 
      of GREEN SCREEN) a desert landscape beyond the army camp.

                                  SAYID
                    He doesn t know anything.  Your 
                    sources were wrong.

                                  OMAR
                          (with a shrug)
                    Perhaps.  But that s really not the 
                    point, is it?  You handled yourself 
                    well in there.

                                  SAYID
                    Did I?

                                  OMAR
                    I ll put in for your reassignment 
                    to the Intelligence Division, if 
                    you still wish it.

      Sayid halts, a big smile crosses his face.

                                  SAYID
                    Yes, sir.  Very much so.

                                  OMAR
                          (returning the smile)
                    Good... But stop calling me  sir  
                    when it s just the two of us.

                                  SAYID*
                    You re my superior officer, Omar.  
                    For now.  Enjoy it while you can.

      Past them, we see TWO ARMED GUARDS, walking in their 
      direction, escorting a FEMALE PRISONER.

                                  OMAR
                    That reminds me... a promotion is 
                      commensurate with your move...

      As the FEMALE PRISONER passes, Sayid throws a glance at her.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST       "Solitary"      (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/4/04     12.

      SLIGHT SLO-MO as she glances back at him and we may 
        recognize... It s the woman in the photo Sayid carries.  But  *
      Sayid appears only to register some small recognition.

                                  OMAR (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    That is, if you won t miss being a 
                      Communications Officer.

                                  SAYID*
                    I m willing to make that sacrifice.

      OFF SAYID, grinning...*


      ON HURLEY, standing by the bamboo shaft sticking out of the 
      ground - the top of the pole sports a torn remnant of the 
      ugly Hawaiian shirt tied to it.  Like a flag.  Hurley pulls a 
      GOLD BAG into frame, next to him, and addresses someone.

                                  HURLEY
                    Welcome to the first -- and, 
                    hopefully last -- Island Open.

      REVERSE to see JACK, MICHAEL and CHARLIE, dumbfounded.

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  HURLEY
                    Dig it.  Just two holes for now... 
                    Three par and no waiting.

      Jack looks at the flag, the hole, trying to absorb this.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST       "Solitary"      (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/4/04     28.
      (CONT'D)1818


                                  JACK
                    Hurley, you -- You built a... a 
                    golf course?

                                  HURLEY
                    Hey, rich idiots fly to tropical *
                    islands all the time to whack balls 
                    around.  Gotta be something to it.*

                                    MICHAEL
                          (to Hurley)
                    All the stuff we gotta be dealing 
                    with, man... This is what you ve 
                    been wasting your time on?

      Hurley sees it s time for the hard sell.

                                  HURLEY
                    Dudes... Listen... Our lives suck.   *
                      Everybody s nerves are stretched to 
                    the max.  We re lost on an  *
                    island... running from boars, 
                      monsters... Freakin  polar bears! --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Polar bears?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Didn t hear about the polar bear?

                                  HURLEY
                    -- All I m saying is... If we re 
                    stuck here, just surviving s not 
                    gonna cut it... People need some 
                    kind of relief.  We gotta find some 
                    way to have... y know, fun.
                          (off Jack s unsure look)
                    Yeah, fun.  Or we re just gonna go 
                    crazy waiting for the next bad 
                    thing to happen to us.

    A moment passes as the others take his words in.  Not sure  *
      what to make of all this.  And then --*

                                  CHARLIE
                    It s bloody brilliant!*

      He runs up to Hurley who high-fives him, delighted that 
      somebody gets it.  Charlie grabs a club from the bag...

      ON JACK and MICHAEL sharing an incredulous look.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"         (PINK)         10/5/04        29.




      CLOSE ON MICHAEL and JACK, appearing concerned.

                                    MICHAEL
                    This is a problem, man.

                                  JACK
                          (looking down)
                    Yeah.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I mean, I know what I d do... But 
                    this is your call.

                                  JACK
                          (making his decision)
                    Okay...
                          (looks up at Michael)
                    Gimme the seven-iron.

      CUT WIDE TO REVEAL they re talking about the lie of a GOLD 
      BALL, stuck behind a mound of dirt.  Michael removes the club 
      from the golf bag beside him and hands it to Jack, who looks 
      toward the hole.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                          (calling out)
                    Heads up over there.

      ON HURLEY and CHARLIE standing by the flagged  hole,  a 
      putter in Charlie s hand, as they step back.

      Jack chokes up on a club and lofts the ball into the air.  
      And at that moment...

                                  SULLIVAN (O.S.)
                    Doc? -- Hey, Doc!

      SULLIVAN emerges from the brush, spotting them.

                                  SULLIVAN (CONT D)
                    There you are...  Somebody said you 
                    went this way.  Listen... I think 
                    this rash is spreading... I mean, *
                    it s like the size of a grapefruit--

      He stops, noticing the club in Jack s hand.

                                  SULLIVAN (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST       "Solitary"      (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/4/04     32.

      ON JACK, looking a little chagrined, feeling caught.

                                  JACK
                    Uh...

      He peers at Michael, then back to Sullivan who sees Hurley 
      and Charlie and the  flag. 

                                  SULLIVAN
                          (incredulous)
                    Are you-- Are you playing golf?

      ON JACK, a little embarrassed, he finally admits:

                                  JACK
                    Y-yeah.

                                  SULLIVAN
                          (after a beat, brightly)
                    Can I play?

      ON JACK and MICHAEL - sharing a look and a shrug.


      ON BOONE, crossing away from a couple of other survivors, who 
      trek off towards the jungle.  We see others conferring 
      animatedly, then moving off as well when Boone arrives by

      SHANNON, wearing sunglasses, sunning herself.

                    You re not gonna believe this...

                                    SHANNON
                          (not looking up)
                    You learned to tie your own shoes?

                                  BOONE
                    Funny.  Somebody at the caves built 
                    a golf course in the jungle.

      SHANNON raises her glasses and finally looks up at him.

                                    SHANNON
                    Are you high?

      PULL OUT to reveal KATE crossing by with wood for the signal 
      fire as she overhears:

                                  BOONE
                      Seriously... A golf course.  
                    Doctor s there now, playing with 
                    some other--

      Kate stops and looks at him, disbelievingly.

                                  KATE
                    Jack?  Is golfing?

                                  BOONE
                          (to Kate, amused)
                    S what I hear.  Don t know about 
                    you, but I gotta check this out.

      He turns and starts off, as Shannon gets to her feet.

                                    SHANNON
                    Well, wait for me, bonehead.

      She runs to catch up with him as Kate drops the wood where 
      she stands and starts off toward the jungle path, herself...

                    Not big on crowds.  And, face it,

    A CROWD has gathered to watch, including BOONE, SHANNON, 
      ETHAN, SULLIVAN, and KATE...  We see WALT arrive... CHARLIE, 
      HURLEY, and MICHAEL are standing on the sidelines, waiting.

                    Not me.  It was all Hurley...

      He looks over at HURLEY, about to tee off.  Charlie nearby.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    I m going crazy trying to make

      ON HURLEY as he muffs the shot and the ball dribbles a few 
      feet away.  The PEANUT GALLERY laughs, applauding.

                                  HURLEY
                    Aw... Crap.  Do-over!

      ON ROUSSEAU as she reaches the tree behind which Sayid took 
      cover.  She hesitates for a moment, then, in a flash...

      NEW ANGLE - She steps behind it, rifle poised to fire, and 
      finds Sayid gone.  Before she has time to react...

                    Put the gun down, Danielle.

      Come around her to find -- SAYID has gotten the drop on her, 
      countering from the other side of the tree.  He s got his 
      rifle trained at her head.

      ROUSSEAU lowers her gun and slowly turns to look at him.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Put it down.  On the ground.

      ROUSSEAU eyes him a moment, almost sadly.  Then begins to 
      raise her gun up again.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)

      But she ignores him, RAISING HER GUN --

      ON SAYID, as it becomes clear what he has to do.  He FIRES.  
      But, nothing happens.  Not even the sound of the hammer.

                                  ROUSSEAU (O.S.)
                    That was his gun...

      Sayid looks at Rousseau, her gun still trained on him.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    I don t... I don t want... I... I 
                    don t know how else to stop you...

      The rifle drops to her side, as if exhaustion has suddenly 
      overtaken her.  Tears stream down her cheeks.

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)

      Sayid looks at her for a moment, pityingly.  He takes a step 
      toward her and she swings the rifle up again.  Sayid halts, 
      putting up his hands.  After a beat...

                    I know what it is like to hold on 
                    to someone.  I ve been holding on 
                    for the last seven years to just a 
                      thought... A blind hope... that 
                      somewhere... she is still alive.

      He starts to walk toward her.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    But the more I hold on, the more I 
                    pull away from those around me.  I 
                    may know in my heart that I cannot 
                    ever let her go...
                          (beat)
                    But I can t find her alone.

      Sayid stands right before the rifle barrel.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"        (GREEN)         10/7/04        51.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    That s why I need to go back.  The 
                    only way off this... place -- 
                    Is with their help.

      He reaches her and takes hold of the rifle barrel... There s 
    a beat, before she relinquishes her weapon to him, and slumps 
      to the ground, spent.  He lowers himself next to her.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Come with me.  We have a doctor -*

      She shakes her head.  No.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Danielle, you have to stop *
                    punishing yourself.  You don t have *
                    to be alone.

      Rousseau looks at him a moment, sadly resigned.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Yes.  I do.

      She slowly gets to her feet and takes her rifle back.

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)
                    Your people, the ones you re *
                      determined to return to...*
                          (pointedly)
                    Watch them closely.

      And with that, she turns and starts to walk away.

      ON SAYID, watching her go.  Then, a question burns in him and 
      he calls after her.

                                  SAYID
                    Who is Alex?

      TRACKING WITH ROUSSEAU, her back to him as she moves on...

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Alex was my child.

      As she passes frame, we re left with SAYID staring after her, 
      registering this new piece of the puzzle.

      CUT WIDE to see him standing in the jungle, alone again.

                                ACT FIVE/EPILOGUE


      EXTREME LOW ANGLE, behind the hole, as a golf ball rolls 
      toward it, bumping along the uneven ground.  We hear shouts 
      from the unseen crowd:  Looks good.    Get in there!   The 
      ball takes a sharp turn and runs past the hole.

      RACK FOCUS to see CHARLIE, putter in his hand, some ten feet 
      away.  As the crowd gives a collective  Awww. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Bollocks.  You see that?

      ON CROWD, now thirty or so strong, and including SUN, SCOTT, 
      STEVE, etc.  JACK, MICHAEL, HURLEY and KATE standing with 
      them.  All having a great time.

                                  HURLEY
                          (to Charlie)
                    Dude.  You were robbed.

                                    MICHAEL
                     Kay, Jack.  S up to you now.  Sink 
                    this and you get to wear the 
                    blazer.

                                  KATE
                          (to Jack)
                    No pressure.

      Charlie joins them as Jack moves off to his ball.

                                  HURLEY
                          (to no one in particular)
                    Five bucks says he makes it.

                                  BOONE
                    Make it ten and you re on.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (to Hurley, hurt)
                    You re betting against me?

                                  HURLEY
                    No offense, dude.  But you re a 
                    duffer like me.

                                  SULLIVAN
                    Hey, I don t have any cash.  But 
                    I ll put up my dinner tonight on

      The CROWD becomes a buzz of people shouting out wagers.  Kate 
      laughs, finding it all hysterical.

      Then, from the back:

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    I got two tubes of sunscreen and a 
                    flashlight says he chokes.

      ON KATE as she and the others turn to see

      SAWYER standing behind them, looking back with uncertain 
      defiance.  There s a long awkward moment as all the fun 
      dissipates with his arrival.

      ON JACK, eyeing Sawyer, as well.

      ON KATE, recognizing the heated tension in the air, but 
      feeling for Sawyer, proud of him for making the effort.

                                  KATE
                          (to Sawyer)
                    I ll take that action.

      Some in the crowd look at her, as does JACK.  After a 
      moment...

                                  BOONE
                    Yeah, me, too.

                                  SHANNON
                    You already bet on Jack, dumbass.

                                  BOONE
                    We can use the sunscreen, princess.

      After a moment, the tension broken, people again turn back to 
      cheer Jack on.   Let s go, Jack!    C mon, Doc! 

      KATE looks at Sawyer.  Sawyer glances at her for a moment, 
      then turns back to watch the action.

      JACK sees this, then looks down at his ball and lines up his 
      putt.  As his putter strikes the ball...


      THWAK!  A THROWN KNIFE imbeds itself in a tree trunk.  The 
      tree sports dozens of scars, as this isn t the first time a 
      knife has cut into it.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST       "Solitary"      (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/4/04     54.

      WIDEN a bit as LOCKE crosses in and pries the knife out.  He 
      turns and walks back several paces, readying himself to throw 
      it again, when he stops himself, sensing something, and says 
      without turning...

                                  LOCKE
                    Does your father know you re here?

      ARC AROUND LOCKE to find

      WALT, standing by the edge of the jungle, behind him.  Though 
      Locke s back is to him, he answers with a shake of his head.

                                  WALT
                    Can you teach me how to do that?

      Locke lowers his arm, and turns to face Walt for the first 
      time.  After eyeing him a few moments, he flips the knife 
      over in his hand and offers the hilt out for Walt to take.

      ON WALT, his eyes widen, as he steps in toward Locke and 
      reaches out...

      CLOSE ON HIS HAND as it takes hold of the hilt and Locke lets 
      go...


      ON SAYID, exhausted, stumbling his way through the jungle.  
      He s grunting a bit, but moving with purpose, now using a 
      found tree limb as a crutch/walking stick...

      Suddenly, he reacts to something and stops, with a sharp 
      intake of breath, holding it.  He listens.  All we HEAR is:

      WIND rustling through the dense thicket of trees.

      ON SAYID - His head darts around...

      HIS POV - Nothing but jungle, trees being blown by the 
      breeze.  And then we hear it...  Amidst the sound of the 
      wind, there s something else... Though faint, it sounds like:

      THE WHISPERING OF VOICES, seemingly all around him.

      And as we PUSH IN on Sayid, wondering whether the wind is 
      playing tricks on him or...  There is something out there.

                                                                        BLACK OUT.
