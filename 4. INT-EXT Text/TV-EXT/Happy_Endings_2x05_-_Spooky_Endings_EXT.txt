Brad and Jane carry five full bags of candy from the car. 

BRAD
It was a little weird buying candy 
 trunk, but at least out of a man s
it was expensive.    

As they walk up the walkway, they stop and realize--

JANE 
Oh no, they trashed Breezy Acres. 

There is shaving cream, cracked eggs, toilet paper and 
smashed pumpkins strewn across the lawn and walkway.  KIDS *
in scary costumes RUN BY making scary sounds! *

BRAD

mess if we d just gone to the party 
instead of test-driving the suburbs. 

JANE
No Brad, we re in this mess because 
you gave away all the candy so you 
could get in that stupid hot tub! *

BRAD
You do not disparage that hot tub-- 
wait, this is what they want.  They 
want us to turn on each other. 

JANE
 m sorry.  We re right.  I You re*
fine now anyway.  We have candy, *

BRAD

The door is actually GONE!  They drop the candy.

JANE

Brad is pumped, on the prowl.  He knocks candy out of BIG

are horrible.

disagree.  The suburbs are way more 
 never exciting than I thought.  I ve
felt more alive.  

SFX: We hear the squeal of tires as a car peels out.
