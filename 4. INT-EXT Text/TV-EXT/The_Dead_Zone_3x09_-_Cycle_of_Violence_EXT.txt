          SUZANNE, 13, rips a photo of a boy and her in half, throws
          the half with him into a flaming barrel, followed by 
          more photos of him, a CD, gift-jewelry; watches them burn.



          Charles and two other jocks, wielding firearms, fire round
          after round of ammunition into trees and old toys, taking
          slightly too much pleasure in blowing things away.

  2020ACROSS FROM ROWIN

          now sits another group: LENORA, a soulful Goth girl bends
          a paper clip into a little Blair Witch-y shape; she's
          accompanied by her mother, a pert, professional secretary,
          MRS. TOWERS.  It's a few minutes later.

                                        MRS. TOWERS
                        Well, she's always been a gloomy
                        girl, especially since her father
                        moved out.  But never dangerous --

                        Just another thing to put up with. 
                        I mean, do this until I'm eighteen,
                        work for forty years, marry,
                        squeeze out some babies, divorce,

                                        MRS. TOWERS
                        Lenora!  She's kidding.

                        I'm not kidding.  I hope they

          Johnny and Petey lock eyes; he's busted, but Johnny didn't
          give him up.

                        Thanks for coming in.


          JOHNNY

          reaches out to pat Petey on the back; reveal it's a little
          later and he's actually reaching out to --


  25A25AASH

          another square-looking kid, surrounded by parents,
          triggering --



            A boring, middle-class sedan BURNING RUBBER and skidding
          around backwards, doing "donuts" at a high rate of speed
          and spewing out smoke; when it stops, we see Ash sitting
          behind the wheel.



          IN THE DRIVEWAY

          Two DEPUTIES lay out a barrier of sawhorses and police
          tape, barring vehicles from passing.


          AT A DOORWAY

          a SECURITY GUARD chains the door shut.


            A BOMB-SNIFFING DOG

          escorted by a DEPUTY sniffs his way through the bushes.


          A LONG LINE OF SCARED STUDENTS

          waits to get through the single available entrance. 


          A FRAIL, UNTHREATENING GIRL

          Takes off her shoes; puts them through a metal detector,
          passing through the metal detector.


          AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE

          Security guards wave metal detectors around the head of a
          GIRL with big hair; they confiscate her bobby pins and
          ruin her hairdo.          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - ACT ONE - 3/19/04 PINK-2   19.



          Johnny looks across the field where --


          DEREK

          runs.  Three JOCKS run after him.  Charles grabs his
            backpack, and plays Keep-Away with the two other jocks
          for a moment; when Derek tries to intercept, Charles trips
          Derek. 


          DEREK

          Finds his footing; then takes a swing at Charles.  Charles
          ducks the swing, then knocks Derek to the ground.


          ANOTHER BOY

          Piles on top of Derek, while --

          CHARLES

          dumps out Derek's backpack.  It's typical teen stuff; and
          one noted-up copy of Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience."


          JOHNNY

          Catches up with them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Knock it off!  Get off of him! 
                        Now!

          Charles and the three jocks back off; Derek gets up, and
          cleans himself off.  Johnny helps him pick up his stuff.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you okay?

                                        DEREK
                        Yeah.  But that security guy was
                        being a Nazi.  He singled me out. 
                        For no reason.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wouldn't have found anything
                        in your backpack --

                        -- that's not the point.  The
                        point is, he has no right.  I
                        didn't do anything.

          Derek stops Johnny from picking up his stuff.

                                        DEREK
                        I got it.  I got it.  You've done
                        enough already.


            MCCLATCHY

          crosses to Johnny and Derek.

          turns around to shoot a glare at Charles; then he makes

          A long line of students waits to get into the school. 
          It's cold outside; they're uncomfortable; in front of the
          main door to school, the only one that's open, is a metal
            detector, and several security guards.


          JOHNNY AND REBECCA

          Walk alongside the long line of students, up to the metal
            detector.  As they get there, MCCLATCHY dumps out the
          contents of a pretty girl's pink backpack.  He thrusts a
          cylindrical metal detecting wand into the backpack; then
          pulls it out and runs it along the girl's front and back,
          before letting her go inside.

                        No talking.  I.D.?

          Colin shows a school I.D.  MCCLATCHY checks Colin's name
          against a long computer print-out.

                                        MCCLATCHY

          fight has broken out.  Johnny, Rebecca and Principal Rowin
          rush to the scene of the fight --


          THE FIGHT

          pits Colin vs. Mcclatchy; they're surrounded by a chorus
          of students.  McClatchy is bigger and tougher than Colin,
          and has the upper hand, jamming his knee in Colin's throat.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Break it up!

          They ignore him; McClatchy continues to pound on the boy
          when a BOTTLE flies out of the crowd, SMASHING into
          McClatchy's head, sending SHARDS to the ground.

          Colin takes advantage of the distraction to stand up, and
          run; before he can run very far, two other security guards
          have caught him.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Who threw that?  Who threw that
                        bottle? 


          ON THE FACES OF STUDENTS

          None of them talking.


          JOHNNY AND REBECCA

          Johnny makes eye contact with Derek.          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - ACT TWO - 3/17/04 GREEN   38.


  4949NEAR THE METAL DETECTOR

          Colin, suffering a black eye and the remnants of a bloody
          nose, is held firmly between two beefy Security Guards; a
          crowd of students stands back, watching curiously. 

            McClatchy sits on the steps, rubbing the back of his head. 
          He's hurt, but not that badly.  As Johnny and Rebecca
          watch, Principal Rowin kneels next to the guard --

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Thank god it's not serious.  Why
                        did you resort to force?

                                        MCCLATCHY
                                (wanna-be cop)
                        He failed to comply with my verbal
                          instruction and resisted letting
                        me search his bag.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        You did the right thing.


          STUDENTS

          Who are watching and eavesdropping, let out "boo"s.  Among
          them are Derek and Lenora.


          ROWIN

          turns and faces the crowd; Johnny and Rebecca stand behind
          him.  They stop booing when Rowin glares at them --

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                                (to students)
                          Whatever you may think of my
                          policies, this man put himself on
                        the line to protect all of you! 

                                        LENORA
                        He didn't protect Colin very well! 

            Laughter.  Rowin picks up the bottle cap --

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        I will not tolerate this behavior
                        toward any school employee.  Now,
                        who threw this bottle?

          No answer.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Who threw this bottle? 

          Still no answer.  Rowin paces back and forth, then abruptly
          tosses the bottle cap to Johnny, who instinctively catches
          it, triggering --


  5050VISION - REWIND

          The glass shards on the ground reassemble in mid-air into
            a bottle, which un-bounces off of McClatchy's head and
          flies backwards into the crowd, to a person unknown; the
          wall of kids blocks Johnny's view.  The entire vision
          rewinds until it FREEZES as --


          FIXED ARRAY VISION - MCCLATCHY FRISKING COLIN

          Vision Johnny walks close to them; then the vision
            unfreezes as McClatchy frisks Colin.  McClatchy leans
          close to Colin's ear, and whispers something only Johnny
          can overhear --

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        You must of done something.  You
                        people can't help yourselves.

                                        COLIN
                        Go to hell.

          Unseen by anyone but Johnny, the security guard jabs an
          elbow, hard, into Colin.  Colin reacts by raising his arm
            defensively; McClatchy hits back, hard, jumping on the
          boy.  The action freezes --


          JOHNNY

            continues into the frozen crowd, passing several students
          until he comes to --


          DEREK

          who finishes the last sips of a bottled beverage.

    50CONTINUED:50

          The action un-freezes, and Johnny sees the fight from
          exactly Derek's perspective:

          Colin doubles over and falls to the ground; MCCLATCHY
          leaps on him and pins him down, jamming his knee in the
          boy's throat.  Colin can't breathe.


          DEREK

          sees what is about to happen, and hurls the bottle.  The
          vision ends.



          Johnny still holds the bottle cap; Principal Rowin looks
          at him expectantly.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        What did you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The guard overreacted.  Colin was
                          defending himself.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                                (siding with guard)
                        He's here to protect these kids.
                        The kid resisted.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw what happened.  The guard
                        was out of line.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                                  (indulgent)
                        We're going to have to agree to
                          disagree on that point, Mr. Smith. 
                        What I really want to know is,
                        who threw the bottle?

                                        JOHNNY
                        If it hadn't been for that bottle
                        Colin might have been injured far
                        worse -- that guard should be
                        fired.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        That's for me to decide.  Who
                        threw the bottle?  Mr. Smith?


          DEREK

          Standing in the crowd, hears this.  Becomes worried.


          JOHNNY AND PRINCIPAL ROWIN

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't help you with this.

          Johnny and Rebecca walk away.


          IN THE CROWD

          They pass Derek; Johnny catches the boy's glance; they
          both know that Johnny just did Derek a solid.


            MCCLATCHY AND ROWIN

          See that Johnny and Derek exchanged the look.

          Johnny and Rebecca get out of Johnny's car in a seedy
          part of town; and walk toward a skate park.

                        Why are we here?

                        I want to talk to Derek.

                                (ahead of him)
                        He threw the bottle?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He pulled the locker stunt, too.
                        He reminds me a lot of myself at
                        that age.

                                        REBECCA
                        How do you know Derek's here?
                        Because of your gift?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because I've lived in Cleaves
                        Mills all my life.

          They look ahead into --

          THE PARK

          Where a dozen or two kids hang out, smoking, skateboarding,
          reading comic books.  Johnny and Rebecca walk past
          suspicious teens, all of whom stop whatever they're doing
          or saying as they pass.  Johnny approaches a kid --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm trying to find Derek Fitz.

          The kid tosses a glance toward a structure in the park;
          Johnny and Rebecca walk toward it where they see --


          DEREK

          Sitting on a bench by himself, reading a new copy of "Civil
            Disobedience."  He looks up.

          The skaters scatter away from Johnny and Rebecca, who
          walk toward the street while Walt walks toward them. 
          When Johnny turns around, Derek is gone.  He looks and
          sees him running.

          Derek, bookbag in hand, arrives at the back of the line
          at the checkpoint where McClatchy and Security Guard Two
          keep watch.  Derek keeps his head down, hoping McClatchy
          doesn't see him as Guard Two searches his bag.

          Guard Two waves him on, and Derek starts to go through

          Derek keeps walking, hoping McClatchy isn't talking to
          him, but before he gets through the metal detector.

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        You there.  Stop where you are.

          Derek stops, his face to camera, his back still to
          McClatchy.  We can see the exasperation on Derek's face.

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        Turn around... NOW!

          Hearing McClatchey's tone the other guard goes on high
          alert.

                        That's him.  That's the kid that
                        blindsided me.

                                        DEREK
                        Look, Starsky and Hutch, I'm just
                        here to talk to Principal Rowin...

          Guard Two moves to grab Derek.  Derek backs away, holding
          out his hands to show he means no harm.

                                        DEREK
                        Get your hands off me...

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        Watch him... he might be the
                        shooter...

          The other kids around scatter like frightened deer,
          spooking the guard even more.  Derek is focused on Guard
          Two and doesn't see McClatchy unbutton his holster.

                                        DEREK
                        I'm just here to talk to Johnny
                        Smith and Principal Rowin... look
                        if you don't believe me, call him
                        and ask...

          Derek reaches into his jacket for his phone...

                                        GUARD TWO
                        GUN!

          BAM!!  McClatchy fires.  Derek looks down at his stomach,
            a stunned look on his face as crimson spreads from where
          he clutches the entry wound.  As the phone slips from his
          hand...

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        It's a phone...

          Derek drops to his knees...

                                        DEREK
                        Just call him...

          THE VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL: VISION JOHNNY

          watching in horror as Derek falls over dead and the VISION
          ENDS.


  7777RESUME PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

          As Johnny comes out of the vision, stunned.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                          Something wrong Mr. Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Derek... they're going to shoot
                        him... the guards are going to
                        shoot him...

                                        REBECCA
                        Oh my god...

                        What?

          Johnny turns to run out the door, Rebecca and Rowin
          following.  Rowin fumbles with the walkie...
