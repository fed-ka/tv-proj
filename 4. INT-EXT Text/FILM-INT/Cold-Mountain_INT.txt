A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes
burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.
Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It
reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay
team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked
to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.
The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last
barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so,
as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him.
The fuze wire is lit. It fizzes towards the barrels.
Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them,
the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights,
groans.
OAKLEY
I'd like to hear some music while I
go.
Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman.
STOBROD
What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's
one I play.
OAKLEY
Play me something sweet. Like a girl's
waiting for me.
Stobrod looks at Inman, confused.
OAKLEY
Play me something like there's nothing
to fear from a merciful Lord.
INMAN
(to Stobrod)
You heard him.
STOBROD
(nervous)
I only know a couple of tunes.
OAKLEY
Like when you're thirsty up at
Bishop's Creek and the water is so
cool.
Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play.
Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising,
increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone
else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in.
OAKLEY
I'm reaching Cold Mountain before
you.
Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly
puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod.
The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away.
A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone,
rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A
FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps
the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next
to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches
Inman, who makes a stand.
OFFICER
Don't get up, soldier. You are
mentioned tonight in my report. You
are a credit to the Highlands, to
North Carolina and to the Cause.
INMAN
(tight)
Do you have news, sir, on my
application for transfer?
OFFICER
I know. A bloody day. It's what our
General said: Good thing war is so
terrible else a man might end up
liking it too much.
INMAN
Sir. It was my understanding the
medical corps was desperate for
volunteers.
OFFICER
Right now, soldier, it's me who is
in need of volunteers. There's a
dozen Yankees in that stand of trees
between us. Stuck there from the
retreat. Come daylight they can shoot
us down for sport.
Monroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who
congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE,
might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a
black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know
them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm.
MONROE
Esco, our friends there --
(indicating Teague
and co.)
-- they helped build the Chapel?
ESCO
That's Teague and his boys. I'd
recommend you kick them out except a
man don't kick a snake. One time the
Teague family owned the whole of
Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm,
all belonged to his grand-daddy.
Teague wanted this place bad. You
got it. He's here sniffing out an
advantage.
MONROE
There's no advantage here, but to
celebrate a job well done. Cheers --
(he raises his glass)
-- and thank you.
And Teague raises his glass across the room.
From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town.
At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package
of music. Inside the first book of music, there's a
DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats, a typical Confederate
pose. Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture,
the notes like a melody over Inman's face. Ada picks them
out on the piano.
The ebullient sound of Shape Singing. A noisy choir letting
rip --
-- THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SINGING, MEN TO ONE SIDE: WOMEN TO
THE OTHER. Monroe conducts, sings. Inman is there, as is
Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.
The door bursts open. Young OAKLEY, apologetic nod to Monroe,
sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing
continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to
Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. Rourke gets up,
leaves. Butcher gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.
Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the
older men are singing and one side of the church is
practically empty.
Inman, remains, fixed on Ada. Who does not look round.
Inman walks inside. Stands with his back to the door. It
opens and closes. Inman turns. It's Monroe.
MONROE
Did you want a quiet word?
Now the door opens again and it's Ada. She's dismayed to see
her father.
INMAN
Just some quiet.
MONROE
Of course Ada.
He indicates they should both leave. Inman sits at a bench.
INMAN SITS ON HIS BED, wearing pants and a vest. His room is
like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed.
He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside
the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door.
He opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her.
Ada waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then
Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots
are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody
walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate
as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward.
ADA
I found you this book. William
Bartram. They tell me it's good. I
think he writes about these parts,
the author, so...
Inman takes it.
She has something else. Wrapped in paper.
ADA
And this...
(hands it to him)
I'm not smiling in it. I don't know
how to do that, hold a smile, so now
I'm solemn...
INMAN
Ada...
ADA
What?
HE KISSES HER, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist.
Below them the sound of a MARCHING BAND. It's the RECRUITMENT
PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs.
Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front
door.
ROURKE
Let's go!
A CROWDED WAGON. It's a cauldron, and those able smash through
the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their
heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE,
neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace.
The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of
the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out
of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of
STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by
an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose
grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic,
grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle
away. His voice is a croak, spoiled.
INMAN
I'm not dying.
STOBROD
(to Pangle)
What'd he say?
PANGLE
Says he ain't about to die.
STOBROD
(to Inman)
Truth to tell they say you are,
Soldier. We'll meet again, in the
better world.
He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping
rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses
back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering
sound...
INMAN lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in THE BALLROOM OF A
COLONIAL MANSION, co-opted as one ward of a Confederate
hospital. Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged
between some vestiges of the room's former glory.
SOME LOCAL WOMEN, conscious of their duty to the cause, are
brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his
grace. The windows are open, but it's still insufferably
hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.
DOCTOR
Most of these men will be dead by
the morning or, if they're stubborn,
by nightfall. I have other men outside
in the quadrangle waiting for the
beds.
The women try to process this, the attitude.
DOCTOR
So, any kind word will be a blessing.
One woman is overpowered by the stench, gags.
DOCTOR
It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot.
The women begin to approach the beds.
DOCTOR
Don't pray. If they're not God fearing
you can stir up a hornet's nest.
MRS. MORGAN, nervous, decent, sits next to INMAN. His mouth
is moving. She doesn't know what he's saying.
MRS. MORGAN
I'm sorry, you want water?
She bends to him again. His voice is a faint croak.
INMAN
Pigeon River. Little East Fork.
The Doctor is on his exit, stops at the bed.
MRS. MORGAN
I'm sorry. I don't know what he's
saying.
DOCTOR
They ramble. Names of loved ones.
MRS. MORGAN
(listening to Inman)
Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold
Mountain?
The Doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the
man in the next bed. Has a brief look, calls to a nurse.
DOCTOR
This man is dead.
ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in
the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign
chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour
is open and the music floats over to him as he works.
Ada plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then
the steady drumming of a summer shower.
ADA
(still playing)
Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with
you!
She plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes
on to the window..
ADA
Daddy, come inside before you drown!
After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes
to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS
CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO
ABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with
dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING
AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER.
He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass
eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs,
oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down
the lane.
ADA (V.O.)
Dear Mr. Inman...
INMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs.
Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She
holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages
stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run.
MRS. MORGAN
It's come to you by way of Virginia.
There are various dates, which she decodes.
MRS. MORGAN
It's not too recent -- written this
past winter. I'm afraid I can't read
who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman,
Ada is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room.
ADA (V.O.)
-- I'm still waiting, as I promised
I would, but I find myself alone and
at the end of my wits --
Mrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter:
MRS. MORGAN
-- at the end of my wits, so now I
say to you, plain as I can, come
back to me. Come back to me is my
request.
(can't read the next
bit)
Then something I can't read,
something, come back to me.
Inman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination,
gives a TINY NOD.
OFFICIAL (O.S.)
By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor
of this great state of North Carolina:
any soldier turned deserter is guilty
of treason and shall be hunted down
like a dog.
The Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches
Mrs Castlereagh, the owner.
ADA
Is there a letter for me?
MRS. CASTLEREAGH
Nothing -- we're getting no post
through at all -- although if you
slip out back the material you ordered
has arrived.
They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area.
Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's
another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs
Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were
narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books.
MRS. CASTLEREAGH
If folks knew I was taking deliveries
from the North.
ADA
I know. Thank you so much.
MRS. CASTLEREAGH
The sooner we lose this war the
better. Already one boy gone, another
with his leg took off at the knee.
That's enough.
ADA
What do you hear?
MRS. CASTLEREAGH
All I know is they say not one boy
in ten from these mountains is coming
home again and most of them are
deserters.
Ada comes into the kitchen. A weak oil-lamp reveals THE TWO
RABBITS, partially covered on a plate, flies buzzing around
them, a little liquid leaking from them. Ada takes a knife
and contemplates skinning gutting them. Suddenly she gathers
them up and runs out.
Ada comes inside, she closes the door. Locks it. Puts a chair
against it. Goes upstairs, to her bedroom.
Ada enters her bedroom. It's a chaos of books, clothes,
dishes. She closes the door, sets another chair against it.
Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers
spilling onto the floor. She props up Inman's portrait, on,
the chair, as if he were guarding her. Sits on the bed and,
desolate, begins to write:
Ada dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist
to reveal her arms and shoulders. Now she shucks off the
dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There
isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket
for something less dirty.
Ada enters her father's room, wearing undergarments.
Everything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the
house, extremely tidy. She opens a wardrobe, finds one of
his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up
the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in
a swivel mirror. She turns the mirror away and the image
swings into --
TWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath
the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various. The
charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering
soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in
wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a
pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile. On his way out,
AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand
and gives him an apple from the barrel.
It is almost dawn. The window by Inman's bed is a frame giving
onto the still dark world. The Night Guard passes by on its
patrol of the perimeter. A CLEAN-SHAVEN INMAN IS FULLY DRESSED
UNDER THE COVERS. He gets his hat, pushes his book into his
knapsack and, with one step up, WALKS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND
INTO THE WORLD.
Ada eats. Esco across from her contemplating her evident
appetite, the oversized man's jacket. Sally ladles more food
onto Ada's plate.
SALLY
Don't go back to that dark house.
There's a bed here, least till our
boys get home.
ESCO
That your daddy's coat?
ADA
I was saying to Sally, I wasn't
expecting to be visiting, so...
ESCO
Don't suit you.
He starts to chuckle, then Ada, too, then Sally.
ESCO
I can't get up to your place this
week.
(of Sally)
She's mad at me --
ADA
I don't expect -
ESCO
-- more than I can do to keep this
place half-managed. I'm ready-to
stop, I tell you. I just want to sit
on my porch with Sal, watch my boys
in the field, holler good job! every
hour or so.
SALLY
What about your people in Charleston?
ADA
There are no people. And no money.
My father had some bonds and
investments. They're worthless now,
of course, the war has... they're
not worth anything.
(they look at each
other)
I love it here. In spite of
everything.
ESCO
And waiting on a feller.
A look from Sally.
ESCO
Look down our well.
(Sally's disgusted
with him)
She should! Look down our well with
a mirror, you'll see the future.
S'what they say.
(to Sally)
You do it! Don't make that face.
SALLY
I know it ain't rightly Christian,
but it's what folks do, like when
they dangle a needle over the belly
to see if you're carrying a boy or a
girl.
ADA
What kind of mirror?
Ada wakes up to persistent knocking.
RUBY
Ada? Ada? You up?
ADA
Yes.
(opening her eyes)
It's still dark.
RUBY
Tell the cows that. It's late.
Ada enters blearily, clutching her novel. Ruby already busy.
ADA
I have to eat something.
RUBY
Then you have to get up earlier.
(at Ada's book)
What's that?
ADA
A novel.
RUBY
(heading outside)
You want to carry a book carry one
you can write in --
Ruby's already pitching hay. Turns to Ada.
RUBY
You mucking out?
Ada half-asleep, obedient, stunned by this energy.
RUBY
Three years I was in school before
my daddy -- saying God rest his soul
is like wishing him what he had in
life, cause he lived to rest, he was
born tired -- before my daddy decided
there was better use for my backside
than have it sat all day in front of
a blackboard.
Ruby cleans out leaves and detritus from the stone channel,
allowing the stream to flow free and cool.
RUBY
Number three: clay crocks for
preserves. Tomatoes. Beans. Jams.
Veasey comes in, now carrying the girl. Inman comes behind,
the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire.
VEASEY
(whispering)
Thank you. I was going to do a
grievous wrong.
He looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around
her shoulders. He turns to Inman.
VESEY
You tasted dark meat? Sweet as
liquorice. I think I should go back
up to my wife. She wakes at the
slightest noise.
Inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed...
INMAN
You find me some paper and a pen.
Ada asleep. Ruby enters, shattering the calm.
RUBY
Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in
the woods?
ADA
No. What? No. We bought our hams.
RUBY
There's a world more to a hog than
the two hams! Lard, for example,
we'll need plenty --
She picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the
overflowing laundry basket.
RUBY
The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's
laundry.
(marching out)
I can feel you shutting your eyes.
Ada, her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration, is
working on Ruby's hair, while Ruby experiments with some
earrings.
A pile of Ada's jewelry on the bed beside them.
ADA
Agricola poetis viam non monstrat.
RUBY
Which means?
ADA
The farmer does not point out the
road to a poet.
RUBY
Which means? Should be the other way
round
ADA
Which means, I suppose, which means
the poet should know where he's going.
RUBY
(of Ada's hairdressing)
It's no wonder you're helpless and
hopeless if it takes this long to
fix your hair.
(of the Latin)
Say some more.
ADA
Terra mutata non mutat mores.
(can't believe she
knows all these
phrases by heart)
It's appalling what's in my head.
RUBY
It's appalling what's in my head?
ADA
No, it means: A change of place does
not change a character.
RUBY
Well that's surely true even in
English.
ADA
You can keep those earrings.
RUBY
We can't keep anything.
ADA
I have to keep the bangles. They
were my mother's.
RUBY
Well that's all. The rest is for
trading. Else they can bury you in
your finery.
ADA
(of her hair)
You're done.
There's a small mirror on a stand. It has Inman's picture
stuck in it. She picks it up, removing the tintype, and
holding it up for Ruby to see her hairstyle.
RUBY
Good God! Okay.
She takes the mirror and shows Ada her simple plait.
ADA
I like it.
RUBY
Takes two minutes. That's what I
like.
She puts the earrings back in the pile.
RUBY
How much do you love that piano?
Ada arrives in the kitchen. They've got it under control
now, scrubbed and orderly. She puts the sack down next to
another one. Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked
and ruined, stripes of earth under them. Ruby comes in,
struggling with the last sack, pleased.
RUBY
We're careful we'll get through the
winter now. I made old man Roy give
me ten of those sheep on account of
I said they were so small put together
they were no bigger than six proper
sheep.
ADA
My father always wanted sheep on
this land.
RUBY
I'm sorry you had to lose your piano.
I cut off my hair once, for money.
My daddy got two dollars for it.
Made a wig for a rich feller in
Raleigh.
They're working as they talk, taking the sacks into the
larder, putting out stuff for the evening meal.
RUBY
Stobrod called himself a musician --
my daddy -- he could play six tune
on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead
at Petersburg. I was like his goat
or some creature tethered to a post.
He left me once, up the mountains. I
was eight. He was gone over two weeks.
ADA
Oh Ruby.
RUBY
(defiant)
I was all right! He'd walk forty
miles for liquor and not forty inches
for kindness.
ADA
And your mother?
RUBY
Never met her. We're the same in
that regard. He said she was -- he
told me a thousand stories -- she
was a wolf or an indian or a donkey.
Don't say much for him, except you
know he'd be fast to work up a sweat
on a tree if he thought there was
pleasure in it.
There's a pause. Ruby not easy with her emotions. Abruptly
she jumps up.
RUBY
There's cows to milk.
No real furniture. Veasey is shaving. Inman stows his knapsack
behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling
water steams away. Then he gets in the tub, his back to the
door.
Shyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in
the steaming water. She appraises Inman. It's intensely
sexual.
SHYLA
That's battered flesh.
(of his neck wound)
I could work a finger in there.
VEASEY
He's a hero. Took that wound at
Petersburg.
INMAN
He doesn't know what I am.
(uncomfortable with
her stare)
Thanks.
SHYLA
(to Veasey)
He's shy, ain't he?
VEASEY
Wait up a few minutes, I'll be in
that tub, then we'll see who's a shy
one.
SHYLA
I want to poke my thumb in his holes.
A second woman comes to the door. Dolly.
DOLLY
Lila says supper's up.
LILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The
table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three
men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks.
Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her
cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress.
Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes
increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to
Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked
buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away.
LILA
Hey!
Junior grins, looks over at Inman, then nudges Veasey.
JUNIOR
He's gone now. Look! His eyes have
gone.
INMAN
(vaguely, drunk)
What?
VEASEY
Dolly?
DOLLY
S'me.
VEASEY
Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That's a
poem. That's a poem.
He begins to recite, has a verse in his mind.
VEASEY
Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae
(but he can' t summon
it)
Da-da da-da da-da dae...
(vague)
...there's a poem there.
JUNIOR
I'm leaving soon as I'm full.
VEASEY
Really. Goodbye.
JUNIOR
Got a bunch of traps needs visiting.
I'll be back tomorrow, before dark.
You'll still be here?
VEASEY
That's my fervent prayer.
JUNIOR
My house is your house.
INMAN
(suddenly)
Like to wash their hands and pray.
VEASEY
Say again?
INMAN
Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae.
VEASEY
That's Job. Don't say much but even
liquored up there's a preacher in
him.
Inman gets up suddenly, sways.
INMAN
I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and
miles to go before sunset.
(head spinning)
I'll just quickly lie down.
And he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls
up.
VEASEY
I'm heading for that smokehouse and
I'm ready to be washed clean of my
dirt.
He gets up, wanders out of the door. Junior's eyes glint. He
jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of
the smokehouse.
JUNIOR
You go tend to him.
(to Lila)
I'll be seeing you.
He picks up his gun and leaves Dolly gathering up the children
and herding them out.
DOLLY
Come on you -- get!
Shyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey. Lila waits
until the children have gone. They consider Inman supine by
the fire.
LILA
He's mine. You can go rub yourself
off on the Preacher.
(of Inman)
Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.
Lila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the
jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and
pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing
field.
Then she bends over the prostrate Inman.
LILA
Hey!
Inman stirs, glazed.
LILA
(kneeling down to him)
You want to see what Mamma's got for
you?
SHE SLIPS A SLEEVE OF HER DRESS TO REVEAL A FULL BREAST.
Inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. She takes her breast
to his mouth, and Inman suckles. Then she puts his hands
under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her
legs. She's naked.
LILA
That's good. Ain't that sweet?
SHE PULLS INMAN TO HIS FEET, KISSES HIM, THEN TURNS HER BACK
AND LIES FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE, HER BARE ASS UNDULATING IN
THE AIR.
LILA
You just get on and ride me all the
way to China.
He doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. She turns.
LILA
You shy? You need a hand?
(goes to his buttons)
Let's have a look see what we can
muster.
She's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle,
working the front of Inman's pants. He's in a swoon,
surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her
head. ON CUE, THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN AND HE'S STARING DOWN
THE BARREL OF JUNIOR'S SHOTGUN.
As Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head,
knocking her over.
JUNIOR
You little bitch! Look at you! Cover
yourself up!
NEXT HE SWINGS THE SHOTGUN BARREL AGAINST THE SIDE OF INMAN'S
HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and whistles.
AND WITH THAT THE ROOM FILLS UP WITH A GROUP OF HOME GUARD
BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS AND PURPOSE. THEY SEIZE INMAN, DRAG
HIM OUT AS JUNIOR SPITS AND KICKS AT HIM.
Lila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head. VEASEY'S
ON THE FLOOR, WITH DOLLY ASTRIDE HIM, HIS ARM CRUSHING A
NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE. He considers Lila, beams:
VEASEY
I had a special prayer you'd come
visit.
THREE MEN BURST IN BEHIND HER, RIFLES RAISED.
Ada's milking. It's barely daylight. She's slowly becoming a
country girl. Ruby appears in the doorway.
RUBY
Someone's been in the corncrib.
ADA
You sure?
RUBY
It's a coon or possum. Scratched out
a fist hole in the side. This place!
I'm telling you -- we grow, others
eat. I'll go into town, take the
last of the cider and trade for a
trap.
Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to
town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse. Ada goes
over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes.
Ada buttons Monroe's dress coat and completes the SCARECROW
she's spent the day making, save for the hat, which she now
fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it. She's made a
stern black thing and steps back to consider it.
Horsemen come riding along the lane. It's Teague and his
men.
He doesn't stop but raises his hat to Ada.
Ada looks out at the Winter Garden. From that distance it
really does look like her father out in the field, arms
outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. She finds
it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields,
attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...
From inside the house, Sally watches everything. Her view
impaired by the sheets.
ELLIS AND ACTON SWANGER emerge from their hiding places,
unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams. They're
carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge.
An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs,
wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary
store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot,
wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know
where he is or how long he's been there.
A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which
pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling
in a pan.
INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN
CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches
him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in
thanks, but -- doesn't look up.
She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads,
puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and
pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs.
MADDY
Take one of these now with your food.
Inman is circumspect, views the stub lozenge with suspicion.
MADDY
Swallow it. If you die I'll give you
your money back.
Inman puts it in his mouth, gags at the taste of it. She
hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down.
MADDY
Our minds aren't made to hold on to
the particulars of pain, the way we
do bliss.
She starts steaming the poppies.
INMAN
It's true...
MADDY
What is?
INMAN
What you remember.
MADDY
What's her name?
INMAN
Ada.
(At the food)
-- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when
I'm just hungry --
(another mouthful)
Ada Monroe.
MADDY
And is she waiting for you?
INMAN
She was. I don't know. Or if she'd
know me. I'm like the boy who goes
out in winter for firewood comes
back in the spring with a whistle.
Maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium, then
hands Inman the liquid.
MADDY
Now drink this. It visits the pain.
And you'll sleep.
He drinks the laudanum she's made.
INMAN
I've had to put myself in the way of
people's kindness.
MADDY
I hope you found it.
She dips a cloth in the steaming water, unbuttons his shirt.
She has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline. She
smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp.
Inman surrenders to the drug.
INMAN
The passenger pigeons fly south, the
berries ripen. Whether I see them or
not, whether a man dies, or a war is
won.
MADDY
That's the laudanum getting to you.
That's good. Say something more.
(she kneels to his
leg)
Raise that up for me.
He obliges. She grimaces at the state of it, where the chain
has chewed into the flesh. Gets to work.
INMAN
She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man
by the name of Bartram. Wrote about
his travels. I carried that book
through every battle. I left it
someplace, got to get it back.
Sometimes just reading the name of a
place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire
Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring
me to tears. Thing is I've been
thinking -- those places belonged to
people before us, to the Indian --
and he had a different name. What
did he call Sorell Cove? How can a
name not even the real name break
your heart? It's her, she's the place
I'm heading. And I hardly know her.
So how can a person who's maybe not
even a real person -- I don't know
what I'm talking about -- I have to
close my eyes...
He slides off the stool and lays on the floor. Maddy goes
over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes
over him.
A strip of fabric, homemade bandage, being wrapped around
Stobrod's badly gashed hand. Ada is tending to him. Ruby is
cooking at the range, not remotely warm towards her prodigal
father, who looks rather comfortable. Stobrod looks at her.
STOBROD
Just so's you know -- I can eat while
she's doing this -- in case you're
holding off.
RUBY
Just so's you know -- you're not
eating inside. Number One -- they
hang people round here for taking in
deserters. Number two -- even if
they gave out prizes -- you'd still
eat outside.
STOBROD
You're scarred.
RUBY
I'm what?
STOBROD
Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to
you.
RUBY
You'd be scarred. You'd be really
scarred if I hadn't wrapped them
trap teeth in sacking. Which was her
idea.
STOBROD
I hurt you.
RUBY
Good God!
STOBROD
I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind.
Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the
eyes that sparkle.
RUBY
Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you
abandoned me, you ignored me, you
beat me some more -- all of that is
better than Ruby with the eyes that
sparkle!
STOBROD
I'm changed. People change. War
changes people something terrible.
(to Ada)
Ruby's told you -- I've no doubt --
I wasn't always the best...
RUBY
You were an asshole.
STOBROD
I can't disagree with that. I was.
RUBY
Get him out of here!
STOBROD
Music's changed me. I'm full of music,
darling. I wish I'd brung my fiddle
Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's
got a little snake's rattle in the
body -- took it off a dead federal
in Virginia. That's a beautiful
fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby.
Don't know if it's from that little
rattle locked up in it, or from
something untied my heart.
Ruby walks over with a crock, wrapped in a cloth.
RUBY
You're all set.
STOBROD
(sincerely)
Bless you both.
He goes to the door.
RUBY
Ain't you got a proper coat?
STOBROD
Darling, I'm fine. And you just say
the word, I won't come back neither.
I don't want to put either you or
your mistress here in any bother.
ADA
I'm not Ruby's employer.
STOBROD
Oh, okay, who is?
RUBY
Nobody.
(Stobrod digests this)
I'll make up food for you, you come
Sundays before it's light, I'll leave
it behind the Old Frazier Mill.
STOBROD
Do you know who really needs a coat,
darling, is my partner, fat boy name
of Pangle. We're hiding up in the
caves and he feels the cold like a
thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit
him.
(leaving)
I love you, Ruby. In case the sky
falls on our head. You're a good
girl.
And he's gone. Ruby scowls. FIDDLE MUSIC BEGINS.
RUBY
He is so full of manure, that man,
we could lay him on the dirt and
grow another one just like him.
ADA
So that's Stobrod Thewes.
RUBY
It is and that's the last you'll see
of him.
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and
retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram,
opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers,
as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing.
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window.
Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE
WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window,
scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food,
points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves.
RUBY
Get on back where you came from!
Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away.
Ada in the bed, reading to Ruby from Wuthering Heights.
ADA
-- a source of little visible delight,
But necessary.
RUBY
She ain't gonna marry Linton, is
she? She said -- whatever our souls
are made of his and mine are the
same. You can't say that and then
marry Linton.
ADA
We'll find out.
RUBY
Okay.
ADA
Tomorrow.
RUBY
I'm not waiting until tomorrow.
ADA
Ruby, I'm falling asleep.
She lies back in her bed. Ruby takes the book, lies across
the bottom of the bed, as Ada goes to sleep.
RUBY
Little visible delight, but necessary.
I like that...
Inman enters the cabin. It's a single room. A big fire. The
baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it.
The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him.
She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite
himself, is mesmerized.
INMAN
Thank you.
SARA
I'm alone here, as you can see, with
my baby. I need to believe you mean
no harm.
Inman takes out his gun. She starts, terrified.
INMAN
No, I mean to give it to you.
He turns it handle forwards and offers it to her.
SARA
I don't want it. I had my way they'd
take metal altogether out of this
world. Every blade, every gun.
INMAN
Is your baby sick?
SARA
He cries. I don't know. He cries a
lot. My man is dead. He took his
wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw
his boy.
She never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the
food or the baby.
INMAN
I'm sorry.
SARA
It's pretty much what you'll get if
you knock on any door of this war.
Man dead, woman left.
She hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on
top.
SARA
It's mean food but it's hot.
She goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts
the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd
lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire.
He picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across.
INMAN
(ashamed of his hunger)
There's no hunting on the road, just
cress and --
He takes another bite. Sara picks up the baby.
SARA
I need to feed this man, if you could
look away.
Inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing
the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the
shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds.
SARA
Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders
took them. Made me kill our own dog
on the porch. That poor creature
watched over me. Nothing left now
save a hog and couple of chickens to
live off till spring. I'll have to
kill that hog and make sense of the
flesh and divisions which is something
I never did.
INMAN
I could do that for you in the
morning.
SARA
I'm not asking.
INMAN
It's what I'd gladly do for you for
what you're gladly doing for me. I'm
Inman by the way. That's my name.
SARA
I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan.
INMAN
Glad to know you both.
Sara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets
up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the
door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen.
SARA
They fit?
INMAN (O.S.)
Pretty much. These boots are good
boots.
SARA
I'll say good night.
INMAN (O.S.)
Good night.
Inman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence.
SARA
Could you do something for me? Do
you think you could lie here, next
to me, and not need to go further?
INMAN
I don't know. I'll try.
He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then
removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's
an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry,
pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him.
SHE SOBS, SHUDDERING IN THE BED.
INMAN
I'll go. I'll go, shall I?
SARA
I don't want you to.
They lie, staring up at the ceiling, her tears falling. A
FIDDLE PLAYS HEAVY WITH YEARNING...
THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing
hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering
it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which
has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas
decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost
completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at
a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA,
with a harmonica. As they play:
PANGLE
(of Sally)
She don't speak.
STOBROD
She can't speak. I told you.
PANGLE
(smiles at Sally)
Is she feeble then?
STOBROD
No.
(to Sally)
Don't mind him.
(to Ruby)
Hey Ruby: what about this?
He starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger. Ruby groans.
STOBROD
Don't make that face -- you listen:
c'mon Georgia...
And he starts up again, but this time GEORGIA BEGINS TO SING.
He's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice.
Ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's
extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild
journey. Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets,
slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own.
Ada at the window as, outside, SNOW FLAKES BEGIN TO FALL.
Sara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining --
is urgently shaking Inman. Hissing at him:
SARA
Get out of here, quick!
Inman surfaces from deep sleep.
SARA
Federals are coming. They find you
here it'll go bad on all of us.
Inman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun.
INMAN
I can try and fight them.
SARA
No, my baby. Please no! Just get.
She pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws
things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on,
but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down
onto the frosty ground.
The door is kicked open. Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the
door shut, REVEALING INMAN STANDING BEHIND IT.
From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in
the day's dying light, snow falling around him. He's digging
a grave.
Inside the house, TWO BUNDLES, the small body wrapped in a
blanket, the other wrapped in the bed's patchwork quilt.
Ruby sorting out a kit of shovels, blankets. Ada comes in
doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion.
ADA
I told Georgia he can stop here,
sleep in the barn. He's got nothing
inside him. He'd walk out of here
and die in the snow.
RUBY
He can milk the cows. I was worrying
about that. It'll be dark in a couple
of hours. I's ten hours climb from
here. He's drawn a map.
ADA
Okay.
RUBY
(boiling)
You know these fools stayed the night
in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he
can't do one good thing without adding
the bad. Left tracks in the snow all
the way up for them Home Guards to
follow. That's a sign says shoot me!
ADA
Ruby, I'm so sorry.
Ada moves towards her, puts her arms around her. Ruby is
rigid. Ada stops embracing her.
RUBY
We should get going.
She's tying up the kit. She doesn't know how to grieve.
RUBY
Every piece of this is a man's
bullshit. They call this a war a
cloud over the land, but they made
the weather. Then they stand in the
rain and say: shit! It's raining!
(tears welling)
If I cry one tear for my Daddy I
stole it off a crocodile.
The fire burns, a pall of smoke. Stobrod lies on the ground,
swathed in blankets. Coughs. Ruby sits next to him, wipes
the hair from his forehead. Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes
them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.
ADA
That wood -- that sound when it burns
that mean more snow?
RUBY
Yes, it do, country girl.
Ada enters, Inman behind her. Ruby looks up from Stobrod.
ADA
Ruby, this is Inman.
Ruby digests this. Considers this ghost of a man.
RUBY
Congratulations, I should send you
out with a shotgun more often. He
looks as he needs sleep.
INMAN
I may need to.
RUBY
Be my guest. You shot or something?
INMAN
Not lately.
RUBY
Hungry?
(Inman nods, Ruby to
Ada)
He woke up.
ADA
Stobrod?
RUBY
Said -- your mommy's name was Grace
then closed his eyes again.
THE FIRE BURNS. Ada lies awake. Ruby sleeping. Ada gets up,
steps out into the snow, her blanket around her.
Ada puts logs onto the fire. After a few moments a knock.
ADA
Come in.
Inman enters. They don't know the rules for this.
ADA
Whatever comes to pass between you
and me, I want Ruby to stay in Black
Cove.
INMAN
Right.
ADA
As long as she wants. And if she
never leaves I'll be glad.
INMAN
More a question could she put up
with me.
ADA
And you understand she's my friend,
she's not a hired hand and she doesn't
empty a night jar unless it's her
own.
INMAN
Sure.
ADA
This war's made some things pointless.
It's hard to imagine a wedding. I
think even my father would recognize
that.
INMAN
Ada, I want to marry you. If you'll
have me.
ADA
Isn't there's some religion where
you just have to say I marry you,
three times, and then you're man and
wife.
INMAN
I marry you. I marry you. I marry
you.
Ada laughs, unsettling Inman.
INMAN
Why's that funny?
ADA
No, I think it's I divorce you three
times and then you're not married
anymore.
INMAN
I can wait for you.
ADA
You waited enough. I certainly did.
I marry you. I marry you. I marry
you.
And they kiss, tentative, then more urgent.
ADA
I'm sorry about the way I look. In
these clothes.
(Inman shakes his
head)
And there are so many buttons.
(starts to undress)
Will you turn your back?
INMAN
Not for all the gold dollars in the
Federal Bank.
She stands holding her clothes in front of her to cover
herself. He takes them from her, drops them to the floor.
Ruby is wrapping a fragile Stobrod for the journey.
STOBROD
You come up the mountain for me,
darling, I'd be dead otherwise, dead
and gone.
RUBY
You'd have found some other fool to
rescue you.
STOBROD
He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy.
He coughs for a long time.
RUBY
If you say a thing and then cough
it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse,
and don't lose him or sell him. We'll
need him on the farm.
A GIRL, about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the
table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled
bottle she offers it. She tries again. Ada comes in suddenly,
takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.
ADA
You bring that lamb outside.
The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.
