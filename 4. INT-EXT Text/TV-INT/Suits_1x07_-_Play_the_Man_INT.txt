      dumping her coffee in the trash at security.

                                  MIKE
                    Let me buy you a fresh cup.

                    Okay, I don t steal.  I cheat.  
                    There s a difference.  And I don t 
                    do it anymore.

                                  RACHEL
                    Great defense.   I know I murdered 
                    her, your honor, but I promise I

                    Actually, I was using hyperbole to 
                    make a point.  Like, say, if I were 
                    to call you a complete asshole.  
                    I m only trying to illustrate the 
                    point that you re a complete 
                    asshole.

      The doors to the elevator open and they step in.  Two people 
      who do not want to be trapped in a small space together.



      Rachel s eyes are locked on the floors ticking up.  Mike 
      takes a deep breath.

                                  MIKE
                    Look, I understand why you re mad, 
                    but I feel like your reaction might 
                    not be totally fair.

      Rachel takes a beat.

                    Not fair?

      Uh oh.  Mike realizes he pushed the wrong button.

                    about the saint act, since you only 
                    found out about my cheating because 
                    you were going to cheat too.

                    Thinking about cheating and 
                    actually cheating aren t the same 
                    thing, analogy man.  And we both 
                    know the only reason you helped me 
                    study in the first place is because 
                    you were worried that I would turn 
                    you in.

      DING.  Rachel and Mike are fuming, as the doors to the 
      elevator OPEN.



      Mike and Rachel step out into a truly bizarre scene-- the 
      usually buzzing bullpen is completely and totally deserted.

                                  MIKE
                    Did I miss an apocalypse?

      Mike peers over a cubicle.

                    Where is everyone?

      Rachel shakes her head at him.

      Frustrated, Mike picks up a pen off the reception desk and 
      mock stabs the air behind her, Psycho-style.  Rachel looks 
      back at him.  He drops the pen.



      CLOSE-ON a pen sliding across the last page of a document.  
      HARVEY and JONES DeBEQUE (37), suave, handsome, wrap up 
      paperwork.  

                                  JONES
                    Not bad, Harvey.  The Prague hotel 
                    in the black in less than three 
                    years and a successful IPO.  Who

                    that.

      Jones sticks out his hand for a shake.  Harvey crosses his 
      arms, doing his best impression of a stern father.

                                  HARVEY (CONT D)
                    Tell me something, Jones, you have 
                    thirty hotels in twelve different 
                      countries.  But you spent last week 
                    at Daniel Vega s Lisbon resort.

                                  HARVEY
                    That was more than a fact finding 
                    mission.  You re thinking merger.

                                  JONES
                    You honestly believe I would do 
                    that without telling you?

                                  HARVEY
                    I know you would.

                                  JONES
                    Then perhaps I did.

                                  HARVEY
                    Yes, but you don t need another 
                    name on the mortgage.

                    Sydney Thompson was a consultant at

                                  KYLE
                    I think you mean my bitch, Louis.

      The crowd starts whooping and hollering, as Louis pulls 
      names.  Donna grabs Mike s binder and flips through.

                    I m glad Jessica finally chose a case 
                    with a strong, female character.  Last 
                    year, I was forced to play a traffic 
                    cop.  It was a waste of my talent.

                                  MIKE
                    You play witnesses?

                                  DONNA
                    I don t play anything.  I embody.  And if 
                    I m on your team, you re a winner.

                                  MIKE
                    How can a witness make a lawyer a 
                    winner?  Don t they all testify to 
                    the same facts?

                                  DONNA
                    You think if you cooked a meal with 
                    the same ingredients as a chef it 
                    would taste the same?
                          (then)
                    When I cook, people win.

                                  MIKE
                    In that case --

                                  DONNA
                    No.  

      OFF the stakes of this fake case landing on Mike, we hear--

                    Mike Ross.  Mike Ross!

      Donna gives Mike a shove forward.  He works his way through 
      the crowd and meets his match...Kyle.  He extends his hand.

                                  LOUIS (CONT D)
                    Kyle for the plaintiff.  Ross for 
                    the defendant.  May the best man 
                    win.  Oh Kyle, weren t you national 
                    Mock trial champion?

                                  KYLE
                    That s right Louis.  In high 
                    school, college and law school.

                                  LOUIS
                    Good luck to both of you.
                          (to Mike, whispering)
                    Not really.

      OFF Mike s GULP.  We SMASH TO...MAIN TITLES.

                                        ACT ONE



      Harvey stands at his desk, while Mike stands at attention.

                                  HARVEY
                    I need an assessment of all of 
                    Vega s hotels.  I want you to check 
                    property value, annual earnings--

      Harvey looks up at Mike s blank face.

                                  HARVEY (CONT D)
                    There should be writing.

                                  MIKE
                    But this doesn t sound like an 
                      emergency.

      Harvey stares at him.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    Mock trial tournament...this guy
                          (indicates himself)
                    ...off limits...to you...

      Mike wilts under Harvey s gaze.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    Yeah, I ll get on it.

      Mike starts to walk out, but stops short.  He turns back--

                                  HARVEY
                          (barely looking up)
                    I don t give advice.

                                  MIKE
                    Yes, you do--

                                  HARVEY
                    Not when you ask for it.  Only when 
                    I decide you need it.

                                  MIKE
                    Please, Sensei.  I m out of my 
                    league on this mock trial thing.

      Harvey takes a beat.  Considering Mike s earnest face.  He 
      sits on the edge of the desk.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  11

                                  HARVEY
                    Listen to me.

      Mike s on the edge of his seat.

                                  HARVEY (CONT D)
                    Don t.  Go.  To.  Trial.

      Harvey leans back, with a  You re welcome  smile.

                                  MIKE
                    It s a mock trial.  I think the 
                    trial part is a prerequisite.

                                  HARVEY
                    Law is about control.  And you can 
                    only control so much when there s a 
                    judge, a jury, witnesses, and 
                    another lawyer with an ego complex.

                                  MIKE
                    What if the lawyer doesn t have an 
                    ego complex?

                                  HARVEY
                    Every lawyer has an ego complex.
                    The firm s presented an exercise 
                    where there s potential for 
                    failure.  I m saying create a 
                    situation where that s not even a 
                      possibility -- Kobayashi Maru.

                                  MIKE
                      Koba-what-now?

                                  HARVEY
                    Star Trek.  Captain Kirk.  He wins 
                    a no-win situation by rewriting the 
                    rules.

      Mike considers this for a beat and then can t help himself.

                                  MIKE
                    You re a Trekkie?

                                  HARVEY
                    Hey.  Captain Kirk is the man and I 
                    don t want to hear a word about it.  
                    Now, enough with your fake law 
                    problem.  Let s deal with my real 
                    one.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  12

      Off Mike s face...

      PRE-LAP:

                                  KYLE
                    You want to know how to do a cross? 



      Mike s zeroed in on Kyle, who dispenses advice to a group of 
      gathered associates.

                                  KYLE
                    Cochran for bravado, Dershowitz for 
                      substance, and Bremner for the 
                    feminine touch.  Personally, I m a 
                    little more go for the groin...
                          (to Mike)
                    Oh, hey Mike.

                                  MIKE
                    You mind dismissing the peanut 
                    gallery so we can talk?

      Kyle waves them off.

                                  KYLE
                    Sorry, guys, I think Ross wants to 
                    plead for mercy.

      The crowd disperses, enjoying the face-off.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    If you re here for the 
                      witness/exhibit exchange, don t 
                    bother.  I already know who you re 
                    going to call and what evidence 
                    you re going to use.

      Mike sits on Kyle s desk, doing his best Harvey.

                                  MIKE
                    Actually, I m not going to call any 
                    witnesses or present any evidence.

                                  KYLE
                    It s a make believe trial, Ross, 
                    but that doesn t mean it can all 
                    happen in your head.

                                  KYLE
                    Or, I can beat you.

                                  MIKE
                    In the real world, the end result 
                    of a wrongful termination would be 
                      settlement.  

                                  KYLE
                    In my real world, the end result 
                    would be me beating you.

                                  MIKE
                    The plaintiff showed a pattern of 
                    making derogatory statements about 
                    my client --

                                  KYLE
                    Hearsay --

                                  MIKE
                    Not the e-mails.

                                  KYLE
                    Which have no tone of voice and are 
                    subject to interpretation.

                                  MIKE
                    Which is exactly what makes your 
                    argument shaky at best.  

                                  KYLE
                    Then beat me in court.

                                  MIKE
                    Kyle, I know you think you re going 
                    to beat me and maybe you will.  But 
                    law is about control, and you don t 
                    control everything in that trial.  
                    There s a reason Harvey chose me as 
                    his guy, are you that sure you want 
                    to find out what that reason was? 

      A beat.

                                  KYLE
                    How do I know this isn t some kind 
                    of trick?

                    This isn t a trick.  It s a way for 
                    us to stand out.  Settling gets us 
                    in and out of there in five 
                    minutes.  I give your client three 
                    month s severance, you drop the 
                    suit, and you and I can spend the 
                    week making ourselves indispensable 
                    to the partners while everyone else 
                    buries their heads in Candyland 
                    Court.

      This lands on Kyle.

                                  KYLE
                    I m going to go against my better 
                    judgement and trust you.

                                  MIKE
                    So we have a deal?

                    despite the fact that you two

                    You two know each other?

      Jones starts leading the four of them through the first floor 
      of the hotel.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    We were at Harvard Law together.  
                    Harvey was number five in the class 
                    and I was, oh I forget, what was 
                    it?

                                  HARVEY
                    Married to the library.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    That s right.  Number one.

                                  HARVEY
                    Yes, number one.  At studying.  But 
                    what s my success rate against you 
                    in the real world where we practice 
                    real law?

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Harvey, there should be no winners 
                    or losers in a merger.  Just a 
                    happy new couple.

                                  HARVEY
                    That s right.  Three and oh.

      They ve landed outside the elevators.  Jones and Daniel size 
      these two up.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  16

                    Well, I say we let these two talk 
                    deal points while I try your chef s 
                    famous Sea Bass.

      Jones hands Harvey a key to a suite.

                                  JONES
                    Play nice.  Remember --  
                          (indicating Daniel)
                    We like each other, even if you two 
                    don t.

      All four share a laugh.  One that is immediately dropped by 
      Harvey and Scottie as soon as the men have turned.  

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Married to the library?

                                  HARVEY
                    It s not my fault if the library is 
                    the best you could do.

      The elevator doors open and Harvey and Scottie enter.  

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Push the button.

                                  HARVEY
                    You push the button.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    If we were going to the first 
                    floor, I d push the button.  But 
                      ironically, we re going to the 
                    fifth floor.

                                  HARVEY
                    Really?

      As the doors close.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Do you understand what I just did?  
                    Cause you were fifth in the class 
                    and I was --

      Harvey and Scottie enter a beautiful executive suite.  It s 
      enormous, with a large dining table and multiple doors 
      leading off.  They place their briefcases on the table.

                                  HARVEY
                    Do you have a preliminary proposal?

      They CLICK them open.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    No, I just flew in from London 
                      completely unprepared.

      She hands him a folder.  Harvey starts to open it.

                                    SCOTTIE (CONT D)
                    I think you owe me something first.

      Harvey hands her a folder and removes his suit jacket.

                                  HARVEY
                    Try not to be intimidated.  I use 
                    some big words.

      Scottie places it on the table and removes her suit jacket.

                                    SCOTTIE
                      Overcompensation isn t that big of 
                    a word.

                                  HARVEY
                    It isn t? 

      Harvey loosens his tie.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    I can hardly wait to see the work 
                    of a senior partner.

                                  HARVEY
                    Hm, I see my promotion popped up on 
                    your Harvey Specter google alert.

      Scottie removes her heels.  What the...?

                                    SCOTTIE
                    That s not all that s going to pop 
                    up.

      Harvey untucks his shirt.  Scottie removes a bobby pin and 
      her hair tumbles to her shoulders.  There s the first crack 
      of a smile from both of them and they COLLIDE.  Passion, 
      fire, ferocity, locked in a kiss.  She wraps her legs around 
      Harvey, as he carries her towards the bedroom.

                    rules.  No case negotiations until 
                    we re done.

      Harvey takes a beat.

                                  HARVEY
                    That might be a while.

      And they go, disappearing into the room.

                                        ACT TWO



      Mike walks towards the law library, briefcase in hand, the 
      picture of confidence.  A crowd gathers outside, including, 
      to his surprise, Rachel.  He walks up to her.

                                  MIKE
                    Couldn t resist seeing brilliance 
                    in action?

                    Actually, I have to be here.  I m 
                    playing the part of the plaintiff.

      Mike stops short.

                                  MIKE
                    Wow.  I know you re pissed, but I 
                    didn t take you for petty.

                                  RACHEL

                    Believe it or not Mike, it s not 
                    always about you.  Kyle asked me 
                    and I said yes.

                                  MIKE
                    Is he the only one who asked you?

      Rachel just gives him a look.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    Thought so. 

      The doors to the law library open.

                    mock trial legend born.

      Mike walks into the law library.



      The law library has been converted into a courtroom.  Mike 
      and Kyle sit behind their tables.  Jessica sits at the dais, 
      wearing a black robe and a look of judicial solemnity.  A 
      gaggle of severe-looking partners, including Louis, sits in 
      the audience.

                                    JESSICA
                    Counsel, are you ready to proceed 
                    with opening statements?

      Mike and Kyle both rise--

                        KYLE*MIKE
      The plaintiff is ready for  like to submit a *We d

                                                  honor.

      A murmur goes through the crowd.  Mike stares at Kyle.

                    Oh March 31st, 2010, Sydney 
                    Thompson was unwittingly recorded 
                    on a cell phone...
                          (moves into SLO-MO, 
                            distorted)
                    She was making a joke.  The type of 
                    joke I m sure every person in this 
                    courtroom has made at one point or 
                    another.  And yet, she was fired.  
                    She was denied severance.  And 
                      blackballed from a profession she 
                    loves.  This is, plain and simply, 
                    an injustice.  We will show that 
                    Sydney Thompson not only deserves 
                    her job back, but damages for the 
                    pain and humiliation involved in 
                    her firing.  Thank you, your honor.

      Kyle s words fade into WHITE NOISE as Mike panics.  He can 
      feel sweat beading on his forehead.  His breathing is short.  
      He looks at Rachel s steely face.  He looks down at his empty 
      case folder.  He has prepared nothing.

                    That s harder to monetarily define.

                                  HARVEY
                    This isn t the library, Scottie.  
                    My guy is an up and comer, and 
                    that s why your guy is pouncing.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Your client is an impulse shopper.  
                    And that may have made him a quick 
                    success, but it could make him an 
                    even faster failure.

                                  HARVEY
                    So he s a passionate guy?  He falls 
                    in love with a city and he builds a 
                    hotel.  Who are you to argue with 
                    his track record?

                                    SCOTTIE
                    I m a realist.  And I ve never seen 
                    a deal pushed through so quickly.

                                  HARVEY
                    So what?  

                                    SCOTTIE
                    So, your guy might wake up tomorrow 
                    and decide he doesn t want to do 
                    this.  And I m not going to give 
                    you access to our private books

                    Is that a joke?

      Scottie pauses.

                    show me yours.

      Harvey starts to speak--

                    Don t say it, Harvey.

      They smile at each other, as we CUT TO:



      Mike gulps water from the water fountain, trying to recapture 
      his cool.  He stands, clutching both sides for dear life.  

                                  RACHEL (O.C.)
                    Are you okay?

      Mike stands up and stares squarely at her.

                                  MIKE
                    Do you really care?

      Rachel softens, she starts to say something when Kyle steps 
      between them.

                    Mr. Ross, I m going to have to ask 
                    you not to speak to my client.

                                  MIKE
                    I was speaking to Rachel the 
                      paralegal, not your client.  And I 
                    only have five minutes so get out 
                    of my face.

                                  KYLE
                    What s your problem, Mike?

                                  MIKE
                    My problem is, you didn t have the 
                    balls to make this a fair fight.

                                  KYLE
                    Lawyering isn t about fighting 
                    fair.  And you better watch the 
                      accusations.  Or I might just have 
                    to sue for defamation.

      As Kyle places his hand on Rachel s back and leads her back 
      into the courtroom, a light bulb goes off in Mike s head.



      Everyone sits back in their positions, ready to go.

                                    JESSICA

      Jessica gestures him to the floor.  Mike stands.

                    The defendant wishes to countersue.

      A murmur goes through the crowd.  Kyle sits up.

                    On what grounds?

      Jessica raises an eyebrow.

      Jessica makes a hand motion to Mike,  Grounds.   Mike looks 
      straight at Kyle.

                                  MIKE

                                  KYLE
                    That s ridiculous, your Honor, for 
                    there to be defamation, the 
                      statements made would have to be 
                    false.  That s not the case here.

                                  MIKE
                    Then you shouldn t have a problem 
                    proving that in court.

      Jessica pauses a beat.

                    You want to approach the bench and 
                    see how serious I am?

      Kyle and Mike approach the bench.  Jessica hands them each an 
      additional case binder.

                                  KYLE

                    have to find someone to play my 
                    fake witness in my fake trial.

                                  HARVEY
                    You think in the real world 
                    witnesses are going to jump up and 
                    present themselves?  They re not.  
                    And sometimes when you have one, 
                    they re going to disappear or 
                    recant.  You know what you do?  You 
                    deal with it.  Mock trial is about 
                    figuring out what kind of lawyer 
                    you re going to be.  And there s 
                    only two kinds -- winners and 
                    losers.  

                                  MIKE
                    That sounds good, but I haven t 
                    prepared, I don t even have anyone 
                    to play my client or my witness, 
                    and I m going against an opponent I 
                    can t trust.  

                                  HARVEY
                    Well, winners don t make excuses 
                    when the other side plays the game.  
                    So figure out a way to beat him 
                    anyway.

      As this lands on Mike...

                                      ACT THREE



      Mike walks towards Donna s desk with a folder.

                                  MIKE
                    Hey, Donna, I proofed the final 
                    agreement on the hotel merger.  
                    Quick question--has Harvey ever 
                    heard of spell check?

      Donna looks up at Mike and we see tears streaming down her 
      face.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    What?

      He has no idea how to deal with this.  She lets out a sob.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    No, no, don t cry, it s okay.  
                          (he hands her a tissue 
                            from her desk)
                    Shhh.  Shhh.

      She chokes on her words.  She bites her lip, fighting the 
      tears...and she drops it.

                                  DONNA
                    Not bad, right?

      Mike takes a step back.  Totally unsure.

                                  DONNA (CONT D)
                    I can also do a Demi Moore single 
                    tear if that s better for the 
                      character.

                                  MIKE
                    I really don t understand.

                                  DONNA
                    If I m going to be Lena Lunders for 
                    you, I want to be able to use my 
                    full range of emotions.

      Mike smiles.

                                  MIKE
                    I love you.

                                  DONNA
                    Yeah, I know -
                          (she snaps her fingers)
                    Focus.  You need another witness.  
                    At this point, everyone in the firm 
                    is booked up.

      Kyle walks by.

                                  KYLE
                    Mommy helping you clean up your 
                    mess, Ross?

                                  DONNA
                    Am I Mommy in this scenario?  

                                  KYLE
                          (digging out)
                    Um, no, Ross is just... a baby--

      Donna narrows her eyes.  Kyle hurries away.  Mike watches.

                                  MIKE
                    I can t believe I m going to lose 
                    to that douche.

                                  DONNA
                    Hey.  No pity party.  Go to an 
                    outside source for the other 
                    witness.  For the best friend you 
                    need someone pretty, sympathetic 
                    and most importantly--

      OFF Mike s face.

                                  DONNA (V.O.)
                    Willing to go above and beyond for 
                    you.



      Jenny sits on her couch.  Mike stands opposite her.

                                  JENNY
                    So, you ve been living a lie this 
                    whole time?

                                  MIKE
                    Yes.

      Jenny considers this.  Mike s holding his breath.

                                  JENNY
                    That s awesome.

                                  MIKE
                    Really?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  33

                    Yeah.  As far as double lives go, 
                    you re maybe not as cool as Clark 
                    Kent, but a major step up from the 
                    Craig s List killer.

      Mike lets out a sigh of relief.  

                                  JENNY (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  MIKE
                    It just feels good to tell you.  I 
                    don t really have anybody to talk 
                    about this with.

      She smiles.  

                                  JENNY
                    You trust me.

                                  MIKE
                    Yeah, I guess I do.

                                  JENNY
                    I like that.

      OFF Mike relaxing--



      Scottie walks into Harvey s apartment.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Harvey, I ve got to hand it to you, 
                    you may not be able to commit to a 
                    woman, but you ve been in this 
                    place a long time.

                                  HARVEY
                    She gets me.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    And has no needs.

                                  HARVEY
                    I don t think you understand how 
                    high maintenance this place is.

      She hands him a copy of the merger.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  34

                    He agreed to all terms, despite my 
                    protests that he could do better.

      Harvey takes the copy.

                                  HARVEY
                    So, we re done?

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Minus a few signatures.

      Scottie pushes Harvey down on the couch.

                                  HARVEY
                    That s not done.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Then I ll leave.

      She straddles him.  Harvey kisses her, as we CUT TO:



      Mike has converted Jenny s apartment into a makeshift 
      courtroom.  He formally stands opposite Jenny who s in a 
      chair and speaks as though he is an overacting lawyer.

                    Miss Ginnesse, you began working 
                    with Sydney in January of 2005.

                                  JENNY
                    Correct.

                                  MIKE
                    And over the course of your work 
                    tenure, you two acquired a 
                      relationship via office email--

                                  JENNY

                    Uh, no, sorry, you can t ask

                    It s a trial.  I have to be

                                  JENNY

                                  MIKE
                    Yeah, that works when you re trying 
                    to con your way into an LSAT, but 
                    it s useless in a courtroom.

                    her every day that she s been gone.

      Mike looks at her.

                                  MIKE
                    Why aren t you friends anymore?

                    You do it like that, they ll fall

      Mike stares at her.  And he grabs her.  Their mouths find 
      each other.  They remove clothing, with all the speed of two 
      people who have wanted to do this for a long time.  Down to 
      their underwear, they stumble their way into the bedroom.



      CLOSE-ON Scottie s back as she pulls Harvey s dress shirt up 
      onto her shoulders.  She walks towards the kitchen, revealing 
      a naked Harvey, tangled up in 500 thread count sheets.

                                  HARVEY
                    Scottie, that was amazing.

      Scottie returns with two glasses of water.

                    Hydrate, Harvey.  You just ran a 
                    marathon.

      Harvey takes the water.

      Scottie sits on the bed.  He brushes a hair back from her 
      face.  He suddenly freezes, an intensity coming over him.

                    Uh oh.  That s a lawyer look.

      He sits up.

                                  HARVEY
                    Law school, post-mock trial in the 
                    stacks of Widener--

      He jumps out of bed and puts on his briefs.

                                  HARVEY (CONT D)
                    2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, class 
                    action on the prep room table.

      He s pacing.

                                  HARVEY (CONT D)
                    Dempsey settlement, my office, on 
                    the desk and under.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    We doing a highlight reel?

                                  HARVEY
                    As a matter of fact, we are.  Those 
                    were some top moments, right?

                                    SCOTTIE
                    They weren t bad.

                                  HARVEY
                    They were great.  And I just 
                      realized... this was better.

      Scottie smiles.

                                  HARVEY (CONT D)
                    You were the best you ve ever been 
                    and I know why.  You hid something 
                    in the negotiation and I want to 
                    know what.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    You re ridiculous, you know that?

      Scottie hops out of bed and starts putting on her skirt.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    See it?

                                  HARVEY
                    What is it?  One of Vega s 
                      properties is bankrupt?  The Buenos 
                    Aires one?

      She s putting on her shoes.

                                    SCOTTIE
                            (coquettish)
                    What do you want me to say Harvey?  
                    Yes.  You got it.  I screwed you.

                                  HARVEY
                    How?

                                    SCOTTIE
                    You want an anatomy lesson?

      Scottie smirks.  She walks towards the door.  Harvey narrows 
      his eyes at her.

                                  HARVEY
                    That s my shirt.

      Scottie turns in the doorway.

                                    SCOTTIE

      SLAM.

                                  HARVEY
                    I knew it.

      OFF Harvey s anger, we CUT TO:



      Mike and Jenny naked in bed, holding each other.  Mike 
      strokes her face.  She gives him a soft kiss.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  39

                    Is this how you prep all your 
                      witnesses?

                                  MIKE
                    Yeah, I prepped the shit out of 
                    Frank Johnson last week.

      He smiles and kisses her again.  Mike s phone buzzes.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    Crap.  Hang on a sec.

      Mike leans over Jenny to grab his phone.  CLOSE-ON screen.  
      It s a text from Harvey-- Meet me at the office. 911. 

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    Double crap.

                                  JENNY
                    Double crap?

                                  MIKE
                    Yes, it s twice as bad as crap.

      Mike sighs and collapses on the bed in frustration.



      Wee hours of the morning.  Mike enters Harvey s office, where 
      he s maniacally going through paperwork.

                                  MIKE
                    You were right.  There s been a 
                    steady stream of stock buys by 
                    Vega s company over the last 24 
                    hours.  

                                  HARVEY
                    It s a hostile takeover.

                                  MIKE
                    Why have they been disguising it as 
                    a merger?

                                  HARVEY
                    They wanted access to our private 
                    books.  She tricked me.  

                                  MIKE
                    What?  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  40

                                  HARVEY
                    She pretended she didn t want to 
                    hand over their books so I wouldn t 
                    notice when she asked for ours.  
                    It s a classic maneuver.  She made 
                    me think it was my idea.  

                                  MIKE
                    How do you know that?

                                  HARVEY
                    Because I taught her how to do it.

                                  MIKE
                    And now they ve seen how strong 
                    DeBeque s company is and decided 
                    they want to buy it.

                                  HARVEY
                    And they ll be running it by the 
                    time Scottie s back in London.

                                  MIKE
                    Wow.  I leave you alone for two 
                    days...

                                  HARVEY
                    This, my mistake, this is Haley s 
                    comet.  Take a good look.  Because 
                    it won t happen again.

                                  MIKE
                    What are you going to do?

                                  HARVEY
                    I want to know which of Debeque s 
                    hotels are the most valuable.  And 
                    how fast we can get them on the 
                    market.

                                  MIKE
                    You want him to sell his best 
                    hotels?

                                  HARVEY
                    It s called the Crown Jewel 
                    defense.  We unload the highest 
                    grossing assets and make ourselves 
                      undesirable.  

                                  MIKE
                    Debeque will never agree to that.

                    passion for his company that after 
                    I tell him what Scottie s up to 
                    he ll be willing to chop off an arm

      Jenny sits on Mike s desk, while he looks through his case 
      binder one more time.

                                  JENNY
                    You know you had that memorized the 
                    first time you read it.

                                  MIKE
                    Yes, but I didn t finish reading it 
                    because one of my witnesses chose 
                    to be distracting.

                                  JENNY
                    That must ve been rough for you.

                                  MIKE
                    You have no idea.

      Jenny playfully hits him and hops off the desk.

                    Where can I get some water?  I want 
                    my voice to hold up.  

      Mike smiles and points down the hall.  Jenny walks off.  Kyle 
      slides up.

                    I ll make you a deal, winner gets

                    I m never going to make another 
                    deal with you again.

                    Good.  One thing, if you get in 
                    trouble, don t play the case, play 
                    the man.

                                  MIKE
                    What are you talking about?

                                  HARVEY
                    Good lawyers worry about the facts.  
                    Great lawyers worry about their 
                      opponents.  Kyle s devious and

                    that against him.

      Mike gives a nod.

                    Anything else?

      Harvey leans in close.

                    Is it inappropriate to take a Xanax

                    I ve seen clients do much worse.

                    she knew would be damaging to Lena

                    On your performance review, Lena

                    Your coworkers were promoted while

                    you mediocre? 

      Rachel shifts.  This is starting to feel a little personal.

      Jessica clocks this.  Rachel can t believe it.  Even Jenny

      Harvey and Jones sit opposite Scottie and Daniel.  The 
      atmosphere is tense.

                                  HARVEY
                      Gentlemen, I appreciate you leaving 
                    the swords at home.  What started 
                    as a true merger, never needed to 
                    become anything different.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Daniel, listen to me, I know Harvey 
                    and he s just angling to merge your 
                      businesses so he can double his 
                    billable hours.

                                  DANIEL
                    Quiet, Scott.  I want to hear what 
                    he has to say.

                                  HARVEY
                    I m here to get my client the deal 
                    he wants.  And what he wants is a 
                    merger.  Is that right, Jones?

                                  JONES
                    That s right.

                                  HARVEY
                    Daniel, your law firm overreached 
                    in a situation where it wasn t 
                      necessary.  It s not entirely 
                    Scottie s fault.  We lawyers all 
                    have an instinct to win, but we may 
                    not be good at understanding what 
                    that means.  

                                    SCOTTIE
                    We know what it means.

                                  HARVEY
                    Maybe you do and maybe you don t.  
                    For me, it would be to see both men 
                    return to the initial deal, so that 
                    your businesses can grow together.  
                    Instead of having one company with 
                    a hostile reputation and another 
                    one a shell of what it once was.

                    And that doesn t sound like a win 
                    to me.

                                  DANIEL
                          (to Jones)
                    I m sorry.

                                  JONES
                    Let s go back to the deal we had.

                                  DANIEL
                    We can run it together.

      They shake hands.  It s all too obvious that Harvey has 
      completely undermined Scottie in this discussion.



      Harvey sits behind his desk.  Mike pokes his head in.

                                  MIKE
                    You need anything?  Otherwise, I m 
                    going to head out.

                      associates?

                                  MIKE
                    Yup.

      Harvey finally looks up.

                                  HARVEY
                    And what, exactly, are you 
                      celebrating?

                                  MIKE
                    Save the disappointment, Harvey.  I 
                    know what I did.

                                  HARVEY
                    Do you?  Because from what I saw, 
                    you backed off because you were 
                    worried about hurting your 
                      girlfriend s feelings.  







                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  59

                                  MIKE
                    Harvey, it was a fake trial.  I 
                    weighed the pros and cons and 
                    decided it wasn t worth hurting 
                    someone for the result.

      Harvey stands up.

                                  HARVEY
                    The result is you just told every 
                    partner at this firm, including me, 
                    that you have a weak stomach.  That 
                    you don t have what it takes.

      Harvey sits back down at his desk, done with Mike.  Mike 
      starts to leave, but stops.

                                  MIKE
                    You keep telling me that I have to 
                    decide what kind of lawyer I want 
                    to be.  And if I was smart, I d 
                    probably be exactly like you.  
                    Because we all know, you re the 
                    best.  But I m also trying to 
                    decide what kind of person I want 
                    to be.  And sometimes I like my 
                    kind of person better than your 
                    kind of person.

                                  HARVEY
                    You want to know what kind of 
                    person I am?  Tough but fair.  I 
                    call it like I see it.  And what I 
                    see is a kid who asked me for an 
                      opportunity and still hasn t 
                    decided if he wants it or not.  

      Mike walks out.  Harvey watches him go.



      Harvey enters the main bar of the elegant Harvard Club and 
      sees Scottie, suit jacket off, nursing a drink.

                                  HARVEY
                    Harvard Club.  I thought you hated 
                    this place.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Vega kicked me out of his hotel.  
                    So, you know, beggars.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  60

                                  HARVEY
                    Save the pout.  You were head of 
                    law review, clerked for a Supreme 
                    Court judge, and almost beat me.  I 
                    think that deserves a drink.  On 
                    you. 

                                    SCOTTIE
                    I d laugh, Harvey, but I just got 
                    fired.

                                  HARVEY
                    From the firm?

                                    SCOTTIE
                    No.  But the firm won t be happy.  
                    Which is why I m not already on a 
                    plane.

                                  HARVEY
                    The Scottie I know is tougher than 
                    that--

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Is she?

      Harvey looks at a Harvard Club calendar.

                                  HARVEY
                    Hey, you want to go back to Harvard 
                    and see a lecture on why women are 
                    better at science?  That should 
                    cheer you up.

      Scottie can t help but laugh.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Maybe.  But I m not going with you.

                                  HARVEY
                    Come on, still friends--

      Scottie looks him dead in the eye.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    I m getting married, Harvey.  His 
                    name is Steve.  He asked me a month 
                    ago.  When I get back to London, 
                    I m going to say yes.

      This hits Harvey like a freight train.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  61

                                  HARVEY
                    What do you want me to say?

      A moment.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Nothing.

      Scottie stands to leave, but Harvey pulls her into an 
      unexpected hug.  It s the most intimate gesture we ve seen 
      him give.  And lest he reveal himself too much.

                                  HARVEY
                    Sorry I won.

      Scottie smiles.  She puts her hand on his cheek.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    No, Harvey.  I d hate it if you 
                    were sorry about that.

      She turns.  Harvey watches her walk away.



      CLOSE-ON a group of associates, including Kyle, downing 
      jagermeister.  Mike walks by and Kyle pulls him into a 
      headlock.

                                  KYLE
                    This guy is my favorite punching 
                    bag!

                                  MIKE
                    And this guy is covering everyone s 
                    tab!

      Mike pulls Kyle s wallet out of his pocket and throws it to 
      the bartender.  A cheer erupts from the crowd.  Kyle s too 
      drunk to care.  Mike sits down on a stool at the bar.  Rachel 
      comes up next to him.

                                  RACHEL
                    You didn t have to do that, you 
                    know.

                                  MIKE
                    I know.

                                  RACHEL
                      I could ve handled it.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  62

                                  MIKE
                    I know.

                                  RACHEL
                    That was a thank you, in case you 
                    couldn t tell.

                                  MIKE
                    I could tell.

      Rachel gives him a little smile.

                                  RACHEL
                    Jenny was a great witness.

      Mike s suddenly uncomfortable.

                                  RACHEL (CONT D)
                    Really likable.  And pretty.  

      Mike pauses.

                                  MIKE
                    She s an old friend.

      Rachel takes this in.

                                  RACHEL
                    Am I your friend?

                                  MIKE
                    It was a little hard to tell this 
                    week.

                                  RACHEL
                    I know I was hard on you--

                                  MIKE
                    It s okay--

                                  RACHEL
                    But did it ever occur to you to 
                    wonder why I was so mad at you?  
                    It s -- I expect more out of you 
                    than most people.

                                  MIKE
                    Why?

      Rachel stares at him.  There s such an intensity, a 
      vulnerability in her eyes.  Mike sees it.  He s overwhelmed 
      by it.  She s about to say something and she stops.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  63

                                  RACHEL
                    You re a smart guy, Mike.  You can 
                    figure it out.

                                  MIKE
                    You said you wouldn t date anyone 
                    from the office.

                                  RACHEL
                    You re a lawyer.  You re not 
                    supposed to take no for an answer.

      OFF Mike.



      Harvey enters from his goodbye with Scottie.  The firm is 
      empty.  He walks to his office, notices that Louis is at his 
      desk.  Harvey walks in and puts an envelope on Louis s desk.  
      Louis is about to gloat to Harvey, but sees something in 
      Harvey s expression that prevents him from saying anything.  
      As Harvey walks out, Louis opens the envelope and we see it 
      is filled with cash.  Their wager.  Harvey walks back to his 
      office, sits at his desk and starts working.
