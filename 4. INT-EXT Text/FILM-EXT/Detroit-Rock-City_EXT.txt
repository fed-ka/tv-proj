A small, two-story house amid a suburban neighborhood of
other two-story houses. Uninspired architecture. Spindly
trees.
Two-car garage.
A faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across
which shadows frantically dart. Over the CRICKETS, we hear
MUFFLED, BADLY-RENDERED ROCK 'N' ROLL. SCRATCHY, GUTTURAL,
inhuman.
CAMERA MOVES to the cellar window. Inside we see four TEENAGE
BOYS who are to blame for the racket. Band practice.
The front door opens. Jam steps out to greet his mom with a
nervous smile. Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand at a safe distance
in the foyer behind him.
JAM
What's up?
Mrs. Bruce grabs her son by the ear and holds up the KISS
LOVE GUN record waving it in his face.
MRS. BRUCE
The devil's body count, that's what's
up! Don't you know what KISS stands
for? "Knights in Satan's Service!"
She hauls Jam across the lawn. Hawk, Lex, and Trip step onto
the porch looking on in sympathetic embarrassment. Mrs. Bruce
stuffs the record in the trash can then throws Jam in the
front seat. SCREECH, the station wagon pulls away.
TRIP
Jam has yet to do an overnight with
us.
LEX
I had a nightmare once that something
like this might happen. I hope he
doesn't get grounded again. If he
misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I
don't know if he'll be able to handle
it.
HAWK
Lex, quit trying to always jinx
things. Don't worry, dudes. Nobody's
missing that concert tomorrow night.
MAIN TITLES
CLOSE-UP
The LOVE GUN album sitting in the trash can. CAMERA MOVES IN
on the round label till it FILLS THE FRAME. The record begins
to spin like on a turntable as CAMERA DESCENDS INTO the little
hole ENGULFING THE FRAME IN BLACK. This LEADS us INTO...
OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE
"ROCK 'N' ROLL ALL NITE" BLASTS the way it's supposed to
sound. The jammin' KISS classic is accompanied by a barrage
of QUICK CUTS depicting KISS mania. TV appearances. Concert
footage. Magazine covers. Comic Books. Posters. Art work.
KISS merchandise, dolls, lunch boxes, clothes, etc.
We see the BAND do their thing in authentic CLIPS FROM REAL
SHOWS. GENE, PAUL, ACE, AND PETER SHOUTING IT OUT LOUD.
The MONTAGE is a colorful, kick-ass kaleidoscope of the entire
KISS phenomena. CUT TO the BEAT of this seminal anthem.
The FINAL IMAGE is the KISS "DESTROYER" POSTER.
END CREDITS
TICKET CHECK
The suburban high school is teeming with morning activity.
School buses pull up to the curb. KIDS arrive in droves and
immediately find their cliques. The JOCKS and PRIMADONNAS
make up the popular crowd. There's DISCO DUDES, FRESHMEN who
look like grade schoolers, and GEEKS.
At the smoking section hang the BURNOUTS. Hawk, Trip, and
Lex stand amid the other long-hairs.
TRIP
School. What a fuckin' waste of time.
Two GIRLS with tons of make-up, hair so feathered it could
fly, and tight clothes, saunter by SNAPPING gum.
HAWK
Will somebody please tell those chicks
disco is dead.
LEX
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as
much as I hate dogs.
TRIP
Same species when you think about
it.
Their words say one thing, but their eyes say another. They
can't stop gawking at the chicks' asses. Girl #1 sneers back.
GIRL #1
Don't stare too long, you'll go blind.
The boys quickly cover.
LEX
(defensive)
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at
that big ass.
TRIP
You know what they say about a big
ass... big shit.
They chuckle. Just then, Jam steps off a school bus in an
unbelievably geeky outfit, white corduroy slacks, plaid shirt
buttoned to the top, argyle socks and brown deck shoes.
TRIP
Hey, that dork looks just like Jam.
Hawk and Lex look and laugh when they see him.
LEX
Shit, that dork is Jam.
HAWK
(to Jam)
YO, DOOFUS!
Jam gives them the finger.
Beth looks sadly out the window watching Mrs. Bruce push Jam
in the car. Beth puts her hand on the pane wanting to touch
him.
Mrs. Bruce's car turns off the road and drives through an
imposing set of wrought iron gates. The sign reads: St.
Bernard's Veil of Tears. A School for Catholic Boys.
The car winds up the path leading to a dark, Gothic edifice
over which tumultuous storm clouds continuously hover. THUNDER
BELCHES and bolts of lightning shoot at the blackened
crucifixes along the structure. We hear a SCARY ORGAN theme.
C/U on the grill of a moving car, Ohio vanity plate reading:
Ob-GYN.
PULL BACK to reveal it's on a brand spanking-new, brown Volvo
242 DL hauling ass. Hawk drives, Lex rides shotgun, and Trip
sits in the back, arms draped over the front seat.
The Volvo turns and barrels up St. Bernard's gated entrance.
Mrs. Bruce exits the building and approaches her car. She
stops when she sees the '78 brown Volvo parked behind her.
It's empty. She shrugs and gets into her car, driving off.
Inside the Volvo Hawk, Trip, and Lex poke their heads up.
The coast is clear so they can sit straight again. They stare
up at a second story window where they see part of Jam's
profile.
LEX
Now, how are we gonna do this?
HAWK
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
They hear an ENGINE and turn to see a delivery truck labelled
PIZZA PIG parking behind them. A DELIVERY BOY holding a pizza
box steps out. Trip's mouth waters.
TRIP
(licking his chops)
Mmm, pizza...
Seeing the boys, the delivery boy stops at the Volvo.
DELIVERY BOY
Hey, you guys know where...
(looks at slip on box)
Philip McNutly's office is?
Hawk, Trip, and Lex exchange an anxious glance, then Hawk
smiles. He is officially inspired as he turns to the boy.
HAWK
Yeah, I'm Philip McNutly.
ANGLE ON a status report. The 2:45 is now leaving. We see is
Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam running alongside a train as it
picks up speed by the second. They YELL for it to stop, but
it's hopeless. The train is gone. So much for the 2:45.
Just as the DISCO TUNE playing in the Trans Am hits the next
chorus, a fistful of pizza SPLATTERS across the windshield.
Freaked, Kenny swerves and zigzags all over the road.
Righting himself, Kenny's entire family might as well have
been insulted.
KENNY
Stop singing... NOW!
He turns off the stereo and floors the accelerator, swerving
into the left lane and passing the Volvo. Bobby is just now
noticing the mess on the windshield.
He starts to laugh.
BOBBY
Hey, Kenny, look! There's a hunk of
fawkin' cheese on your windsheel!
The Trans Am muscles the Volvo into the breakdown lane.
Parking the ass end of the Pontiac out a bit, Kenny blocks
the Volvo in. Kenny and Bobby climb from their car and storm
over to the boys.
Hawk opens his door just as Kenny's hairy-knuckled hands
pull him out through the window. He grabs Trip, yanking him
out too. Bobby opens the back door and does the same with
Lex and Jam.
With a kid in each hand now, Kenny and Bobby SLAM the four
boys against the Volvo in a line. The size difference between
the burnouts and the guidos is painfully obvious now. Kenny
and Bobby are Neanderthals.
KENNY
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn,
unadulterated, undiluted, no holds
barred, one hundred percent pure as
Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin'
STUPIDITY of what you just did?
HAWK
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Kenny hauls back and SLAPS the row of boys in the faces Three
Stooges-style... WHACKWHACKWHACKWHACK!
KENNY
DO YOU?!
Trip, Lex, and Jam clutch their faces in pain. Hawk looks
merely disenchanted as Kenny pokes a muscle-bound finger at
his chest. Getting in Hawk's face, Kenny yammers loud and
fast.
KENNY
Lemme paint you a friggin' picture
ahright? Imagine if you will a 1978
Pontiac Trans American in pristine
condition.
(beat)
An appealing portrait, nesspah?
Hawk starts to say "yes."
KENNY
BUT WAIT! What's that spec on the
windshield? Could it be a wad of
melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce,
and various friggin' meat products?
Hawk is unimpressed.
HAWK
Could be.
KENNY
And if it ain't cleaned off?
CHRISTINE
Kenny, come on with the macho crap
already. Like this kid could take
you in a fight anyway.
KENNY
(ignoring Christine)
Answer me, hippie girl. And if the
mess ain't cleaned off my car?
HAWK
It could... bake on?
Kenny looks at Bobby and they exchange moronic grins.
KENNY
You're a smart little homo, aren't
you, hippie girl? But, while astounded
at your nimble, friggin' insight, I
still detect an issue hanging fire,
namely: where does a sharp-witted
faggot like yourself get off doing
such a dopey thing like that there?
Hawk figured out that any answer he gives will be incorrect
and has decided to wait till Kenny's done.
KENNY
No really, I'm perplexed. I mean,
could you have done stupider if you
were born without a FUCKIN' HEAD?!
CHRISTINE
(using "oh" to mean
"enough")
Oh! With the language!
KENNY
Shut-up, Christine!
Christine snarls at Kenny.
HAWK
Okay, Kenny? I don't mean to drain
your keg or anything, but could you
speed up this process?
(beat)
Don't get me wrong, we'd love to
stand here and get shit on by the
cast of Saturday Night Fever, but
we're also on a schedule. So step on
it.
Cold silence as Kenny replays Hawk's insult over in his head.
KENNY
Are you gettin' wise with me?
HAWK
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug.
Now can I please clean your windshield
and leave without further ado?
BOBBY
Break his fawkin' legs, Kenny!
Kenny's temper's rising faster than the price of gasoline.
Hawk on the other hand is cooler than an Otter Pop.
KENNY
Oh, you're dumb all right, you hairy
ass punk. But please, allow me to
clean the friggin' windshield. I
insist.
And with that, Kenny grabs himself a fistful of Hawk's long
hair and pulls him over to the Trans Am. He wipes the pizza
off with Hawk's hair, tugging Hawk's head up and down, back
and forth. Hawk GRUNTS with each wipe, but doesn't give Kenny
the satisfaction of hearing him scream.
Trip, Lex, and Jam watch helplessly, trapped under Bobby's
dull-witted, but equally threatening gaze.
Kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and
looks at his handiwork.
KENNY
There. Nice and clean.
He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby. Then, he
suddenly hears the KISS tune coming from the Volvo. Uh-oh!
KENNY
Oh, no, no, no! It's the fag band!
Kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo, reaching
in the driver's door. Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist.
JAM
Whoa! This is about pizza! Let's
leave KISS out of it. Please.
KENNY
A bunch of guys who make bad music,
dress like freaks, and wear more
make-up than all my sisters combined?
These assholes must be stopped!
Kenny pushes Jam away.
CHRISTINE
That's it, Kenny! I'm leaving!
Christine gets out of the car and starts walking down the
highway, exiting the scene.
BARBARA
Oh, Christine! You googatz in the
head or something? We're on the side
of the freakin' highway!
BOBBY
Let her go, Barbara, she'll come
back to Kenny. She always does...
(to Kenny)
Right, Kenny?
Kenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo.
KENNY
Kool and the Gang, now there's real
music.
Kenny takes the 8-track from the car...
KENNY
But this... is crap!
He flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed
to bits under the wheels of a passing semi.
FOLLOW a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape
streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the
road, landing at Jam's feet.
TILT UP to Jam's face. He raises his eyes and turns to the
CAMERA, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the
Indian in that "Keep America Beautiful" litter ad.
Hawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him.
KENNY
So. All that having been said and
done, I believe we are ready for the
final topic of discussion. Namely:
Have you learned your lesson yet,
puke?
Hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. He
blows some smoke in Kenny's face.
HAWK
Well, let's recap, shall we? You
slapped all of us, yelled at me,
used my head for a rag, threw me on
the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8-
track under the wheels of a passing
semi.
(puffing on cig)
So, if the lesson was that you're a
dick with ears and a really bad
haircut, then, yes... I'd say we
learned it.
KENNY
(beat, in disbelief)
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a-
hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
HAWK
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With.
Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
KENNY
Oh, yeah...?
Out of original material, Kenny goes for an old stand by.
KENNY
That's not what your mother said
last night.
Trip, Lex, and Jam exchange "uh-oh" glances. Meanwhile, Hawk's
eyes glaze over.
HAWK
It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me...
Hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly
empty can of Hawaiian Punch, holding it discreetly at his
side.
HAWK
...what exactly did my mother say
last night?
Kenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one.
HAWK
You heard me, prick. What did my
mother say last night?
Kenny chuckles and looks at Bobby. They have a good little
laugh... the homo's got balls! Then Kenny turns back to Hawk.
KENNY
Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what
your mother said last night.
(beat)
She said that I was the fuck of her
life.
Hawk is a little mad now. He tosses his cigarette to the
ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker.
HAWK
(very Clint Eastwood)
How would you like a nice Hawaiian
Punch?
KENNY
(smirking)
Sure.
Quick as a shot, Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into Kenny's
nose, crushing it flat against his face. Hawaiian backwash
spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards
from the impact. He hits his head on the ground.
Taking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a
chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out his
drumsticks.
As if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet,
snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Lex
THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle leaving
a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead.
Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet. When he
hits the ground, Jam's right there DRUMMING his balls.
Bobby shrieks.
Meanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can
off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose
with fruit punch for snot.
Hawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes
the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets out
a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity.
Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head
swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground,
unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking
Bobby out cold.
Terrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered.
LEX
Not so fast, stella.
DISSOLVE TO:
MOMENTS LATER
Kenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with
Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt.
Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of
Barbara's shoulders.
Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the
stella, snickering.
BARBARA
When they wake up, they're gonna
come looking for you jerks. You best
hope they don't find you, cause if
they do, they're gonna kick your
asses.
Hawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road, walking
up to the Trans Am.
HAWK
Right, stella, and we'll deserve it.
But let's really make it worth their
while.
Hawk puts the rock on the Trans Am's accelerator letting the
engine WHINE in protest. (Again we are cautious not to show
the guidos' faces.)
HAWK
By the way, when Kenny wakes up could
you give him a message for me. Tell
him, quote, Kool and the gang bite
my bag, motherfucker, unquote.
He throws the Trans Am into drive.
All who are conscience listen to the brief SCREECH, then
watch the Trans Am as it barrels without a driver into the
woods skirting the highway.
It races into ditches, bounces off trees, and SPLASHES through
ponds, all Smokey and the Bandit-like.
The disco-mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles
down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way,
and finally, BOOM! It explodes on final impact.
The boys all look at each other and shrug. Hawk walks back
to the Volvo and gets in. Trip, Lex, and Jam follow suit and
pile in as well. Lex shouts back to Barbara.
LEX
Oh, thanks for letting us draw from
your ample make-up supply. You must
have the entire Revlon factory in
your purse!
ANGLE ON KENNY, BOBBY, AND BARBARA.
We now see them from the front. Lo-and-behold, Kenny has
been made-up like Gene Simmons, Bobby like Paul Stanley.
Whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their
musical taste... and kick their asses all over again.
BARBARA
Very funny. I hope you choke!
STELLA ON BOARD
The sun hangs low on this day as the Volvo sits in traffic,
passing Cobo Hall. Movement is nearly impossible.
KISS FANS cram every square foot of open macadam, pushing
through the jammed cars. STREET VENDORS hawk KISS souvenirs
from tee-shirts to pennants. Some are in stands along the
sidewalk. Others come right up to car windows.
COBO Hall looms up ahead.
Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam enter the sidewalk. A thickening
CROWD of KISS fans continually meander by.
On their way to the car, they suddenly hear a WOMAN'S VOICE
bellowing through a megaphone from somewhere down the street.
After a moment they see the voice's source.
A GROUP OF WOMEN has congregated about forty feet ahead and
their LEADER, her back toward the boys, yells to the group
through her bullhorn. Flying above them all is a large banner
reading: "MATMOK, Mothers Against The Music Of KISS."
LEADER
Welcome to the first open meeting of
MATMOK, Mothers Against The Music Of
KISS!"
The group cheers as the KISS FANS milling around them pretty
much ignore the whole MATMOK spectacle.
Lex looks away from the MATMOKS and into the street. We can't
see what he sees, but we can tell he's alarmed.
LEX
Uh... dudes?
HAWK
(ignoring Lex)
Now there's a woman who totally abuses
the privilege of motherhood.
LEX
DUDES!
They all look at Lex.
LEX
(eyes focused ahead)
Where's the Volvo?
Hawk, Trip, and Jam look at their parking spot to see a beat-
up Dodge Dart sitting there instead of the Volvo.
TRIP
It's gone.
LEX
I can see that, bright boy. What
happened to it?
JAM
It was stolen!
HAWK
(incredulous)
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass!
The stella booted with your mom's
wheels.
LEX
But we took the keys?
TRIP
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We
picked up a professional car thief
in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
LEX
Okay, I'm just a little mad now!
Jam, why'd you talk us into picking
that bitch up in the first place!?
JAM
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a
nice thing to do.
HAWK
Jam, not another word out of your
femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here,
we got nothing, and we got an hour
and a half. We're totally committed.
It's time to brainstorm.
LEX
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop
worrying about the concert for the
time being and get the cops in on
this Volvo situation.
HAWK
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The
cops aren't gonna waste city dollars
looking for a Swedish car. Face it,
the Volvo's on a cutting board as we
speak getting sliced, diced, and
julienned by Christine, the chop
shop gourmet.
Lex is developing a look of resolve. This is Detroit!
HAWK
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
LEX
(on a roll)
...I mean, my mom's got insurance.
What's the worst thing she could do?
Ground me for the entire year? I can
handle that...
HAWK
Cool, bro, now listen up...
LEX
...Holy shit! I am in absolute
trouble! I never should have let you
drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
HAWK
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now,
then, step number one, we find us a
scalper. I got...
(takes out KISS money
clip)
twenty-five.
TRIP
Twenty-five more'n I got.
LEX
All I got is five. The rest is in
the Volvo.
JAM
I got...
HAWK
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show
us.
Jam holds up a ten keeping his mouth shut.
HAWK
So maybe we got enough for one ticket.
Fuck!
TRIP
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find
four really small kids, beat the
shit outta them and steal their
tickets. What do you think?
HAWK
(sarcastic)
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance.
Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel
Prize.
Trip smiles proudly.
LEX
I think we should try sneaking in.
HAWK
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get
busted fer sure. Bad plan.
LEX
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four
ticket stubs off some kids in the
audience, comes back out, and we all
"re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
HAWK
Still too risky for my money.
(looking at watch)
We're running out of time here. This
is KISS! A victory for one is a
victory for the team. I'm sure I can
barter with a scalper, but if you
dudes think you got better plans, go
for it. We'll reconvene at that
intersection...
Hawk points to the intersection where the church, the male
strip joint, the parking lot, and the Smiley Mart are located.
HAWK
...at twenty-thirty hours.
TRIP
One more time in English.
HAWK
For the next hour and a half it's
every dude for himself. Try to get
at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M.
we'll meet over there.
JAM
(inspired)
Wait! I know how we can get in!
HAWK
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to
speak, remember? Go use whatever
femmy idea you have to get yourself
a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear
it.
JAM
(sadly)
But... my plan involves all four of
us acting together.
HAWK
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.
(to Lex and Trip)
Dudes? Later.
Hawk, Trip, and Lex split up, leaving Jam alone. He starts
walking in the opposite direction, passing MATMOKS. The leader
is still on a roll, yelling through the megaphone.
LEADER
Look around you tonight, mothers!
Look at all the young faces! They
smile and laugh but their eyes have
lost all hope! Not one among them
appears to possess the love and fear
of God... This satanic group KISS
has stolen their souls.
The leader's gaze finally falls upon Jam. He lets out a GASP.
Yes, the leader is Mrs. Bruce. So this was her church meeting.
She freezes when she sees her son; her jaw slackens. Meanwhile
Jam looks stunned beyond comprehension.
JAM
Oh... dear... Lord!!
Mrs. Bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another MATMOK
member, who picks up where Mrs. Bruce left off.
Jam looks around for someplace to run and hide, but it's too
late. Mrs. Bruce slices through the crowd of KISS fans and
grabs Jam by the ear. He yelps.
MRS. BRUCE
I don't know how you got here tonight
and I don't want to know either. All
I know is you're going to pay dearly
for this one, young man!
Mrs. Bruce tugs Jam toward the intersection we saw before.
They cross the street toward the corner where the Cathedral
sits.
Jam looks up at the cross on the steeple and GULPS with
trepidation.
JAM
Mom, what're we...?
MRS. BRUCE
Just keep your lying, heathenous
trap shut, Jeremiah.
They climb the steps to the cathedral passing a bulletin
board reading: Thank God It's Friday Mass, 6PM-7PM.
PARISHIONERS exit the beautiful church, shaking hands with a
PRIEST as they leave.
PARISHIONERS
What a wonderful mass, Father/So
inspirational, Father/Thank you.
PRIEST
Thank you/Come again next week.
Mrs. Bruce pulls Jam up to the priest.
PRIEST
Next mass is tomorrow morning, sister.
MRS. BRUCE
Can we talk, Father? I'm desperate.
My son was about to defy God by going
to that blasphemous KISS concert.
PRIEST
In that case, come right in.
Meanwhile, across the street...
Parked in front of the busy fast-food establishment we
recognize the two-toned Chevy Impala with luggage tied on
top. In the window we see Beth and her parents sitting at
one of the booths.
Out the window Beth looks across the street just as Jam,
Mrs. Bruce, and the priest enter the cathedral. Her face
drops.
BETH
Oh my God! That's Jeremiah!
DAD
Who?
BETH
Jeremiah Bruce from school. He and
his mom just went into that church.
He must be in Detroit for the concert.
Can I go say good-bye to him?
MOM
Beth, I am not letting you wander
the streets of Detroit after dark.
BETH
I'm not going to wander. I'm just
gonna go over there.
Beth points to St. Sebastian's.
BETH
He's with his mom.
DAD
Fine, as long as we know where you
are. But don't be long. We need to
be getting back on the road.
Beth is already out the door and halfway across the street.
Dad pats mom's shoulder.
DAD
She's probably got a little crush on
that boy.
Beth runs up to the cathedral and sneaks in.
Hawk walks down the sidewalk badgering everyone passing by
for a ticket, getting the same stock answer: "Suffer, dude!"
He stops and sits on a curb, lighting a cigarette. Behind
him stands the marquee for IT'S RAINING MEN, the male strip
joint. A DISCO SONG comes from inside. Just when it looks
like Hawk's given up, a VOICE is heard above.
VOICE
Hey, chief? Need a ticket?
Hawk can't believe his ears. He looks up at a greasy-looking
hybrid, part porn star, part used car salesman, the SCALPER.
SCALPER
Second row center, seventy-five clams.
Trying to act confident, Hawk takes out his money clip showing
the scalper twenty-five dollars.
HAWK
Dude, this is all I got.
SCALPER
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be
here for a while if you scare up the
extra gravy.
HAWK
Where the hell am I gonna scare up
that kinda gravy in one hour?
SCALPER
The easy way.
The scalper points over his shoulder and Hawk turns to see
three GIGGLING WOMEN exiting the strip joint. None are under
forty.
A sign below the bar's logo reads: Amateur Night Giveaway!
Guys Over 18 Only! Bare It All And Win 75 Bucks!
SCALPER
You look a little scrawny, but it's
worth a shot.
HAWK
I can't just walk in and take my
clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
SCALPER
Guess you don't want to see the
greatest show on earth. And in Detroit
no less. Well, take care, chief.
The scalper turns and Hawk grabs his arm.
HAWK
Dude, if it were dancing the way
Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my
best shot. I'd learn the steps and
practice in my spare time. But this...
tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's
way-too-spontaneous for me.
SCALPER
Yeah, you're probably too young
anyhow.
HAWK
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright.
That's not the problem... They're
playing disco music in there, man.
SCALPER
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink
heavily, your feet will know what to
do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do
you wanna dance or do you wanna see
KISS only on their album covers?
Hawk gets a look of resolve on his face.
SCALPER
You sure you'll have a ticket for
me?
SCALPER
You have my solemn oath as a public
servant.
Hawk turns and walks up to the door, hesitating before opening
it. Rummaging through his pockets, he pulls out a handful of
expired driver's licenses.
Choosing the one he thinks best suits himself, he walks in
with trepidation. The scalper sees someone else coming up.
SCALPER
Hey, chief, you need a ticket? Second
row center, seventy-five clams.
It's Trip.
TRIP
No thanks, dude. I'm beating my ticket
out of some poor, defenseless chump.
Trip exits FRAME.
SCALPER
What's happening to kids today?
Your typical 70's convenient store. Out front two SIX YEAR
OLDS in Star Wars tee-shirts play tug-o-war with a Stretch
Armstrong doll.
Trip stomps over grabbing them by their mini shirts. When he
tries to act tough, it's pathetic. Even six year olds aren't
afraid.
TRIP
Hey, you little twerps, gimme your
KISS tickets or I'll pop your fuckin'
faces in.
SIX YEAR OLD #1
We don't have any KISS tickets.
SIX YEAR OLD #2
Yeah, KISS sucks!
TRIP
I oughta kick your asses for sayin'
that.
He grabs the Stretch Armstrong and stuffs it in his pocket.
TRIP
But I'm in a hurry so I'll just take
this instead. Now scram.
The kids run away.
The full-to-capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of
SECURITY GUARDS.
Lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot
and looks at the back side of Cobo Hall just beyond the chain
link fence that surrounds the lot.
He crouches down and walks between two cars parked against
the fence, looking both ways. Seeing a guard's flashlight
beam, he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past, then
SIGHS eased.
LEX
(whispering to self)
I can't believe I'm actually
entertaining the notion of sneaking
in. I oughta have my cranium examined.
Lex finds a vertical break in the chain link. He lays on his
back, slides through, then stands on the other side of the
fence. He's at the edge of a weedy, littery field that also
happens to be poorly lit.
LEX
Whoa. Danger Will Robinson.
Spooked, he lays down again intending to slide back through
when a flashlight beam hits his eyes.
SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
Hey you! Get back in here!
Lex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the
other side of the fence. Panicking, he bolts deeper into the
field.
SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
You're not getting far, kid!
Lex double-times it as we hear the guard yelling into his
walkie-talkie.
SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
We got one just ran into the field
from the north lot!
The field gets darker as Lex closes in on Cobo Hall's well-
lit loading dock, where ROADIES empty the remaining bits of
KISS's monstrous set from an 18-wheeler. Other huge trucks
are parked nearby. There's a bustle of last minute activity.
Lex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to
huge trunks, keeping well hidden. He dodges roadies and avoids
being seen by OTHER GUARDS.
He slithers along side the 18-wheeler and nears the loading
bay. Up ahead some auxiliary speakers, drum kits, and
scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building.
SECURITY GUARD'S VOICE
There he is!
Lex spins. The security guard, flanked by two others, barrel
right for him.
LEX
Shit!
He dives rolls under the 18-wheeler. The three security guards
leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEMI
The three guards scramble to their feet and grab a SCRAWNY
BODY. They spin him around roughly.
SECURITY GUARD
Alright, wiseguy, you are so outta
here!
They suddenly realize they've got the wrong man. It's a
roadie.
ROADIE
Hey, what the fuck?
The roadie holds up his all-access laminate angrily.
ROADIE
Keep your paws to yourself, ya dumb
fuckin' apes.
The security guards look around frantically for Lex as other
roadies join in to defend their comrade.
SECURITY GUARD
Where'd he go? You see him?
No one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the
guards and up the loading dock ramp. They don't notice Lex
crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master.
Praying he won't be spotted, Lex holds his breath as he's
carried into the building and disappears.
JAM IN A JAM / KISS THIS
Lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff
of his neck. The security officers laugh and pat themselves
on the back as they hurry back in.
Lex peeks out the lid. The alley is dark and spooky. He jumps
out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest
GERMAN SHEPHERD that has ever lived. Its teeth are bared and
its black, wolf-like body is coiled, ready to spring.
GRRRRRRR!
Lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster. A GROWLING PITBULL
walks out from the shadows and joins the Shepherd.
LEX
(petrified)
Dogs! Why did it have to be dogs!
Then, a GROWLING DOBERMAN with a spiked collar emerges from
the darkness on the other side of the alley, its solid,
muscular form making the brick building nearby look like
jello.
Lex starts SLAPPING himself on the face.
LEX
Wake up, Lex! Wake up, man! This
part's gotta be a nightmare!
No luck. He stops, when several other DOGS emerge from the
shadows and gather behind the first three. These new mutts
immediately join in the GROWLING chorale. The Shepherd snaps
at Lex.
LEX
(to the heavens)
God, if you ever get me outta this,
I swear I will never masturbate again!
The pack BARKS even louder.
LEX
(to heaven again)
I REALLY MEAN IT THIS TIME!
Still trapped by the GROWLING, BARKING pack of dogs, Lex
searches nervously through the garbage behind him.
LEX
Okay, okay, you're pissed off. I can
see this. So... Maybe what we need...
ah-ha.
Lex holds up a worn-out, old frisbee.
LEX
Play some frisbee, poochies?
The pack just glares and SNARLS. He tosses the frisbee over
the packs' heads, but the dogs don't even acknowledge it.
They just keep BARKING and GROWLING.
Meanwhile, an unnoticed dog at the rear of the pack, a mangy
Basset Hound, turns its flat head to see the frisbee land on
the ground behind him. His tail starts to wag.
LEX
(exasperated)
Alright! I give up! I hearby and
forthwith defer my destiny to you
mutts. I may be an intelligent,
upright, walking, homo-fucking sapien,
but you fleabags are a force of
nature. So, I'm just gonna sit here
and wait for you to decide. If you
let me live, I thank you. If you
bite my head off, I'll die knowing I
did all I could. It's up to you.
Lex waits before the GROWLING, SNAPPING canines. Suddenly,
the Basset Hound runs up in front of the pack and drops the
frisbee at Lex's feet. Lex looks down at the floppy, wrinkly
dog, who wags its tail and PANTS furiously.
LEX
Well, how do you like that?
Lex starts to pet the hound, and one-by-one the rest of the
dogs shut-up. Shocked, Lex picks the frisbee up again and
throws it.
This time the entire pack bolts after the Whammo product.
Lex smiles, watching them fight for it in the air... in SLOW
MOTION... as the theme from "CHARIOTS OF FIRE" begins.
The black Shepherd finally grabs the frisbee in its mouth
and runs back toward Lex. It's soon joined by the rest of
the pack. That's right about when Lex realizes they aren't
going to stop.
LEX
Whoa! Whoa!
The dogs plow into Lex full-force knocking him into the
garbage. They surround him licking his face. Lex bursts into
unstoppable laughter.
Pulling himself up, he pets the dogs as they jump around him
wagging their tails and PANTING.
LEX
(baby talk)
You sonsofbitches could tickle a guy
to death, y'know that? Sure you do...
Sure you do...
Lex stops. He hears TALKING coming from inside the windowless,
brick building on the other side of the alley. He steps in
front of the pack and puts his fingers to his lips. They
obey, quieting instantly. He then tiptoes to a thin crack in
the brick wall. The dogs quietly follow.
Lex puts his eye to the crack and peers in.
DOLLY FROM the front end of a Jaguar XKE, Michigan vanity
plate reading: AMANDA.
TO its windshield, through which we see Hawk and Amanda
kissing in the front seat, clad only in their underwear.
Something like "ME AND MRS. JONES" plays on the radio. When
they separate, Amanda takes out a flask and offers it to
Hawk.
HAWK
Thanks.
He gulps some down and pulls the flask away COUGHING.
HAWK
What the hell is that?
AMANDA
Gin.
HAWK
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a
tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski
man myself.
AMANDA
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't
want to give you whiskey dick would
we?
HAWK
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Amanda plants a stocking foot on Hawk's crotch and rubs.
AMANDA
Well. Obviously no one you have to
worry about... Woody.
HAWK
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Hawk's eyes cross as he lets out a DEEP, OBNOXIOUS GROAN.
HAWK
...holy shit!
Amanda looks down at his crotch.
AMANDA
But you do know Premature Peter,
don't you? Shame, I just bought these
stockings.
Hawk has never been more embarrassed.
HAWK
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a
night. So far you've seen me and my
dick throw up.
(to the heavens)
What's next? Projectile diarrhea?
(beat, to Amanda)
Man. What a stud, huh?
AMANDA
Believe it or not, you still have a
way to go before you start competing
with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the
champion of lousy lovemaking. The
man who thinks he's the biggest and
the best... The man who thinks every
secretary, stewardess, and cocktail
waitress he fucks should lick his
feet for the honor. The man for whom
faking it was invented. Christ, if I
hadn't gotten pregnant with our son,
I would have never known I even had
sex with the prick.
She takes a healthy swig of gin, relishing its bitterness.
HAWK
You love him?
AMANDA
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
HAWK
No, I mean... you love your son?
AMANDA
More than anything in the world.
HAWK
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
AMANDA
He's a little spoiled, but I know he
does.
HAWK
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
She pats his shoulder.
AMANDA
You're sweet.
Hawk stares out the windshield.
HAWK
My mom died of a heart attack while
she was having me. Man, I wish I had
known her for even one day. If they
ever invent a time machine, that's
what I'm doing. Going back in time
to meet my mom. I'm gonna say, "Mrs.
Pitchford?... or Miss Williams,
depending on when I show up. You
don't know me, but I'm your kid from
the future. Just wanted to thank you
for the blue eyes, pug nose and for
tying the knot with a guy who didn't
mind diaper detail... Oh, and, uh...
cut down on the red meat, will ya?"
Amanda caresses Hawk's cheek. He turns with her hand and
kisses it. He takes her arm and begins kissing his way up to
her neck, her cheek, her mouth...
DR. LOVE TO THE RESCUE
Beth's parents wait in the running car as Jam and Beth share
a heartfelt good-bye outside the back door.
BETH
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from
Cleveland, right?
JAM
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I
could come up all the time.
BETH
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday
your band'll play there. It's a
college town, you know?
Jam takes her hands.
JAM
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't
I just say something a year and a
half ago? Man, think of how much
time we wasted.
BETH
Let's not think about the past. Let's
just think about from today on. I'll
never forget you, Jam.
JAM
Tell me about it. Church will never
be the same again.
They stare at each other for a really long time. Then, kiss.
BEEP. BEEP. Dad looks back out the window and CLEARS HIS
THROAT LOUDLY.
BETH
(flustered)
Coming dad.
(to Jam)
I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone.
Bye.
JAM
Bye.
She gets in the car. They both wave as the Impala turns a
corner out of sight. Jam is left alone still waving long
after she's gone.
The cashier, shoppers, and a gathering CROWD watch two cops
load the dazed man with the coat into a cruiser.
COP #1
(to cashier)
You wouldn't happen to know where we
could find this... Dr. Love, would
you?
CASHIER
It's company policy to hand over a
cash reward of a hundred and fifty
dollars to anyone who stops a robbery.
I gave him the money and he took
off.
The cops shrug and get into the cruiser.
COP #2
Okay, well, thanks anyway. And let
us know if you happen to see him
again. We'd like to ask him some
questions.
The cruiser takes off and the cashier stares at her mood
ring. It throbs red like a beating heart.
CASHIER
(sighing to herself)
If I see Dr. Love any time soon,
you're gonna have to wait till I'm
done with him first.
CAMERA TRACKS BACK QUICKLY AND SWINGS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.
We find Trip counting his money out to the little kid, Chongo,
and their two buds.
TRIP
...hundred forty, hundred fifty.
That's all I got.
The little kid puts the money in his pocket.
LITTLE KID
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I really wanted things
to work out for you, my weasly, dim-
witted friend. You got spunk.
(to Chongo)
Chongo, give him a fifty dollar
wallop.
Chongo reels back and...
TRIP
Oh, no... Please, look.
I...
THWAM! Right in Trip's face. Trip flies off his feet into
the Smiley Mart brick wall with a THUD. A bag of weed drops
from his jacket, then some uppers, a few sheets of acid, and
finally a can of beer rolls out.
CHONGO
Hey, the jerkoff's got drugs.
LITTLE KID
Consider it a bonus, Chongo.
Chongo laughs like an ejaculating gorilla as he and his two
buds scoop it all up. The little kid, Chongo, and the buds
leave Trip lying in a puddle of his own nose blood.
He pulls out Stretch Armstrong and looks at him fondly.
TRIP
(misty eyed)
At least I still got you, Stretch.
Trip looks up. The six year olds who he stole it from stand
close by having watched the whole humiliating exchange.
Licked, Trip tosses the doll to them. They both dash away
with it, giggling.
Christine sits in an idling taxi taking money from Lex, who
stands outside the window.
LEX
This oughta be enough to get you to
Disco Inferno, Christine.
CHRISTINE
Come with. It's not too late for you
to catch the fever.
LEX
No can do. But I made a promise to
get you to that disco, and we KISS
maniacs are men of our word.
Besides... you're pretty cool... for
a stella, I mean.
Christine takes his hand and writes something on his palm in
lipstick.
CHRISTINE
Here's my number. Tell me how cool I
am over the phone sometime. Okay?
She gives Lex a kiss then pushes him away.
CHRISTINE
(to CABBIE)
Disco Inferno, on the double.
The taxi SCREECHES away as Lex smiles and gets back into the
Volvo.
Hawk runs to the scalper across the street who's selling a
ticket to another KISS fan.
HAWK
Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! That better not be
the last ticket! I hope you have
another one for me!
The scalper sees Hawk and bolts down the street disappearing
around a corner. Hawk stops. He's lost him.
Hawk sulks to the now-familiar intersection where all four
landmarks meet. He takes one more look up the block at Cobo
Hall. Nearly all the KISS fans are inside. The streets are
almost deserted.
HAWK
Fuck me!
He sees someone out of the corner of his eye across the
street. It's Jam. Lex approaches the other corner. Trip comes
up to the forth corner. They all stop when they see each
other. Each standing on his own corner. They're all pissed.
They meet in the middle of the street as last minute CONCERT
GOERS hurry by.
HAWK
Any luck?
TRIP
Plenty, but it was all bad.
LEX
I found the Volvo.
HAWK
Tickets?
They all shake no.
HAWK
Well, dudes, the only way we're gonna
see KISS this tour is by some fuckin'
miracle.
Suddenly, a commotion up the street. A SURLY MOM yanks four
12 YEAR OLD BRATS dressed like KISS by the scruffs of their
necks. She's furious, they're CRYING.
SURLY MOM
How dare you sneak out of the house
like that! You had me worried to
death! Don't you know this is Detroit!
And for a degenerate band like KISS!
They're sick, sick, sick and oughta
be in jail with their vile antics!
She throws a wad of paper to the pavement as they pass our
four heroes. The dudes watch her pull the brats away.
SURLY MOM
Just wait until your father gets
ahold of you!
Jam, Hawk, Lex, and Trip turn and look at the crumpled wad
at their feet. It's an envelope. An ANGELIC SPOTLIGHT FROM
ABOVE highlights it.
LEX
No... You don't think...?
HAWK
Nah. Couldn't be.
They all shake their heads in unison resolved that it isn't.
Then, unable to control themselves, they dive for the
envelope. Jam tears it open. His trembling hand reaches in.
All their eyes focus like lasers on what's inside.
Jam pulls out four KISS tickets. Their jaws drop. Their eyes
bug.
JAM
It's a miracle! A miracle!
The boys are practically moved to tears. It's Divine
Intervention at its finest.
Suddenly, a greasy hand juts out of nowhere and grabs the
tickets. The boys look up shocked. They can't believe it.
ALL FOUR BOYS
ELVIS?!!
Yes, Elvis. Fire in his eyes. Mania on his mind. And tickets
in his hand.
ELVIS
(laughing hysterically)
Whose laughing now?! Whose laughing
now, ya little shits?! I told ya...
Over my dead body! Ha-HA-HAAA!
HAWK
(arms outstretched)
Take it easy, Elvis. Don't do anything
crazy. Just give me the tickets before
someone gets hurt.
TRIP
Hey, wait a minute! This ain't school
property! He's not the boss of us
here!
ELVIS
(crazed)
That's right. This ain't school.
It's not about school anymore. Now
it's personal.
LEX
Come on, Elvis. We was only kiddin'.
It's all in good fun. We run, you
chase. Cat and mouse. You know.
ELVIS
Boys, this time... I win!
Elvis stuffs all four tickets in his mouth and chews crazily.
In seconds, GULP. Elvis explodes into unhinged laughter as
he runs away zigzagged down the street.
Our boys are left dumbstruck and speechless. After a really
long pause...
JAM
Well... I still got my idea if anybody
will let me speak.
HAWK
(beaten)
Go ahead, Jam.
JAM
We all beat each other up, then,
once we're nice and bruised, we run
over to the ticket takers and say we
got mugged and our tickets were
stolen. They gotta let us in then.
They stand and think for a moment. Hawk's mouth curls into a
devilish grin.
Then, he lets out a gigantic "AIEEE!!! and slugs Jam. The
four boys brutally pummel one another in the middle of the
intersection. Punching. Kicking. Headbutting.
Two TICKET TAKERS are letting the last KISS fans in. They're
about to close the doors when our four bloodied and bruised
heroes come running up.
HAWK
Dude, you gotta let us in! Four
muggers just stole our tickets!
TICKET TAKER
(sceptical)
You expect us to believe that?
JAM
Look at us!
Trip points into the crowd of fans inside the auditorium
foyer.
TRIP
It was those assholes! They even
stole my wallet!
The ticket takers turn to see the little kid, Chongo, and
their two buds just going in. The ticket takers signal two
security guards who proceed to stop the four stunned kids
and confiscate their tickets. They find all the stolen dope
and Trip's wallet.
TRIP
Inside that you'll find my KISS Army
picture I.D. and a hundred fifty
bucks cash.
The security guards see he's right and break out the cuffs.
TRIP
(to little kid)
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I was really hoping
things would work out for you, my
weasly, midget friend. You got spunk.
The little kid for once is speechless.
Then the ticket taker extends his arm in SLOW MOTION into
COBO Hall as if to say "Entrez Vous." The four friends pause.
JAM
This is it!
They take a few slow steps almost as if they don't believe
it, then run like the wind into the auditorium.
DETROIT ROCK CITY
