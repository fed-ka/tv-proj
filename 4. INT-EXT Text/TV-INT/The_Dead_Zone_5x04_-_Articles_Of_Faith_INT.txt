                        A bunch of black kids shouting
                        "Black Power" beat the crap out
                        of two white high school geeks... 
                        and the cops refuse to classify
                        it as a bias crime.

          During which we push in tight on a COMPUTER SCREEN
          displaying the WEB FORUM of the "Aryan Nationalist
          Community."  Our speaker -- "Seattle Korps" is his web

44A THIRD BEDROOM WORKSPACE - DAY - ON A MONITOR

          Where a loop of violent computer game action plays in one
          window while another male teen's typed words appear in
          another.

                                        STORMTROOP 12 (V.O.)
                        Yo, yo, Seattle Korps.  Where you
                        been, dude?

          As we now INTERCUT between the three screens --

                                        SEATTLE KORPS (V.O.)
                        Feels like "The Twilight Zone"
                        but the yokels call it Maine.  My
                        Dad, in his infinite wisdom,
                        decided to ditch the Pacific
                        Northwest.  "Make a new start."

                                        BLITZKRIEG (V.O.)
                        Must be some local skins you can
                        hang with.

                                        SEATTLE KORPS (V.O.)
                        Yeah, only now he's threatening
                        to ship me to military school. 
                        You believe it?

                                        STORMTROOP 12 (V.O.)
                        Life's a bitch and then you die,
                        my brother.  Still, lethal skills
                        may come in handy.  Like Blitz
                        says, the War's coming.

          On which disturbing note, we pre-lap a somber adult voice --

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                        One cannot understand intolerance
                        without understanding its roots...

55A TV MONITOR ON A WALL

          It shows WILLIAM COTTON, 50, a smooth, charismatic speaker.

                                        COTTON (ON TV) (CONT'D)
                        Nowhere is this clearer than in
                        the chasm that the terrible events
                        of 9/11 opened between Muslims
                        and Christians, a chasm we've
                        just begun to bridge.

          As camera meanwhile pulls back, revealing rows of listeners
          seated in folding chairs in the crowded FOYER of:



          Packed with students, congregants, and members of various
          evangelical denominations and conservative Christian
          interest groups -- hence the overflow crowd.  Banners
          proclaim Faith Heritage's "Tenth Annual Interfaith
          Festival."  As camera enters the main space, Cotton is
          revealed speaking from the dais at the front.  (Note: *
          for his full speech, see Addendum C.)*

                                        COTTON
                        It wasn't Muslims who crashed
                        those planes, but extremists who
                          abandoned the central tenets of
                        their faith:  peace and love --
                        the same values we cherish.

            Applause, as camera now finds Johnny, Bruce and Purdy
          watching from the back.  Johnny claps dutifully.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who is he?

                        William Cotton.  A former Seattle
                          minister who's been getting
                          involved in local politics.

                                        COTTON
                                (in background)
                          ...There should never be another
                        excuse for Muslims and Christians
                        to go to war.

                                        PURDY
                                  (applauding)
                        A forceful speaker with an
                          important message:  tolerance.

          Johnny indicates a group of militant pro-lifers, their
          mouths taped, holding signs that say "Abortion = Murder".

                        I'm not sure everyone's getting
                        it.

                                        PURDY
                          Dialogue is the key.

          Bruce nods toward a thicket of TV and print reporters.

                        Not to mention press coverage.

                                        PURDY
                                  (gratified)
                        It's the first time the festival's
                        enjoyed this sort of media
                        attention.
                                (sees an aide gesturing)
                        I'm glad you stopped by, Johnny.

          As he moves off...

                                        BRUCE
                        I'd rather be bowling... enjoying
                        my morning off instead of...

          Then both his and Johnny's eyes alight on the same
            beguiling sight -- DANA BRIGHT, waving to them from where
          she stands with her TV news crew.

                                        BRUCE
                        Now it all makes sense.

          As Johnny smiles at him and heads over...


  77WITH DANA

          A cameraman and soundman are recording Cotton's speech,
          while a bespectacled, conservatively dressed YOUNG MAN
          stands nearby taking notes in a reporter's notebook.

                        If it isn't my favorite psychic.

          They hug, Dana holding it for a significant extra beat.

                        Boston isn't exactly New York, or
                        even Washington... but it's a

                        How'd you get roped into covering

                        My bosses remembered I started
                        out editing the student paper
                        here.

          Hearing which, the Young Man glances over.

                                        DANA
                          Speaking of which, I'd like you
                        to meet the current editor.  Josh
                        Blake, this is Johnny Smith and
                        Bruce Lewis.

          Josh nods to them but doesn't offer his hand; he's too
          busy taking notes.  His voice has a sardonic edge.

                                        JOSH

                          Reverend Purdy likes to drop your

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't believe everything you hear.

                                        JOSH
                          I don't.

          At which point Cotton finishes his speech to a STANDING
          OVATION.  Josh, however, seems to scoff at the applause.

                                        JOSH
                        "And they will deceive every one
                        his neighbor, and will not speak
                        the truth."

          Johnny looks at Dana, who shrugs.  They turn back toward --          DEAD ZONE: "Articles of Faith" - TEASER - 5/6/05 - PINK 6.


  88COTTON

          Who's making his way up the aisle flanked by a bunch of
          YOUNG MEN in jackets and ties, many with short haircuts,
          like a kind of junior secret service retinue.  People
          reach out to shake Cotton's hand, and as he approaches --


          THE CROWD

          surges toward Cotton, carrying Johnny with it, along with
          Josh Blake (but not Bruce), shoving them up against the
          breakwater of young men (including Darryl Cotton, who we
          won't recognize since we haven't seen his face yet).

          Johnny reacts as he's jostled by the crush of bodies. 
            Suddenly, there's a big WHOOSH and as we push in on --


  99JOHNNY'S FACE

          His eyes close, his head tilts from vertical to horizontal,
          and cuts and bruises appear as we MATCH, MOVE, MORPH TO:



          Dressed as someone else: a murder victim.  He's lying on
          his back.  Then someone drags him out of frame.  FLASH!  

            JOHNNY/MURDER VICTIM is propped against a wall.  FLASH! 

          WHITE PAINT is splashed across his body.  FLASH! 

          An OLD BRUSH paints letters on a wall.  We pull back to
          reveal the phrase "WHITE POWER!"  And, under it, another
          word: "RAHOWA!"  

          Then the brush is dropped in a puddle of white paint. 
          Off the paint, as tendrils of blood swirl into it... 


  1111BACK TO SCENE

          As Johnny finds himself left behind by the crowd surge,
          unable to tell who or what gave him the disturbing vision.

          As he exchanges a troubled look with Bruce...

                                        DANA
                        Well, with the help of copious
                        amounts of therapy, I managed to
                        break some bad habits.  Like
                        falling for very successful but
                        very manipulative men.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ah.

                        Don't worry, you didn't qualify --
                        on either count.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

                        Anyway, I decided to give my social
                        life a rest and focus on my career.

                        Most of my "likely suspects" either

                        Maybe we should check with them.

          other young staffers move to greet her, clearly star-

                          requirement for working in TV,
                        though it never hurts.

          Laughter from some of the other students, which irks Josh.

                        C'mon people!  We've got a paper
                        to put out.
                                (to Dana, suspicious)
                        Bad time for a "victory lap."

                                        DANA
                        I'm not here to poach a story, if
                        that's what you're worried about. 
                        We need your help.

          Josh remains wary.  Johnny takes the lead.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you have your doubts about
                        me, but my visions are real.  I
                        had one this morning of a murder. 
                        A hate crime.

          Josh is intrigued despite himself.

                        After Cotton's speech?

                        How'd you know?

          Josh considers, then leads them toward the layout table.

                                        JOSH
                        No poaching, right?

          He removes the blank sheet, revealing the next day's front
          page.  It's an expos  on William Cotton, with the headline
          "Interfaith Speaker has Supremacist Ties," and a picture
          of a SOMEWHAT YOUNGER COTTON speaking at a small rally
          with WHITE POWER SYMBOLS on banners behind him.

                                        JOSH
                        Meet William Cotton, the '90s
                          version, with a decidedly different
                        slant on "interfaith tolerance."

          Johnny and Dana are both pretty stunned.

                        photos.

          Dana nods, impressed, as she eyes the photos.

                        For someone who lectures on
                        tolerance, he's certainly kept
                        some odd company.

                        Why would Purdy bring him here?

                        I don't know.  I wanted to run
                        the story before giving anyone in
                        the administration a chance to
                        spin it.  But Cotton -- the new
                        guy -- has credentials.  He wrote
                        a book on Muslim-Christian
                          relations that made him a go-to
                        guy on the college speaking tour.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What if he's genuinely turned a
                        new leaf?

          Josh leads them into a small OFFICE, where his LAPTOP is
          open on his desk, displaying a web page.

                        Liberty Organization, the political
                        party Cotton started after he
                        moved here from Seattle. 
                          Superficially, it's clean.  But
                        scratch the surface...

          Johnny meanwhile tries to angle the screen toward him. 
          But as he does, MATCH, MOVE, MORPH around the laptop to --



          Pulling back from the same web page, to find Johnny

                          blocking God's will, right?  Is
                        that what it means to be a disciple

          Johnny turns off the ignition, still mulling that last
          vision.  Dana senses his distraction.

                                        DANA
                        Where are you?

                        Vision I had about Josh... and
                        his girlfriend.  Made me feel
                        like a peeping Tom.

                                        DANA
                        That hot, huh?

                        Just the opposite.  Didn't think
                        kids still held out 'til they got
                          married.

          She turns holding a VIDEO CAMERA, loads a fresh cartridge.

                        Well, you definitely wouldn't
                        call Faith Heritage a "party
                          school."  All those bibles can
                        work like a cold shower.  Me, I
                        was never much of a reader.
                                (hands him the camera)
                        Here.  You're my cameraman.
                                (off his reaction as
                                he handles it)
                        Don't tell me you have a problem
                        with a little bit of guile?

                        No, it's just I saw you making
                        out with your cameraman.

                        That was just...

                        Very funny.  I forgot what a pain
                        you can be.

          She gets out.



          Camera tracks past desks where a staff of young men in
          shirts and ties -- the same young men who flanked Cotton
          after his speech -- are preparing to quit for the day,
          approaching the door to an inner office --



          Where Cotton is mid-interview with Dana, as Johnny films.

                          Socially, it means promoting
                        tolerance.  "Live and let live."


          WITH JOHNNY

          As he films, at one point backing into a credenza, then
          dropping one hand to steady himself.  We can tell he's
          fishing for visions.  Apparently, without luck.

                        I was hoping you'd be more
                        revealing.

          Cotton eyes Johnny, smiles.

                        And I was hoping you'd explain

          Johnny lowers the camera, busted.  Dana covers --

                        Uh, my regular guy got sick.

                        It's my fault.  I should have
                        introduced myself.

          He holds out his hand but Cotton just eyes it suspiciously.

                                        DANA
                        There's a story running tomorrow
                        in the Faith Heritage student

                          organizations.

          Cotton sighs but surprisingly doesn't seem too upset.

          But as he rises to usher them out, Johnny's camera
            accidentally knocks over a PHOTO on his desk.  A photo of
          Darryl Cotton.  As Johnny picks it up --

          It could be the same place where Johnny saw the murder
          from the killer's POV, only now he seems to experience it
          from the victim's, as Darryl Cotton, sleeves rolled up to

          toward us with an ALUMINUM BAT.  We glimpse his expression

                        this stolen vehicle report from
                          Seattle.  Couple years ago.  Cotton

                        then called back the next day to

          Crude letters over it, spelling "White Power."

          Johnny gives Bruce a look... it's apparent the crime has
          affected him on a personal level... as Walt approaches
          with an evidence baggie, several items inside.

          Johnny reaches into the baggie, touches the edge of the
          wallet.  Nothing.  The second item is an old cross-shaped
          WAR MEDAL.  Johnny touches an edge.  We hear a WHOOSH,
          then he looks up.

          hand on his shoulder.  We hear a WHOOSH.  Johnny looks
          back at his friend for a beat, nods, then goes to work.

            disconsolately leafing through a family PHOTO ALBUM.  The

                          Enemies?  No.  He was a kind boy,
                        very shy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can't think of anyone who
                        might want to hurt him?

          Aziz's eyes go to Johnny.  He doesn't recognize him.

                        This is Johnny Smith.  He's helped
                        us in the past.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm very sorry for your loss.

          He takes a small envelope from his shirt pocket, empties
          it into his hand.  Aziz reacts to his father's MEDAL,
          then, filled with emotion, reaches for it.  As the medal
          connects their hands --


  4444VISION - PAST - EVENING

          Johnny finds himself sitting next to Rashid at the dining
          room table.  The family is gathered for a meal, along
          with an attractive and self-assured young Pakistani woman,
          ZAHRA, 19, who's seated on Rashid's other side.

                                        ZAHRA
                        We called it the "Fast-a-thon." 
                        More than 150 colleges
                          participated.  The idea was to
                        give non-Muslim students a "taste"
                        for the meaning of Ramadan, and
                        for what it's like for the poor
                        to go hungry.

          Aziz nods enthusiastically.  We realize this is an arranged
          date for Rashid, who shyly studies his food. 

                                        AZIZ
                        See, Rashid.  A college girl who's
                        also observant.

                                        SYEDA
                        Faith and good works.  The path
                        to salvation, as the Koran says.

                                        ZAHRA
                        I hear you're applying to college,
                        Rashid.  What are your top choices? 

          But as she smiles at him innocently, her hand secretly
          finds his thigh under the table.  Johnny notices, then
          notices Rashid react uncomfortably and brush her hand
          away.

                                        RASHID
                        I was hoping to find a school
                        close to home.

          He shares a pained private look with his sister.

                        Not too close, I hope.  The way
                        he eats, we can't afford him.

          The table laughs.  Rashid tries to muster a grin.  Off
          Johnny, observing his unease...


  4545BACK TO PRESENT

          As Johnny reacts, as puzzled by this vision as he was of
          the one he had of Josh Blake.  Meanwhile, Aziz clutches
          the medal, quietly overwhelmed.

                                        WALT
                        Mister Mahmud.  We'll find who
                        did this.  I promise.

          But it's a promise that ultimately offers little solace
          to this grief-stricken family.



          A hard-core POWER TRIO thrashes out a song on a cramped
          stage while a bunch of young punks and skinhead types
          MOSH in the pit.  Finding Johnny, Bruce and Dana making
          their way through the crowd.  Bruce shouts over the din.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, do I feel old!

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're cold?

                                        BRUCE
                        Old.  I feel old!

          Johnny nods as they approach a PUNK COUPLE drinking beers
          and making out.  Meanwhile, Dana continues on to the bar.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi!  You guys know a kid named
                        Darryl?  Darryl Cotton?

          The couple shrug, give Johnny's clothes a disdainful once-
          over, then go back to twining their tongues.  Bruce taps
          Johnny's shoulder, indicates Dana, who's waving them over
          to the bar, where she's been conferring with the tattooed
          and goateed bartender, BILLY.  Johnny and Bruce head over.

                                        DANA
                        This is Billy.  He knows Darryl.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is he here tonight?

                                        BILLY
                        Was.  Had to throw him out.
                                (re mosh pit)
                        He and his friends were getting a
                        little too aggressive.

          Johnny and Bruce eye the moshers, who appear to be engaged
          in an Ultimate Fighting free-for-all.  "Too aggressive"?

                                        BILLY
                        Those skinheads don't get it. 
                        The music's not about violence. 
                        It's about energy.
                                (re a side door)
                        Try the alley.

          As he moves off to deal with some clamoring patrons...          DEAD ZONE: "Articles of Faith" - ACT TWO - 5/10/05 - YELLOW 28.



          Now it's Darryl's father who grips his son's arm, incensed,
          as he shoves a Bangor Daily News front page in his face
          (all we can see clearly is a headline, which screams: 
          "Police Seek Hate Killer").  Camera pivots to show Johnny
            watching.

                                        COTTON
                        Tell me you didn't do this!

          But Darryl stubbornly refuses to deny it.

                                (re his tats)
                        It's what we stand for, isn't it? 
                        Or doesn't that matter anymore? 

          As he jerks his arm away, we again MATCH, MOVE, MORPH --


  5050BACK TO SCENE

          As Darryl jerks his arm away from Johnny --

                        Get off me, freak!

          He SHOVES him hard.  And now BRUCE loses it, shoving Darryl
          into another skin and sending them both sprawling,
            precipitating a BRAWL.  Bruce takes hits, along with
          Johnny, who tries to protect him.  DANA steps back.


          NEW ANGLE

          As other bystanders try to pull the combatants apart. 
          Suddenly the action FREEZES with a CLICK.  Then UNFREEZES. 
          Three more clicks, three more freeze-frames, the last one
          showing Bruce getting clocked from behind.

          Pull back to reveal Josh Blake standing behind a corner. 
          As he lowers a DIGITAL CAMERA to check the image...



          Dana rises anxiously from a couch as Johnny, a bit bruised
          and roughed up, enters from the foyer.  He nods, indicating
          the upstairs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I put a couple of butterfly band-
                        aids on his cut, got him to lie
                        down for a bit.

                        And you?

          Johnny holds up an ice pack.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My injuries are less serious.

          Johnny does.  She gingerly applies the ice to a bruise.

                        I seem to remember putting in for

          Johnny smiles, takes her hand.  But at that moment, her
          cell phone rings.  A distinctive melodic tone.

          She reluctantly fishes her cell from her purse, answers.

                        Yes, Gary, I know I've been off

                        Which is why I want us to nail
                        him.
                                (looking around too)
                        Thing is, you've already touched
                        just about everything there is to
                        touch.

          He has indeed.  As Johnny surveys the surroundings --


  5353MEMORY FLASH (BLACK AND WHITE) - JOHNNY AS THE VICTIM
          REELS BACK FROM A CLUBBING BLOW


  5454BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny orients himself, indicates to Bruce the place where
          he, as the victim, was standing in the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stand there and face away from
                        me, okay?

          Bruce does.  Johnny adjusts his own position behind him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The killer would've stood here.

          Camera tilts down to his feet as he shifts them.  Bruce
          glances back, observing this...

                                        BRUCE
                        You think "standing in his
                        footsteps" could trigger a vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe if I could find them.
                                (an idea)
                        Give me your flashlight.

          Bruce hands him the heavy metal MAG-LIGHT.  Johnny grips
          it by the base... we see his feet shift again, a wider
            stance... then we tilt up as he raises it high.  WHOOSH --


  5555CU:  THE MAG-LIGHT HAS SUDDENLY BECOME A CLUB-LIKE
          STEERING WHEEL LOCK (LIKE "THE CLUB"). AS IT SWINGS DOWN

                        Whoa!


  55A55ABACK TO SCENE

          Bruce has turned just in time to catch Johnny's downward
          swinging arm (his turn would coincide with the victim's
          turn just as he gets hit with the first blow).  They both
          take a breath.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It wasn't a baseball bat.
                                (beat)
                        Darryl Cotton isn't the killer.

          Off which...

          FADE IN:


          Purdy's doing spin control, quieting a hubbub of shouted
            questions from reporters, as Josh and his staff stand by.

                                        PURDY
                        Mister Blake has done us a service
                        by pointing out William Cotton's
                        ties to certain extreme elements. 
                        Past ties we were unaware of.

          More shouted questions:  "What about Cotton's son?" 
          "Darryl Cotton?"  "The murder?"  "Hate crime."  Etc.

                                        PURDY
                        Mister Cotton may have made a
                        break with his past.  But his
                        son's involvement with this crime
                        reminds us that our failure to
                        openly confess and atone for our
                        sins is what dooms them to be
                          repeated.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Nice sermon, Gene.

          Heads turn to see Johnny in the back, holding up a
            NEWSPAPER headline declaring:  "Cotton's Son a Suspect."

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's just one problem.  The
                        story isn't true.

          As the reporters react to this --

                                        JOSH
                        The paper stands by every word.

          Johnny sees a well-thumbed BIBLE on Josh's desk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Would you swear to that?  On this --

          But as he picks up the bible, WHOOSH --



          Josh holds the bible open and prays aloud, clearly upset. 
          Widen to reveal Johnny observing once again...

                        "For whosoever shall commit any
                        of these abominations, even the
                        souls that commit them shall be
                        cut off from among their people."


  57A57ABACK TO SCENE

          Johnny's puzzlement at this vision causes him to miss a
          beat before stammering --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darryl Cotton is not a suspect.

          Again the reporters react, again Purdy gets their ear --

                                        PURDY
                        I've been assured that the
                          Sheriff's department is seeking
                        him as we speak.

          On Johnny as he reacts, Purdy meanwhile continuing...

                                        PURDY (O.S.)
                        Tonight I'll lead a candle-lit
                        vigil, followed tomorrow by a
                        march in memory of Rashid Mahmud.



          Johnny and Bruce trail Roscoe through the busy station.

                                        ROSCOE
                        We've got a witness who put the
                        Cotton kid with the victim on the
                        night of the murder.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A witness?

                                        ROSCOE
                                (nods)
                        The news stories must've spooked
                        him.  Sheriff's got everyone out
                        shaking the trees.

          He stops at a desk to hand a clerk some paperwork.

                                        ROSCOE
                        If you came to us sooner, we
                          could've brought him in quietly.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't want to implicate him
                        until I was sure.

                                        ROSCOE
                        And now you're sure he's innocent?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a vision that he was involved
                        in an assault, but I don't think
                        it's this one.  I need to talk to
                        your witness.

          Off Roscoe's indecision...



          A quieter, barfly crowd.  A soundman setting up some amps
          on the empty stage.  Bartender Billy sets down some beers.

                                        BILLY
                          I already told the cops everything.

            Revealing Johnny and Bruce at the bar.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why'd you wait to come forward?

                                        BILLY
                        Didn't know the kid was a suspect
                        until I heard it on the news.

          As Johnny and Bruce exchange a look --

                                        BILLY
                        Hey.  All I know is that they
                        left together.
                                (points to a stool)
                        The other kid sat right there.

          As Johnny touches the bar stool... MATCH, MOVE, MORPH --



          Once again in full swing, the house band wailing.  It's
          the night of the murder.  Johnny watches Rashid sitting
          alone and looking out of place as he sips a soft drink. 
          Rashid checks his watch, looks relieved, and heads for
          the side door...

          ...just as Darryl Cotton crosses from the mosh pit.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Articles of Faith" - ACT THREE - 5/11/05 - GREEN 38.


    61CONTINUED:61

          He throws a sweaty arm around the young man's shoulders,
          pulling him close in a menacing, taunting way.  Rashid's
          shoulder bangs into the door frame as Darryl laughs. 
          Johnny notes the bartender observing what indeed could
          look like the pair exiting together --


    6262INTERCUT:  JOHNNY - PRESENT

          As he gets off his bar stool, heads to the side door --

                                        BRUCE
                        John?


  6363IN THE VISION... JOHNNY ALSO APPROACHES THE DOOR, MOVING
          THROUGH THE CROWDED NIGHT-TIME BAR...


  6464IN REALITY... JOHNNY PAUSES AT THE DOOR, TOUCHES THE
          FRAME WHERE RASHID'S SHOULDER BRUSHED IT --


    6565SUDDENLY, THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN, DAY BECOMES NIGHT AGAIN,
          AND RASHID AND DARRYL ARE EXITING TOGETHER INTO --



          Johnny's continuing his explanation to Walt, Bruce by his
          side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ... Rashid went around back and
                        got into a car.

          For some reason, Walt looks dubious...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm telling you, Walt, Darryl
                        didn't do it.

                        John... there have been some
                          developments while you were out.

  69A69AA SHORT TIME LATER - ON DANA DOING ANOTHER STAND-UP

                                        DANA
                        This is Dana Bright reporting
                        live with a WPKV exclusive.  Darryl
                        Cotton, sought by police in
                        connection with the murder of a
                        local teen-ager, has surrendered
                        and agreed to make a public
                        statement.  Darryl?

          As she holds the microphone, we reveal Darryl standing
          beside her, looking slightly nervous.

                                        DARRYL
                        I've been accused of murder. 
                        They're calling it a "hate crime." 
                        Well, if it's hate to stand up
                        for what you believe in, then I
                        plead guilty.

            Reactions as Johnny, Bruce and Walt realize that Darryl
          is apparently confessing on live television.  Nor are
          they the only people reacting as we cut to:



            Bartender Billy and patrons watch a set above the bar
          (it's still too early for the band but the club is slightly
          more crowded) --

                        was a Pakistani kid, an immigrant. 
                        But I don't hate immigrants.  How
                        could I?  I'm descended from
                          immigrants.

                        Now the people we call "immigrants" --
                        Asians, Arabs, Mexicans -- don't
                        come here to build but to exploit,
                        to grab what they can for
                          themselves.

                          Unbelievable.

          But we sense a deeper sense of surprise, and puzzlement,
          in his private reaction...



          Darryl's father watches, stunned at what he's hearing: 
          the sound of his nascent political career unraveling.

                        and all the other minorities that
                        only care about tearing this
                        country down.  So do I feel hatred? 
                        Yes...

                        who'd turn a blind eye while they
                        drag us all down into the muck
                        they came from.

          And now he stares at the camera, nervousness gone, almost
          fierce in his determination.

                        My father taught me that this is
                        war.  You choose a side, or die.

          Dana, like everyone else in the station, is too stunned
          to realize he's finished.  Finally, Walt nods to a deputy --

                        Cuff him.

          The room erupts with noise, ringing phones.  Walt grabs
          the cuffed Darryl, leads him by a shaken Johnny --

                                        WALT
                          Whaddaya think, John?  He still
                        sound innocent?

          Johnny just shakes his head.  But as Walt roughly leads
          Darryl away, Darryl's shoulder brushes Johnny.  WHOOSH --



          Tumult still.  Johnny and Bruce trail Walt, as Dana's
          crew breaks down.

                        of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's wrong here.

                        Look, you said he was involved in
                        an assault.  Maybe your visions
                        just mixed up the particulars.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know what I saw... and what I
                        didn't see.

          Johnny reacts curtly.

                        I don't have time, Dana.

                        Darryl found me, Johnny.  He asked
                        to make that statement.

          But Johnny still feels burned; he can't bring himself to
          trust her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me.

          He goes after Walt who's moving off...

                        being taken out of here dead.

          sister and with his family.  Revealing Tahmina, Johnny

                        You two were very close.

                                (nods)
                        When we came to America, neither
                        of us spoke English.  We only had
                        each other.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So he'd never keep something from
                        you?

          Tahmina is immediately uneasy...

                          Tahmina, I'm a psychic.  When I
                        was here before, I had a
                          "vision"... of what I think was a
                        date your parents arranged for
                        Rashid.  The girl was very smart
                        and attractive, but he didn't
                        seem too interested.  Then he
                        looked at you...

          Silence.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Tahmina, was there anything you
                        didn't tell the police about your
                          brother?  A girlfriend he didn't
                        want anyone to know about?

          A beat, then she shakes her head.

                          Tahmina, was your brother gay?

          Tahmina nods.

                        Our parents would never understand. 
                        But he was going to tell them
                        anyway.

          Johnny looks through the bars at Darryl, who glares back.

                                        DARRYL
                          I confessed.  Isn't that enough
                        for you?

          But his bark has lost some of its menace; he's acting his
          part now, covering the turmoil in his feelings.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know who killed Rashid.  Right
                        now I'm more worried what may
                        happen to you.

                                        DARRYL
                        Me?

          He approaches, nods scornfully to the door Roscoe's waiting
          behind.

                                        DARRYL
                        They got me on a suicide watch. 
                        You think I'm suicidal?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why else would you confess to a
                        capital crime?  Unless you wanted
                        to punish yourself.  Or someone
                        else?  Your father maybe?

          Johnny's words cut through Darryl's defenses.  A beat.

                                        DARRYL
                        I've said all I have to say.

          But Johnny can see he's wavering.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the beauty of it.

          He loosely grips the bars...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't have to say anything.

          Johnny grabs him.  Darryl is caught off-guard.  WHOOSH!



          Johnny crouches near two black teens -- the young CAR
          THIEF from the license photo and a friend -- who are
            stripping a late-90s Mustang when A HALF DOZEN WHITE GUYS
          in stocking masks, armed with bats and clubs, burst in.  


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Articles of Faith" - ACT FOUR - 5/11/05 - GREEN 51.


    95CONTINUED:95

          The friend drops a tool and runs, jumping up on a car and
            wriggling out a small window (or just escaping through a
          back exit) before one of the white guys can grab him. 
          But the car thief trips over a jack, falls and twists his
          ankle.  He groans, clutching it, as a few of the masked
          men start to advance.  But their leader holds up a hand --

                                        MASKED MAN
                        No! 

          He peels off mask; it's William Cotton.  The others peel
          off their masks, and we see that one of them is Darryl
          (looking slightly younger).  His father hands him a bat. 
          When Darryl hesitates --

                                        COTTON
                        Do it.

          Darryl takes the bat, starts to advance slowly.  A ROARING
          fills his head -- a mix of "hatecore" music and supremacist
          chants, the word "RaHoWa" a repeated refrain.

          Finally, his face a frightening mix of revulsion and anger,
          Darryl raises the bat and screams as he swings it down!


          ANGLE - VISION JOHNNY

          Wincing at the sight and sounds of several O.S. blows.


          NEW ANGLE

          As Darryl backs away with that same horrified, almost
            disbelieving expression we saw on Josh's face after he
          murdered Rashid.  Cotton steps up to his son, taking the
          bat from him and putting a hand on his shoulder.

                                        COTTON
                        It's a war, son.  You choose sides
                        or you die.

          Off Johnny...



                                        JOHNNY
                        Choose sides or you die.

          Darryl pulls himself away, his expression once again
          stricken...

                        I hated him for that.  I hated
                        myself.  And now he wants to send
                        me away, like none of it ever
                          happened?

                        Then make it right.

          Darryl looks at him, helpless and vulnerable for the first
          time... as Roscoe enters with William Cotton and a lawyer.

                                        COTTON
                        Get away from my son!

          Roscoe unlocks the cell.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's going on?

                        He got a court order dismissing 
                          Darryl's confession as "coerced."

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Cotton)
                        You can't take him out of here.

                                        COTTON
                        The hell I can't.  Get out of my
                        way.

          As Darryl throws him a last look before being led out...



          Johnny wanders in looking a little dazed.  Bruce and Dana
          cross to him...

                                        DANA

                        that my camera crew's lurking

                        You're even harder on yourself.

                        I just wanted to say goodbye.

                        It was good seeing you.

          Dana cocks a hip, studies him with that familiar knowing
          smile.

                        their faith:  peace and love --
                        the same values we cherish.

                        These were not men bent on a holy*
                        task on behalf of a vengeful deity,*
                        but lost souls who had forgotten*
                        the true dictates of their own*
                        sacred text, the Koran.  Just as*
                        we Christians say, "thou shalt*
                        not kill," so the Koran teaches*
                        that God has sanctified life, and*
                        that it is a sin to take it. *
                        This is important, because if we*
                        can keep in mind the beliefs we*
                        share, then we can learn to*
                        understand our differences.  And*
                        with that understanding comes*
                          another:  There should never be*
                        another excuse for Muslims and
                        Christians to go to war.

                        There are those in the Muslim*
                        world who would say that we in*
                        the West have embarked on another*
                          crusade.  There are other voices*
                        within our own society that would*
                        argue the opposite:  that it is*
                        Islam that seeks to remake the*
                        world in its own image, and is*
                          therefore a threat that must be*
                          contained or destroyed.  In both*
                        cases, these are arguments born*
                        of fear, a fear that in turn is*
                        the result of ignorance.  A general*
                        will say "know your enemy"; I say*
                        "know your fellow man."  Know his*
                        words, and the meaning of those*
                        words.  A word, for example, such*
                        as "Jihad."*

                        Most of you assume that it means*
                        a "holy war" against infidels. *
                        But a true Muslim scholar will*

                        one -- a struggle for*
                          enlightenment.  This "holy war"*
                        isn't one we need to fear, but*
                        rather one we need to share in. *
                        Share in as we question the depth*
                        of our own religious convictions. *
                        Share in as we ask ourselves how*
                        far we're willing to go to banish*
                        fear and ignorance and replace*
                        them with acceptance and*

                        "How far?" I ask you now.  "How*

                        For if in the end we can face the*
                        demons that lurk in our heart,*
                        then we can look into a stranger's*
                        heart and see not a reflection of*
                        our own fear, but instead a kindred*
                        soul, beloved of God, as we all*
                        are.  I ask you, my friends, let*
                        us join our hands and bridge this*
                        chasm together.  Banish the*
                          darkness that once threatened to*
                        claim us and embrace the light. *

                        If I can leave you with one word*
