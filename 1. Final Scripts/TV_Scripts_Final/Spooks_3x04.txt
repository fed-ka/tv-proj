      PATRICIA NORTON is going through some papers. DRIVER glances 
      at her in his rearview mirror. She looks up puzzled, takes 
      her bearings.

                    way to my hotel.

      He doesn t reply. Just his hard eyes meet hers in the mirror. 
      Her expression changes to one of terror. She scrabbles at the 
      window which doesn t open, takes out her mobile. CHAUFFEUR

      watches impassively. He knows she won t be able to call. Car 
        accelerates. No reception, she cries out in frustration and 
      the mobile falls from her hand. She starts to bang helplessly 
      on the windows.

      ON SCREEN: Question Time type debate and speaking is NICHOLAS

                    houses bulldozed, a great big 
                    security fence that cuts you off 
                    from work and you wonder why the 
                      Palestinians are angry? 

      Another panel member intervenes. We will know him later as 
      DAVID SWIFT.

                                  CATHERINE (V.O.)
                    The day I finished my film, a 
                    volunteer from this Campaign was 
                    escorting Palestinian farmers to 
                    their fields. He was shot by the 
                    Israeli Defence Forces...

      HARRY, who is the only one standing holds onto the wall, 
      staring at the screen. DANNY freezes image of Catherine.

                                  DANNY
                    OK, I ve been accessing the 
                    computer of the Finance and 
                      Monitoring Officer...

      Tails off as he becomes aware that nobody is listening. 

      They re staring at HARRY.

                                  ZOE
                    Harry? Is something wrong?

      HARRY is still staring at the TV.

                                  HARRY
                      Catherine.

      They turn back to the screen, the face of Catherine Townsend.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Thought she was in Tel Aviv. 

                                  ZOE
                    You know her?

      A beat.

                                  HARRY

                      Catherine s my daughter.

                                  ZOE
                          (stunned)
                    Yes but her surname...

                                  HARRY
                    Her mother s. She took it after the 
                    divorce.

      Team exchange another stunned look. What divorce?

                                  ADAM
                    Didn t you know your daughter was 
                    mixed up with the Palestine Freedom 
                    Campaign, Harry? 

      HARRY is clearly taken aback by this obvious question.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                      No...well...you could always count 
                    on Catherine to find the bird with 
                    the broken wing. Emotion over 
                      intellect, suppose you have to 
                    expect that in a girl. Brother was 
                    the one with the brains...

      ADAM glances at ZOE who raises an eyebrow. 

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Shall we crack on?  

      DANNY is still staring at HARRY.

                    caught? Think I might have just the 
                    man.

      A few smiles exchanged.

                                                                                              *
                    proposal you helped me with...

                                  ASHWORTH
                    I thought external involvement in 
                    the intifada was an excellent idea.
                          (beat)
                    He s the academic though.

                                  ZOE
                      I wondered if you d take a look at 
                    it and see if you think he s being 
                      reasonable.

                                  ASHWORTH
                    OK, hand it over.

      ZOE reaches in her bag, takes out a stack of papers and the 
      Daily Herald which she  accidentally  lets fall. ASHWORTH 
      frowns.


                                  ASHWORTH (CONT D)
                    You read that rubbish?

                                  ZOE
                    Always best to know what your enemy 
                    thinks.

                                  ASHWORTH
                    I should sue David Swift for some 
                    of the lies he s allowed them to 
                    print about the Campaign. Our 
                      volunteers have been killed over 
                    there, Laura.

                                  ZOE
                    Didn t you say in the meeting you 
                    were going to ask questions about 
                    him in parliament?

                                  ASHWORTH
                    I have information from good  
                    Middle East sources about some of 
                    his connections.

                                  ZOE
                    What kind of connections?

                                  ASHWORTH
                    Bad connections. 

      He glances at his watch.

                                  ASHWORTH (CONT D)
                    We ll talk more tomorrow. I really 
                    have to go now.

                    OK, but I know nothing about this.

      HARRY s staring at two cardboard files. One (blue) reads 
      CHILDREN - GRAHAM and the other (pink) reads CHILDREN - 
      CATHERINE. He studies some photos in the CATHERINE file. They 
      are of a little girl, a teenager, a young student on 
      graduation day. He takes out a swimming certificate, a school 
      exercise book, a kid s painting. The painting is of a stick 
      child holding the hand of a pot-bellied man. ME WITH MY 
      DADDY. A small smile crosses HARRY s face. He picks up a 
      single piece of paper with the photocopy of a poem A Prayer 
      for my Daughter.

      ADAM does a hands-clasped thank-you gesture and makes his way

                    copied from David Swift s office. I

                    Well that should have crowds 
                    flocking to the cinemas.

      DANNY uncomfortable and not quite sure what to say.

                    I d like you to talk to her.

      DANNY nods. HARRY almost as afterthought.

                    You may need to wander a little off-
                    piste so she doesn t get 
                      suspicious. But be careful, 
                    Catherine can be very tricky.

                    I thought that was great.

                                  CATHERINE
                      Scorcese s overrated.

                    I m wrong?

      She gives him an amused look and starts to walk away. He runs 
      after her.

                    Great. Where do you want to go?

      She laughs at this cheekiness.

                                  CATHERINE
                    That doesn t mean yes.

      She hesitates, glances at her watch.

                    So. The suicide note they found 
                    with Patricia s body blamed the 
                    pressure of an extra-marital

                      conventional or otherwise. You re 
                    out of your depth.

      He laughs dismissively. ADAM  walks away but he looks 
      isolated and vulnerable. Has he just stepped out of his 
      depth?

                    CLEARLY DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT?

      He is staring at ADAM.

                                  ADAM
                    It wasn t a rash move.

      Zoe gives Adam a look.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    You shake the tree and see what 
                    flies out. If their agent in the 
                    Campaign even twitches as a result 
                    of my conversation with Swift we ve 
                    found an asset we can use to 
                    destroy both Swift and the November 
                      Committee. 

                                  HARRY
                    I KNOW what you re doing Adam but 
                    it s bloody dangerous and if 
                    anybody gets hurt there will be 
                      consequences.

                                  ADAM

      HARRY stares at him for a moment and then walks out. They 
      look at ADAM. He appears completely calm.

                    We need to watch over him. Seeing 
                    his daughter was a big shock. But 
                    the last thing we need is for Harry 
                    to go all King Lear on us right

                    I ll ask you again. Why do you need

                      interrogation technique.

                    I have techniques you can only 
                    dream about.

                                  ZOE
                    Oh please I m so scared.

      He flops down beside her.

                                  WILL
                    You don t think I could be an MI5 
                      interrogator?

                                  ZOE
                    No. Anyway I like you as a 
                      photographer.

                                  WILL
                    Like?

      She flushes and turns away. He turns her face to hers.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Like?

      She gets up.

      In contrast to the evening when DANNY was in there alone, the 
      offices are a hive of activity. Young people are arguing and 
      laughing. There are posters advertising films, marches and 
      other solidarity events. DANNY is watching CATHERINE as she 
      chats to NICHOLAS ASHWORTH. She checks her watch and signals 
      that she has to go. He gets up and follows her across the 
      office.

                                  DANNY
                    Hey, Catherine, you ve been to

      She pauses.

                    I lived in Tel Aviv. It was...I was 
                    really happy there.

                    Well there were personal reasons.

      She checks her watch again.

      She jolts and turns to face him.

      We see CATHERINE walking down the street and from a distance 
      of about a hundred yards HARRY following her.

                    location, Bravo Two?

      He pulls off headphones and leaps out of the van.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      HARRY is right behind CATHERINE. If she turns, she will see 
      him but instead she goes to open door where for a second she 
      catches a tiny glimpse of him reflected in the glass door. 
      She whips round but there s nobody there. Shakes her head and 
      goes into

                      occasions. It s an excuse for 
                    risking the lives of others for our

                    And you are the dark horse.

                                  WILL
                    I was just choosing the right time 
                    to tell you.

      ANDY grabs the bottle of champagne from ZOE

                                  ANDY
                    Better late than never. I ll get 
                    the glasses.

                                  WILL
                    Thought you were just leaving.

                                  ANDY
                    Hey, I can t normally afford a 
                    bottle of Bollinger.

                                  WILL
                    You can t normally afford your bus 
                    pass.

      WILL gives ZOE an apologetic look. ANDY moves to kitchen area 
      and starts to look for glasses.


                                  ANDY
                    So what do you do, Zoe.

      INT. CATHERINE S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 4. 1930
5050

      DANNY is nosing about in CATHERINE s living room. She s 
      looking through some videos trying to find the right one. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Where s the one about the Siege at 
                    the Church of the Nativity...

      DANNY inspects the books, picks up a photo of CATHERINE with 
      a middle-aged woman. 

                                  DANNY
                    Who s this? 

                                  CATHERINE
                    My mum.

      He nods and replaces it. Then jumps as he sees another photo 
      of CATHERINE and a man in uniform. GILAD LASKER.

                                  DANNY
                    And this?

                                  CATHERINE
                    That s Gil.

                                  DANNY
                    Unusual name.

      She catches his look.

                    They re not all bad.

                                  DANNY
                    They usually are when they re in

      A beat. She looks down as if considering and then up at him 
      again.

                                  CATHERINE
                    It s no big deal.

                                  DANNY
                    No big deal? He might have given 
                    the orders to shoot Campaign 
                      volunteers or bulldoze houses.

                                  DANNY
                    You were seeing somebody from 
                    Israeli military intelligence?

      obvious point here. CATHERINE looks down and then back up at 
      him again.

                                  CATHERINE (CONT D)
                    All right, you must swear not to 
                    tell anybody what I m about to tell 
                    you.

                                  CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Before I left Tel Aviv, Gil told me 
                    about a group of far-right Israeli 
                      extremists called the November 
                      Committee. They have friends in 
                    very high places and that s what 
                    I m really trying to make a film 
                    about.

                                  DANNY
                    Never heard of them.

                                  CATHERINE
                    That doesn t mean they don t exist. 
                    Gil hated them and he told me that

                    Doesn t matter. I called this guy 
                    and arranged to meet him for lunch 
                    with a hidden camera. Told him I 
                    was a convert, that I could get 
                    lots of information about Nicholas 
                    Ashworth, even give him footage of 
                      volunteers.

                    few times.

                    And somebody as powerful as him

                                  CATHERINE
                    Perhaps I should have somebody stay 
                    with me.

      She s close and DANNY is paralysed.

                                  DANNY

      A mobile ringing. DANNY blinks, opens his eyes, looks at 
      Catherine lying asleep beside him. Closes them again. What 
      have I just done? Answers mobile.

      She nods and he throws her to the floor and exits fast. 

                                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

      DANNY is standing outside looking at CATHERINE who s inside 
      by the bar. He looks utterly miserable. This is the last time 
      things will ever be the same between them. She looks up at 
      him, waves and smiles. He holds up his hand hesitantly but it 
      is more as if he is bidding her farewell. Then he walks into 
      the bar.

                    It wasn t like that.

      She holds up a hand.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I trusted you. And I liked you.

                    Oh sure.

      She gets up and walks out. DANNY follows her.

                                  CATHERINE (CONT D)
                    You work for my father!

      They go out into the street, he is half-running after her. 

                                  DANNY
                    Please...

                                  CATHERINE
                    It would bring you a whole world of 
                    pain if I told him what we did 
                                                                                              *
                    wouldn t it?

      She breaks into a half-run, turns a corner and walks slap 
      into the arms of a man coming in the opposite direction.

      She screams in terror. 

      The man holds her tightly. It s HARRY and behind him is ADAM. 

      EXT. SMALL PARK - DAY 6. 1330
6161

      A tiny neighbourhood park with a goldfish pond and HARRY and 
      CATHERINE sitting on a bench. She is at the end of the bench 
      as far away from him as possible. ADAM and DANNY stand guard 
      at the park gates.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Seen Graham recently? You remember 
                    your son? The one with the brains 
                    as you always said.

                                  HARRY
                    I just wanted him to do well.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Well he isn t doing very well is 
                    he?

                                  HARRY
                    No.

                                  CATHERINE
                          (bitter sarcasm)
                    What do you want from me? You want 
                      absolution? I forgive you. I m a 
                    grown woman, I don t play  blame 
                    the parents  any longer. Now can I 
                    go?


                                  HARRY
                    You said I might as well be dead.

      The penny drops and she glares across at DANNY who is luckily 
      out of range. He is glancing nervously into the park 
      terrified that she is telling HARRY they slept together. She 
      points at Danny which makes him even more nervous.
                                                                                              *

                                  HARRY
                    Don t blame him.

                                  CATHERINE

                                  HARRY
                    I made him wear a wire because I 
                    wanted to hear your voice. It was 
                    the only way...

      HARRY takes out the pink folder marked Children - Catherine.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    I wanted to show you this.

                                  CATHERINE
                    A file on me. Makes sense.

                                  HARRY
                    I was proud of you.

                                  CATHERINE
                    You had a funny way of showing it.

      She takes the file and starts to flick through the photos, 
      pictures and swimming certificates.

      HARRY has clearly been making a supreme effort at self-
      composure but he s silently weeping. She stares at him 
      helplessly.

                    Look at that. I hate that. This 
                    isn t the kind of park for a big 
                    dog like that.

                                  HARRY
                          (wipes his eyes)
                    It s trampling all over the bloody 
                    crocuses as well.

      Father and daughter scowl at the dog owner who remains 
      impervious.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Can t you drag him to the Tower in 
                      a handcart?

      He laughs.

                                  HARRY
                    Who did you tell that your father 
                    worked for British Intelligence.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Only Nicholas Ashworth. 

      HARRY frowns. That just doesn t make sense.

                                  CATHERINE (CONT D)
                    We d better go. It s too windy.

      HARRY and Catherine get up and walk across the park towards 
      DANNY and ADAM. DANNY almost shaking, about to issue a 
      disclaimer. HARRY pats his shoulder.


                                  HARRY
                    Thanks, Danny. I ll walk my 
                    daughter home.

      They pass by. DANNY watches as if longing for her to turn 
      round. She doesn t.

      People are milling around eating with plates of food. An MI5

      We focus on the bar where SWIFT is sitting with a woman whose 
      beauty has been turned up to full volume. It s our food 
      critic and sexual connoisseur.

                                  ADAM
                    He s interested.

                                  ZOE
                    How do you know?

                                  ADAM
                    She just touched her right ear. If 
                    it had been her left ear, it would 
                    have meant  no chance .

      They watch for a bit longer. FIONA laughs and touches Swift s 
      arm.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    He s going to get her a drink.


      Sure enough, SWIFT beckons to the barman. The waiter brings 
      the drinks. FIONA takes the cocktail stick out of her martini 
      and lets SWIFT suck the olive from it.

                                  ZOE
                    What does that mean?

                                  ADAM
                    It means she s taking the piss.

      FIONA takes out a small compact case. Puts some lipstick on.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Good, good.

                                  ZOE
                    So?

                                  ADAM
                    He s hinting about sex.

                                  ZOE
                    You re very matter of fact about 
                    that!

                                  ADAM
                    Well, I m hoping that on one of 
                    these operations I can finally get 
                    rid of her.

                                  ZOE
                    Sure you are.

      His eyes narrow at the screen. FIONA moves her glass.

                                  ADAM
                    She s taking him upstairs.

      FIONA gets up, smooths down her skirt, smiles at her target.

      They both watch another screen of a hotel corridor. Half way 
      down the corridor, FIONA stops SWIFT and right under the 
      camera, engages in a long passionate kiss. At one point, it 
      almost looks as if she is grinning up at the camera over his 
      shoulder.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Hey, David, how does it feel to

                      newspaper?

      FIONA leads SWIFT by the hands to a hotel room, opens the

      DAVID SWIFT is sitting with RICHARD HOLLINS - ASHWORTH s 
      lover.

                                    RICHARD
                    It s our first anniversary tonight. 
                    He thinks we re going to a 
                      restaurant.

                                  SWIFT
                    We ve sorted out the finances so 
                    that he appears to have a motive 
                    for suicide.

                                    RICHARD
                    I ll do it in the Campaign offices.

                                  SWIFT
                    Good. It s possible MI5 may still 
                    be following me so take measures.

      RICHARD puts a baseball cap back on.

                                    RICHARD
                    What about the girl?

                                  SWIFT
                    We re adding her to the list.
                                                                                              *

                    What s her final destination?
                                                                                              *

                    You just worry about Ashworth.
                                                                                              *

      RICHARD leaves. SWIFT takes out a lap-top and types in the 
      name CATHERINE TOWNSEND. Her photo comes up. There is a field 
      marked Destination. Slowly, SWIFT types in the word JENIN.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    She was called Phoebe. Everybody 
                    loved her. She was funny, clever, 
                    she had a great life ahead of her. 
                    She boarded a number 26 bus in 
                      Jerusalem. Two stops later a Hamas 
                    suicide bomber joined her.


                                  ASHWORTH
                    Who are you?

                                    RICHARD
                    That doesn t matter. Phoebe was 
                    killed by the people you support.

                                  ASHWORTH
                      Understand. Not support.

                                    RICHARD
                    Weasel words.

                                  ASHWORTH
                    Nobody will believe I committed 
                    suicide.

                                    RICHARD
                    They will when I explain that you 
                    were depressed recently. And scared 
                    that a newspaper might discover 
                    your secret account with funds from 
                    a Saudi businessman.

                                  ZOE (O.S.)
                    But how will you explain me?

      RICHARD spins around as he sees ZOE standing in the doorway.

                    Don t come any nearer, Laura.

      Richard takes out a gun and points it at Zoe.
                                                                                              *

      ASHWORTH stares horrified at her.

                                    RICHARD
                    Sit down over there.

      ZOE goes and sits by a desk. RICHARD moves the chair a little 
      with his foot. ASHWORTH closes his eyes. He s seconds from 
      death.

                                  ASHWORTH
                    I m truly sorry about your sister.

                                    RICHARD
                    She was wearing a red skirt that 
                    morning.

                                  ZOE
                    It can t just go on and on, 
                    Richard. An eye for an eye. 

                                    RICHARD
                    Spare me the cliche about it making 
                    the whole world blind.

                                  ZOE
                    Every cliche has some truth. And 
                    too many people have stories of 
                      unbearable pain and suffering. 
                    There has to be a peaceful 
                    solution. For all our sakes.

                                    RICHARD
                    There will be a peaceful solution. 
                    When Arab murderers have been 
                    driven from Judea and Samaria.

      RICHARD turns back to ASHWORTH.

                                  ASHWORTH
                    I love you and I forgive you.

                                    RICHARD
                    I love you too.

      He kicks the chair away and turns the gun on ZOE.

                                    RICHARD (CONT D)
                    Sorry, Laura.

      She shuts her eyes and at that point the gun goes off but ZOE 
      is not hit. DANNY has rubgy-tackled RICHARD to the ground. 
      ZOE runs over, pulls RICHARD s arm back and snaps it so that 
      he drops the gun which she kicks away. Behind them ASHWORTH 
      is spinning and choking. ZOE grabs the chair and guides 
      ASHWORTH S body onto it. Loosens the noose and chokes out.

                                  ASHWORTH
                    You re MI5!

                                  DANNY
