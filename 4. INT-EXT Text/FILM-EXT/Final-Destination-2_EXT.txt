KIMBERLY BURROUGHS, 19, puts a folded AAA map in her mouth. She opens
the back of a RED NISSAN SUV, and pla ces her duffel bag inside.
That done, she lets the map drop from her mouth, catches it in her
free hand and turns to hug her father, MR. BURROUGHS.
KIMBERLY
Thanks, Dad. I'll call you.
MR. BU RROUGHS
You have everything, Kimberly?
Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
KIMBERLY
Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not
Mongolia.
MR. BURROUGHS
(playful)
Fix -A-flat? Road flares?
Sunblock? Mace?
SHAINA (O.S.)
Condoms, handcuffs, lube?
Kimberly and Mr. Burroughs turn to see --
SHAINA, 19, tall leggy brunette. Tan, tight tube top revealing her
pierced navel, Kimberly's best friend. She walks up the driveway with
her bags.
SHAINA
Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.
MR. BURROUGHS
(sarcastic)
Oh, that makes me feel a lot
better.
Shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the SUV.
Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek.
KIMBERLY
I know this is the first time we've
been apart since. But everything's
gonna be okay.
MR. BURROUGHS
I know, honey. I just --
Kimberly hugs him tighter. Cutting him off.
MR. BURROUGHS
Your mother would have been so
proud of the way you've handled
yourself through all of this...
KIMBERLY
(softly)
I know, Dad.
SHAINA (O.S.)
Hello, the guys are waiting!
Kimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the
car and pulls away as Shaina cranks up the stereo.
MR. BURROUGHS
Buckle up!
Mr. Burroughs waves as the girls roar off. As he looks down he spots
an OIL STAIN left by Kimberly's SUV. As he drags his shoe across the
stain, a SLIGHT BREEZE blows past his face.
CAMERA PUSHES IN as a look of concern crosses his face.
ON OLD WOMAN
As she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. A SQUEAKY WHEEL is
shrill and disturbing.
DRIVERS of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered
face as she passes. Up ahead waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.
UP AHEAD
Waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.
SHAINA (O.S.)
Watch it!
Kimberly accidentally KISSES the bumper in front of her while
daydreaming. She calls out to the driver in front:
KIMBERLY
Sorry!
My fault!
Shaina looks over, concerned. In the backseat, the guys DANO and
FRANKIE laugh hard and some of Frankie's milkshake comes out of his
nose.
SHAINA
Want me to drive?
KIMBERLY
No, I'm good.
Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.
Kimberly spins around, startled.
Kimberly stares transfixed at the Old Woman, who stares back with
chilling intensity.
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking freak." The Old Woman's
PLASTIC BAG BREAKS, sending oranges rolling down the on- ramp. The Old
Woman breaks eye contact with Kimberly as she rushes to retrieve
them.
The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.
Kimberly pulls the SU V onto the highway, looking in the side view
mirror to see the Old Woman look up at her in SLOW-MO.
FRANKIE
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help
your mother?
DANO
Blo w me.
CU ON KIMBERLY
As she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic
road sign that flashes "WARNING: CONSTRUCTION NEXT 180 FEET".
NISSAN SUV
Kimberly merging into traffic, NEARLY COLLIDES with a speeding yellow
mini- bus carrying a high- school football team.
Kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's
speeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back
left, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment.
CLOSE.
Kimberly pulls around the mini-bus as rowdy football players tackle
each other, yelling:
FOOTBALL PLAYERS
Pile up!
Pile up! Pile up!
Kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear HIGHWAY TO HELL by AC/DC at
earsplitting volume. Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and
reach to lower the volume.
Kimberly, disturbed by this, hits SEEK -- an oldies station. A GRISLY
CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.
DANO
Christ, is this tribute to Princess
Di Day or what?
Kimberly passes a car WEAVING on her right. The driver reaching into
the back seat to quiet a BARKING DOG hanging on its head out the
window.
KIMBERLY
(unnerved)
Jesus, all the crazies are out
today.
A CLOUD passes Kimberly's head. She smells it and turns around,
taking her eyes off the road to see Dano smoking a joint.
KIMBERLY
I told you no drugs in the car!
My
dad will freak!
Dano and Frankie exchange looks, God, what a geek!
DANO
(laughs)
Calm down, Kimmy.
It's not drugs,
just weed.
FRANKIE
Yeah, you should have specified.
Kimberly turns to Shaina, helpless. Shaina spins around, her eyes
wordlessly tell Dano, I know she's a priss, but put it out.
Then Kimberly's CELL PHONE RINGS. She hits the speaker button.
MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)
Kimberly? It's Dad.
KIMBERLY
Hey, Dad. What's up?
Dano defiantly blows more smoke toward Kimberly, then breaks into an
unexpected coughing fit - looking over to see a HELLS ANGEL laughing
at hi m. The biker's trashy GIRLFRIEND, also laughing, quickly FLASHES
HER TITS at Dano over:
MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)
Your car's leaking either
transmission or brake fluid. I
want you to have it checked ASAP at
a gas station.
KIMBERLY
You got it, Dad. I'll call you if
I have a problem.
MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)
I mean it. Take care of it.
KIMBERLY
I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.
Kimberly passes a STATION WAGON on her right, the DRIVER squinting at
a map while driving. A mattress and some furniture tied to the top
SHIFT as the wagon hits a bump.
SHAINA
Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna
call like every ten minutes is he?
Before Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him.
He lowers the joint at once.
DANO
(hiding bag of weed in
pants)
Shit! There's a cop behind us.
Pull into the right lane now!
Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding
flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !
A HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A
COILED CHAIN drops down to the highway.
DANO
Look first, idiot!
Shaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly.
SHAINA
Ignore 'em.
ON LOG TRUCK
One end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the
pavement, sparking.
Looking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls
in behind her.
KIMBERLY
Dano, put that out NOW.
Dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It
bounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left.
INSIDE THE EXPEDITION
KAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and
speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette.
KAT
No, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I
won't be able to pitch the
campaign. Let's get Silverstein to
come in and...
Kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her
windshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles.
KAT
What the hell?
No,
not you.
Kat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out
the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing
her vision.
Kat turns and looks at --
DANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead.
DANO
What's the cop doing?
Did he see
that?
Kat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation.
KAT
Forget it, I'll call him myself.
Kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a
number...
PAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKE
Early 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange.
INSIDE THE POLICE CAR
Thomas speaks into his radio.
THOMAS
I was supposed to be off today.
How did I get screwed?
DISPATCHER (O.S.)
No biggie. Drake called in sick.
THOMAS
Copy that.
(switches off; annoyed)
Go on, sleep it off Drake.
Thomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard,
but it's TOO HOT. He places it back on the dash.
The VIBRATIONS of the road make the COFFEE CUP slide closer and
closer to the edge of the dashboard.
BACK TO KIMBERLY'S SUV
Dano nervously looks back.
FRANKIE
Relax, dude.
But Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard "Check Engine" light
begins flickering.
Kimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles.
KIMBERLY
This trip better be wor th it.
What's the guy- girl ratio again?
SHAINA
Get ready to smile, five guys per
girl.
KIMBERLY
I can live with thaaaa --
Kimberly stops mid-sentence when the WHITE VAN in front of her
suddenly SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES and pulls onto the shoulder for no
reason. Kimberly SCREAMS, swerving around the van just in time to
avoid an accident. Frankie instinctively SHOUTS at the van.
FRANKIE
What's your problem, ya fuckin'
crack baby?!
INSIDE THE WHITE VAN
ISABELLA CRUZ, late 20's and VERY PREGNANT, drives a delivery van
full of funeral wreaths, crosses and classic rose urns. Most are
marked: In Memory of Flight 180.
She chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over.
ISABELLA
...couldn't Keep your dick in check
for another month? I knew this
would happen when I got pregnant.
She pounds the steering wheel, furious.
ISABELLA
What'd the doctor say? I have to
come in to test for STDs? Goddamn
you, Jorge.
A CRATE in the back of her van topples over and CRASHES and a flurry
of sunflower petals sails out the window. Isabella jumps in surprise
and, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals
shower the visor of --
EUGENE, the Harley Rider, who smears the petals (and some squashed
bugs) around his visor and drops back.
INSIDE NISSAN SUV
Kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees
a TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing
its side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES.
It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads,
"DRUNK DRIVING KILLS."
Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter
from the back seat.
Up ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN
against it.
Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front
of them causes everyone to roll up their windows.
OIL DRIPS from its rusty exhaust pipe. The thick exhaust BLINDS
Kimberly.
FRANKIE
Gas it around these idiots. We do
have 1200 miles to go, you know.
Kimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a
SUBURU WAGON. In the front seat, a seven- year old kid is sadistically
SMASHING two toy cars together.
Kimberly passes the Suburu and pulls up to a PACER. The Harley roars
by, startling her.
INSIDE PACER
NORA KESNER, 35, and her son TIM, 15. Tim drums on the dashboard with
two ten-ounce Naya bottles.
NORA
Tim, will you cut that out? I
can't even hear myself think.
Tim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw.
TIM
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
NORA
I know, we'll be there soon.
Tim drops the Naya bottles on the seat. One of them quietly falls to
the floor, rolls a bit, finally settling UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL.
INSIDE NISSAN SUV
Kimberly is still behind the smoke-spewing Chevette. She passes it on
the left. Frankie rolls down his window.
FRANKIE
(yells to driver)
Ever hear of the Ozone layer,
asshole?
INSIDE CHEVETTE
RORY, 27, leans down to snort a line of coke off a Def Leppard CD
case. S he looks up to see the Patrol Car is now behind him, he
reflexively taps the brakes.
Rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and
nonchalantly wipes the CD clean on his pants.
INSIDE NISSAN SUV
She has dropped back behind the Chevette and CHP car and is running
down along side of a BLACK TRANS AM.
Up ahead she sees the Hig hway Patrol Car flick on its LIGHTS and pull
into the shoulder around the Chevette and behind the Semi loaded with
logs.
INSIDE THE COP CAR
As Thomas pulls in behind the log truck, his coffee cup lurches
forward, spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor.
THOMAS
Son of a bitch.
INSIDE TRANS AM
Its driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly,
clearly making Frankie jealous.
FRANKIE
A Trans Am. That shit went out
with New Kids on the Block.
DANO
Yeah. Who does he think he is?
Knight Rider?
FRANKIE
(laughs; then)
Who?
Frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window.
DANO
You know, Hasselhoff before he did
Baywatch.
Evan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear
around the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him.
KIMBERLY
What's the chance of finding a nice
mature guy once we get to Daytona?
SHAINA
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Kimberly laughs, then leans in close to Shaina.
KIMBERLY
Hey, thanks for talking
me into
this trip. Ever since
my mom... I
dunno, I just feel like
I'm
starting to live again,
you know?
Shaina smiles in understanding.
INSIDE POLICE CRUISER
Thomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he
tries to soak up the coffee.
Suddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side
of the truck onto the highway.
One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and
out the back, taking Thomas' head with it.
EUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED
to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right
in front of the yellow mini-bus.
The MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS
tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides
off the road onto the grass median.
He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING
several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a
MACK TRUCK.
Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch.
Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle.
Rory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas
tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield
where it remains half in/half onto the hood.
KAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from
the Chevette.
She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a
huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the
Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly.
Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a
huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but
hits it broadside --
Sending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the
road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag
dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the
side window.
Kimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her
mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see
NORA'S PACER
Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen
Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of
Kat's Expedition.
The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a
huge fireball.
EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his
Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass.
Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF
FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still
alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to
release the seatbelt.
Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh
the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it
like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming.
KIMBERLY'S POV
The semi's grill comes right at her!
CU ON KIMBERLY
She screams and we --
CUT TO:
THE HIGHWAY O N RAMP - NISSAN SUV - 8 MINUTES EARLIER
Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her
surroundings...
DANO (O.S.)
Flight 180. You know, that plane
crash with those kids from Mount
Abraham.
The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking Freak!"
Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.
Kimberly's eyes lower to the bag of oranges --
Which BREAKS, exactly like before, and the Old Woman scurries after
them. The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.
FRANKIE
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help
your mother?
DANO
Blow me. Yellow means go,
Kimberly.
Kimberly hyperventilates in the driver's seat. Freaking. A yellow
mini- bus with football players speeds past.
KIMBERLY
Oh my god, oh my god...
Dano, confused, rolls a joint.
SHAINA
What is it? What are you?
KIMBERLY
There's going to be a huge
accident! Everyone's gonna die.
All of us! I saw it!
Dano hums the Twilight Zone theme.
FRANKIE
That's it. My turn to drive.
CLOSE UP - KIMBERLY SCREAMS!
AND WE'RE BACK
THE HIGHWAY ON RAMP
Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her
surroundings.
DANO (O.S.)
Flight 180. Y'know, that plane
crash with those kids from Mt.
Abraham?
The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.
The kids ad-lib "Let's go", "Fucking freak."
Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.
Kimberly's eyes lower to the bag of oranges, which breaks, exactly
like before and the Old Woman scurries after them.
The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.
FRANKIE
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help
your mother?
DANO
Blow me.
Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Kimberly hyperventilates in the driver's seat. Freaking. A yellow
mini- bus with football players speeds by.
KIMBERLY
Oh my God, oh my God...
Dano, confused, rolls a joint.
SHAINA
What is it? What are you?
KIMBERLY
There's going to be a huge
accident! Everyone's gonna die,
all of us, I saw it!
Dano hums the Twilight Zone theme.
FRANKIE
That's it. My turn to drive.
HONK! The drivers behind them start leaning on their horns. Kimberly
leans out the window and sees the Chevette, the Pacer, The White Van,
the Trans Am, the Harley...all the familiar vehicles from the pile
up. She turns on the radio, frantically scans the dial.
SHAINA
Relax, you need to chill the fuck
out.
KIMBERLY
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
SHAINA
For Christ sakes girl, take a
breath.
D.J. (O.S.)
Taking you into an all request
weekend with a classic from AC/DC.
The opening guitar riff to HIGHWAY TO HELL blares from the speakers.
Kimberly turns to Shaina with a "believe me know?" look, but Shaina's
nowhere near on the same page.
HONKING behind them.
Kimberly, shaking like a leaf, pulls the SUV forwards, turning it
sideways to block off all traffic.
DANO
What the hell are you doing?
Dano shifts in his seat and sees - a Highway Pat rol Car ominously
cruising up the shoulder of the onramp. He shoves a bag of weed,
along with the joint, down his pants.
DANO
Five-O's coming!
Let's fucking
roll, man!
Officer Thomas Burke stops the car behind them.
FRANKIE
Jesus Christ! Here he comes!
Move!
KIMBERLY
No!
We'll all die if we do!
The cop turns on his FLASHERS.
DANO
I told you she'd ruin everything!
SHAINA
Shut up, Dano, just stay cool.
(to Kimberly)
He's just stoned.
Officer Thomas Burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side
of the SUV, hand on weapon. Thomas taps the window with his knuckle.
THOMAS
What's going on here?
KIMBERLY
(incoherent, through
tears)
There's going to be a pile up.
Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it
happen. It happened.
Thomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, "we don't know her."
THOMAS
Miss, please step out of the
vehicle.
As she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously
eyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the
pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her
friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly.
ISABELLA
Excuse me, but is there some way we
could just drive around? I have a
delivery.
Her CELL PHONE RINGS and she leans back inside to answer it.
ISABELLA
Hey hon, you got a mysterious
caller on the answering machine
from Planned Parenthood. What's
going on?
As she listens, growing agitated, the Harley Rider dismounts and
pulls off his helmet. Revealing EUGENE DIX, 35, a nebbishy school
teacher in cool leathers.
INSIDE PACER
NORA watches the SUV, distressed.
NORA
What on Earth are they doing?
TIM
(picking up two Naya
bottles)
Who am I, David Blane?
Nora gives Tim a hard stare, then they both break into smiles. Nora
tousles his hair. And doesn't stop.
TIM
(good-natured laughter)
Okay, quit it already.
As he laughs, something pains his jaw and he winces. THOMAS isn't
quite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet. Dano and
Frankie, no help, stare dead ahead.
KIMBERLY
(trying to calm herself)
The radio played the same songs,
the old lady's bag broke the exact
same way it did in my premonition.
Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past.
She grabs at Thomas for emphasis.
KIMBERLY
THAT's the truck that's going to
kill everyone!
THOMAS
Alright miss, calm down. I just
need this lane open. I need you to
pull your vehicle onto the
shoulder!
KIMBERLY
You're not listening to me!
You
have to do something!
EVAN impatiently yells out the window of his TRANS AM.
EVAN
Arrest this whack-job, wouldja?
Some of us have lives, y'know.
Kimberly looks to Shaina for support, but even Shaina can't meet her
eyes.
KIMBERLY
Why won't anyone listen to me?
Thomas, subtly reaching for his cuffs.
THOMAS
I'm not going to tell you to calm
down again --
A SERIES OF CRASHES AND EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD. In the distance. It's
neverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in
horror and collapses against the SUV.
Thomas runs to his patrol car.
The White Delivery Van makes a J- turn out of the line of cars and
SPEEDS down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into
her cell phone.
ISABELLA
You couldn't keep your dick in
check for a month?!
The other drivers exit their cars, craning their necks to see what's
happened up ahead. Kat takes a deep drag off her smoke.
KAT
Great, now I'm really gonna be
late.
Thomas barks into the radio handset --
THOMAS
L.A. 51, I need assistance and
requesting paramedics for a major
T.A. At --
INSIDE THE SUV
Frankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing
cars BRAKE HARD. Shaina anxiously watches Kimberly pacing behind the
SUV.
SHAINA
Kimberly, what's going on?
Kimberly moves toward Shaina's window. As she leans her head into
Shaina's window, an ominous BREEZE blows back their hair and we hear
the BLARING HORN of a TRUCK.
And Kimberly is unexpectedly yanked backward by Thomas!
From nowhere, a SHRIEK of BRAKES as a JACK-KNIFED TRUCK plow s the SUV
across the frame! CRASH! Flying debris misses Kimberly and Thomas by
inches!
Kimberly cries in horror into Thomas' shoulder as her friends burn up
in the wreckage.
Kimberly drives a beat up Hyundai through an eerie morning mist that
surrounds the grounds of the Stoneybrook Hospital.
ANGLE ON
A computer printout in the shotgun seat: MAPQUEST directions to
"Stoneybrook Hospital".
As Kimberly drives through the gate, the mist almost seems to follow
her inside.
A SIGN offers a choice between "Emergency/Medica l Care" or
"Psychiatric Treatment Center." Kimberly drives to the mental ward.
As Kimberly pulls into her driveway, she's surprised to see a STRANGE
CAR parked there. Then --
THOMAS, wearing street clothes, peers through the front window of the
house. He guiltily backs away as Kimberly gets out.
THOMAS
I tried calling last night but your
father --
KIMBERLY
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Thoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect
the sky behind them.
THOMAS
I know. I've gotten calls all
morning from everyone who was on
the onramp. We're all meeting at
my apartment tonight.
KIMBERLY
Then you believe all this?? That
Death is working off a list?
Thomas hesitates before answering.
THOMAS
I didn't. Until I was dispatched
to clean up one of the Flight 180
survivors.
KIMBERLY
Clean up? I don't...
Suddenly through the reflection of the window glass, Kimberly sees
hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once!
Like a scene out of THE BIRDS, Kimberly must duck and cover as the
pigeons assault her from every angle.
But when Kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual
pigeons, THEY'RE GONE. ALL IN HER HEAD.
KI MBERLY
Did you see that??
Thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing.
KIMBERLY
Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's
right about the order, then Nora
and Tim are going to be attacke d by
Pigeons!
THOMAS
I'm not following you --
KIMBERLY
They're next on the list.
We have
to find them.
ANGLE ON
Woman's N ike shoe on a down-moving escalator. Reveal Nora taking her
son Tim to a dentist's office. The SHOELACE snags on a bolt of one of
the steel side panels, untying it...
TIM
(mischievous smile)
You think the tooth fairy's gonna
come tonight? I'm thinkin' like
fifteen bucks.
NORA
Nice try, kiddo.
Tim smiles, then winces from the pain in his mouth.
THE DANGLING SHOELACE heads straight for the escalator grate. IT GETS
SWALLOWED UP. As Tim steps off, Nora TRIPS forward. Her caught
sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase.
TIM
Mom!
Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker,
fear mounting. Tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks. Finally, the
shoelace SNAPS, and Nora's free again.
TIM
You okay?
Nora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the
stubby one.
NORA
Sure hon. I'm fine.
Let's shake
it, we're late.
Tim nods. The wind picks up as they continue past a --
CONSTRUCTION CREW
Who apply industrial suction cups to large, thick sheets of PLATED
GLASS .
Tim stares in childlike fascination as they pass JACKHAMMERS, a
CEMENT MIXER, and an EXCAVATOR.
Thomas drives his car into a friendly neighborhood. Kimberly, riding
shotgun, hangs up her cell phone.
KIMBERLY
Turn around. The cleaning woman
said they're at the dentist's.
14th and Main.
THOMAS
Hold on.
Thomas expertly skids into a U-turn.
Nora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the CONSTRUCTION CREW. A
CRANE OPERATOR smiles at Tim, who smiles back.
From across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas
appear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming.
TIM
What are they doing here? And why
are they yelling "pigeons"?
Just then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of PIGEONS who
suddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand
inadvertently jerks a lever -
A METALLIC CHAIN RATTLE fills the air and Tim looks up just as a HUGE
SHEET OF GLASS PLUMMETS downward toward him and CRUSHES him, his
mangled body visible underneath.
As two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk, NORA SCREAMS.
DISSOLVE TO:
Emergency vehicles everywhere. Thomas seems exhausted as he walks
back to Kimberly, who stands by his car. In the BG, EMTs load a
stretcher into an ambulance.
THOMAS
(shaking his head)
Nora's not coming. She refuses to
leave her son.
KIMBERLY
We have to tell her she's in
danger!
THOMAS
(sadly)
I did. And right now, I don't
think she cares.
Thomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. Kimberly holds up her
hand and watches it tremble.
KIMBERLY
It's happening again.
It's fucking
happening again. I hoped we'd get
there and they'd be okay, that
Clear Rivers was full of shit and
Evan's death was just a freak
accident...
Thomas kills the engine to listen.
KIMBERLY
But we're all going to die. We
can't stop it. It's just a matter
of time. I'm so scared.
Thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly.
THOMAS
I am too. But you can use that
fear. It'll sharpen your
instincts. Keep you alert fro
signs. It's the only way you'll be
able to sav e the others...and me.
Kimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. Thomas senses
he's losing her, and softens her approach.
THOMAS
I know you didn't ask for any of
this, Kimberly. But I don't think
you have it in you to quit either.
Kimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in.
BANG! A startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car.
Kimberly jumps, then spins around to see:
CLEAR RIVERS - standing in the driveway. A determined, powerful
presence. Kimberly exits the car. A MOMENT where Kimberly and Clear
stare each other down.
KIMBERLY
Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.
Clear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly.
KIMBERLY
(bitter)
The second one just dies.
A 16
year old kid.
CLEAR
(nods; a faint trace of
guilt)
I hope you're ready for this.
Thomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot. Kimberly,
Thomas and Clear file out and head to the door.
KIMBERLY
This is cheery.
THOMAS
Who is this guy, anyway?
CLEAR
A mortician. He seemed to know a
hell of a lot more about death than
he ever told us.
THOMAS
Should we knock?
CLEAR
(looking ill)
He probably already knows we're
coming.
CLOSE UP - GAS DRIPPING
From the nozzle in Thomas' car. Thomas fills the tank, watching for
signs of danger. Clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' EMERGENCY
CUT-OFF VALVE
Some SKATE RATS exit the mini -mart with a pack of Camels, followed by
Kimberly, who carries a couple of Red Bulls and hands them out.
THOMAS
New life defeats death? Follow the
signs? Where the hell did you find
that guy?
KIMBERLY
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to
be helpful.
CLEAR
He was. If we can use your ability
to see the signs, we can cheat
Death long enough to figure out
what "new life" means.
(off their looks)
I know, it worries me that I
understand him.
Thomas tops off the tank. Some gas spills to the ground. Quick looks
all around -- sure enough, one of the Skate Rats is about to strike a
match.
CLEAR'S HAND SLAPS the kid in the back of the head, stopping him mid -
motion.
CLEAR
What the fuck are you thinking?
The startled Skate Rat shrinks back from Clear's rage.
SKATE RAT
I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee
yatch.
Thomas chuckles to himself and looks at Kimberly who --
SMASH CUT TO:
POV DRIVER. Grease-covered female hands reach out toward a steering
wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE!
The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In
moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped.
Drowning. Horrible.
SMASH CUT TO:
Rory sits in his Chevette outside an apartment building, staring up
at the address. He quickly snorts some powder off his key and wipes
his nostrils free of crystals. He takes a breath and exits the car.
Kat's Ford Expedition winds its way through rural New York.
A SPORTS CAR speeds past on the left, then as it pulls in front of
the Exped ition, its slipstream sucks over some debris from the
shoulder; a thin metal piece of trim, which bounces in front of Kat's
Expedition's left front tire.
CU KAT'S WHEEL WELL -- the metal trim is shot upward into the wheel
well, where it lodges firmly, its sharp metal edge GRINDING AGAINST
THE RUBBER.
INSIDE THE CAR
Kat drives, Thomas reading directions in the shotgun seat. Kimberly,
Eugene and Rory ride in back. In the CARGO area, Clear scans out the
rear window for danger.
Rory fidgets.
RORY
Is this safe, guys? I mean,
someone in this car is about to get
whacked. Do the rest of us really
feel like sitting next to him?
(off Kat's glare)
Or her. Hopefully her.
An uncomfortable beat.
THOMAS
Guys, let's not panic.
Isabella's
safe.
KIMBERLY
How do you know?
THOMAS
You said she was going to drive
into a lake. How can she when
she's in protective custody?
Small town station. Only one patrol car. In the patrol car, Isabella
buckles up in the sho tgun seat, the belt stretched tightly across her
belly.
Deputy Steve tries the ignition, but the car won't start.
STEVE
Damn, they always stick me with the
clunker.
ISABELLA
Take my van!
KAT'S EXPEDITION speeds through a yellow light and continues on.
CLOSE ON EXPEDITION'S LEFT TIRE
Metal sheers away more rubber.
INSIDE THE EXPEDITION
Rory, antsy, rubbing his nostrils, stares at two Yankee tickets.
RORY
Here's what I don't get. For nine
months, Death does all this shit to
make sure I win these tickets and
end up on Route 18 at exactly the
right time for the pile up...
KAT
Yeah?
RORY
But why single me out? What am I
in the great scheme of things?
You'd think I stepped off Flight
180 or something... Fucking weird,
man.
THOMAS
You want weird? Last year, my
partner and I were heading out for
the graveyard shift. A call comes
in about a train wreck and Frank
decides to let me handle it alone.
(beat)
Frank died that night in a
shootout. I'd be dead too if that
call had come in just ten seconds
later.
Everyone nods in that 'life's weird' reverence kind of way.
KAT
I got that beat. So like, last
May, I was supposed to stay at this
cheesy bed and breakfast in
Pennsylvania. There was a major
gas leak no one knew about and all
the guests suffocated during the
night.
RORY
Yeah, so what happened?
KAT
I never mad it. The Greyhound bus
I was on splattered some chick all
over the road and we had to stop.
CLEAR
Was that in Mt. Abraham?
KAT
Yeah.
How did you know?
CLEAR
(sinking realization)
That bus you were on? It killed
Terry Mathers. She was supposed to
die on Flight 180.
KAT
I'm not sure I--
THOMAS
Shit. The call about the train
wreck that saved my life? That was
the night I scraped up Billy
Hitchcock.
RORY
Who?
KIMBERLY
Another kid from Flight 180.
A chill passes over the group.
BRIAN GIBBONS, 15, cheerfully drives a TRACTOR hauling a WHOODCHIPPER
across the high crest of the empty road toward a pile of thick
branches.
The Tractor unexpectedly stalls in the middle of the road. He tries
the ignition, pumps the gas. Nothing...
Only by standing on the tractor can Brian see the White Van speeding
up the hill toward him. He jumps down and frantically tires starting
the tractor. Once, twice, nothing.
CU FRONT TIRE - METAL shreds away more rubber.
BRIAN GIBBONS jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward
the accident. At the edge of the property is a common farm FENCE made
from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires.
Brian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a DEAD OAK
TREE ten feet inside the fence. In the BG, MR. GIBBONS darts inside a
double-wide construction trailer.
MR. GIBBONS (O.S.)
Call 9- 1-1!
WE FOLLOW BRIAN
To the crash site. Brian's jaw drops as he absorbs the chilling sight
of a guy and a girl dragging a blood- soaked man from the back seat to
perform CPR on him.
Around Brian, voices mesh in a surreal haze.
THOMAS
Stop it, don't move him!
KIMBERLY
He can't breathe damn it.
I think
his lung's collapsed!
CLEAR
Someone call for help!
We STEADICAM around Brian to reveal a woman screaming from the
driver's seat. The sound is surreal.
KAT
I can't move my fucking leg!
Please get me out of here before it
explodes!
The color drains from Brian's face as the dying man on the ground
coughs blood and the girl performing CPR recoils.
The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from
the horrors he can't face. Into the street --
And Rory yanks him back from imminent death as an AMBULANCE SPEEDS
onto the property.
RORY
Watch it, dude!
That SNAPS Brian back to reality. Sounds become normal again. Brian
collects himself and SNIFFS the air. He then drops to ground level,
looking under the Expedition for something.
KIMBERLY
Help us, we need help over here!
BRIAN
(to Kat, reassuringly)
I don't smell any gas. And none's
dripping, either.
Brian sticks his head in Kat's window and peers down at her trapped
leg. He swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick
flannel sleeve, reaches in, and tries to YANK the door open with all
his might.
No good, Kat SCREAMS in pain.
KAT
Stop that! I still need this foot,
thank you.
Brian steps back as the emergency vehicle speeds over.
DISSOLVE TO:
Clear watches two EMTS lo ad Eugene into the back of an ambulance. An
oxygen mask has been placed over his mouth.
CLEAR
Be careful with that, check the
gages on the regulator and be
mindful of overdoses. Oh, watch
for potholes and puddles.
As Clear continues, the exasperated Paramedics do their best to
ignore her. When she tries to climb inside, she is pushed away.
CLEAR
Look, I made him a promise --
PARAMEDIC
Sorry.
There's no room.
Again, she's shoved away and steps back, helpless.
Thomas and Kimberly stand by Kat, still trapped in the SUV.
THOMAS
Get that over here!
Move move
move!
A RESCUE WORKER carries the JAWS of LIFE past Clear towards the
Expedition.
RESCUE WORKER
Excuse me, hot soup coming through.
The hydraulic hose that leads back to the Power Unite WRAPS AROUND
CLEAR'S LEG.
As the hose tightens, Clear realizes she's surrounded by shards of
glass and metal. She quickly WRESTLES herself free of the hose and
watches the Paramedics lock Eugene's gurney into place.
CLEAR
One more thing.
Watch out for
power lines.
The doors slam, revealing the PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL logo. The
ambulance speeds off, spraying gravel at her.
She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a CRUSHED cell phone. Shit.
She runs back over to Thomas.
CLEAR
We have to contact Isabella now!
A NEWS VAN tries to weave through the emergency vehicles to get
closer to teh accident.
ANGLE ON NEWS VAN UNDERCARRIAGE
It sinks into the loose dirt, SCRAPING A LARGE ROCK. The gas tank
PUNCTURES.
EMT'S angrily wave the news van back to the road, where it parks near
the twin wire fence opposite the DEAD OAK TREE.
Immediately, A CAMERA CREW exits the van to catch the action. Rory
steps behind the News Van, making sure he can't be seen, and digs
into his sock, coming up with a bindle. A SMILE...
THOMAS (O.S.)
Rory!!!
Rory cringes at his name, pockets his stash, then EXITS FRAME. WE
PUSH IN, the news van gas tank is leaking. A SMALL DRIP...
Thomas, Kimberly, Clear and Rory watch the JAWS OF LIFE being clamped
onto Kat's door.
THOMAS
Where's the cell phone Clear gave
you?
RORY
I dunno. I think I gave it to
Eugene back at your place.
THOMAS
Damn it. We have to call the
Greenwood Police Station and warn
Isabella.
Thomas runs in the direction of some local POLICE. After he leaves,
Rory drifts away from the pack, hand in pocket.
Kimberly moves back to Kat, who chain -smokes in the front seat of the
Expedition.
KIMBERLY
You doing alright in there?
KAT
My legs are starting to cramp up.
And God, why am I so thirsty? Does
anyone have any Fiji?
The KA-CHUNK of the Jaws of Life next to Kat startles her half to
death.
KAT
Christ, you wanna give me a heads
up next time, pal?
Brian and Mr. Gibbons approach with a cup of tap water. They hand it
to kat, who frowns but drinks anyway.
CUT TO:
THE DRIP
Of the leaking gas becomes a steady trickle. GAS SLITHERS over packed
dirt, around debris, toward the crash site.
BACK TO:
THOMAS DARK ROOM
Speaks to another COP who clicks off his radio.
COP
She's at Phelps Memorial. They're
prepping her to give birth right
now.
THOMAS
Where's that?
COP
A few miles up the road.
Near the
docks.
KAT
Lights one cigarette off the other KA -CHUCNK! The sound makes her
flinch, dropping the cigarette on the floor.
KAT
Damn, can't you be quieter with
that thing?
RESCUE WORKER
(dripping scorn)
Sure, I'll just set it to the
"quiet" mode.
Kat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales.
KA-CHUNK!!! She jumps again, but maintains her composure.
MEANWHILE
The gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through
pipes, closer and closer to the Expedition. At one point, the gas
even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty
feet closer to the site...
KIMBERLY
Looks confused to watch Rory climb between the fence wires and drift
the Dead Oak Tree into the field. Thomas runs down the hill toward
Kimberly.
THOMAS
We gotta go now.
Isabella's in
labor.
Rescue Workers pull off a large chunk of door. KA-CHUNK! Kat
Flinches.
KIMBERLY
What about that?
CLEAR
(calls over to Kat)
How you doing in there, hero?
KAT
(re: spike behind head)
I guess it could be worse.
Brian hands out drinks to Rescue Workers.
THOMAS
So let's go...Where the hell is
Rory?!
Thomas sees Rory in the field and angrily hops the fence, heading
directly under the dead Oak Tree.
Rory, his back to everyone, finally opens the BINDLE. Enraptured, he
delicately unfolds it...
KIMBERLY
Is put on alert by a fresh BREEZE. Her attention is caught by the
WINDOW of an emergency vehicle. IN THE REFLECTION, Kimberly sees a
man sitting on the Expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no
one there.
KA-CHUNG! The door comes off the Expedition, finally freeing Kat!
Everyone applauds!
KIMBERLY
Wait!
Mr. Gibbons, applauding with everyone else, chooses that very moment
to sit on the bumper.
DEPLOYING THE AIRBAG!
SLAMMING Kat's head backwards through the spike, HEAD-KABOB.
Kat's dead limp hand drops her last cigarette -- which bounces along
the hard dirt -- toward the oncoming gas. Closer, closer,.. The
BREEZE KICKS UP, aiding the cigarette.
WHOOSH, the gas fuse catches. The blusih flame travels through pipes,
over rocks, racing toward the news VAN.
Kimberly , half-traumatized, watches an ominous BREEZE rustle through
the field, up to the trees, toward Thomas.
The GAS BURNS up an incline, and disappears into the ground... And
pops up twenty feet closer to the News Van.
Kimberly follows the BREEZE to the dead oak tree under which Thomas
stands. And blows a large branch until it snaps! A startled Thomas
sees it fall just in time to DIVE to safety.
Clear, seeing the flame, instinctively runs from the van.
CLEAR
Get back!
BOOM! The news van's explosion hurls two fence posts just over
Thomas' head, end over end, the two lengths of wire stretched between
them. The flying garrote heads directly for --
Rory, who sorts hard, stands up with a satisfied smile - and is
sliced into three sharp cuts of beef.
The silence from the emergency crew is deafening. Mr. Gibbons starts
crying hysterically.
MR. GIBBONS
I didn't mean to do it - I didn't
know.
Kimberly numbly stares at the fallen branch, the one that caused
Thomas to step out of the path of the flying fence.
KIMBERLY
(to herself)
It wasn't his turn.
And it's not
my turn.
Kimberly sees the corpses of Kat and Rory, buries the pain, and
approaches Mr. Gibbons.
KIMBERLY
Give me the keys to your truck.
Now!
MR. GIBBONS
(hysterical)
Anything you want. Anything.
I
wish I knew. I didn't...
Mr. Gibbons hands Kimberly the keys.
Kimberly drives Thomas and Clear in the Gibbons' truck. All are numb.
THOMAS
(buckling up)
Hurry up. There's no time.
She's
about to give birth.
Kimberly unbuckles her seatbelt and floors it.
CLEAR
What are you doing?
You're going
to kill us!
KIMBERLY
No. If anyone dies from a crash
now, it'll be me. But I can't die
if Eugene and Isabella are still
alive. I'm last on Death's list.
CLEAR
Are you crazy? What makes you
think you'd survive?
KIMBERLY
What happened when Eugene tried to
kill himself out of turn?
CLEAR
(considering)
Six duds in a row.
KIMBERLY
And when it was Rory's turn to die,
and Thomas was in the way?
THOMAS
That branch fell and saved my life.
You're right, Death's maintaining
the order.
KIMBERLY
Let's pray that Isabella's still
alive.
The truck speeds into the horizon.
Kimberly speeds the truck down some dangerously twisty roads slick
from wet leaves.
KIMBERLY
This makes no sense. Isabella was
supposed to crash her van into a
lake. Could we have altered her
destiny when we had her arrested?
CLEAR
I don't think so. Alex's
premonitions happened exactly as he
saw them no matter how much we
tried to change it.
THOMAS
Then the only way to survive is to
get to the hospital and protect
Eugene and Isabella for as long as
we can.
CLEAR
If only Alex and I had done that
with the others, Alex might still
be...
A somber beat. Then Thomas looks over at the speedometer.
THOMAS
Um, Kimberly? This is a
neighborhood. You may wanna slow
it down.
KIMBERLY
Don't worry. Nothing can happen to
us.
THOMAS
I wasn't worried about us.
Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat!
HARD CUT TO:
The pick up truck races to the hospital. As Kimberly speeds past a
billboard, a POLICE CAR pulls in hot pursuit.
KIMBERLY
Shouldn't we pull over?
THOMAS
No time. Keep going. I wouldn't
know how to explain any of this
anyway.
At the next intersection, TWO MORE COP CARS APPEAR.
KIMBERLY
Oh come on.
The pick up truck blows by the second pair of cop cars, which
instantly join the high speed chase. Kimberly takes a long look in
the rearview mirror at the TAILGATING COPS. She then inspects the
road ahead.
UP IN THE DISTANCE
A busy six-lane intersection.
KIMBERLY
What do you want me to do?
CLEAR
(hesitated beat)
Speed up.
KIMBERLY
Yeah, fuck 'em.
(to Thomas)
No offense.
Kimberly SPEEDS toward the intersection. She pulls her seatbelt
aside, making sure it offers ZERO protection. Thomas jumps in the
backseat, buckles up...
CLEAR
Be alive, Isabella, please be
alive.
Kimberly's eyes widen in fear. Her foot hesitates over the brake
pedal as --
The truck blindly blazes through the busy intersection, miraculously
missing every car!
The police are just barely able to fishtail into 90 degree turns,
avoiding the intersection completely.
Kimberly's eyes open and she lets out a victory cry.
Kimberly seems to have ditched the cops. She speeds the pick up
through the medical facility.
The pick up skids to a halt in front of the hospital. Kimberly,
Thomas and Clear run outside and into the building.
The RAT stops gnawing. The TV stops sparking. A wave of intense
relief washes over Eugene. He pantomimes reaching into his shirt
pocket and lighting a victory cigar.
POV DRIVER
Grease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van
speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE!
The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In
moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped.
Drowning. Horrible.
And on the rearview mirror, six floral scented AIR-FRESHNERS.
BACK TO:
Kimberly looks down at her grease -covered hands and looks ill.
KIMBERLY
...the Same hands from the van.
Finally everything makes sense to Clear.
CLEAR
It's you Kimberly. The
premonitions are about you.
Kimberly trembles, refusing to accept what she's hearing.
KIMBERLY
No!
It can't be.
CLEAR
(suddenly remembering)
I have to save Eugene!
Clear leaves Kimberly and Thomas together. Kimberly verges on tears
and Thomas consoles her with a hug.
IN THE BACKGROUND
Clear looks at passing room numbers while hurrying down the corridor.
She comes to a room with a HUGE CART parked outside, blocking the
door. She looks up to see - B -187.
Clear leans into it, pushing it out of the way of the door.
CLEAR
Eugene?
Are you in there?
EUGENE'S ROOM
Eugene strains to hear through the thick door.
CLEAR (O.S.)
Can you hear me? I'm coming in .
An intense wave of relief washes over Eugene.
BACK TO:
As Kimberly hugs Thomas, she watches Clear push the cart past the
door.
ORDERLY (O.S.)
Make way, make way lovebirds.
Kimberly spins as Eugene's Orderly passes her; a paper, pen and a
crossword book in one hand, A BIRTHDAY CAKE in the other.
The CAKE reads "Happy Birthday Gregory". The THIRTEEN SPARKLING
CANDLES on top ODDLY FRAME Clear's head.
KIMBERLY
Oh no...
The Orderly speeds down the corridor toward Clear, whose hand reaches
for Eugene's door handle. She leans into it --
ORDERLY
(to Clear)
Thanks hon, the Henzels are going
crazy for this thing.
THOMAS AND KIMBERLY
Watch as Clear opens the door, briefly revealing Eugene, a whoosh of
Oxygen --
BOOM!!!
Clear's body is obscenely hurled END OVER END towards the CAMERA,
heading straight for Kimberly and Thomas!
Thomas throws himself and Kimberly around the corner to prevent being
crushed by Clear's lifeless body!
The hospital erupts in total chaos. Just as Kimberly is about to
break down completely, she sees --
A WOMAN hurrying down the hallway in their direction, pushing a crash
cart.
Kimberly sees the nametag: KALARJIAN.
KIMBERLY
Nurse Kalarjian...
DR. KALARJIAN
Doctor Kalarjian. Excuse me,
please.
ANGLE ON CART
DEFRIBULATOR PADDLES rest on top. And then Dr. Kalarjian passes them
toward the area of the explosion.
KIMBERLY OMINOUSLY TURNS, the camera following her view, until she
sees a small lake across the street from the hospital.
KIMBERLY
Oh my God. That's it. The lake.
The EEG machine. Nurse Kalarjian.
THOMAS
What?
Just then, an AMBULANCE SKIDS up to the nearest entrance. PARAMEDICS
jump out and run towards the blast site.
KIMBERLY
You can't cheat destiny. I know
what I have to do to save us. I
have to die.
THOMAS
That's crazy. You can't give up
now. We can still fight this
thing.
But Kimberly isn't listening. She stares through the glass doors at
the --
AMBULANCE
A red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six
floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from
her vision! And it's running!
KIMBERLY
I have to do this.
Kimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns
and runs before he can speak.
Kimberly heads right for the open ambulance. The driver's door almost
seems to swing open for her as she gets in.
Kimberly shifts into gear and speeds off. Thomas squeezes through the
doors and runs after her. An EMT, the driver of the stolen ambulance,
rushes outside.
EMT
What the fuck?!
Thomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over
curbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the
lake!
Thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the EMT trailing far
behind.
INSIDE THE AMBULANCE
Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a
final gasp of air --
ON THE LAKE'S EDGE
Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle
descends below the surface -- and he dives in!
UNDERWATER
Thomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets
to the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his
baton and BANGS on the glass - nothing!
He tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of
the twisted bumper. He squirms frantically...
And as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything --
FADE TO BLACK.
We are at a summer barbecue. Frisbee, lawn darts, croquet, et.
Everyone's happy.
TITLE CARD: FIVE MONTHS LATER
ANGLE ON
Shish -Kabob entering a mouth.
REVEAL
Kimberly taking a bite, relishing the taste and calmly pulling the
metal skewer from her mouth.
KIMBERLY
My God, this is delicious. I can't
believe I used to be a vegan.
Thomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own. As the metal skewer
is deep in his mouth --
A running FRISBEE PLAYER accidentally bumps into Thomas! But no harm.
Thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his
mouth around the shish-kabob.
MR. BURROUGHS (O.S.)
So what's the deal, Thomas? Three
months and you still haven't asked
my daughter out on a date.
Kimberly turns red as Mr. Burroughs appears and takes a seat.
THOMAS
What's wrong with a platonic
relationship?
MR. GIBBONS
Platonic my ass. That's for ugly
women.
KIMBERLY
For God's sake, leave him alone,
Dad.
THOMAS
(smiling)
Yeah, don't make me cite you for
harassment.
MR. GIBBONS
Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone.
(looking around, lowering
voice)
Besides, if you can beat Death,
what's he got to worry about me
for?
Mr. Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. His wife,
MRS. GIBBONS, joins.
MR. GIBBONS
You know, you still never explained
to us how you did it.
It seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.
THOMAS
Well, technically when we died, we
gave Death what it wanted. And by
the time we were revived, it had
already moved on to graver
pastures.
Mrs. Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. She
changes the conversation.
MRS. GIBBONS
You know, I'm having the greatest
day?
KIMBERLY
Food's great too, Mrs. Gibbons.
Big props to you and Brian.
MRS. GIBBONS
Our...pleasure. So, ready for the
back-to -school season? NYU, right?
KIMBERLY
Three short glorious weeks away.
MRS. GIBBONS
Sounds wonderful. I wish I were
going myself.
MR. GIBBONS
(to Mr. Burroughs)
You may want to think twice about
letting her live in the village,
Bob. Our eldest daughter moved
there and came back with piercings
all over her face.
(looks grave)
Among other places.
A chorus of friendly laughter.
BRIAN (O.S.)
Dad used to call her the
pincushion. From Hellraiser.
BRIAN enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter. He holds a plate full
of raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches.
BRIAN
Dad, you had the spatula last,
right?
MR. GIBBONS
Sure, here.
Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera,
SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between
Kimberly and Thomas' heads.
KIMBERLY
Brian looks like he's having fun.
MR. GIBBONS
Sure does. Owes it to that friend
of yours, in a way.
Mr. Gibbons immediately regrets having said that.
KIMBERLY
How's that?
MR. GIBBONS
Well, Brian was nearly hit by an
ambulance the day...but your friend
Rory pulled him back at the last
second.
Kimberly and Thomas ominously turn their heads around. In the BG,
Brian fidgets in front of the barbecue.
MRS. GIBBONS
You never told me that, Peter.
Boy, that was lucky.
BOOM!!! The PROPANE TANK blows Brian to smithereens. A deafening
silence follows, punctuated when Brian's ARM lands on Mrs. Gibbons'
plate. PLOP.
FADE TO BLACK.
END CREDITS.
