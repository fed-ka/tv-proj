      MALE HANDS - GLOVED - set TWO BRICKS OF C-4 EXPLOSIVE on a 
      tile bathroom counter.  

      THE RUNNER, a woman, FROM BEHIND.  Strong and graceful, she 
      breezes past other runners on the path.

      THE GLOVED HANDS press wires into the C-4 - with an ease and 
      style that is almost artistic.

      The Runner from DIRECTLY ABOVE - her relentless pace takes 
      her through the trees, vibrant with the changing colors of 
      fall.  We see her - we don t.  We do again.

      The Hands run wires to a DETONATOR, expertly attaching them 
      to the brick of explosives.  Fingers touch the smooth 
        plastique... nearly a caress...

      The Runner s face - determined - breath escaping in misty 
      bursts.  She is BECCA WINSTONE: smart, beautiful, and a 
      devoted mother whose SUV is most often found outside the gym, 
      the Whole Foods or the school.  But something sets her apart 
      from other women like her... an undefinable awareness. 

      UNDER A CAR - The Gloved Hands attach the completed bomb to 
      the WHEEL WELL, running wires through the undercarriage.

      Like a heartbeat, barely noticeable, the MUSIC ticks a steady 
      rhythm in the background that Becca s running feet no longer 
      matches as she slows at the trail head.  She begins her cool 
      down as two SUBURBAN WOMEN warm up.

                                  WOMAN
                    You got an early start, Becca.

                                  BECCA
                    No husband, no kid, until tomorrow 
                    anyway.  Next stop, bubble bath.

      The Women laugh and run off down the path.  Becca approaches 
      HER SUV.  She takes out the key fob -    POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       2


      CLOSE ON THE FOB as she PRESSES the button...

      CLOSE: The door locks POP UP.


      Across the sea, Becca s husband PAUL and her 8-year-old son 
      MICHAEL pack in a luxurious hotel.  Paul - buff, polished, but 
      with a dangerous sense of humor; the man all the ladies try to 
      catch under the mistletoe at the office Christmas party.

      Michael, more thoughtful than a boy his age should be, is 
      trying to fit a soccer ball into his luggage next to a TEAPOT 
      already wedged inside.  Packing his own bag, Paul watches, 
      amused, as Michael tries every variation he can think of.

                                  PAUL
                    Basic geometry, champ.  It may not 
                    be possible.

                                    MICHAEL
                    It has to be.

                                  PAUL
                    What s our rule?

                                    MICHAEL
                          (Rote)
                     Carry-on only, no checked luggage.  
                    Anything important enough to keep 
                    is important enough to carry with 
                    you.  
                          (facing his father)
                    Dad, I don t want to leave the 
                    ball.  It s signed, by Zidane.

                                  PAUL
                    Then leave the teapot.

                                    MICHAEL
                    The teapot s for Mom.

      Michael looks over the situation.  Tries one more 
      configuration then stops, wrestles with himself.  He sets the 
      ball aside and packs the teapot.  Paul looks at his son, 
      touched, proud.

                                  PAUL
                    Tell you what... you pack the 
                    teapot, I ll carry your ball.

      Michael hugs his father, thankful.  These are the moments for 
      which fathers live.  And off Paul savoring it, holding his 
      son tightly --    POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       3



      God, this hotel - glass - steel - A FIRE projected on the 
      faux fireplace.  Too hip for guys like me, honestly.  It s 
      late, and the lobby feels like the inside of an echo.

      Paul and Michael walk to the front desk as he talks on his 
      cell.  Each pull a carry-on, while the soccer ball is seen 
      wedged under Paul s arm.  The CONVERSATION is INTERCUT.

                                  PAUL
                    Let me guess... just finishing your 
                    run.

                                  BECCA
                    You know I like my routine and... 
                    running gives me time to think.

                                  PAUL
                    About what?  How much you miss us?

                                  BECCA
                    There s that, but also, about maybe 
                    adding one more... to  us. 

      Caught off guard, Paul takes a moment to respond.

                                  PAUL
                    Are you saying this just for me?

                                  BECCA
                    No.  I m ready.  I want to start 
                    trying.
                          (beat)
                    So hurry home.  We have work to do.    POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       4


                                  PAUL
                          (A beat)
                    I ll be there as soon as I can.

                                    MICHAEL
                          (Grabbing at the phone)
                    Dad, my turn.

                                  PAUL
                    I m sensing that your son wants to 
                    talk to you, although he s being 
                    awfully subtle about it.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Just get to the mushy part already.

                                  PAUL
                     Mushy  is the new word for all 
                    things emotional...
                          (beat)
                    I love you, Becca.

                                  BECCA
                    I love you too.  Safe flight. 

      As the two of them walk toward the front of the hotel where 
      their RENTAL CAR awaits, Paul hands Michael the phone.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hi, Mom!

                                  BECCA
                    Hi, baby.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I got you something, but I m not 
                    gonna tell you what.

      PANNING ALONG the rental car...past the WHEEL WELL... and up 
      to Paul as he slips the key into the boot.  He turns it 
      and... the boot pops open uneventfully.

                                  BECCA
                    Well, I can t wait.  Do you like 
                    Vienna?

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s okay.  Dad dragged me to see 
                    some stupid bridge and got all 
                    weird about it.

      Becca blushes, touched.

                                  BECCA
                    Mushy, huh?    POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       5


                                    MICHAEL
                    Totally.

                                  BECCA
                    That s where your dad and I met.

      Paul loads in the bags as Michael climbs into the back seat.  
      Almost simultaneous - jarring us:

      SLAM!  Michael s door - 

      SLAM!  The boot -

      As Paul gets in the car, he realizes - 

                                  PAUL
                    Mikey, I left your ball.  Will you 
                    run inside?

      Seeing his ball on the counter by the front desk, Michael 
      heads back into the hotel.

                                    MICHAEL
                    So, Mom, check it out.  We were at 
                    the Milano game, and guess who was 
                    sitting two rows back.

                                  BECCA
                    I have no idea.

      CLOSE on the STEERING COLUMN as Becca turns the key in her 
      ignition -

      A MASSIVE EXPLOSION ROCKS THE SCREEN -

      Michael, his back to the front of the hotel, is knocked off 
      his feet.  Turning back, he sees -- THE RENTAL CAR ENGULFED 
      IN FLAMES!

      Chaos as panicked, screaming guests start to recover from the 
      shock.  Clutching the phone, Michael runs toward the burning 
      car.

      On the other end of the phone, Becca hears nothing but 
      shouting and screams.  Panic rises --

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Michael!  Michael!  What happened?

      A HOTEL CLERK stops Michael, scooping him up in his arms.  
      Michael kicks and screams, desperate to get to his father.  
      But all he can do is watch the twisted pile of metal burn.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Daddy!  Daddy!    POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       6


      Becca screams helplessly into the phone:

                                  BECCA
                    Michael!  What s happening, baby?  
                    MICHAEL!

      TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:  TEN YEARS LATER 


      Helping unpack groceries, Michael finds a box of Frosty O s.

                                    MICHAEL
                    So you ll be eating Frosty-Os?

                                  BECCA
                    Oh, that s just... habit.

      Michel studies his mother, then realizes --    POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       8


                                    MICHAEL
                    Or, you re not gonna let me go.

                                  BECCA
                    We re still discussing it.

                                    MICHAEL
                    No, discussing it would mean 
                    actually hearing my side.  I was 
                    the only freshman accepted into a 
                    graduate level architecture 
                    program.  The only one.  Mom... 
                    this is my chance to see these 
                    buildings where they live, where 
                    they breathe.

                                  BECCA
                    Rome is just so far away.

      After holding her gaze a moment, Michael turns, walks away.  


      No rock stars or Bikini Babes here.  Between the HAND-CRAFTED 
      MODELS and POSTERS of iconic buildings, this place is a 
      shrine to architecture.  

      Michael is on his bed, staring at the ceiling as Becca enters.

                                  BECCA
                    You have to hear my side too...

                                    MICHAEL
                          (sincerely)
                    I know your side. We ve discussed 
                    it a thousand times.  Terrorism is 
                    a fact of life.  But the odds of 
                    something like that happening to 
                    me, after dad -

                                  BECCA
                    There are other dangers in the 
                    world besides that, you know.  
                    You re so young.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You should have more faith in 
                    yourself, mom.

                                  BECCA
                    Myself?

                                    MICHAEL
                      I wouldn t even be thinking of 
                    doing this if it weren t for you.    POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       9


      This surprises Becca.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    I had nightmares for three years 
                    after dad died and every night, you 
                    came into my room and stayed with 
                    me until I fell back asleep. You 
                    made me feel safe again when I 
                    never thought I would.
                          (A beat)
                    I ll be okay.

      Becca nods, and after a moment --

                                  BECCA
                    Your father would ve seen this 
                    coming.  On the day you were born, 
                    he picked you up, walked you over 
                    to the window so you could see 
                    outside, and said  Michael 
                      Winstone... meet the world.  
                    World... meet Michael Winstone. 
                          (beat)
                    If only he d said something like, 
                     Meet Maryland...   I d let you go 
                    anywhere in Maryland.

                                    MICHAEL
                    That s not really true.

      In a much needed moment of levity, they both laugh.

                                  BECCA
                      So...we ll need to put you on a new 
                    cell phone plan because I m 
                    expecting lots of texts, and lots 
                    of calls.

      Michael leaps from the bed, and hugs his mother tight.  After 
      they part, Becca pulls a SUITCASE from the closet.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don t need a suitcase that big.  
                    Anything important enough to keep -

      She holds up a hand, stops him.

                                  BECCA
                    My son is not going to Rome for 
                    four months with a carry-on.

      He laughs.  And as they start to gather things to pack, Becca  
      grabs A FRAMED PHOTO of the THREE of them together - herself, 
      Paul and Michael - and slips it into his suitcase.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       10



      Amidst a sea of travelers, CAMERA finds Becca.  Blood shot 
      eyes betray her lack of sleep.  REVERSE TO the gate door 
      opening to reveal EIGHT-YEAR-OLD Michael, escorted from the 
      plane by MARTIN REDFORD, older, handsome, a seasoned edge.  

      Michael spots his mother and starts running.  Becca takes her 
      son in her arms, tears streaming down her face.  She holds 
      him as though she ll never let go.

      Martin hangs back, knowing it s best to let them have this 
      moment alone.  Becca looks up at him, eyes wet.

                                  BECCA
                    Thank you, Martin.

      He nods, pained.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    I want to come back with you.  I 
                    want to help -

                                  MARTIN
                    There s nothing you can do.  Stay 
                    here... be a mom.

      As Becca nods and hangs on to Michael, we HEAR --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Mom.  Mom.

      They pull apart to reveal eighteen-year-old Michael standing 
      before her.  And we are now --


      -- with contemporary Becca and Michael saying good-bye.  She 
      shakes the memory off.

                                  BECCA
                    Hey, I m letting you go to Rome.  I 
                    can get a little mushy if I want. 
                    Look, I made this for you.

      She unfolds a MAP OF ROME.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    This is the university here, and 
                    your dorm s here.  I marked the

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    most direct route from each of them 
                    to the American embassy.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Thanks.  Mary gave me a pamphlet 
                    about STDs.

                                  BECCA
                    Let s live forever as if you didn t 
                    just tell me that.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Okay, so... I made something for 
                    you too.  For us, I mean.

      He shows her a TEXT WORD on his phone, made from a short 
      string of NUMBERS, LETTERS AND SYMBOLS: 235@W 

                                  BECCA
                    Is this a curse word?

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s code.  Twenty-three is my 
                    jersey number, then five because 
                    the heart is the fifth largest 
                    organ in the body,  at  W followed 
                    by the symbol for prime.  You re 
                    the head of the family, you re 
                    Winstone Prime.  So, all together 
                    it means  I love you .

                                  BECCA
                    Couldn t you just text  I love you? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Not in front of my friends.

                                  BECCA
                          (touched)
                    Okay.  Winstone Prime, I like that.

      Becca smiles, kisses him on the cheek.  She steps back but 
      this time it s Michael who pulls her into a tight embrace. 


      Returning from the airport, Becca steps inside, hangs her 
      keys on the hook...and then she stops, looks around.  The 
      silence hits her like a chill.  It s that moment all mothers 
      dread... the day their children grow up.  But before it can 
      get too bad, her cell phone CHIMES.  She picks it up, opens 
      the phone to reveal a text from Michael: 235@W   Just six 
      little symbols, but in this moment,  it s everything Becca 
      needs.  And off her smile --  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       12



      Becca wakes up in the morning.  She checks her phone first 
      thing and she finds TWO TEXTS from Michael:

       Just landed a-ok ciao 

       Architecture studio here is epic!! 


      We SEE A PHOTO OF MICHAEL IN FRONT OF THE VATICAN, with the 
      caption  C I m even going 2 church .

      PULL BACK from Becca s PHONE to find her looking at it in the 
      produce section.  She proudly shows it to the 20-YEAR-OLD 
      CLERK stocking melons and questioning his life choices.

                                  BECCA
                    My son is in Rome.

                                  CLERK
                    Hooray for him.


      Becca works on a bouquet and listens to MARY, her best friend 
      and co-owner in the shop.  Always perfectly put together, she 
      could easily be mistaken for a local news anchor.

                                  MARY
                    Do I look like a chair to you?

                                  BECCA
                    Depends.  Chippendale or folding?

                                  MARY
                      Apparently Phil thinks I m part of 
                    the furniture.  One of those pieces 
                    in the corner that you forget is 
                    there until you need somewhere to 
                    set your hot dog.

                                  BECCA
                    Phil sets hot dogs on you?

                                  MARY
                    Not in weeks, honey.  Not in weeks.

      Becca s CELL PHONE RINGS.  Mary gets to it first.

                                  MARY (CONT D)
                    Hello, lover boy... Yes, your 
                    mother s right here but she doesn t 
                    want to talk to you.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       13


      Becca tries to get the phone.  Mary twists away.

                                  MARY (CONT D)
                    You ll just have to settle for me. 
                    Your mom says you call entirely too 
                    much, she s sick of the sound of -

      Becca finally wrests the phone away.

                                  BECCA
                    Hi, baby.  Hang on, I m going to 
                    put you on face time.

      She sets it so they can SEE HIM.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Where are you?

                                    MICHAEL
                    At a friend s apartment.  Look what 
                    you can see...

      He holds the phone up and she sees the TREVI FOUNTAIN down 
      the street, tiny on the phone compared to the patterned metal 
      grating on the window itself.

                                  BECCA
                    The Trevi Fountain, right?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yeah, but the real story s in the 
                    building behind it.  There was a 
                    prince that lived there who jumped 
                    and killed himself because of a 
                    broken heart.  His father had the 
                    original architect come back and 
                    seal off the room he jumped from.  
                    No one has been in there in, like, 
                    six hundred years.  Man, what I d 
                    give to get in there...

                                  BECCA
                    If anyone can, you will.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Studio molto duro, momma.

                                  BECCA
                      Impressive.  What s it mean?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m studying very hard.  Gotta run. 
                    Call you tomorrow?  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       14


                                  BECCA
                    Tomorrow it is.  I love you.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I love you, too.

      He hangs up.  Becca turns to Mary..

                                  BECCA
                    Did you really give my son a 
                    pamphlet on STDs?

                                  MARY
                    Honey, he is in Europe.


      Becca wakes up, rolls over, checks her phone.  No texts.


      Becca gets into bed at the end of the day, checking her phone 
      one last time.  Still no texts.


      Becca and Mary help a delivery man load the van.

                                  MARY
                    It wasn t like he made a big deal 
                    out of it.  I reached for his hand, 
                    and he just moved it.  Slid it away 
                    on the table, you know?

      Becca checks her phone for the umpteenth time.

                                  MARY (CONT D)
                    Becca!  Are you even listening?

                                  BECCA
                    I haven t heard from him in four 
                    days.  We haven t gone four days 
                    without contact since he born.   POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       15


                                  MARY
                    Honey, he s eighteen-years-old, on 
                    his own for the first time in Rome.  
                    He s probably up to his neck in 
                    Italian p...
                          (catching herself)
                    - izza.

                                  BECCA
                    You re right.  Totally right.
                          (deep breath)
                    Okay.  Better.  Thanks.

                                  MARY
                    Thank God.  I was afraid I was 
                    gonna have to share my Xanax.


      Becca pours a cup of tea from the teapot Michael brought her 
      from Vienna ten years ago.  As she sips, the phone rings.  
      She jumps to it, sees the 011 INTERNATIONAL CODE.

                                  BECCA
                      Michael...

      Silence, and then the worst words a parent can ever hear:

                                  VOICE (FUTZED)
                    Is this Mrs. Winstone?

      And off Becca, blood draining from her face --


      Becca pulls up in front of Mary s apartment and Mary gets in. 
      Becca pulls away immediately.

                                  MARY
                    Take it easy.  I m sure there s a 
                    simple explanation, he s fine -

                                  BECCA
                    They said he moved out of the dorm 
                    two weeks ago.  He missed three 
                    lectures.  He s out of the program, 
                    Mary.

                                  MARY
                    That doesn t sound like Michael.

      Becca shakes her head.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       16


                                  BECCA
                    No... something s happened to my 
                    son.


      Becca and Mary sit across from FRANK STORCH, a middle-aged 
      detective with a paunch and an ingrown toenail that s killing 
      him.  Becca is focused, but under that, frightened.

                                  BECCA
                    I ve already alerted the American 
                    Embassy.  I need you to file an 
                    official report with both the 
                    Italian Police and Interpol.

                                  DETECTIVE STORCH
                    And say what exactly?  You got a 
                    kid on his own in the most romantic 
                    city on earth, and he hasn t called 
                    his mommy?

                                  MARY
                    Get out your handcuffs,  cause I m 
                    about to assault an officer.

      Becca scans his desk.  Takes A PHOTO OF HIS FAMILY and points 
      to his LITTLE GIRL.

                                  BECCA
                    What s her name?

                                  DETECTIVE STORCH
                    Katie.  Why?

                                  BECCA
                    Katie hasn t called you in five 
                    days.  She promised she would, and 
                    for a while she did.  And then she 
                    just stopped.  She doesn t answer 
                    her phone, or return your calls.

      Storch looks at the photo, Katie s happy face.  Softens.

                                  DETECTIVE STORCH
                    I ll file the reports.

                                  BECCA
                    How long will that take?

                                  DETECTIVE STORCH
                    On my end, right away.  On theirs, 
                    who knows.  It s Italy.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       17


      ON BECCA AND MARY as they share a look.  Becca doesn t like 
      that answer.  A NEW VOICE ASKS HER:

                                    CUSTOMS AGENT (PRE-LAP)
                    What is your purpose in Italy?


      BACKGROUND MATCH and we see that Becca is at customs in Rome.  
      A living airport - teeming with people, most of them as 
      frustrated with the wait as the BABY CRYING behind Becca.

                                  BECCA
                    I m here to visit my son.

      He SWIPES her passport, stamps it, and she s on her way.


      Becca rides through the tight, crowded streets of Rome.  With 
      her window down she is almost a part of the conversations, 
      lover s spats and hawking vendors, all punctuated by the 
      impatient HORN of her driver and the buzz of Vespas passing.  
      The streets swirl with life - you can almost smell the fresh 
      bread, coffee and cigarettes that infuse the air.  

      Becca - her mind only on Michael - notices none of it.


      A BELL - a class ends.  KIDS spill out and Becca (her one 
      piece of luggage - a shoulder bag - in tow) approaches TONY, 
      a boy she recognizes from one of Michael s videos, walking 
      with ANOTHER BOY.

                                  BECCA
                    Tony?  It s Tony, right?

                                  TONY
                    Do I know you?

                                  BECCA
                    I got your name from the office.  
                    I m Michael Winstone s mother.

                                  TONY
                    Okay, that s not weird at all.  I 
                    gotta go to class.

      The three of them walk, pushing through the crowded halls.

                                  BECCA
                    He moved off campus.  You have any 
                    idea where?  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       18


                                  TONY 
                    He got an apartment.  Some dude had 
                    a place to sublet, it was too good 
                    a deal to pass up.

                                  BECCA
                    You know the address?
                          (Off of his look)
                    He s not in trouble or anything, I 
                    just came a long way to see him.

                                  TONY
                    I only went there once.  It was 
                    somewhere on Via Della Paneterria, 
                    but that s all I remember.

                                  BECCA
                    Thank you.

                                  TONY
                    You see him, tell him he still owes 
                    me for the soccer ticket.


      Becca bounds up the stairs to the apartment.  KNOCKS.  No 
      answer.  Tries the handle and is surprised - it s unlocked.


      Becca - ENTERS - eyes sweeping the room - alert.  Stately - 
      high ceilings - four hundred years of Italian romance in its 
      walls - definitely not furnished by an American teenage boy.

                                  BECCA
                    Michael?

      The apartment is still except for a LONE FLY buzzing.

      Becca finds A HALF-EATEN BREAKFAST, rotted and crawling with 
      ants, as if it was simply abandoned mid meal.  She picks up a 
      cereal box - Frosty-O s.  A chill runs down her spine as she   POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       20


      realizes she is in the right place.  She looks at the half-
      eaten meal, its terrible meaning hitting her.

      She finds HIS PHONE, still on the charger.  Becca scrolls 
      through RECENT CALLS as she moves through the apartment, 
      which is filled with Michael s stuff: clothes in messy piles; 
      school books still laying open on the desk.  In RECENT CALLS 
      she sees  Mom , and several to  Francesca.   Francesca has a 
      cell and a work number.  

      Becca auto-dials the cell.  VOICE MAIL answers, a generic 
      Italian mechanized voice.  

      She dials the work number.  In <Italian>:

                                  VOICE (FUTZED)
                    <You have reached Il Rapace. We are 
                    open every night from seven p.m.-->

      Becca hangs up and pockets the phone as she goes into --

      THE BEDROOM.  The bed is ruffled and unmade, obviously having 
      had two people in it.  Michael s clothes hang in the closet.

      Becca takes out MICHAEL S MILANO JERSEY.  She lifts it and 
      inhales his smell.

                                  BECCA
                    Where are you, baby?

      SHE HEARS THE FRONT DOOR - hurries toward it - A MAN closes 
      the door, unaware of her.  Then she sees -

      THE GUN in his hand!  She backs away - The floor CREAKS.  He 
      whips his head around - screws a silencer on to his pistol.

      Becca frantically searches for another way out of the 
      apartment, but they are on a high floor.  She's trapped!  She 
      grabs the only thing she can - A WOODEN HANGER - from the 
      closet - and hides in the shadows.

      The Man approaches, entering the room gun first...

      Suddenly, BECCA IS ON HIM!  The wooden hanger around his 
      forearm, bending it back - his wrist almost snaps and he 
      drops the gun - she kicks the gun under the bed - 

      The Man elbows her in the chest, knocking the wind out of 
      her.  He picks her up and tosses her across the dresser, she 
      falls hard on the other side - 

      Becca s eyes - surprise, fear - and then focus.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       21


      He grabs her by the foot to pull her out of the corner, and 
      she twists and kicks him across the face with her other foot. 
      He lets go, she rolls to her feet -

      He comes at her again, but she s ready - she meets him blow 
      for blow - playing defense - deflecting his rapid volley of 
      punches.

      Wait a minute -- this is Becca!  Housewife... mother... WTF?

      At the front door - A NEIGHBOR PASSING - sees them fighting 
      and hurries away -

      Becca - rusty - tiring - he grabs her - throws her so hard 
      against the wall that the plaster actually CRACKS.

      He comes at her - it takes all her will power to roll across 
      the bed - she reaches for the gun - but he shoves the bed, 
      driving her back against the wall - she jumps vertically, 
      landing on the bed on her feet as it hits the wall -

      She jumps to the floor - decides then and there - no more 
      playing defense.  She grabs a GLASS PERFUME BOTTLE WITH A 
      POINTED GLASS TOP from the dresser and uses it like a knife, 
      driving him back with thrusts and slices.

      She picks up the WOODEN HANGER again and uses the hook end to 
      yank him.  He lurches forward with the momentum -

      She rolls behind him - kicks his knees out from under him - 
      he drops to his knees - she grabs the lamp cord and wraps it 
      around his neck.  In FLAWLESS ITALIAN:

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    <Where is my son??>

                                  MAN
                    <Who the hell are you?>

      She tightens the cord.

                                  BECCA
                    <Tell me what happened to my son!>

      TIGHT AS: The Man pulls a hidden knife from his boot and 
      thrusts it back at her!

      Acting on pure instinct, Becca SNAPS HIS NECK!  She stands 
      over the dead body - breath heaving - face in shock - looking 
      down in horror at the dead man at her feet.

      That s right... Becca Winstone is more than a soccer mom.


                                  END OF ACT ONE  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       22


                                        ACT TWO


      Becca as we left her, standing over the body.  Dazed -  

      But only for a moment.  Senses sharpen.  From outside - A 
      POLICE SIREN - wah-WAH - coming closer.  She goes into 
      action.

      The dead man s gun - RRRACK!  SNAP!  Check the clip! - wiping 
      prints off the closet door handle - off the cereal box - 
      examining the crack where the thug smashed her into the wall - 
      extracting one of her own hairs from the crack - no traces.

      BRAKES SQUEAL.  SIREN STOPS.  Becca hears it but she won t be 
      hurried.  She s on her own clock now, ice in her veins.  She 
      pulls out Michael s phone and SNAPS A PHOTO of the dead man.  
      The next instant she s at the window...


      A suave man around Becca s age is asleep beside A BEAUTIFUL 
      YOUNG WOMAN.

      His cell phone RINGS and he gropes for the alarm clock and 
      looks at it, surprised at how late it is.  He answers.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Ciao?

      This is GIANCARLO;  twenty years with Interpol.  Always wears 
      the same suit but it s still somehow always in style.  
      Becca s age but a Bad Boy.  You try hard not to fall in love 
      with him, then wind up doing it anyway.  It practically ruins 
      your life...but you d do it again.

      THE CONVERSATION IS INTERCUT.

      Becca speaks in flawless <ITALIAN>:

                                  BECCA
                    <Will you meet me?>

      A long silence.  No answer.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    <Hello?>

      Giancarlo sits up on the edge of the bed, nude but for the 
      strategic sheet.  He seems stunned.  After a bit:

                                  BECCA (ON PHONE) (CONT D)
                    <I need to see you.  You know 
                    where.>
                          (A beat. In English)
                    Please.

      She hangs up.  Giancarlo sits there for a long moment in 
      stunned silence, mind whirling.  He finds his clothes, pulls 
      his pants on.  He leans over the sleeping woman, kisses her 
      cheek.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    I m sorry, I have to go.

      With a drowsy, knowing smile:

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                    Certo lei fa.

       Of course you do.   Giancarlo gets dressed fast, well 
      practiced at leaving women s apartments in a hurry.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       24



      Becca s face - 10 years younger - stares at us from a monitor.  
      In a sophisticated, surveillance room rife with screens and 
      equipment, A TECHNICIAN in front of the screen holds a phone.   POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       26


                                  DAX (O.S.)
                    Is she one of ours or not?


      Male and female STAFFERS tap keyboards, stare at screens.  
      Dax comes to a stop behind the chair of the very Technician 
      he was talking to, an Asian-American with the unlikely last 
      name of FITZPATRICK.  

                                  DAX
                          (without skipping a beat)
                      Fitzpatrick, what are our 
                      inferences?  Go.

                    Rebecca Winstone, active nineteen-
                    ninety to two-thousand.

      A PHOTO OF MARTIN REDFORD comes up on SCREEN.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       27


                                    FITZPATRICK (CONT D)
                    She was trained my Martin Redford, 
                    one of his last.  Apparently they 
                    were close back then -

                                  DAX
                    Lovers?

                                    FITZPATRICK
                    No.  All indications are he was a 
                    father figure to her.  But they 
                    haven t spoken in almost ten years.

                                  DAX
                    What about real family?

      Martin s PHOTO goes down and PAUL AND MICHAEL come up.

                                    FITZPATRICK

                                  DAX
                    And where s he?

                                    FITZPATRICK
                    KIA, October two-thousand.

      The Field Coordinator is a laser focused Pakistani career 
      woman named RABIA.  Raised in St. Louis, she has no accent.

                                  RABIA
                    Killed by Russian Intel in a car 
                    bombing.  Legend given out was that 
                    it was terrorists, neo-Fascists, 
                    and he was a random civilian.

                                  DAX
                    And then she quits.  Convenient.

                                  RABIA
                    She accepted a full benefits 
                    package upon retirement. 

      Dax frowns and scans the data on the screen in front of him, 
      alongside Becca s picture.

                    What s this  PFA ?  Is that some

                                    FITZPATRICK 
                    Uh, sir... that s the Parent

                                  RABIA
                    She s basically spent the past ten 
                    years on the PTA and as a scout 
                    leader.

                    don t kill ex-SISDE assassins.

      He continues staring at Becca s photo.  Another STAFFER looks 
      over from a phone.

                                    STAFFER
                    Sir, we re about to get a visit.  A 
                    SISDE colonel.  Wants to talk.

                                  DAX
                    Of course he does.
                          (To the room)
                    I want Becca Winstone in my 
                      interrogation room before this 
                    coffee gets cold.


      Heavy drapes, intense spots of halogen light.  Strips of glow-
      in-the-dark safety tape adorn the dancers  shirts and pants.

      Becca walks in and scans the crowd.  She takes out Michael s 
      cell phone and pushes a key on its auto-dial.  Watches.

      A COCKTAIL WAITRESS responds to a ring, takes her cell out of 
      her hip pocket and looks at the read-out.  This is FRANCESCA - 
      olive skin, flowing hair, enormous wet eyes.  Stunning.  She 
      looks shocked by the number that comes up.  She looks around 
      with a furtive glance and answers nervously.

                                  FRANCESCA
                    Mikey?  Is that you?

      She looks over her shoulder and is surprised again.  Standing 
      right behind her is:

                                  BECCA
                    No.  It s his mother.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       29


      Francesca recovers.  She clicks off the phone, then turns 
      away from Becca to deliver beers and Camparis to a table.

                                  FRANCESCA
                    I think you dialed the wrong 
                    number.

                                  BECCA
                    Really.  You re going with that.

      Francesca looks around, nervous.

                                  FRANCESCA
                    I can t talk now, too busy.  Meet 
                    me on my break, twenty minutes.  
                    You know the Arch of Constantine?


      Secure.  Floor to ceiling opaque glass.  Dax sits across from 
        a civilian-suited SISDE COLONEL.  AIDES from both sides 
      MURMUR urgently on phones, TAP NOTES on lap tops.

                    We acknowledge that at one time she 
                    was stationed in your country -

                                    COLONEL
                    You know she has a son in Rome?  We 
                    just learned this.  She s asking 
                    about him at his school, says he s 
                    gone missing.

                                  DAX
                    We re aware, and we re on it.  Now 
                    let s talk about your man.  His 
                    apartment was ten thousand Euros a 
                    month.  Either he was working for 
                    someone, or you fellows have a hell 
                    of a retirement package.

                                    COLONEL
                    We are going to bring her in.

                                  DAX
                    You don t want to do that.  She s a 
                    U.S. national, we ll deal with her.

                                    COLONEL
                    How about this then, Deputy 
                    Director Miller. We will see who 
                    finds her first.

      Becca - mad as a cobra, pushes her way to the BARTENDER.

                                  BECCA
                    Francesca - I need to talk to her.

                    me no more.  Bye-bye baby, bye-bye.

      She slips a twenty Euro bill across the bar.

                                  BECCA
                    I need her address.


      Becca comes up the stairs.  Sees the door ajar.  Goes still. 


      Becca - at the door - cautiously enters...

                                  BECCA
                      Francesca? 

      She steps around a corner.  Pauses.  Her lips breathe a soft -  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       34


                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Oh no.

      She enters the BEDROOM.  Steps over a HALF-PACKED SUITCASE.  
      Stops at the bed.  Looks down. 

      Francesca, sprawled across her bed in her underwear...  DEAD.

                                      ACT THREE


      Steaming HOT WATER pours into a stand alone TUB. 

      Becca steps out of her pants.  Reaching to lift her shirt, 
      however, she winces in pain.  Looking in the mirror, she sees 
      her ribs, badly bruised.


      Giancarlo sits against the wall, a glass of SCOTCH in hand.

                                  BECCA (O.S.)
                      Giancarlo...

      He stands attentively, and with him we enter -


      - to find Becca standing, shirt still on, her helplessness 
      betrayed by a look.  Giancarlo approaches -

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Turn around.  This may hurt a bit.

      He gently raises her arm, and lifts her shirt off.  Dropping 
      it to the floor, he takes a moment to look over her body, 
      battered but still beautiful.  He unsnaps her bra.  Then, 
      always the gentleman, he turns, faces away.

                                  GIANCARLO (CONT D)
                    I think you can handle the rest.

      Becca turns her head to look at him.  Both faces reveal 
      they re reminded of their history.  Both know it s not the 
      time to bring it up.

      Turning back, Becca disrobes, steps into the bath. 

                                  BECCA
                    What s going to happen when they 
                    find out you have a fugitive in 
                    your bathtub?

                                  GIANCARLO
                    I ll plead extenuating 
                      circumstances.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       37


      He hears her settle in.  Giancarlo takes a WASHCLOTH, moves 
      to the side of the tub and takes a seat.  Reaching for her 
      arm, he begins the process of cleaning her wounds.  It s 
      gentle, caring.

                                  BECCA
                    Did you ever get married?

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Twice.  The second one damn near 
                    took, but she wised up.

      She laughs softly.

                                  GIANCARLO (CONT D)
                          (smiling)
                    My pain amuses you?

      Becca shakes her head...then looks up.

                                  BECCA
                    You understand I had to decide... 
                    back then.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    For both of us?

                                  BECCA
                    For my husband and my son.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    You decided for yourself.  

      Becca is stung.

                                  BECCA
                    Maybe a little.  You ll never 
                    change.  If I had left them, you 
                    would have gotten bored and moved 
                    on in a month.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Tell yourself that, if it helps.

      They sit in silence for a moment.

                                  GIANCARLO (CONT D)
                    It s a long time gone.  
                          (a beat)
                    We ll find your boy.


      Becca alone on Giancarlo s bed, scanning photos and videos 
      Michael sent to her on her iPad.  Having hit a dead end, she   POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       38


      is searching for clues, anything that might lead her to  the 
      next step in finding Michael.  

      She notices an older file, clicks on it, and brings up an OLD 
      HOME MOVIE.  We HEAR Michael s voice as a child -  Ready or 
      not, here I come. 

      IN THE VIDEO: Someone is following Michael with a handheld 
      video recorder.  There are a BUNCH OF KIDS and their parents 
      celebrating Michael s birthday in the b.g.  Michael goes 
      through the back yard of their house, searching.  The CAMERA 
      briefly swings down to show the HIGH HEEL SHOES of the 
      videographer.

                                  MARY (O.S.)
                    Slow down, I m in heels...

      WE PUSH IN ON THE VIDEO and jump the frame... 


      -- PULL BACK from the iPad, and into the present world where 
      Becca sits on Giancarlo s bed, missing Michael, utterly lost. 
      She looks at the BLINKING RED LIGHT, then - an idea! -

      She goes through the photos on the iPad until she arrives at 
      a SHOT of Michael by his window.  And there, in front of the 
      jewelry store across the street, she sees it...a RED LIGHT.

      ZOOMING IN, we see that it belongs to a SECURITY CAMERA.


      TIGHT SHOTS of Becca quietly loading a number of items into a 
      DUFFLE -- FLOUR, an EXTENSION CORD, A PAIR OF TONGS.


      Empty but for a few boxes in the corner.  Eyeing the distance 
      to the front wall, Becca picks a spot on the floor, starts 
      prying up floorboards.


      Quiet.  Dark.  Until a CEILING PANEL shifts, allowing a shaft 
      of light to break through. Further still and we reveal Becca, 
      reaching down and tossing a handful of FLOUR across the room.  

      Drifting to the floor, the flour ILLUMINATES LASER BEAMS 
      crisscrossing the room.  Becca eyes her spot.

      Moments later, she drops though the ceiling, both feet wedged 
      in a loop of EXTENSION CORD.  Her hands feed cord up, 
      controlling her descent.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       40


      Landing, she tosses more FLOUR, then carefully carves a path 
      through the laser beams to the back of the store.


      Becca takes a seat at the desk, wakes the computer, and 
      within moments is staring at SURVEILLANCE CAMERA POV out the 
      front of the store, Michael s building visible in the b.g.

      Scrolling through the log, she arrives at a date:  OCTOBER 
      3rd.  The display window goes black.  Becca leans closer.  
      CAMERA pushes in over her until our entire FRAME is BLACK--

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      looking at a BLACK CARGO VAN.

      Down the street, we find Michael amid VARIOUS PEDESTRIANS.  A 
      YOUNG MAN climbs off a Vespa, approaches Michael -

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Si scusa, lei ha il tempo?

                                    MICHAEL
                          (checking his watch)
                    S , undici trenta. 

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Grazie.

      Michael moves on, the YOUNG MAN following a few steps back.  
      A BIGGER MAN exits a bakery, falls into stride beside 
      Michael. Painfully unaware of what is unfolding around him, 
      Michael continues up the street, fast approaching the BLACK 
      VAN.

      Young Man picks up the pace, moving in closer behind Michael.  
      He nods to a face in the side mirror, and suddenly the back 
      doors burst open -- two more MEN move quickly toward Michael.  
      Instinctively, he slows.  The two behind grab Michael, 
      covering his mouth.  Frantic now, he struggles, but against 
      the momentum of four, it s futile.

      Though clearly terrified, Michael glances down as they push 
      him toward the van -- MOTION SLOWS as we see his POV of the 
      LICENSE PLATE -- then accelerating to NORMAL SPEED as Michael 
      is shoved into the van.  Just before the doors close, Michael 
      wrenches his head around, stares straight across the street 
      at the jewelry store, catching the GLEAM of a camera lens... 
      His breath coming IN PANTING BURSTS.  FREEZE FRAME--  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       41



      -- PULL BACK OUT so we are now looking at 2D SECURITY FOOTAGE 
      OF MICHAEL.  That same moment he s being shoved in the van. 
      He s looking at the security camera lens. 

      Becca has FROZEN THE IMAGE.  CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.  She ZOOMS in 
      on Michael s face.  On his panicked eyes -

      The short panicked BREATHS CONTINUE... But now we realize 
      they re BECCA S -- experiencing every mother s worst 
      nightmare.  Helpless.

      Her wide, staring eyes looking straight into her son s.  Her 
      eyes brighten, grow wet.  For the first time, her tears flow 
      freely.

                                        ACT FOUR


      Giancarlo is asleep on the couch when Becca enters, frantic.

                                  BECCA
                    I saw him!  I saw Michael.

                                  GIANCARLO
                          (Jolted awake)
                    Gesu Cristo!

                                  BECCA
                    He was taken.


      Becca on a mission.  I-Pad out.  Fingers moving.  Looking for 
      one video of the utmost importance.  She finds it, and 
      Giancarlo is over her shoulder watching as Michael is grabbed 
      and thrown in the van.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Partial plate.  It s French.

      He heads toward his office...

                                  GIANCARLO (CONT D)
                    Let s see if we can -

                                  DAX (PRE-LAP)
                    - find her.  This is ridiculous.  
                    Somebody tell me something.


      The screens explode with scattered images.  CCTV.  Satellite.  
      Security cameras trained everywhere. 

                                    FITZPATRICK
                    Nothing.  No sight.  No sound.

                                  DAX
                    She can t just disappear.  Who s 
                    got ears on the locals?

                                  PETERSON
                    Report of a break-in.

                                  DAX
                    Where?

      As Peterson turns to answer Dax, we INTERCUT WITH:  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       43



      Giancarlo taps away at the keyboard on his computer as Becca, 
      twisting her wedding band, is now the one looking over his 
      shoulder.  The computer compares various number and letter 
        combinations of the last bit of the license plate.

                                  BECCA
                    You can run the border crossings...

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Some things never change.

                                  BECCA
                    What do you mean?

                                  GIANCARLO
                    You.  Telling perfectly capable 
                    people how to do their jobs.

                                  BECCA
                    I never did that.  There, those 
                    two!  Those two plates.  Run those.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    So glad you never did that.

      As Giancarlo works, she paces.

                                  BECCA
                    Why haven t they made any demands? 
                    Or contacted me?  Or anyone!  What 
                    the hell do they want with him?


      Lots of motion.  Video.  Every agent on a phone or headset.

                                  DAX
                    Let s go, people.  Work.  Faster.

                                    FITZPATRICK
                    Think I got her!

      Dax rushes to the monitor to find a figure ducking into an 
      alley next to the jewelry store.

                                  DAX
                    Closer.

      Fitzpatrick taps a button and the video shutters closer.  It 
      freezes a moment as the focus is adjusted -- and there she 
      is.  Becca.  A pretty decent profile shot.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       44


                                  DAX (CONT D)
                    What were you after?

                                  RABIA
                    Italian police are reporting 
                    nothing stolen from the store.

      Dax stares at the image of Becca.  Thinks.  A furtive smile.

                                  DAX
                    Tell them to pull the store s 
                    security footage.


      The report from Interpol comes back.  Giancarlo and Becca 
      scan the document listing every vehicle with the last three 
      digits from the security camera.


      The entire room looks at A FREEZE FRAME of Michael being 
      loaded into the van. 

                                  DAX
                    Someone better be running those 
                    plates!  We find that van, we find 
                    Winstone.


      Giancarlo focuses on one of the entries on the Interpol 
      report: a black Van.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    It s registered to a French import-
                    export company dealing in artifacts 
                    from Burma, Laos, couple of others.


      All men on deck.  The camera feeds show cars crossing 
      borders, customs checks, airport lines, train tracks.

                                    FITZPATRICK
                    Beast!

                                  DAX
                      Translation please.

      Fitzpatrick spins in his chair to face Dax.

                                    FITZPATRICK
                    The van crossed into France six 
                    hours after the abduction.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       45


                                  DAX
                    Alright. Ladies and Gentlemen. Mrs. 
                    Winstone cannot cross the border 
                    into France.  Let s go get her.

      The order has been given and, although it doesn t seem 
      possible to ramp up the electricity in the room - they do.


      On Giancarlo, as Becca packs what little she has.  She s just 
      focused.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    You can t go.
                          (No response)
                    Becca.

      Nothing.  Giancarlo watches for beat before he goes to a 
      closet, opens a safe and pulls out a  fly away bag : money, 
      gun, first aid kit.  He turns.  Becca is standing behind him.

                                  BECCA
                    You re not coming.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    The hell I m not.

                                  BECCA
                    You ve risked enough.  By the time 
                    you get dressed, I ll be gone.

      Giancarlo sits with this.  He knows her.  She s right.  He 
      tosses her the  fly away bag .

                                  GIANCARLO
                    God help whoever has him.


      Shoulders bumped.  Bags wheeled.  Italian clarion calls for 
      someone to find their gate.

      A massive sea of a tour group, all wearing the same red, 
      white and green Italian pee caps, pour over their duty free 
      bags.  Becca stands in the midst of them.  Her eyes scan the 
      Air France departure sign: PARIS - 11:35 p.m.  Current time: 
      9:45 p.m.

      Becca - walking.  She passes through a clearly American 
      family struggling to keep bags and children and passports 
      together.  She brushes past the AMERICAN MOTHER, who gives 
      her an overwhelmed look of helplessness.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       46



      Peterson s eyes go wide and he spins in his chair.

                                  PETERSON
                    Holy crap...sir.  I got her!

      Dax rushes over as Peterson plays VIDEO of Becca at the 
      airport.

                                  DAX
                    How long ago was that?

                                  PETERSON
                      Twenty-five minutes.

                                  DAX
                      Fitzpatrick?

                                    FITZPATRICK
                    Yeah, it s her.  Madeline Addleton 
                    just passed through customs at Da 
                    Vinci Airport.  That s a dead cover 
                    assigned to Becca Winstone in 2000.

      Dax gives Peterson his  pat on the back from Uncle Sam .

                                  DAX
                    How many agents do we have at the 
                    airport?

                                  RABIA
                    Four.

                                  DAX
                    Get them on her.


      The Italian Intelligence Colonel we met earlier is reading a 
      file when a staffer comes in.  In ITALIAN:

                                    STAFFER
                    <Sir.  We found her.  She s at Da 
                    Vinci.>

      He is up and out of his chair like a shot.


      Close on Becca s face as she walks through the terminal.   
      Travelers jockey for position all around her.  Two Italian 
      police saunter towards her as a SUITED MAN stops to talk to 
      them.  She ducks into a shop to buy a candy bar.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       47



      START ON the security CAMERA that takes a photo of every 
      person who passes through when they swipe their passports.

      PAN DOWN - FOUR CIA AGENTS hurry up to passport control and 
      are handed PHOTOGRAPHS, still wet from the printer, by the 
      Agent at the counter.  We DO NOT see the photos.  

      A moment after they run off - the Colonel and TWO OF HIS MEN 
      show up.  The Colonel barks at the agent in Italian.


      The CIA AGENTS, push through the line, guns drawn, glancing 
      from the photos in their hands to the faces around them.


      Becca stalks along - eyes pinned to every security camera.


      The beehive is buzzing, every eye in the room on the screens.  

                                  DAX
                    I can t get a visual.  Anybody see 
                    her?

                                  CIA AGENT 1
                    Yes, sir.  But we aren t alone.


      The Colonel and his SISDE AGENTS wave off Italian police as 
      they close in.  The CIA Agents pick up their pace.


      Dax leans into the radio.

                                  DAX
                    Take her.


      The agents grab her. Hands twist arms. Cries of pain. Chaos. 

                                    HUSBAND (O.S.)
                    What do you think you re doing?

      The CIA agents cuff her and throw her on her back only to 
      realize that it is THE TERRIFIED AMERICAN MOTHER.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       48


                                  CIA AGENT 1
                    Passport!  NOW!!!

                                    HUSBAND
                          (handing them all over)
                    Here!  They re all here!

      The CIA Agent flips through, finds one with Becca s photo.


      Dax scans the scene.

                                  DAX
                    Well?  You got her?

                                  CIA AGENT 1 (O.S.)
                    Negative.  She swapped passports.

      Dax shakes his head, disappointed but impressed.


      We see Becca board...a TRAIN!  Only now do we realize she was 
      in a different terminal all along.


      Becca sits in a seat as the train rockets through the night.  
      Her eyes play over her fellow passengers.  The Suited Man 
      from earlier is there.  A couple with a child.  A hemped out 
      hippie.  A Goth Girl.  A businessman plays solitaire.

      Becca removes a new phone from its casing, draws something up 
      on her I-Pad.  It s the number for the warehouse associated 
      with the black van.  She dials.  They converse in FRENCH:

                                  OPERATOR (O.S.)
                    <Good evening.>

                                  BECCA
                    <Yes.  Good evening.  I m calling 
                    from La Rouche and Company.  I have 
                    a driver aimlessly wandering the 
                    streets of Gentilly looking for 
                    your warehouse.>

                                  OPERATOR (O.S.)
                    <There is your problem.  Our 
                    warehouse is in Aubervilliers>.

      Becca writes down the address, gets up and EXITS.  A few 
      moments later the Suited Man also EXITS.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       49



      The lunch car.  Snacks.  Gin.  Cake.  Becca senses someone 
      follow her from the passenger car, keeps moving.  Pops her 
      head into a sleeper car - taken.  The next - empty.  She 
      enters...


      Becca waits.  She hears FOOTSTEPS in the corridor... waits... 
      then reaches out and grabs her tail and pulls her into the 
      room - GOTH GIRL - IT S ON!!!

      Hair pulling - flesh in nails - bruising shots to the ribs - 
      no-holds barred - Becca has her arm - twisted back - Goth 
      Girl (whose real name is VIOLET) jams a heel into Becca s toe 
      - Becca goes down - Goth Girl s elbow to Becca s back - Becca 
      rolling over, knee to Goth Girl s groin, painful with or 
      without balls.

                                  BECCA
                          (French)
                    <Why are you following me??>

      Nothing - a briefcase swung, Becca ducks, briefcase snaps 
      open, papers everywhere - Becca runs - shoulder drives Goth 
      Girl against the window -

      CRASH!!!  Wind whips in - papers tornado - fists and knees 
      and feet - Becca kicks Goth Girl s knee - we hear a crack - 
      and a cry of pain - Goth Girl responds - fist to the gut - 
      Becca out of breath, struggling to get to the door - no such 
      luck - Goth Girl grabs her ankle - trips her -

      Becca grabs A LETTER OPENER from the briefcase - knife fight - 
      swings and misses - swings and connects - cry!  Goth Girl 
      KNOCKS the letter opener from Becca s hand - Becca grabs her 
      neck - spins - drives her out the broken window -


      Becca struggles - veins popping - sweat stinging her eyes -

                                  BECCA
                          (Italian)
                    <Who sent you!?!>
                          (German)
                    <Where s my son!?!>
                          (Russian)
                    <WHERE IS MY SON!?!?  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       50



      The word rocks Becca -- quick tug -- Goth Girl in at the last 
      possible moment -- the tunnel engulfs the train.

                                  BECCA
                    You re CIA?

                                  GOTH GIRL
                    Someone wants to meet you.

                                  BECCA
                    I m not going in.

      Suddenly, Becca is TASED from behind!  She goes rigid and 
      collapses, REVEALING a TRAIN CONDUCTOR standing behind her.  
      He nods to Goth Girl.

      We are left with that and the rocking of the train...


                                  END OF ACT FOUR  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       51

      Becca paces, fuming.  She s wasting time here.  Finally Dax 
      comes in and she s on him at once.

                                  BECCA
                    You have no right to hold me -- no

                    What?

                                  BECCA
                    Not agent.  Mrs.  Now you listen to 
                    me.  My son has been kidnapped...

                                  DAX
                    We re aware.

                                  BECCA
                    Then you are also aware that the 
                    longer I stand here, the less 
                    likely it is that I get him back.

                                  DAX
                    We can help you retrieve him, but 
                    it has to be on our terms.

                                  BECCA
                    Your terms?
                          (a flare of anger)
                    I don t want the CIA involved with 
                    my family... ever... again.

                                  DAX (CONT D)
                    No, of course he doesn t.  We have

                                  BECCA
                    But I didn t.

      It s clear; she blames herself.  Dax looks around the room, 
      at the video cameras, the microphones.

                                  DAX
                    Can I buy you a cup of coffee?


      Dark; strange shadows cast by BUDDHAS and other religious 
      statues from the east.  Some of them seem to be watching her. 
      Becca has entered on A CATWALK above the statues.  She scans 
      the room, sees a HEAVY METAL LOCKED DOOR at the bottom of 
      some steps down by the offices. She starts along the catwalk.

      A LONE GUARD - coming up the catwalk, armed with a submachine 
      gun.  Before he sees her, Becca leaps over the side of the 
      catwalk and swings underneath it.  He walks along as she 
      swings the opposite way, monkey-bar style.  When he is right 
      above her, Becca drops to the floor, landing behind a statue.

      Becca crouches, works her way around, through the statues, 
      until she reaches the heavy metal door at the bottom of the 
      stairs.  It s unlocked.  She goes through.


      Becca finds a dimly lit CELL with a wooden door.  She hurries 
      to it and calls through the small barred window urgently:

                                  BECCA
                    Michael!  Michael, are you there?

      Getting no response, she picks the lock and goes inside.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       55



      Becca looks around the cell - but it is empty... Michael is 
      not here.  She stands still for a moment, emotion and 
      exhaustion washing over her.  Then she starts to head out, 
      until SHE SEES SOMETHING THAT STOPS HER IN HER TRACKS - 

      BECCA - in disbelief - slowly comes forward, sinks to her 
      knees - reaches out to run her fingers over:

      THEIR SECRET  I LOVE YOU  TEXT SYMBOL - 235@W  - carved into 
      the wall next to the door!  Michael was here!  Becca half 
      laughs, half cries, overwhelmed.  She is so focused on the 
      symbol she does not see A SHADOW moving on the wall...

      THE GUARD sees her, whipping his gun around as she rolls to 
      her feet, coming up under his gun - a BURST OF GUNFIRE 
      strafes the ceiling.  Becca disarms him - gets him around the 
      throat from behind - squeezes until he stops struggling, then 
      lays him down gently on his back.  She takes his machine gun.


      Becca comes back up the steps, gun first, making sure there 
      are no more guards.  There aren t.  She goes into:

      THE OFFICE.  She rifles through the desks - bookshelves - 
      looking for anything.  Rips through a FILE CABINET - nothing. 
      She goes to the computer.  

      Becca searches the desktop computer, until she finds the 
      office software for the GPS UNITS IN THE VANS.  She tracks 
      them, looking for the most recent one to leave the lot.  She 
      WRITES DOWN the address of its CURRENT LOCATION.

      Next, she goes through their financial records, rapidly.  We 
      can t make heads or tails of the numbers flying by, but we re 
      not Becca.  She looks out at the Buddhas, thinks.  Gets up.

      BACK IN THE WAREHOUSE she starts SHOOTING BUDDHAS with the 
      submachine gun.  The first two merely shatter, but - THE 
      THIRD BUDDHA BURSTS OPEN, spilling thousands of condoms full 
      of OPIUM onto the ground.

      Back to the desk.  She dials.  Waits.

                                  BECCA
                    Get me Deputy Chief Dax Miller.

      handcuffed by the office.

      Ortega hangs up. 


      Dax hangs up, then returns the land line Becca left off the 
      hook to its cradle.  He glances at the computer. Surprised - 
      he reaches out and takes a POST IT NOTE off of the screen.  
      CU ON THE NOTE: All it says is -  HE WAS HERE. 

      Rabia ENTERS.

                                  RABIA
                    Sir?  The alert?

      Torn.  A beat.  Dax finally nods. 

                                  DAX
                    Issue it.

      Rabia EXITS.  Dax tucks the note into his jacket pocket.


      Becca opens the front door, having picked the lock, and steps 
      into the realm of the super rich -- priceless antiques and an 
      amazing view of the EIFEL TOWER across the Seine.

      But there is something odd about the apartment too; there are  
      ninety million dollar paintings on the wall, but no personal 
      photos.  It is clean, meticulous, but has no personal 
      touches.

      Becca moves slowly down the hall, goes into the - 


      In THE CLOSET - Suits arranged dark to light.

      In THE DRAWER - Shirts and socks neatly folded and stacked. 
      She checks under the clothes but finds nothing.

      On THE NIGHT STAND - A book, some reading glasses, a water 
      glass.  She moves the book slightly, REVEALING a dust void.


      Becca ENTERS and looks over the things on the desk, rifles 
      through the drawers.  One of the drawers on the desk has no 
      handle, and when she tries to open it, seems to be locked.  
      But there is no keyhole, no visible way to unlock it.  She 
      looks under the desk, feels around.  Nothing.

      One of the other drawers strikes her as odd too.  She pulls 
      it all the way out, empties it.  She raps on the bottom with 
      her knuckles, then discovers the FALSE BOTTOM.  She takes the   POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       58


      false bottom out, feels around the edges.  One spot seems to 
      give... she presses it and...

      THE FIRST LOCKED DRAWER POPS OPEN.  It lets out a HISS, as if 
      it was hermetically sealed.  She slides it out.

      Becca goes through the files in the drawer.  One catches her 
      attention.  She takes it out, opens it... and freezes as ice 
      water runs up her spine. 

      THE FOLDER contains SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS OF MICHAEL, taken at 
      his school in Rome, around his Italian apartment building, on 
      dates with Francesca, at the AC Milan soccer game.

      Becca is absorbed in the photos, when she HEARS THE FRONT 
      DOOR OPEN.  She turns, surprised, and MORE PHOTOS fall out of 
      the folder.  She looks down...

                                  BECCA
                    What the hell..?

      She kneels - picks up the photos in disbelief - they are 
        SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of Michael and her back in the States, 
      before any of this started: Becca picking Michael up at 
      school when he was 10 - Becca coaching and Michael playing 
      soccer - Becca at his high school graduation - Michael 
      helping her carry groceries the day before he left.

      Becca is rocked; someone has been watching her son since 
      before he ever arrived in Italy!  She is stunned - confused -

      Becca grabs the photos and goes to the window - forces it 
      open - starts climbing out - HEARS A NOISE - looks back and 
      sees something that terrifies her - so much so that she - 

      LEAPS FROM THE LEDGE as A SHOT RINGS OUT!  THE BULLET HITS 
      HER!  She spins in the air -
