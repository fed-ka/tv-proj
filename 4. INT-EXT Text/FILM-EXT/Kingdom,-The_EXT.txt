A Muslim family sits together at a table under a tented-
canopy: 32 year-old MAN nervously chewing on a toothpick, and
his 8 and 15 year-old SONS. The 8yo leans his weight into an
old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his
Grandfather. He gently rubs the Boy's head with an ancient
left hand. The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script, right to
left, getting paint on the table. Read the translation: There
is no God but Allah.
The Grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the
head-wrap worn by some Muslim men. Never a clear view of his
face. His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to
them, the Son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that
toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: A Security
Gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of
compound. The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision,
most of which we can see from this high up.
The landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, on
the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal
monolithic shapes made more so by the heat.
Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now...
Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up from
his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a
softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinforced
walls that extend a mile in each direction. Played on the
only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage.

Sounds from the softball game much louder now, just over the
walls. Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you
get to the main gate. A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to
slow all entering vehicles: give machine-gun emplacements
flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles
if need be. Middle-Eastern Police platoons. 500 lbs. lift-
gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern
Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his
uniform. A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows
queues up. All the windows roll down: just a single, portly
White WOMAN behind the wheel, her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat
in front. Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom
of the Rover.
A brief exchange, as Haytham checks his ID:
DRIVER
How are you today, Sergeant?
HAYTHAM
Sun is shining. Wind is blowing.
How bad can I be doing?
DRIVER
I like that, "Sun is shining..."
A tight smile from Haytham.
The other Officers are checking the inside of the Rover now.
They nod to Haytham, Haytham hands the ID back to her.
Windows rolls up. Lift-gate goes up. Range Rover pulls away,
navigating the zig-zag jersey barriers.

Stay with the Range Rover as it moves deeper into the
complex. Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960: stucco
homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks,
concrete and rock where grass should be.
The Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top
sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN. A Police Land Cruiser
parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security.
Official markings, emergency lights in the grill.

The Son studies the compound through binoculars, while the
youngest Grandson squints to study the softball game:
Interest cut with jealousy. More muted cheers float. Behind
and above him, his Grandfather's voice, rough as sand, to his
32 year-old Son, in Arabic:
GRANDFATHER (O.C.)
Hang up the phone. If they're not
ready now, no words will change it.

Another Middle-Eastern POLICEMAN takes in the motley
competition: half-smiling, half-smirking at a plump-pink
White Man cheering on his plump-pink 9 year-old Son sliding
into third.
WHITE MAN
GET DIRTY!
Safe. Clapping and Hoots. The PITCHER: an older White Man in
his middle forties visibly frustrated. A 25 year-old African-
American Batter steps to the plate now. Pitcher turns to his
Fielders:
PITCHER
STEP IT UP NOW!
(back the Batter)
Ready for my knuckle-curve?
The Batter just stays focused as the Pitcher tosses a high-
lob. Batter smacks the ball a mile high, deep to left. The
teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third:
TEAMMATES
TAG UP! WAIT `TIL SHE CATCHES IT-
PITCHER
(spins, points up at the
ball)
-COMIN' HOME!
A 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball:
sets up, catches it, juggles it, drops it.
We pick up different families on the grass nearby: A young
WOMAN helps her five year old DAUGHTER untangle a yo-yo. A
black COUPLE doing a crossword puzzle together, the wife's
head on her husband's lap.

The muted reaction to the dropped ball. The whole Family,
save the youngest Grandson, intently focused on two Officers
walking up to that Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle
of the road, well inside the compound: no blinks now.
The youngest still enthralled by the softball game, the
cheers, the running, the shorts and t-shirts. We see his
Grandfather's left hand stop rubbing the Boy's head, and move
to the Boy's temple, placed like a blinder so he can't see
what's about to happen. In Arabic:
GRANDFATHER
Don't stop watching the game.
14

Noises from the softball game close again. Track these two
Officers on foot walking toward the Police Land Cruiser ala
shift change: nonchalant but quick.
15
16
The youngest Grandson wide-eyed, startled, watches as every
member of the Security Details in and around the Compound go
prairie dog: search with necks extended, eyes wide -- what
the fuck was that? The Boy tries to turn his head away from
the game to look for himself: Grandfather just pushes his
head back to the game, voice harder now, in Arabic:

GRANDFATHER (O.C.)
I said keep watching the game.
17

Haytham instantly sprints toward another nearby Police Land
Cruiser as most everyone else ducks. In Arabic:
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
LOCK DOWN!
Then points at the Officer in the Driver's seat:
SERGEANT HAYTHAM (CONT'D)
MOVE!

Game forgotten. Parents up, screaming for loved ones, moving
fast toward the parking lot. The Middle-Eastern Officer that
has been watching the game hustles onto the field, next to
the Pitcher, waves people toward him. Gathering but sporadic
gun-fire in very near distance.
WATCHING OFFICER
(accented English)
COME TO ME! FOLLOW ME!
People immediately flocking around the authority figure.
CUT TO:
The 14 year-old Indian Girl running in, more puzzled than
scared: why is that Cop wearing a jacket in this heat?
BACK TO:
The Officer rips a yellow gun-shape from his jacket pocket.
The Pitcher sees it, instinctively tries to rip it away from
him. Gets a handful of collar, pulls as violently as he can,
shreds the front of the Officer's coat: a white linen vest
with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket...
19
19
The youngest grandson's wide-eyed face. Then we see the
Grandfather's right-hand slide down the other side of his
youngest Grandson's face, coming to rest on his other temple:
making sure he's still watching the Softball diamond now. The
Grandfather's right hand: missing an index and middle finger.
KINGDOM 8/18/06

Panic. The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape, what we now
realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something
else, bashes the Pitcher's face with it. Those that had
gathered have turned, are sprint-stumbling away...
The Officer closes his eyes, depresses the drill trigger,
vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue-
black chaos, expanding in an ever-wider sphere. Immediate
surroundings dissolve: players, parents, stands, cars, the
light standards surrounding the field and parking lot.
21
21
Located behind straight-a-way center field, at the nexus of
four fields. We see it from profile as shock-wave and
shrapnel blast the structure: another Officer hiding behind
it staggers out now, sprawls ugly: balance fucked from a
blown inner-ear. He also wears a jacket, and holds a modified
yellow plastic power drill. Moves uneasy toward screams in
the nearby parking lot.
22
22
The off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African-
American woman pinned under a Toyota. She hyperventilates,
her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air. The Officer's
breathing calms: the sight of exposed skin as divine
reassurance. CLOSE-UP: the vented rear of the drill as the
14.4 volt motor sparks blue. A second blue-black explosion
that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another
desperate to escape.
23
23
Panicked women walking dogs. Frozen. A Police Land Cruiser
with bullet-scarred windows roars around the corner. Stops
near the women. They smile: cavalry to the rescue. Then a man
with leans out the window with an AR-15: point-blank
staccato. Tracers exit bodies, drill asphalt. The Land
Cruiser rolls, spraying passing homes indiscriminate...
24
24
Tearing through the streets, Passenger firing at all signs of
life. Sits back for a lightning-quick re-load. Leans back out
-- before he can begin firing again-
KINGDOM 8/18/06

-another Police Land Cruiser from nowhere hammers their
Driver's side. Vicious. The Passenger is launched out his
window, head-first into the curb. Both vehicles smoke-
screech. Momentary pause after the a massive collision.
Then Sergeant Haytham, 9MM in-hand, falls from the Second
Land Cruiser. Stalks bloody to the Passenger side of the
jacked Land Cruiser still slowly rolling backwards, leaking
all it's vital fluids, it's snapped drive-shaft leaving a
groove in the pavement. And Sergeant Haytham empties his clip
into the interior while walking along side.
The Officer Haytham told to 'move,' rips himself from the
Passenger's side of their vehicle, bleeding profusely,
screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio.
26
26
Just the youngest Grandson's horrified eyes: he had no choice
but to see it all, carnage painted permanently. His face
still held tight between his Grandfather's hands. In Arabic:
GRANDFATHER (O.C.)
Our Time is not a peaceful one. God
has left it to us to make it so.
Hold on those deep, young, brown eyes.
Those young brown eyes finally blink.
CUT TO:

The shattered softball diamond and parking lot. Emergency
lights swirl from everywhere. Acrid smoke.
FRANCIS MANNER (FBI LEGAT, US Embassy) is giant. The kind of
American that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. Military
whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G-
shock, FBI credentials visible on a chain.
Hangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of the
frame to the other. Saudi teams setting up portable lights
that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns of
black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men.
Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the parking
lot. Fran has to do something/anything.
Move through the horror with him now. His hands shake, his
face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team
pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rover.
She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back in.
She is the woman we met at the gate of the compound.
She
wants her baby.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
15.
Fran bloodied, just kind of steps away from the woman. Leaves
the Saudi emergency team to fight with her. Backs away until
he feels grass under his feet. The woman's screams
reverberate. Fran just sits in the grass. Staring at the
woman, her shattered soul. Forces himself to look away. Eyes
come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed
with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt.
VOICE (O.C.)
(immediately behind)
Fran. You gotta stand Big Man...
Fran turns to find REX BURR: 5'7" fireplug. A long silence.
Fran points to the hat:
FRANCIS MANNER
Rex, how old were you when your hat
was that small?
We watch tears well in Rex's eyes...
REX BURR
You gotta stand, Big Man.
Fran does. Wipes his hands on his pants. Slack-jaw hopeless.
The first moments in what will be weeks of reverse-
engineering the murders of unknown dozens. He and Rex step to
a group of WALKING-WOUNDED. A NEIGHBOR doles out mugs of
coffee. Most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the
proximity. SAUDI emergency teams sprint past. Fran spits,
settles in:
FRANCIS MANNER
We need to get everyone back, then
get all their-
SOMETHING HUGE EXPLODES over their shoulders, 50 yards away.
The Attack's coup de grace: wait for people to lift up their
heads, hit them again. Five times the size of the suicide
bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment
buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is
crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown
into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get
decimated.

Slowly lift up and hold on Al-Rahmah as it burns. Black smoke

Fleury enters, steps to a podium, opens his folder. 50 Agents
seated lecture hall-style. Steam from fifth, sixth cups of

cribbed from Al-Jazeera.
Throughout the scene, Fleury constantly refers to a roster of
his ERTs.
RONALD FLEURY
Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+

JANET MAYES, 29 years-old, stifles a sob in the front row.
Fleury steps from behind the podium, puts a hand gently on
Janet's shoulder, leans in and whispers something no one but
Janet hears. Whatever his words, they give back her
composure. She nods.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
So was Rex Burr from State.
Fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium.
No one says a thing. Fleury lifts his eyes again, real
trouble maintaining control...
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
Fran was the best among us...we'll
feel this loss the rest of our

(beat, moment to regroup)
Grant, take stabs at bomb sizes.
GRANT SYKES. 50 years-old. Virginia State Trooper before
joining the FBI. Law-and-order formidable: sharp-smart
Charlottesville accent. Studies the images for a beat...
GRANT SYKES
From the craters, looks like they
used a High Explosive... possibly
military grade: can't fit that much
TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of
PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4:
they could get it. The third there,
God knows...that crater looks like
a plane dropped a 500-pounder...
RONALD FLEURY
Obviously a secondary blast after
the initial devices used to lure
first responders to the scene.
Don't know anything about where or
what it was yet.
GRANT SYKES
This is how they do it.
ADAM LEAVITT. 34 years-old, sought-after Investigator.
There's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and
mouth incapable of quiet. He paces around the room, then
eagle-eyes the bomb images... starts surge-scrawling crude
diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. Feels
more like nervous doodling than work. Not looking up from his
drawing:

LEAVITT

RONALD FLEURY
If you already know the answer
Adam, why ask the question?
Fleury circles Leavitt's name on the roster. Leavitt never
stops drawing.
SYKES
We're not seeing this kind of
planning and execution anywhere
else...these ain't hot-wired
artillery shells waiting for
Humvees to roll by.
(pointing at the screens)
These hits are coordinated:
planning, timing, and big, broad-
daylight balls-
JANET MAYES
(almost trance-studying
the images)
Yeah, So... did they all happen
during daylight?
Another great question. Fleury looks over to AGENT #1 on his
immediate right, an egg-head type with a big binder in front
of him. Everyone's eyes follow. Agent #1 flips quickly
through the binder, back-and-forth, searching. Fleury crosses
his name off of his roster. Then:
AGENT #1
Yes. At least the first parts of
the attacks.
Everyone smells it: that's big -- more proof these attacks
are being carried out by one, very skilled Terror Cell.
JANET MAYES
We had two others...North of Riyadh
and the oil thing. What was that?
ADAM LEAVITT
The Refinery... Ras Tenura

JANET MAYES
Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing:
daylight, suicide bombers. Right?

RONALD FLEURY
This is not new in concept. It is
new in scope. It's bigger. Very
sophisticated. Command and control
was flawless. They found the
largest kill zone they could and
they did it... they did it by being
patient.
ADAM LEAVITT
Any rumors or confirmations of
uniforms being used in the other
two attacks?
Fleury circles Mayes' name on the ERT roster.
AGENT #1
(from memory)
No. I know this is the first for
that.
GRANT SYKES
That's `worst case scenario' if
you're still asking for my stab,
Sir. A crew who can build bombs
this big, with this level of eyes-
on control and detonation
coordination... has access to Saudi
uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus.
LEAVITT
Anyone take credit?
Fleury checks from his notes.
FLEURY
Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin-
Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in
Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq.
Now he seems to have come home.
He's clearly becoming increasingly
active...

If it is Hamza, he's definitely

Sykes studies Leavitt with what is best described as
substantial skepticism. Fleury circles Sykes' name on his
roster.
JANET MAYES
They can't afford to appear as if
they are losing any kind of
control. They lose control over
their country, their people...then
they risk losing control over the
oil. They won't let us in. No way.
Fleury's P.O.V.: His open folder on the podium. A memo
printed on Department of State letterhead. Pulls the memo,
reads it aloud, calm laced with rage.
RONALD FLEURY
From the State Department, one hour
ago: `We are in agreement with the
Saudi security assessment that any
additional American presence on
Kingdom soil represents reckless
risk. Therefore it is the Secretary
of State's position that only after

The National Security Advisor and

The General does not have
investigative experience.
PRINCE BIN KHALED
Attackers wore YOUR uniform. Police
Uniforms. Some of your men may have
been involved with this Cell, may
still be involved. You're lucky to
have a role at all.
Al-Ghazi silent. The Prince pulls an anti-acid tablet, puts
it in his mouth: that's why his tongue is chalk-white.
PRINCE BIN KHALED (CONT'D)
And your role will be critically
important: make sure the Americans
leave our country as alive as when
they arrive. Five days they will be
our guests. Understood?

PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, SAUDI ARABIA. Our C-130 touches down
smooth on Saudi soil.

60
The cargo door locks into place on Saudi tarmac. Fleury and
the Team outside the plane now, bags dropped at their feet.
90 degrees even this late. Look-up: light washing over a
small, formal Saudi military team in front of two caskets
draped in American flags, and a small convoy of bullet-proof
black Suburbans. Adam Leavitt will never forget this first
glimpse of Saudi Arabia: surreal. Tears in Janet's eyes as
she glimpses the caskets.
Colonel Al-Ghazi steps up, offers his hand to Fleury. Fleury
and Al-Ghazi shake:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Colonel Al-Ghazi.
RONALD FLEURY
Special Agent Ronald Fleury.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(beat: the caskets)
Your two fallen comrades, Mr.
Manner and Mr. Burr.
Three men multi-task hustle to forklifts, start them up. Into
the cargo hold, pulling out paletts. Things moving orderly-
fast now. The Americans just kind of step back, dazed.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
Passports and credentials. Please.
Sergeant Haytham, driving one of the suburbans, steps forward
with kevlar vests for our crew.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
Thank you to keep these on whenever
you are outside of Al-Rahmah.
JANET MAYES
We brought our own.
The crew hits their bags, pulls out their vests.
Another OFFICER checks each team member's FBI badge and
passport. Stops at Leavitt's: an Israeli stamp on his
passport. Leavitt's quick:
KINGDOM 8/18/06
49.
ADAM LEAVITT
Israeli stamp in my passport?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(in Arabic to the Officer)
That is not our concern.
Al-Ghazi takes the passports and badges, hands them back.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
I'm also to collect your sidearms.
This is like handing over your first-born. Fleury goes first.
Haytham puts each weapon in a padded case.
GRANT SYKES
And I usually just toss it on the
kitchen table...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(small smile)
If each of you would please get
into the middle vehicle.
61
The convoy brakes impossibly close to a checkpoint. Waved
through perimeters staffed by SANG and Police. Fatigues,
automatic rifles, peering at the tinted windows.
65
65
Crew arrives at a crime-scene that spans the immediate
horizon. White tents with SANG sitting under each. Industrial
lights outline shattered buildings, idle heavy equipment,
bombed-out automobiles. TIGHT ON MAYES looking out.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
55.
JANET MAYES
That's one of the great horrors of
television: Crime scene
manipulation. They say a TV camera
adds pounds to actresses. Isn't
that what they say?
ADAM LEAVITT
Who's "they?"
JANET MAYES
That is what they say. Doesn't add
to crime scenes. Television cameras
shrink them. Misrepresent. No
smells. Poor sound. Limited view.
TV always makes them look smaller.
You can't feel the hatred on
television.
TIGHT ON FLEURY: Quiet and focused, taking everything in.
FLEURY
...heads on a swivel, people.
66
66
Two more security perimeters of SANG surround the Community
Center: blinding portable lights, heavy machine guns mounted
in the backs of Humvees track the convoy as it comes to a
stop: every troop on-guard. The Team tentatively exits: 100
pairs of glares from heavily-armed SANG.
Soldiers descend on the Teams' bags, paletts of equipment.
Long leers at Janet: not so much `sexual' as `wary.' Janet
goes for her own bag. Haytham goes for it at the same time.
Their hands accidently touch. Haytham pulls back fast,
embarrassed.
JANET MAYES
EASY.
Janet notices the nasty marks around Haytham's right ear.
67
67
Florescent lights make it ugly. Haytham dumps duffel-bags by
their bunks, SANG stack steel travel-boxes from the paletts
inside. No windows, AC cranked to `coldest.' Americans sealed-
in - in the name of comfort.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
56.
Janet's area made obvious with a floral partition. She
immediately folds it, puts it into a corner. Haytham watches
her undo his work.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The bathrooms are through that
door. I will be here tomorrow
morning so we can begin.
FLEURY
What time tomorrow morning?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Sunrise.
RONALD FLEURY
What time is sunrise?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(beat)
When I knock.
Al-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then
the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on,
half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in.
GRANT SYKES
That's against fire code.
JANET MAYES
They don't have fire codes. They
don't have codes other than codes
of war. They'll lock us in and dial
up some kind of earth movers if
they want to. You know that, Sykes.
Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill
it up and no one comes calling.
You're in the jungle now, baby.
Silence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage.
ADAM LEAVITT
(smiling)
You alright, girl?
JANET MAYES
Watch it, boy.
ADAM LEAVITT
Just asking...
JANET MAYES
Unpack.

Everyone hits their own bags first.
FLEURY
(to himself)
Saudi slow roll...
Fleury pulls out his laptop, wakes it up from sleep mode.
Eyes a photo of Kevin on his desktop, picks up the phone.
LYLA FLEURY
(on phone)
Hello?
RONALD FLEURY
Hey... How are you? How's my boy?
LYLA FLEURY
We're just fine. How are you?
Where are you?
RONALD FLEURY

Lemme talk to my boy.
A BEAT as Lyla passes the phone to Kevin.

KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.)
I'm talking to you. What are you

FLEURY
Yeah... I saw him...
(PAUSE)
I saw him.
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.)
Is he still tall?
FLEURY
Yeah... Yeah...he's still tall.
Silence... as Fleury takes a beat to collect himself.
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.)
Daddy? Are you still there?
FLEURY
Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your
eye on your mama. Be the man.
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.)
You, too Daddy.
FLEURY
I'll call you tomorrow. I love you.
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.)
Bye, Daddy.
Fleury begins unpacking.
68

Pre-dawn: Eight black suburbans parked on the side street:
waiting. The doors of the first four open in-unison. 20 Arab,
suited SECURITY GUARDS exit.
Al-Ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands
dressed, waiting. CLOSE-UP: The Team steps out to see
massive, organized security.
From one of the vehicles exits a middle aged AMERICAN -
sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. This is US Deputy
Chief of Mission, the Embassy's second-in-command: DAMON
SCHMIDT.
Another 100 Security CONTRACTORS remain vigilant: SNIPERS on
roof-tops, in machine-gun nests.
Schmidt approaches Fleury.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
59.
SCHMIDT
(big smile)
You are in so much trouble.
FLEURY
Is that right?
SCHMIDT
For sure. I mean, I don't know how
you did it. Nice work, but if you
live through this, which I put at
about fifty percent - if you do,
your balls are gonna get stretched
and beaten on. Dig that?
Fleury stares at this freak show. Schmidt sticks out a paw.
SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
Damon Schmidt. State Department.
I'm in charge of getting you out of
here.
PRINCE BIN KHALED and his INNER-CIRCLE exit a Suburban and
approach: All in traditional dress. The Prince locks eyes
with Fleury.
IN THE BG, forklifts rumble-hiss to life, placing Jersey
barriers around the community center.
SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
Don't let go of his hand first.
Major disrespect.
One of the inner-circle, without a word, takes off the FBI-
emblazoned windbreaker worn by Leavitt and places it on a
short-sleeved Janet. Careful not to touch skin.
Only then does Prince Bin Khaled approach. A lone
PHOTOGRAPHER follows: snapping pictures. Different
definitions of personal space: four inches separation as Bin
Khaled greets each Team member in accented English. Janet
last: the pictures suddenly stop. The Prince gives a little
curtsy, no words, steps back to Fleury: the pictures re-
start. Bin Khaled holds Fleury's hand sixth-grade boyfriend-
style.
PRINCE BIN KHALED
(in Arabic)
This is our level of commitment to
bringing Terrorists to justice:
Motions to the Americans. No more unflattering a portrait:
pre-coffee, post-twelve hour flight, hours unpacking...
KINGDOM 8/18/06
60.
As the cameras start flashing. Angle on Al-Ghazi and Haytham
placed to stand next to the Americans. Haytham clearly not
comfortable with this kind of attention.
PRINCE BIN KHALED (CONT'D)
We've invited American legal
officials into our Kingdom despite
current difficulties between the US
and Islam. They will observe our
advanced investigative techniques,
offering helpful hints.
(to Fleury in English)
You will please honor me with your
presence tonight at my home.
(beat, a stunted nod)
Yes.
The Prince turns back to the convoy. Entire entourage
follows. One of the Security Contractors catches the jacket
Janet hurls back at him, tosses it to Leavitt. Convoy gone.
The team turns: 100 glares again. Fleury blinks out the
camera flashes, takes in all the eyeballs.
Fleury looks up at a retreating Damon Schmidt.
SCHMIDT
Nice pictures. You guys ready to go
home now?
Dead eyes from Fleury. He's clearly not amused.
SCHMIDT
(CONT'D)
OK. If you change
your minds, I got
a plane fueled up
and ready to go -
got your name all
over it...
He points a finger gun at Fleury.
SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
Strap your kevlar on tight, people.
SCHMIDT takes off. Sykes by Fleury.
GRANT SYKES
Slow roll... gonna be like when you
go deep sea fishing in Florida and
you pay seven hundred bucks for the

hours and the crew jumps around and
screams and points and you think
your constantly about to bag a
Marlin but you never do and they
keep pointing and jumping and-
KINGDOM 8/18/06
61.
FLEURY
Enough.
Haytham walks off by himself, shaking off the shady Royal
photo vibe, looking back at the Americans. From behind him:
POLICE OFFICER
You're willing to die to protect
your enemy?
Haytham turns. An older POLICE OFFICER stands with a GROUP of
SANG twenty feet behind him, eyeing Haytham.
Back to Fleury: he looks to Al-Ghazi.
RONALD FLEURY
What did the Prince say?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(beat)
That there are more rules than just
not working at night.
RONALD FLEURY
What rules?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
You are here as observers. Not
investigators.
Fleury tries to remain cool.
RONALD FLEURY
That's not accurate--
Al-Ghazi ignores Fleury.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
--I need to make sure the sites are
secure. Then you can begin
observing.
Leavitt looks around at the Security as Al-Ghazi hustles off:
ADAM LEAVITT
(to Fleury)
How could they get more secure?
The Team slowly realizes they're not going anywhere yet, dump
their bags in a pile, already disgusted.
In the distance, the group of SANG stare back at our team.
KINGDOM 8/18/06

Al-Ghazi and General Malik stand outside.
The Athan sounds for Dhuhr.
100 soldiers immediately drop to their knees.

Hands in pockets. Soak in the aftermath: shallow but wide
crater, shredded backstop, nearby buildings torn, blood baked
into dirt. Fifteen cars.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)
The remaining rules: you cannot
touch evidence, question anyone
without me present, touch Muslim
dead, or leave my sight at anytime:
your safety is my primary concern.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
64.
FLEURY
I would have thought your primary
concern was investigating a crime.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
And you would be mistaken.
Sykes looks over to Fleury. Crooked smile.
SYKES
(to Fleury)
I think it's one of those
"something happens to us... his
head comes off" kind of deals.
(to Al-Ghazi)
Is it one of those kind of deals,
Colonel?
Al-Ghazi ignores Sykes.
FLEURY
So, if you're not running the
investigation...who is?
Al-Ghazi motions to 50 MEN in uniforms different than his:
SANG troops digging, bagging evidence, marking the scene with
red-flags.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The National Guard's Military
Police Brigade is conducting the
investigation. My orders begin and
end with your health.
The Team: so we're on Tour. Fleury still silent.
ADAM LEAVITT
I thought the SANG were soldiers--
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
--the bombers didn't wear a
soldier's uniform. They wore mine.
Fleury finally speaks, asking the most important question:
RONALD FLEURY
Who is in charge of the
investigation then?
Al-Ghazi points to a Man we've seen before, General Abdul-
Malik. Haytham's Interrogator. He pours over a table 20 feet
away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
65.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
General Abdul-Malik. He's given us
permission to walk through each
crime-scene.
RONALD FLEURY
To walk through? Are you kidding
me?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I am not.
Starting to get heated.
RONALD FLEURY
Get him over here now and let's
clarify this situation.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
There is no lack of clarification.
RONALD FLEURY
There sure as hell is! I don't know
what kind of game you're playing
but you got the wrong guy, Colonel
Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal-
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(getting hot)
This is not a game show, Mr.
Fleury! There are no deals made
here. There is me telling you what
you may or may not do and there is
you doing it.
Beat. As Al-Ghazi stabilizes...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
You will be permitted to walk
through the crime scenes. When we
have determined that it is safe.
A stand off. Fleury eyes Al-Ghazi. Trying to figure this guy
out.
Sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment in Al-
Ghazi's eyes: unable to perform his profession, relegated to
Tour Guide. Leavitt begins taking notes. Haytham sees his
notebook, snaps his fingers at Al-Ghazi who looks, nods: let
him.
RONALD FLEURY
OK.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
66.
Fleury tight-grins. Looks off. In one of the apartments, he
sees a PERSON looking down at them from behind a curtain.
He tries a new tactic.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
How have you guys been doing with
the witnesses?
AL-GHAZI
What witnesses?
Al-Ghazi just stares at Fleury.
FLEURY
I'm guessing there are a bunch of
Americans, Brits... Australians?
Someone must have seen something.
I'm sure they're just dying to talk
to you guys, seeing as how the
killers were wearing your uniforms.
That must be a real confidence
booster for them.
Al-Ghazi silent, staring.
FLEURY (CONT'D)
Let me talk to them.
Al-Ghazi looks unsure. He was not expecting this.
71
71
Fleury and Al-Ghazi walk up the front walk. Fleury noticing
kids bikes, hockey gear, a comfortable easy chair covered in
fur outside on the front porch, toy guns.
72
73
Next door to the Ripons. Fleury knocks. Door opens: a sad MAN
with black bags under dying eyes. Disgusted-resigned breath
through a half-open mouth. Silver watch and Polo insignia...
sees Al-Ghazi, eyes come alive, teeth grit.
RONALD FLEURY
Mr. Aaron Jackson?
AARON JACKSON
(re: Al-Ghazi)
Get him away from me-
KINGDOM 8/18/06
69.
RONALD FLEURY
-easy, Sir. He's a friend to us-
AARON JACKSON
-I don't know either one a' you.
RONALD FLEURY
I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of
the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi
with the Saudi State Police-
AARON JACKSON
-the Police: they attacked.
Al-Ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. Fleury looks after
him, turns back to Mr. Jackson who stares after Al-Ghazi:
hate. Fleury unsure what to do next.
AARON JACKSON (CONT'D)
I just put my boys down for the
first time in two days. I can't
wake `em and sure as hell can't be
gone if they stir on their own.
RONALD FLEURY
Can I come back?
AARON JACKSON
(too loud)
WHY?
RONALD FLEURY
Your boys...
Jackson remembers the warning he just spoke...
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
To ask about two nights ago.
Fresh tears re-animate his face:
AARON JACKSON
When my wife's jaw was shot off in
front of our sons? My sons who sat
with her while she bled to death?
Couldn't speak because she didn't
have the bottom of her face and I
wasn't home and my baby boys are
destroyed for life and my five year-
old had a box of band-aids in his
hand when I finally got home?
KINGDOM 8/18/06
70.
Silence outside of Mr. Jackson's sobbing. Fleury sick to his
stomach. Desperate to let this man alone. No eye contact.
RONALD FLEURY
...I won't pretend to know...
Aaron Jackson settles, wipes away tears, appreciates the
honesty. Then bites back into his rage:
AARON JACKSON
Kill everyone that had something to
do with this. Everyone related to
them. Everyone who knew them.
(beat)
And all you'd be doing is their
recruiting for them... It's an
entire generation: not small and
isolated like they say. But a
generation that thinks what they
did to my wife, to my children, is
a "calling"...
RONALD FLEURY
Up the street, there was a wreck,
did you see any-
AARON JACKSON
-notice how it wouldn't take a lot
to disguise your friend
(points to Al-Ghazi)
as a Mexican? Think he couldn't
handle crossing our deserts? Look
around!
RONALD FLEURY
Aaron-
AARON JACKSON
(explodes)
-LET ME FINISH GOD DAMN YOU-
A child's scream from inside. Piercing. Scary. Jackson goes
red, clenched fists, steps to Fleury who takes an instinctive
step backward, guard-up. Jackson stops, spins back inside. A
door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the
shattered window. The screams become night terror shrieks.

A LONG, SAD BEAT, as Fleury and Al-Ghazi stand alone in front
of the Jackson house.

RONALD FLEURY
(to Al-Ghazi)
Can we tour the compound? Can we
please do that?
Slow nod from Al-Ghazi.
75

The team tours the site.
As they fan out. They walk casually, but focused through the
first bomb site. An inquisitive Mayes, already peering into a
mostly in-tact car, halfway out of its parking spot. Al-Ghazi
and Haytham watch the Americans like mother-hens.
JANET MAYES
He or she almost made it.
Fleury steps, looks inside: blood and safety glass coat the
seat. Janet points to keys in the ignition: still at the `on'
position. Then the stick-shift, pulled to the back right:
reverse. The shift-knob bloody...
JANET MAYES (CONT'D)
(beat, quieter)
Makes me think of the Trade Centers
-- the people on the floors above
the impacts -- no matter how fast
or strong or smart you are, if
you're in the wrong spot, `it' will
not let you get away.
FLEURY
That's what makes this a War.
Sykes notices something on the ground... he picks up a
military detonator, discretely hands it over to Fleury.
Fleury quietly pockets it.
76
76
Structures 100 feet away look like they've been hit with a
God-sized sawed-off. The crater: 25-feet wide, 7-feet deep.
Blackened frames and bits of vehicles circle the crater. The
bottom of the crater filled with water. A syphon-pump works
overtime. No SANG Investigators around.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)
About one hour into the rescue.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
72.
ADAM LEAVITT
Hit a water main?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
No -- from the tanks of this fire
engine: that's the water that
didn't evaporate in the blast.
Al-Ghazi points to a mass of black metal: looks like a fire
truck the way a Jackson Pollock looks like the Mona Lisa.
Leavitt and Grant stand back. Quiet:
GRANT SYKES
(eyes on Fleury)
Hole is the case. See, there's
"evidence" down in that hole. You
understand evidence? Little things
that are "clues." Clues can be very
helpful to a fella when he's trying
to solve a crime.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I understand that.
GRANT SYKES
Glad to hear it. So can we get in
there?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
No.
Sykes holds Al-Ghazi's gaze. Smiles.
GRANT SYKES
OK.
Fleury is taking in the entire crime scene. He notices a four
story building half a mile off the perimeter.
He watches Al-Ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into
the mud, bag it himself, search for someone to give it too.
Nobody. Sets it down. Stands, wipes his hands hard on his
pants. Fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional:
trying to feel like he's doing something.
77

The Land Cruiser Haytham rammed - driver's side crushed,
bullet holes, out-of-control skid-marks, asphalt scars from
the snapped drive shaft...
KINGDOM 8/18/06
73.
Fleury is moving around the scene, restaging the shoot out.
Instantly lining up the angles.
Leavitt's taking digital snaps of the shattered Land Cruiser.
Through the viewfinder: the caved-in door. Two snaps.
A SANG passes Adam, his gun aimed a touch high.
ADAM LEAVITT
(to Fleury)
A little high...
FLEURY
(to SANG, "Lower," in
Arabic)
Watt-tee...
ADAM LEAVITT
Watt-tee fuck (alt: "Watt-tee
hell...") is his gun doing up so
high?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(to Fleury)
This vehicle was stolen. Two
drivers murdered. A team outside
the blast-radius...shooting at
anything. Everyone.
(beat)
Sergeant Haytham ended this part.
ADAM LEAVITT
(to Al-Ghazi)
Are the Shooters in-custody-
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
-dead.
So Sergeant Haytham speaks English...
FLEURY
Were any of these shooters your
men?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
No.
Fleury's thinking, looking into the car. Searching the
horizon, he spots a distant apartment building providing a
view of the crime scene.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
74.
FLEURY
They got into the compound.
Somehow...took control of this
vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't
politely ask whoever was in this
car if they could take it for a
little ride?
Fleury gets in the car, checking out ballistic shreds in the
back of the passenger seat headrest.
AL-GHAZI
No, they didn't. There were two
officers in the car. Both were
executed.
FLEURY
I understand that. Those men were
your men--
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
-- they were. They were Police.
FLEURY
I'm sorry.
Al-Ghazi offers the slightest of nods to Fleury.
FLEURY (CONT'D)
Where was this car when they hit
it?
a77A
a77A
Al-Ghazi leads our team to the main gate.
Sykes and Fleury
follow close.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Security is a combination of the
police and military.
Leavitt and Mayes lag behind a bit. Leavitt makes eye
contact with a YOUNG SAUDI behind the .50 caliber.
JANET MAYES
Good news is that if he shoots you,
he's gonna shoot you sitting on an
American tank... with an American-
made bullet. So, it's kind of "all
in the family."
KINGDOM 8/18/06

ADAM LEAVITT
How about we get into those
American Suburbans... with their
American A/C...
Al-Ghazi continues the tour as Fleury once again notes the
familiar apartment off in the distance.
77A
77A
A car port. Fleury and team moving around the area. Fleury
picks up some broken glass from the ground.
FLEURY
The car was parked here?
AL-GHAZI
Yes.
FLEURY
Backed in?
AL-GHAZI
Yes.
Fleury studies the scene.
FLEURY
They were attacked from the front.
Must have assumed the killers were
fellow officers... Have any of
these men been identified?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Not yet. We will check certain
neighborhoods. It is likely that
the four men prayed at the same
Mosque.
JANET MAYES
The same Mosque is enough to
identify them, link them to a cell?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Yes. If the Mosque is in Suweidi.
ADAM LEAVITT
Suweidi?
KINGDOM 8/18/06
76.
JANET MAYES
Suweidi is a known militant
stonghold. Al-Qaeda could recruit
from storefronts.
On Fleury: he looks back at the homes, then up and around: He
locks on the OBSERVATION BUILDING in the distance.
FLEURY
Can we go to check out some of
these surrounding buildings?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Why?
FLEURY
Seems reasonable that the Planner
had to observe and based on Hamza's
past history, it's consistent that
he would want to video the attack.
Is that true? Is that accurate?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
That is true.
RONALD FLEURY
Well, in order to video, in order
to observe, you need a view.
Fleury points to one particular building.
FLEURY
That building sees all three crime
scenes.
Al-Ghazi looks up to the building. Back to Fleury.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(beat)
It's outside the walls-
ADAM LEAVITT
-c'mon now. This is insane: we got
enough security to invade Suweidi,
let alone that building-
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
-no you don't.
FLEURY
(to Al-Ghazi, respectful)
Could you ask?
(MORE)
KINGDOM 8/18/06

FLEURY (CONT'D)
We're already seeing the crime-
scenes individually -- why not all
at once?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Any answer will take-
FLEURY
-time. I understand.
Fleury speaks slowly and clearly now: like he's cementing his
words in his own head as he speaks them.
FLEURY (CONT'D)
You have to ask the General, then
the General would ask the Prince.
Does it go higher or is that... is
the Prince the end of the chain?
Al-Ghazi hesitates, can't help but be charmed. Fleury clearly
knows when to step-on or lay-off the gas. He's smooth... and
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE: Al-Ghazi nods `yes' to the strange half-

Five car convoy moving quickly through the city.

Our convoy pulls up in front of the apartment. They exit the
vehicles. Our team stands surrounded by a 50-man security
detail, rifle-stocks to shoulders. Double-time it - outside
the walls now, hostile territory. Two-man sniper teams out
front. Al-Ghazi ten steps ahead.
A SANG five car security CREW pulls up, tracking Fleury and
company. A stand off between the two police forces.

The SANG Officer in-charge steps to Al-Ghazi. In Arabic:
SANG OFFICER
This is unacceptable.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
79.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
It's cleared with General Abdul-
Malik. We have five minutes here.
SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
We were told they must remain in
the vehicles...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
That is not true...
SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
They must stay in the Toyotas-
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
-report me then when you get in-
touch with the General-
-Officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers Al-Ghazi open-
handed as Al-Ghazi tries to step past. Collective shock.
In that breath, Haytham punishes the Officer with a left-
cross: knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him.
Haytham's kick follows, catches the Officer in the sternum as
he hits ground.
Al-Ghazi shakes it out, trades blows with the SANG second in-
command.
Leavitt moves, catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two
steps. Fleury aims, drills the Soldier that butted Leavitt:
instant night-night. Another SANG steps up. Fleury throats
him, knee caps him, and grabs his weapon before the dude hits
the ground.
Fleury can obviously fight... all the above happens in four
seconds.
Then, a `knock-it-off' gunshot aimed at the sky pops one-foot
from Janet's head. We hear what she hears: one half-second of
the shot, then the big ring. On her knees immediately, hand
over her ear. In response: heavy-caliber gunfire flies: group
flinch-n-crouch. The warning shots from a .50-caliber mounted
on a Humvee racing this way from Al-Rahmah: dust plumes from
the speed. Members of the security detail and the Special
Forces go Mexican stand-off.
JANET MAYES
Tell me it didn't burst-tell me it
didn't burst-
KINGDOM 8/18/06

Al-Ghazi the first to her, touching her hand to pull it away
from the ear. A SANG nearby sees this: spits two inches from
Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi leans to Janet's non-ringing side:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
No blood.
The Humvee now slides to stop ten feet from the fracas.
General Abdul-Malik out of the passenger seat, in Arabic:
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
WHO FIRED?
That Soldier's hand goes up sheepish. Two men out of the
Humvee's backseat break him down, face first in the dirt:
cuff him, lock him in the vehicle.
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK (CONT'D)
AND WHY?
SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
(standing, doubled over)
A disagreement.
The General grabs the Officer by the back of his head: an
abusive Dad. Walks him to the side.
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
(back to Al-Ghazi)
FIVE MINUTES.
Al-Ghazi looks back down at Janet, at Leavitt's bruise, at
the man Fleury knocked out. Angry. Impressed: fought
alongside him. Haytham hasn't moved an inch, not even when
the General came, chin raised to an entire platoon: say when.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(to Fleury)
Five minutes.
The SANG move back. The team staggered, slowly remembering
why they're here in the first place, finally make their way
to the Roof Top.
82

Fleury finds a table with a view. Tabletop: holes and finger-
paint stains. Al-Ghazi three feet away. Both look in the same
direction: two Tigers being held back.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
81.
Fleury's studying the housing compound through a video
camera, comparing the images on his camera with what he saw
posted on the internet.
FLEURY
You've seen the images of the
attack posted on the internet?
AL-GHAZI
Yes.
FLEURY
Look for yourself.
Al-Ghazi takes the camera from Fleury. He lines up the same
shots we saw posted on Leavitt's computer: clearly a match.
This is where they shot the video
AL-GHAZI
He was here...
Another long moment. Al-Ghazi looks at the table, discarded
trash: the Capri Sun containers, the candy wrappers.
RONALD FLEURY
Formed the plan up here: saw
everything he could hit.
(beat)
Way too pretty a' plan to have been
fully hatched on just one visit. He
came here a couple times.
Al-Ghazi quiet for a long while. Then he reciprocates:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The man who did this is a Saudi -
this place, this neighborhood... if
foreigners were up here, someone
would say something.
Fleury looks over to the two dozen LOCALS peering out with
suspicion at them on the rooftop.
FLEURY
I see.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Nobody's talking. Here, many people
love Hamza - they think of him like
Bin Laden. Like your Robin Hood.
Fleury smiles small at whatever just passed between them. Al-
Ghazi stays stoic, then looks straight at Fleury:
KINGDOM 8/18/06

COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
A man who thinks of something like
this ...while maybe his family
played around him... scares me more
than I have words to express.
Shaytan...
RONALD FLEURY
(refocusing)
Two big answers in two small
minutes. Imagine if we had a couple
days together.
Al-Ghazi pauses.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
I'm sure the General is good
guy...and I'm just as sure he's no
Investigator.
Al-Ghazi stands still, silent. Fleury reaches into his
pocket. Reveals the detonator to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi reaches
to take it. Fleury holds it for a BEAT...
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
Let me help you.
He hands the detonator to Al-Ghazi.
Al-Ghazi now pockets it.
A BEAT...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
We break now: too hot to work
outdoors. Then we will leave for
the Palace.
RONALD FLEURY
And I imagine that will run until
sundown?
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(beat)
I had televisions delivered to your
quarters to pass the downtime.
Fleury just nods back.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
Miss Mayes will not attend this
evening. Men only.
Fleury looks over to Janet. Hurt, yet extremely defiant, she
looks ready to attack anything that comes near her.

Al-Ghazi in the passenger seat, hand on the stock of his Mp-
5: again searching for threats. Our team in back, freshly
scrubbed, collared-Polos as formal as anyone thought to pack.
Team frustration has evolved into angry acceptance.
The convoy zipping alongside a wall now: desert-orange in
color, twelve-feet high, blue ottoman tiles running the
length of the wall's horizontal center-line.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
We're here.
The helicopters peel off at steep angles, the sound of the
rotors reverberating in your chest. Leavitt watching them go:
ADAM LEAVITT
Big wall.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
It's a big palace.

Half-assed gardening party. Al-Ghazi worked through the
night, hasn't slept since we last saw him. Looks like it.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
From now on, any evidence you find
you hand over.
Al-Ghazi smiles...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
I'm "all ears," Special Agent
Fleury.
RONALD FLEURY
We should start with the dead
shooters.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
They had no identification on them.
Fingerprints and dental have come
up empty.
RONALD FLEURY
Can we photograph all three of
them? Couple hundred copies each...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
No problem.
RONALD FLEURY
Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like

Crawl up in it. Make deep contact.

Dead, confused stares from the Saudis into the mud hole...
Sykes happy as a pig in shit.

He smiles, watches another Officer write Saudi translations
on the stainless-steel paint cans into which you load
evidence: shrapnel, soil, DNA, shells, etc.

A JUNIOR OFFICER double-times it to Al-Ghazi with a stack of
photos: Rough head-shots of the three dead SHOOTERS. Fleury
takes some, hands the rest back to Al-Ghazi.
RONALD FLEURY
Have him pass these out to the
compound security. See if anybody
knows them.
Fleury, Leavitt, and Al-Ghazi walk past the Land Cruiser
Haytham took out. 15 Police INVESTIGATORS on-scene: Leavitt
stops, drops his bag. Al-Ghazi introduces him to the Officer
in-charge.
Leavitt opens his evidence kit. A couple of Police can't help
but sneak a peek, checking out what the American's got
inside.
91

Al-Ghazi gives the photo of the IDENTIFIED SHOOTER to an AIDE
waiting outside.
AL-GHAZI

The Muslim dead wrapped in white linen according to the

Haytham is looking uncomfortable as if he is embarrassed to
be seen with the American woman.

Fleury knocks at Aaron Jackson's door. A pause, the peep hole
darkens. A longer pause, then the door opens. Aaron Jackson
doesn't look any better. Same shirt.
Packed boxes. Suit cases. Jackson is clearly getting out of
Dodge.
RONALD FLEURY
(beat)
How are your Sons?
Jackson's eyes shrink-wrapped in tears. After a long silence
with no answer, Fleury hands him a sheet of paper:
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
That's the name of a clinical
psychologist. Works with Embassy
kids...apparently very good at
explaining violence-
AARON JACKSON
-what do you know about what my

Aaron Jackson begins shaking his head yes. Tears flow free:

the death of your wife. We're

AARON JACKSON

Fleury turns his head: Al-Ghazi approaches on the next lawn
down with three JUNIOR OFFICERS. Fleury nods goodbye to
Jackson.
Fleury approaches Al-Ghazi, holds up the Shooter's photo.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The gardener. We know who he is.
He's on several watch lists.
Fleury - a slight nod of satisfaction.
RONALD FLEURY
We know where he lives?

Ten Police Investigators in the crater with Grant. Outside
the crater: pieces of vehicles laid out outside: 1/2 of a
door, 1/4 of a front axle, bits of engine. Five feet away
from that: stacks of bagged evidence, two dozen evidence
containers.
Sykes clambers out of the hole, streaks of re-animated mud
where sweat streams out of his hairline, mad-dashing for his
chin. A chunk of metal in one hand, something small in the
other: a marble. He drops it in the appropriate cannister
then steps to a chunk of metal: one half of an alternator.
Sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal.
He studies a piece of twisted, half-melted iron. Thinking...
He walks over to a second larger piece of twisted metal.
Starts trying to fit the two pieces...like a puzzle.
97

Sykes still works the two large pieces of trashed iron. Until
something clicks. The fit. Sykes looks down at the connected
metal.

Sykes looks down at the mud colored DIGGERS.
SYKES (CONT'D)

Sergeant Haytham?
Confused stares from the Saudis.

SYKES (CONT'D)

Sergeant Haytham!
Inside the crater: water-level down to the ankles. Three
Saudis dig around what looks to be one of the dualie-style
back tires. Re-positioning to get a better grip, Sykes
notices the top of what looks to be a sizeable, ragged hole,
still mostly submerged. Pointing:
GRANT SYKES
Here.
Sykes slogs over. He drops to his knees, reaches his hand in,
all the way to his shoulder, the side of his face to the
water: void. Out of the crater, Sykes points to a Bobcat
earth-mover, in Arabic:
GRANT SYKES (CONT'D)
Who has the keys?

Janet stands with the Saudi Pathologist. She prepares to take
a fingerprint from a body. As the moves in to touch the Arab
hand, one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full
guttural Arabic assault. No idea what he's saying, but it's
obvious he's furious. Haytham starts firing back. This is an
un-translated argument. We sense that the guard is doing more
than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet. This seems
to be personal. Janet's getting very nervous. A frightening
display. Then, Haytham turns:
HAYTHAM
You cannot touch any Muslims.
Janet takes a breath as the Police hard-eye her.
JANET
No problem. Can I still touch
Americans?
HAYTHAM
Of course.
Janet moves back to the American dead, as the Saudi Tech
continues with the Muslims. She pulls another shard of
COLORED GLASS from a wound.

SERIES OF SHOTS:
A two car convoy drives deep into the city.
The Convoy is forced to stop across the street from a gas
station as a construction crane backs into a drive way.
Al-Ghazi and Fleury stare across the street as a large gas
truck fills up the heavy tanks of a Saudi gas station.
FLEURY
What's gas running a gallon out
here, Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon?
Al-Ghazi smiles.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
It was an American. An engineer
named Karl Twitchell. Hired by
Saudi Arabia to find water. He
didn't find so much as a dried
oasis, but he found this. Enough
oil to turn the earth.
Fleury stares out as the oil spills out overflowing from the
station tank.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
They say my country sits on over 1
trillion more barrels of
recoverable oil.

Police Investigators eat lunch under a tent 50 yards away

Leavitt stares. Subtle defiance. Nobody blinks. Silent
moments pass.

The small convoy pulls up next to a run down, late seventies
chunk of architecture which looks like a combination bombed

The Bobcat digs
into the crater, over the unknown hole.
Already a large
pile of dirt. Another sizeable scoop down
about two feet:
nothing. Haytham now stands over the crater
watching Sykes.
Leavitt has joined him.
GRANT SYKES
Whatever this is, it blasted-off
like NASA.
Haytham yells to the Machine Operator in Arabic:
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
Driven in at an angle... go
deeper...
Another gouge of earth: 4 feet. Nothing. Grant sits back.
GRANT SYKES
`High-order explosion' doesn't do
it justice: what's left a' this

wood-chipper.
Leavitt rubs his eyes: adrenaline long gone. Looks at his
watch: time passing fast. Sykes drops to his stomach, reaches
in with the TRENCHING TOOL to see how much farther the hole
goes: a metallic `clink.
An oxygen tank. The kind used in ambulances. Nozzle assembly
gone, burst in the explosion with a force that drove it
several feet into solid ground. Haytham takes a razor blade,
scratches off samples of the soil and carbon for explosive
residue into a fresh cannister. Then takes a wet rag, begins
cleaning the tank to reveal Arabic script...

Snipers stand posted on near-by rooftops. Helicopters audible

rides: 3 on each rail, 2 vehicles. SWAT team: military

Flying down the cul-de-sac: Half-way down the street, one of
the Snipers open fire: BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. That moment an RPG
fires wide of the lead Suburban. Over Al-Ghazi's walkie-
talkie, in Arabic:

The two SWAT-Teamers at the front of the running boards open
up with their MP-5s one-handed: the front of the house puffs,
bursts, disintegrates. Suburbans rip to a stop. SWAT off,
move fast. Three toss flash grenades into and around the
house. Massive flash-bangs. Six through the front door. Six
sprinting around back. Loud AK-47 bursts from inside
now...screams. Then an RPG fired inside: the rushing sound
and yellow-white flash past two windows. A section of the far
left wall of the house detonates from the inside out.
More mechanical, silenced thwacks from the SWAT Mp-5s.

DAMON SCHMIDT
-kidding me? You mean those are
Terrorist targets? Holy Wow.
Momma, don't let your children grow
up to be cowboys.
(beat)
Just get ready to go home and revel
in the fact that for the next few
weeks your shit won't stink.
The phone rings that instant. Leavitt hands it up to Fleury.
Schmidt holds his hand up to Janet: high-five -- she gives it
up slowly, warily, semi-charmed:
DAMON SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
(to Janet)
Double or nothing that's a
congratulatory call.
RONALD FLEURY
Hello?
(beat)
Yes, Sir. We're all here and
healthy. I'm sitting next to their
corpses but this may not be over.
These don't feel like anything
resembling senior leadership-
(beat)
-thank you Sir. I do.

RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
Please do me one favor before we
board: warn every `Coalition-of-the-
Willing' or whatever the hell we're
calling our Iraq allies now, that
pictures of their Riyadh embassies
were found in this Cell's safe-
house.
113
117
Our Suburban on two wheels: The lead Suburban turns the same
direction a twitch too late. The small brown truck detonates.
The lead Suburban takes a massive fraction of the explosion
broadside, essentially shielding our vehicle. Flame spits
through the lead vehicle as it spins, flips onto its roof.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
116.
118
118
Off-road now, violent impacts on bare rims shedding rubber.
119
119
The lead Suburban: tortoise on its back, engulfed, still
sliding. Fleury's Suburban fish-tailing.
The Lead Suburban blows in-half now as the gas tank ruptures.
A football-sized shard of metal explodes through our
windshield-
120
121
Leavitt's throwing punches as he's dragged with velocity to
the trail Suburban, idling. Pistol-whipped viciously,
repeatedly until they're able to kick him inside. Another
Officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an AK-47,
pulls back the cocking mechanism, ready to spray the dazed
occupants of our Suburban-
-the Officer's ankles and shins detonate. POP-POP-POP-POP
from the driver's seat: Haytham. Screams from the would-be
shooter at double volume. Haytham keeps firing as the
Officer, hit multiple times, falls hard.
The trailing Suburban hesitates,
slams into our Suburban just
as Fleury is getting out of the
wreckage. Everybody else
still inside, knocked silly. The
trailing Suburban backs up
quick. Fleury instinctively goes
for his holster: empty for
days now.
RONALD FLEURY
GUN!
Trailing Suburban accelerates away now, as Janet struggles
out. Haytham's 9 MM in-hand racked open: empty. Fleury steps
away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle -- in
the passenger seat of the trail Suburban, he sees the Officer
that checked passports at Prince Sultan Air Base.
GRANT SYKES
-DOOR HELP-
Fleury rips Grant's door open. Trapped smoke billows, clears:
Grant's arm closest to the outside of the vehicle dangles at
an unnatural angle, bleeding badly.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
118.
GRANT SYKES (CONT'D)
Can't release-
Fleury begins sawing Grant's seat-belt with a jagged piece of
metal.
RONALD FLEURY
Hands up -- you're gonna fall-
Sykes still does, ugly. Fleury and Janet rip him free of the
Suburban.
Haytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped
vehicle. Haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster-tail.
In Arabic:
SERGEANT HAYTHAM
They're going to disappear...
Desperate, Fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing
Suburban: the rooster-tail it leaves getting smaller. Al-
Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway
traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on
instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's
feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tourniquet
around Sykes' reminder of an arm.
Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his
state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the
larger mass, then the topper-
-AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal bursts
around us: this attack is still going.
Fleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the
median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of
stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held high
out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another opening
to finish the job.
Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many have
abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest
go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for
the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack
dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the
next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH.
RONALD FLEURY
(back to his crew)
GET DOWN!
KINGDOM 8/18/06
119.
Al-Ghazi starts screaming in Arabic, motioning frantically to
the CITIZENS who have turned back, running toward them, in
Arabic:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
DOWN!
Fleury's view blocked by fleeing Saudis: just intermittent
flashes of the Mercedes braking hard, massive dust cloud
behind them, sliding toward the opening Fleury pre-sighted.
Intermittent wild shots fired from the SUV, vaguely in our
direction.
Fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle, just
forward of the handle: full-auto. Takes a deep, measured
Sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his
right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip
perfectly: one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap.
The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears.
Fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit the
Mercedes: Al-Ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo from
a knee. Something bright red pops against the driver's side
window now, the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop. Commotion
inside. Wild, half-aimed shots back at us.
Then it starts up again. Al-Ghazi bolts toward the line of
stopped traffic. Searching for something big, empty, still
running. Fleury right on his heels.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
WE MOVE NOW OR WE LOSE HIM.
Early 90's Land Rover. Desert tough. Driver long-gone,
exhaust plumes pumping out. Al-Ghazi dives into the Driver's
seat, Fleury shotgun. Guns it to the rest of the Survivors,
an eye on the rooster-tail of the Mercedes he and Fleury just
shredded, heading the same direction as Leavitt's kidnappers.
Al-Ghazi jumps out, ushers Haytham into the Driver's seat. In
Arabic:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
You know Suweidi -- you know how to
go fast.
Fleury helps Sykes into the rear. Janet loads the weapons.
Jump in.
The Land Rover spits it's own tell-tale plume as it sprints
away down the median, dodging traffic, in desperate pursuit.
Startling silence comes sudden now as the fight moves
elsewhere. Receding engines. Petering screams/shouts.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
120.
Hold on the flipped, still burning/still smoking Suburbans.
Surreal in the sun/smoke/haze.
122
123
Janet's sitting with Sykes in the rear, readying weapons and
ammo. She hands him twin Berettas - Sykes' double-fisting
despite his wound, looking forward to a fight.
SYKES
Nobody's gonna hurt Leavitt but me.
Driver's Seat P.O.V.: on the median, 95 MPH, dodging
abandoned and escaping cars. High-beams flashed on-off-on-
off, constant horn, gaining on the Mercedes' rooster-tail
ahead of them.
124
127
Haytham searching for the turn-off: where the rooster-tail
they were following cut left, died. At the last minute, he
sees tire marks headed down an embankment into a decrepit,
decaying apartment block neighborhood. Haytham cuts hard,
fish-tails. Sykes' head SMASHES into the rear-side window,
starring it.
They're being lead into Riyadh's most hostile neighborhood.
AL-GHAZI
We should not be here...
JANET'S POV: scanning for the trail Suburban and the Mercedes
- she can't help but notice the neighborhood. Halfway past an
intersection, Fleury yells:
RONALD FLEURY
BRAKES-REVERSE-TO THE RIGHT...
Haytham brakes, reverses: the Suburban.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
122.
128
128
Without hesitation Haytham pulls across the cramped street,
surrounded by the same decaying buildings. Ahead: CIVILIANS
huddled behind cars, poking heads out from behind shacks.
A second passes: these people know where the attackers went.
Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly
just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his
back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past
on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the
little boy was nodding a warning-
What follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat:
GRANT SYKES
-GET OUT OF-
-big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse
and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield
bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles
bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the
dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor
panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes.
A Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE
thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off
the roof and into the Land Cruiser.
Frantic, Fleury swats it out.
The blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel
into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of
shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4:
returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and
all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds
everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle:
firing out the back door, more covering fire. Civilians who
were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight.
129
129
A SHOOTER: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school red-white-
black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face
backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what
else.
Shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge,
firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting
a fire-cracker.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
123.
We see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of
blindly-fired shells pop the asphalt inches from Fleury's
head, soiling his face in black-top debris. But Fleury never
stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on
reflex. Air Jordan grabs another grenade just before he
disintegrates: Fleury's three-feet away with the riot gun.
Another rack and blast to make sure A.J. stays down for
eternity.
Fleury spots and bull-charges a second SHOOTER: Ballistic
Chicken, Fleury wins. A sound... Fleury spins, racking the
riot gun, aims and FREEZES: 2 six year old BOYS stare from
the doorway.
130
130
Haytham crouches in front of the Land Cruiser. Rocks thrown
now from somewhere: KIDS peeking from behind shacks
Palestinian-style. He's pelted in the side of the head.
Janet and Sykes move to a stopped vehicle and take cover.
From the rooftop, Fleury yells down to the men on the ground.
FLEURY (O.C.)
I CAN SEE THE MERCEDES... BLOOD-
TRAILS RIGHT UP TO AN APARTMENT IN
THE NEXT BUILDING-
131
131
Fleury's P.O.V.: an Apartment complex that looks like a
roadside motel: exposed stairwells, walkways, entrances. A
puddle in front of one of the front doors on the third floor.
Then we look right, one street over: civilian FIGURES, some
in traditional dress, starting to mass.
FLEURY
MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK!
He drops the riot gun, picks up the AK from the man he just
killed, pops a new clip from the backpack, slings the
backpack over her shoulders. Starts to hustle down.
132
133
Running down side stairs, Fleury spots a grenade launcher
poking from a door, next-door to the apartment with blood-
pool in front.
RONALD FLEURY
RPG!
Empties his clip into that vicinity: windows shatter, wood
splinters. The grenade launcher recedes. Janet and Al-Ghazi
start to run. The launcher fires from its new position...The
trail suburban DETONATES. Al-Ghazi and Janet knocked flat on
their asses for second and third times: dazed.
Fleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading,
how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a
grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly.
Bounces just on the third floor landing-
134
135
Sykes takes cover between two cars, holding down the rear,
firing warning shots and screaming football plays to freak
out the LOCALS.
SYKES
THIRTY EIGHT RAZOR MAD DOG!!!
He fires above the crowd, as Janet heads into the building.
Two LITTLE KIDS slowly approach carrying water, obviously
terrified at the sight of the wounded American.
Sirens and helicopters sound in the distance.
136
136
Base of the stairs: Mayes joins Fleury and a dazed Al-Ghazi &
Haytham.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
A tunnel networks through all these
places... they use attached
civilian Apartments, innocent
families.
JANET MAYES
I do not like these people.
RONALD FLEURY
We go in the front door. Haytham -
cover the stairs. Janet - hallway.
Watch the side doors. Watch your
backs.
Silent nods. Bracing for war...
KINGDOM 8/18/06
125A.
They move 3 levels up the stairs into the building, following
the blood-trail from the SUV to the Apartment. PEOPLE step
out of their doors. Al-Ghazi aiming at them:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(in Arabic)
INSIDE!
137
137
The puddle of blood, a trail leading under the door. The
front wall/window/entrance of the next apartment down, still
smoldering from Fleury's grenade. No sounds, words. Our team:
fingers on triggers, weapons to shoulders, sights-aligned.
Ten feet back. Shoulders already flexed with tension,
expecting a suicidal blast at any moment. Janet grabs another
grenade, moves to secure the hallway.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
126.
Intercut Sykes outside. Haytham on the stairs.
RONALD FLEURY
(beat, to Al-Ghazi)
Is Allah on the other side of that
door?
Al-Ghazi raises his prayer beads to Fleury.
AL-GHAZI
(beat)
I think were about to find out, my
friend.
Fleury moves forward: I'm primary through the door. Al-
Ghazi's right with him. Fleury gets three-point-stance low,
hits the door like Jim Brown. Scattered gunfire. Fleury opens
up in response.
Fleury never stops forward motion. Stumbling headlong into a
kitchenette, hard into a refrigerator and cabinets, firing
the whole time. Al-Ghazi blasting anything that looks like a
body. Straight mop-up operation.
138
139
Huge Man ATTACKS Janet. Vicious hand to hand blows. Still
tied, Leavitt does what he can, kicking at the attacker.
Adrenaline morphs Janet from scared and out-sized to
desperate and equally vicious. This is SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
shit with Leavitt as the observer. He's no coward - he's
doing everything he can.
Huge Man overtakes Janet, slow-choking her... she's gasping,
dying... Janet has a knife out and is shredding the big man's
back right thigh and ass. BOTH SCREAMING. From nowhere,
Fleury ends the fight with a butt-end baseball-swing of the
shot gun to Huge Man's head.
Janet: fucked up, but alive.
JANET MAYES
(to Leavitt)
Sykes is going to kick your ass.
Al-Ghazi follows Fleury into the room. Leaning to Janet,
Fleury sees Leavitt, puts his hand on his head. Leavitt's
somewhere else, tears in his eyes, just taking deep, measured
breaths.
RONALD FLEURY
Everybody OK?
Slow nods from Leavitt and Janet as Fleury cuts Adam's ties.
FLEURY
There's at least three more of
them.
As Janet's eyes catch on something: a sheet/half-assed
backdrop hung from the ceiling has been nearly pulled down -
exposing a crude square cut out of the wall - a path into
another Apartment.
Janet points to the hole in the wall. This isn't over: a
seven-year old GIRL peers out at her, shaking, tears in her
eyes. Janet tries her best Motherly smile.
JANET MAYES
It's okay Little One.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
128.
The little girl backs away. Janet gets up, steers Leavitt
outside. Sits him down. Hands him a Glock.
Fleury and Al-Ghazi step through the hole. Janet follows. A
blood trail snakes through Little One's room, out her door,
and deeper into another apartment. Little girl long gone into
the main part of the Apartment. Then, Arabic SCREAMS, the
metal-crashing sound of automatic GUNFIRE.
Sirens overheard outside now.
140
140
Hustle cautious into the apartment. Haytham stands in the
room already: the muzzle of his AK still smoking, held on a
man down. The other occupants of the room are a cowering
FAMILY: KIDS and a couple of real OLD FOLKS, all terrified. A
little boy cries by himself, huddled in a corner. The
collateral damage of random violence. Janet quick scans the
room. LOCKS EYES on the traumatized little boy, his innocence
draining as she watches. Can't take her eyes away.
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM:
Taking this all in: The violence. The terror of this family,
the defiance on the faces of these young souls.
Al-Ghazi, post-game shakes, a tear running down his cheeks,
spattered in blood, stares at Fleury. The man Haytham shot is
not dead: ragged gasps. Fleury and Al-Ghazi lock eyes, then
take in the tragedy of the room -- kids their children's age,
never to be the same. Al-Ghazi to the room, In arabic:
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Is everyone alright?
Silent stares from the Saudis. The little girl Janet saw
earlier, eyes still on Janet, moves to her brother - he holds
her tight, his eyes down. Janet kneels, heart-breaking, holds
her hand out: I can help you little one.
The Little Girl holds a fist out to Janet, tears in her eyes:
okay. Janet slowly crouches over to her, the older women's
eyes on her, piercing.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(to the little girl, in
Arabic)
It's okay.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
129.
Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to
her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her
little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a
gift for you.
Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a
marble...
Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things.
Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER
staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al-
Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out...
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(in Arabic)
Let me help you up, Old Man...
The old man nods a `no.'
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(in Arabic)
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS!
Al-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al-
Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing
fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his
eyes, lifts his chin with his hand.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
(dazed, starting to
realize)
...Hamza.
The old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)
I got you. Abu Hamza, you are under
arrest.
ABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi.
NASSAR
You are a traitor to your
country... a traitor to your God.
COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I am no traitor to my God. You are.
Al-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15
year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM.
Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the
floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather
with him.
KINGDOM 8/18/06
130.
Fleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only
see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son...
not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick:
RONALD FLEURY
...Don't...
The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger
again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims
it at the boy's chest.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
...drop it, Son...please...
...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough
to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half
something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his
hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking
shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another
round into the chamber.
Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger.
Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's
fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the
old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing,
the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still
screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers
something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear.
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying
teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for
his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in
Haytham's eyes.
A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room.
Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the
bleeding...
Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears
spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man,
back down to Al-Ghazi.
Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would.
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
You got him. You got him... You got
him.

Our crew watch from a deserted terminal as a C-130 touches

Haytham enters: came to say good-bye. The team's first smiles
-- collective. Fleury stares at Haytham...thinks about what
he's seen the past few days...how he has come to admire this
Kid. Haytham smiling, bandaged himself. Halting and awkward,
he shakes Janet's hand.
HAYTHAM
(in Arabic)
Thank you.
JANET MAYES
Thank you, Lieutenant Haytham.
Haytham says good bye to Leavitt and Sykes. Comes to Fleury.
Hands him a beautiful wooden prayer bead necklace.
HAYTHAM
