      An immense interior, configured for passengers -- almost all 
      YOUNG MEN IN UNIFORM, almost all asleep, in spite of the 
      TURBULENCE.  They really pack  em in:  picture coach on the 
      world s worst airline and take away the creature comforts.  
      Against each windowless side there s a row of seats facing 
      inward.  One of these is empty.  That s because:


      REBECCA KINCAID, M.D., is in the bathroom, struggling with an 
        OVER-THE-COUNTER PREGNANCY TEST KIT.  She s in her late 20 s 
      or early 30 s and she s beautiful, though she d be the first 
      to admit we re not seeing her at her best right now.  She s 
      wearing a brand new Canadian Forces desert camo uniform, a 9 
      MM pistol strapped to her thigh.  She s about to get a result 
      from the test strip when the PLANE HITS A BUMP, her head 
      SMACKS the bulkhead, and the test kit goes flying.

                                    REBECCA
                    Dammit to hell!

      A KNOCK on the door.

                                  MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Okay in there, ma am?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yes!  Out in a minute!

      The test strip has landed on the filthy, sticky floor, 
      useless.  As Rebecca uses a tissue to pick it up and flush 
      it, we HEAR a MICROPHONE-AMPLIFIED VOICE:

                                  MAJ. GEN. VAN DER VELDE (O.S. PRE-LAP)
                    ...and although today we officially 
                    recognize it, the smooth transition 
                    to NATO command...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                          COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - TEASER - 2.



      Rebecca takes her seat, careful not to wake DR. BOBBY SINGH 
      in the seat next to her.  Bobby s late 20 s and looks 
      younger.  Like Rebecca, he wears desert camo; he s a Captain 
      while she s a Major.  But in this case those ranks don t 
      indicate Army experience:  Captain is the entry level rank 
      for a general practice doctor like Bobby, while Major is the 
      entry level for a specialist like Rebecca.  More telling is 
      their brand-new uniforms, which, to the experienced eye of 
      the US AIR FORCE FLIGHT CREW SERGEANT approaching Rebecca, 
      clearly identifies them as new to the Army. 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                          COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - TEASER - 4.

                    States Air Force.

      He offers her a pair of airsickness bags.

                                    REBECCA
                    Why would you think I d need these?

                                  USAF SERGEANT
                    Well, to be honest, Major, you 
                    haven t been sleeping and you look a 
                    little pale.  And this ll be your 
                    first combat landing, I m guessing.

                                    REBECCA
                    Good guess.  What s a combat 
                    landing?

                                  USAF SERGEANT
                    We don t want to draw ground fire, 
                    so we fly an evasive pattern.  The 
                    troops love it... the ones that 
                    don t puke.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The cabin lights come up to full strength as an ANNOUNCEMENT 
      comes over the speaker: 

                                  FIRST OFFICER (O.S. ON LOUDSPEAKER)
                    This is the flight deck, prepare for 
                    the cabin for combat descent.  
                    Buckle up, everybody!

      The announcement wakes Bobby Singh.  He rubs his eyes.

                                  BOBBY
                    Get any sleep?

                                    REBECCA
                    No.

                                  BOBBY
                    Still?  

                                    REBECCA
                    There s a lot on my mind.

      But she doesn t offer any details and he doesn t ask.  
      Instead, he looks at the airsickness bags.

                                  BOBBY
                    What s that for?

      She hands him one.

                                    REBECCA
                      Apparently we re expected to throw 
                    up now.

      Suddenly the plane FLIPS ON ITS SIDE and DROPS LIE A STONE -- 
      Rebecca and Bobby, horrified, are flung forward, restrained 
      only by their seatbelts, as...


      ...the YOUNG SOLDIERS enjoy being flung violently from side 
      to side:  most WAVE THEIR ARMS, like kids do on a roller 
      coaster.  






                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                          COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - TEASER - 6.

      CONTINUED:

      REBECCA AND BOBBY

      try to brace themselves against the extreme, unpredictable 
      motion but it s no use.  Rebecca s looking paler by the 
      second.  Bobby s head SMACKS into hers.


      It s essentially one big room subdivided with plywood into 
      eight semi-private trauma bays.  DOCTORS, NURSES and MEDTECHS 
      work feverishly to care for the SEVEN AFGHANI CHILDREN who 
      came in unexpectedly.  But there s no shouting or yelling:  
      they work intensely but quietly.


      Colonel Leclerc sews up a FRIGHTENED SMALL BOY S arm. 

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    What s your name?

      VANS, the 17-year-old Afghani  terp  -- interpreter --
      translates.  He s everybody s favorite kid brother.  We see 
      the source of his nickname:  his T-shirt with the  Vans 
      Warped Tour  logo on the front.  

                                  VANS
                    His name s Aref.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    You re doing great, Aref.  Almost 
                    done.

      Vans translates, and Aref looks a bit less frightened.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Col. Leclerc comes out of Bay 3 into the main Trauma Bay 
      where he s interrupted by a young woman with a clipboard, a 
      unit CLERK (CORPORAL LISA ZUCKER). 

                                  CLERK LISA
                    Any details on the IED, sir?

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Check with Vans, he s talked to all 
                    the kids.

      Lisa hurries off; Col Leclerc grabs a moment with Will 
      Willett, the chief nurse.  

                                  COL. LECLERC (CONT D)
                    How we doing, Will?

                                  WILL WILLETT
                      Everything s under control for now, 
                    but what about--

      Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) Sean Kelly hurries in.  He s 
      the unit s senior enlisted man and Col. Leclerc s steady 
      right hand in all things military.

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    It wasn t just a screw up, sir. TOC 
                    reports there really are seven 
                    Marines, 30 minutes out.  One 
                    sucking chest, two bad bleeders with 
                      tourniquets in place, rest unknown.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Okay.
                          (to Will)
                    Anything non-emergent that can t be 
                    finished in 15 minutes doesn t get 
                    started, we ll deal with it later.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Rebecca and Bobby drag their duffle bags inside to the 
        admissions/waiting room area.  There s no one in here, 
      either.  The front desk is currently unmanned.

                                    REBECCA
                    Okay, now this is starting to feel 
                    like the bizarro world.  Wait.  I 
                    hear something in there.


      Rebecca and Bobby push through into the trauma bay where 
      NURSES and MEDICS work swiftly to prepare for the next wave 
      of casualties.  (The Afghani kids have all been treated and 
      moved to the ward.)  No one takes any notice of Rebecca and 
      Bobby until Will Willett spots them.

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    The outpatient clinic s closed, but 
                    if you take a seat outside we ll see 
                    you as soon as we can.

                                    REBECCA
                    We re not sick.  We re reporting for 
                    duty.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 11.

      CONTINUED:

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Oh, sorry.  You looked a little...
                    Never mind.  We can use you. 

      He grabs a pair of mops and gives one to each of them.

                                  WILL WILLETT (CONT D)
                    Get the blood off the floor so 
                    nobody slips.

                                    REBECCA
                    You don t understand.  We re 
                    doctors. 

      A nurse, MAJOR SUZY CHAO, gives Rebecca a who-does-she-think-
      she-is look.

                                  SUZY CHAO
                    Does that mean we have to show you 
                    how to mop the floor?

                                    REBECCA
                    No, I know how to mop, but-- 

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Good.  Thanks.  We just had a rush 
                    and we re about to get another.

      Then he s off. Rebecca gives Bobby a look that says,  can you 
      believe this shit? 

                                    REBECCA
                    I guess we mop the floor.  

                                  BOBBY
                    I guess so.

      No sooner do they start than they re interrupted by 
      Regimental Sergeant Major Kelly bursting in behind them.

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    Who the hell left their damn duffle 
                    bags in the middle of admissions?

                                  BOBBY
                    Sorry, that was us, we just got in.

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    Major Kincaid?  Captain Singh?  We 
                    met your plane yesterday.

                                    REBECCA
                    We got stuck in Kuwait.

      Colonel Leclerc blasts in from the opposite direction.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Any update?

                    Dustoff 17 five minutes out, 
                    Colonel. Dustoff 22 is right behind 
                    with four on board, no details 
                     cause TOC s only getting every 
                    second word.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    And who are they?

      He means Rebecca and Bobby.  The RSM answers before they can.

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    Major Kincaid and Captain Singh, 
                    reporting for duty, sir.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    We were expecting you yesterday.

                                    REBECCA
                    Sir, we--

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Don t tell me -- Kuwait. 
                          (looks at Rebecca)
                    You feeling all right?

                                    REBECCA
                      Absolutely, sir.  I m good to go.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Fine.  Follow me.

      Col. Leclerc turns to head back the way he came.  Rebecca and 
      Bobby put down their mops and hurry to catch up.


      Rebecca and Bobby practically have to jog to keep up with the 
      Colonel as he leads them down the corridor.  The plywood wall 
      to their left goes only up to the waist high; above the 
      plywood, the rest of the wall is made out of sheets of scared 
      Plexiglas, so they can see 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 13.

      CONTINUED:

      INTO THE OPERATING ROOMS  

      where OR One and Two are being prepped; a surgical procedure 
      in still going on in OR Three.  Col. Leclerc raps on the 
      Plexiglas to get the SURGEON S attention, then holds up his 
      splayed hand to indicate  five minutes.   The surgeon gives 
      him a thumbs up.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Sorry we have to put you to work the 
                    minute you get here, but then...

      They round the corner...


      ...into another hallway that also has a wall of Plexiglas and 
      duct tape along the left side.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    ...I think you ll find that 
                      everything here is not like anything 
                    you ve experienced before.  That s 
                    our ICU, eight beds plus a couple of 
                    isolation rooms for detainees. 

      Bobby s feeling very much like the new kid on the block, but 
      Rebecca s used to quickly rising to the top of the class in 
      every situation she s ever been in.  And she sees no reason 
      for that to change.

                                    REBECCA
                    Actually, sir, I trained at both 
                    Detroit Receiving and Miami 
                      General...

      They round another corner...


      ...as Rebecca continues:

                                    REBECCA
                    ...we could see four, five, even six 
                    gunshot wounds a night.

      Col Leclerc s still walking in front of them, so they don t 
      see the trace of amusement that flashes across his eyes.

                                  COL. LECLERC 
                    I don t doubt it.  Those doors lead 
                    to the ward, and in here...

      He leads them through a doorway to the left.                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 14.



      Half shipping container, half tent; half briefing room, half 
      lounge.  

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    The US Army used to call this the 
                     ready room,  and I haven t thought 
                    of another name.

                                  SIMON (O.S.)
                    The  unready room,  I call it.

      The VOICE of DR. SIMON HILL emerges from behind an old sofa.  
      He raises himself INTO THE SHOT to glance at the newcomers, 
      then, seeing Rebecca, shambles to his feet.  Simon s almost -- 
      no, definitely -- too handsome for his own good.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Well, hello.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Dr. Hill, our neurosurgeon.

      Simon shakes hands with Rebecca; it stops just short of being 
      a caress.  He uses his very sexy voice to full advantage.

                                  SIMON
                    Please, call me Simon.

                                    REBECCA
                    I m Rebecca.

                                  BOBBY
                    I m Bobby.

      Simon s handshake with Bobby is decidedly less warm then his 
      handshake with Rebecca.  Simon gazes into Rebecca eyes.  
      Almost against her will Rebecca feels flattered by Simon s 
      intense focus.  Col. Leclerc impatiently cuts this short.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    You can change into scrubs over 
                    there.  Just your shirt.  Pull that 
                    curtain for privacy.

                    What do we do with our weapons?  
                    Keep wearing them?

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    You re required to wear your weapon

                    In here, you can leave it in one of 
                    the lockers or wear it, whatever you 
                    like.  I always wear mine because 
                    I m always going in and out -- and 
                    also I like it -- it s a constant 
                    reminder that we re in a war zone.

      RSM Kelly appears at the door.

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    Sir, two minutes out.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Any new details?

      As the Colonel and Regimental Sergeant Major continue their 
      quiet, urgent exchange, Simon addresses the curtain behind 
      which Rebecca s changing.

                                  SIMON
                    Tell me, did they try to hand you a 
                    mop?

                                    REBECCA
                    They didn t just try, they 
                      succeeded.

                                  SIMON
                    They tried that on me.  They didn t 
                    get very far, let me tell you.

      RSM Kelly takes off; Col. Leclerc turns to Bobby, who hasn t 
      bothered to pull the curtain of the men s changing area.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    You ve been a trauma team leader 
                    before, right?

                                  BOBBY
                    Yes sir.  In training.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Then you re the TTL in bay 4.  

      Rebecca comes out from behind the curtain with a scrub top 
      over her camo pants and desert boots.  Bobby s changed by 
      this time, too.

                                    REBECCA
                    Ready, sir.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Come on.  You too, Simon, all hands 
                    on deck.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 16.

                                  SIMON
                    Right behind you, Colonel.


      Again the Colonel sets a blistering pace.  Rebecca and Bobby 
      try to keep up.  Simon s left way behind.

                                  BOBBY
                    To be honest with you, sir, I m more 
                    a general practice guy.  I like to 
                    think I m a good diagnostician, but--

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    You know your ABC s, don t you?

                                  BOBBY
                    Of course, sir.  Airway, breathing, 
                      circulation.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Then you ll be fine.  

      Rebecca s more than a little taken aback by the focus on 
      Bobby, who obviously feels under-qualified to be a Trauma 
      Team Leader, whereas she s overqualified if anything.

                                    REBECCA
                    I have tons of TTL experience, sir.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    I want to keep you free for surgery.  
                    Until then, just stand by in case 
                    someone needs help.  The bathrooms 
                    are there, the out-patient clinic s 
                    on the left...

      They make yet another right turn.


      They trot down this new hallway past a set of offices.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    That s the admin office, that one s 
                    my office, in there s the TOC -- 
                    that stands for?

                                    REBECCA
                    Tactical Operations Center.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Good, you read the manual.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 17.

      They HEAR the SOUND of helicopters approaching -- and feel 
      it, too: the whole flimsy building SHAKES with vibrations.

                                  COL. LECLERC (CONT D)
                    They re here!  Let s go!

      He breaks into a run and they follow, bursting through a set 
      of swinging doors...


      ...back into the room they started in, this time from a side 
      entrance -- they ve made a complete 360 degree circuit of the 
      building in under five minutes of real time.  Col. Leclerc 
      peels off to meet the incoming helicopters.  Will Willett 
      sees Bobby looking like a deer in the headlights.  

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Trauma bay 4, doctor?  This way.


      Will literally steers Bobby into place at the head of the 
      table.  A NURSE and THREE MEDTECHS are ready to go.

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Meet Dr. Bobby Singh.  Captain Pam 
                    Andries is your nurse/anesthetist, 
                    your medtechs are Larry Alexander, 
                    Eric Astin and Christine Ezrin.

      Nods all around.  Bobby still has that deer-in-the-headlights 
      look that s hardly reassuring.

                                  WILL WILLETT (CONT D)
                    Don t worry, they ve got your back.

      Rebecca, watching from the open entry, takes this all in.


      --without pausing through the Trauma Admissions area, 
      bursting through the second set of swinging doors--


      --into the big room and from there turning into one of the 
      spaces partitioned with plywood, the one called

      TRAUMA BAY FOUR

      where the PARAMEDIC running with the litter YELLS a report.

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    GCS 9, BP 100 over 40, pulse 102 and 
                      thready...

      As his report continues, they grab the delirious young Marine 
      PRIVATE FIRST CLASS -- his nametag reads  LOWEN  -- and

                                    MEDTECH ALEXANDER
                    One, two, three.

      --on  three  they transfer him to the table.  They cut off 
      his clothes; someone drapes a cloth over his crotch; they 
      hook him up to instruments and add additional IV lines as PFC 
      Lowen writhes around in semiconscious agony while Bobby 
      stands frozen, trying desperately to think.

                                  BOBBY
                    GCS 9 -- should we tube him?

                                    NURSE/ANESTHETIST ANDRES
                    Your call, doctor.

      At the foot of the table Rebecca s watching this, itching to 
      take over, as Bobby still hesitates.

                                    MEDTECH ALEXANDER
                    Shallow breathing!  I m getting 
                    nothing on the right side!

                                  BOBBY
                    We ll tube him.  Could I-- 

      The nurse slaps a laryngoscope into his hands before he can 
      finish asking.  She also sedates the young Marine who goes 
      limp.  Bobby slowly works the laryngoscope into the PFC 
      Lowen s throat and attempts to insert an endotracheal tube.

                                    NURSE/ANESTHETIST ANDRES
                    B.P. falling -- 75 over 20.

                    Damn!  You got a smaller tube?

                                    MEDTECH ASTIN
                    What about more blood, doctor?  You 
                    want a central line?

                                  BOBBY
                    Central Line?  Yeah, good idea...

                                    NURSE/ANESTHETIST ANDRES
                    02 sat 93% and falling.

      Bobby s struggling with the smaller endotracheal tube and 
      struggling harder to think:  his patient s going south fast.  
      Rebecca takes a step forward and is about to intervene when 
      Colonel Leclerc appears beside her.

                                  COL. LECLERC 
                    Like some help with that airway, 
                    Doctor?

                                  BOBBY
                    Yes, please.

      He steps back, allowing Col. Leclerc to get his hands on the 
      laryngoscope.  The Colonel gets the tube in on the first try.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Okay, bag him.

      The nurse/anesthetist has the respirator bag ready; she hooks 
      it on and starts breathing for the patient.

                                    MEDTECH ALEXANDER
                    Shallow in the left, still nothing 
                    in the right.

      Emboldened by Col. Leclerc s example, Rebecca steps up to the 
      patient s right side, grabs a scalpel off the instrument 
      tray, and cuts a deep hole between the young Marine s ribs.

                                    REBECCA
                    Chest tube.

      A MEDTECH hands her one, which she slides into the opening 
      she just created.  The tube immediately fills with blood.

                                    MEDTECH ALEXANDER
                    That got it.  I m getting bilateral 
                    breath sounds now.

      We may not understand a single word they re saying, but 
      there s no mistaking the RELIEF WE HEAR in their voices.

                                    REBECCA
                    Should we take him to the OR?

      She asks Colonel Leclerc, but Leclerc looks to Bobby.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Doctor?  What would you like?

      But Bobby just stands there, crushed with humiliation and 
      embarrassment.  Col. Leclerc lets Bobby off the hook.

                                  COL. LECLERC (CONT D)
                    It looked like we got a little less 
                    than 800 CC s from the chest tube.  
                    Under 800, we try to manage 
                      conservatively: fix up the numbers 
                    in the ICU, then get them on the jet 
                    to Landstuhl.  More than 800, or 
                    more than 300 CC s an hour, then 
                    it s straight to the O.R.  This is 
                    right on the border, so it s your 
                    call, Doctor.

      Leclerc s trying to restore Bobby s self-respect by that last 
      comment, but Bobby s beyond that.

                                  BOBBY
                    Whatever you say, sir.


      Rebecca and Bobby look through the Plexiglas window 

      INTO THE ICU

      where Colonel Leclerc gives some last instructions to the 
      NURSES caring for young Marines -- we see Lowen, Bobby s 
      patient -- and the Afghani children from earlier. 

      BACK TO REBECCA AND BOBBY

      as they watch Leclerc at work.

                    Doesn t he get tired?

                                  BOBBY
                    Don t you get tired?  I slept on the

                    It s the adrenaline.  Which is 
                    starting to wear off, believe me. 

      RSM Kelly comes up to them with orientation folders.

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    Ah, there you are.  Here s your 
                      orientation packet.  It has your 
                    room assignments, your keys -- I had 
                    your bags taken over already.  

      He hands them each a beeper.

                    Old fashioned but reliable, unlike

                    Mine doesn t work at all.  But 
                    Rebecca s been getting text 
                    messages.

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    That reminds me.  You had an e-mail 
                    message, Major.  Sent via the DND in 
                    Ottawa. 

      He pulls it out of Rebecca s folder and hands it to her.

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY (CONT D)
                    You each have individual e-mail 
                    addresses in your folders.  Please 
                    tell your friend to use that.  The 
                    Kandahar Role 3 e-mail is for 
                    official business only.

      Rebecca, embarrassed, balls up the message in her fist.

                    If he does it again, please tell him 
                    to eat shit and die.

      Colonel Leclerc comes out of the ICU.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Got them sorted out, Sean?

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    Yes, sir.  And fine additions to the

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    You may, and I couldn t agree more.

      Bobby gives a snort of self-disgusted amusement at this.

                                  BOBBY
                    Yeah.  One of us, anyway.

      At a glance from the Colonel, RSM Kelly tactfully steps away. 

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Walk with me.  

      Colonel Leclerc puts a hand on Bobby s shoulder to pull him 
      out of Rebecca s earshot.

                                  COL. LECLERC (CONT D)
                    So what does that mean?

                                  BOBBY
                    Oh, come on, Colonel, you saw what 
                    happened.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    What?  Did somebody die without 
                    telling me?  No.  Nobody died.  When 
                    he came in to your trauma bay, he 
                    was dying, no question about it, and 
                    he went out alive and there he is...
                          (points to ICU)
                    ...PFC David Lowen, 19, from Dayton, 
                    Ohio, about to come off the 
                      respirator and live a long life.

                                  BOBBY
                    No thanks to me.  I couldn t think.  
                      I couldn t even get the tube in.

      ANGLE ON REBECCA

      as she watches Leclerc talk with Bobby.  She JUMPS when she 
      feels a hand on her shoulder.  It belongs to Dr. Simon Hill.

                                  SIMON
                    Sorry if I scared you. 

                                    REBECCA
                    You didn t scare me.  You startled 
                    me.

                                  SIMON
                    I stand corrected.  Are you feeling 
                    all right?

                                    REBECCA
                    I m perfectly fine.  Why do people 
                    keep asking me that?

      Leclerc finishes his talk with Bobby and turns to Rebecca.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Mind if I cut in, Simon?

                                  SIMON
                    Of course not, Colonel.  
                          (to Rebecca)
                    I ll be in the unready room.

      Simon goes off; Col. Leclerc takes Rebecca aside this time.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    You did a very good job with that 
                    chest tube tonight.

                                    REBECCA
                    Thank you, sir.  But I sense there s 
                    a  but  coming.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    How well do you know Bobby Singh?

                                    REBECCA
                    We only just met.  But we ve been 
                    traveling together for 48 hours.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Well, you completely undermined his 
                      confidence by stepping in like that.

      Rebecca s stung by the injustice of this.

                                    REBECCA
                    Me?  Sir, I didn t do anything 
                    before you did.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    I asked permission.  You took over.  
                    Big difference.  Did you see that 
                    line of red tape on the floor?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yes, sir.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Know what it means?

                                    REBECCA
                    No one goes past the red line.

                                  COL. LECLERC

                    He d have survived another minute 
                    and by then Bobby would have ordered 
                    the chest tube.  Let me spell it out

                    But I ve got eight trauma bays and 
                    only three OR s, so if I could only 
                    pick one of you, I need a confident,

                    more than I need a hotshot Trauma 
                    Surgeon.  Do I make myself clear?

      The look on her face tells us it s crystal clear.  The 
      colonel doesn t raise his voice, which if anything makes it 
      tougher to take, particularly for Rebecca, who is used to 
      nothing but praise, and was expecting nothing but praise now.

                                    REBECCA
                    I m sorry, sir.

                    Don t do that either -- that d only 
                    make him feel worse.  Just remember 
                    next time.  Can I count on you to 
                    not do that again?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yes, sir.

                    Good.  Other than that, you did very 
                    well today.

      Col. Leclerc takes off down the hall.  Rebecca and Bobby 
      rejoin each other, both feeling humiliated in different ways, 
      each wondering what the Colonel said to the other.  Leclerc 
      has an afterthought -- he turns back.

                                  COL. LECLERC (CONT D)
                    Oh, I forgot.  That business with 
                    the mop?  Don t believe Simon.  That 
                    wasn t some fraternity hazing 
                    ritual.  The nurses and medtechs 
                    know where everything is and what 
                    needs to be restocked.  The doctors 
                    don t.  And blood, you know, is 
                    slippery.  So the doctors mop the 
                    floor.  

      He turns away, then turns back one more time.

                    Kandahar.

      The Colonel disappears around the corner, leaving Rebecca and 
      Bobby standing together in the now empty hallway, as alone as 
      they were when they entered the building.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT TWO - 27.

      FADE IN:


      Rebecca and Bobby finish changing while Simon waits on a 
      dilapidated sofa.  The ROAR of the fighters gradually fades.

                                    REBECCA
                    Do you ever get used to the noise?

                                  SIMON
                    I ve been here a year, and no.

      Rebecca emerges from behind the curtain of the women s 
      changing area.  Simon stands.

                                  BOBBY
                    It s really nice of you to stay and 
                    show us our rooms.

      To Simon, it s so obvious that he s staying because of 
      Rebecca, he suspects Bobby s joking.

                                  SIMON
                    Are you being sarcastic?

                                  BOBBY
                    Huh?

      Bobby s completely baffled.  Simon quickly shifts gears.

                                  SIMON
                    Never mind.  Follow me.


      Across the hall from the ready room are doors marked  Blood 
      Bank  and  Pharmacy,  both locked a this hour.  Simon 
      produces a key which he uses to open the Blood Bank door.

                                  SIMON
                    One of the privileges of being a 
                    civilian -- I was able to insist on 
                    a key to the blood bank.

                                    REBECCA
                    Why would you need access to blood?

                    I don t.  I need access to the 
                    freezer.

      As they watch from the doorway, Simon goes

      INTO THE BLOOD BANK ROOM

      where he opens a freezer and pulls out a thermos bottle.

                                    REBECCA
                    What is it?  Vodka?

                                  SIMON
                    And not just any vodka -- the real 
                    Russian stuff.

      During this he s come back

      INTO THE SOUTH HALLWAY

      and re-locked the blood bank.  Rebecca glances at the door 
      marked  Pharmacy. 

                                    REBECCA
                    You don t have a key to that, by any 
                    chance?

                                  SIMON
                    Sadly, no, but what do you need?

      A pregnancy test kit.

                                    REBECCA
                    Something for sleep.

      Rebecca lies really well.  Still, Bobby s incredulous.

                                  BOBBY
                    For sleep?  You haven t slept 
                    since...  I ve lost track.

                                    REBECCA
                    I m still keyed up.

                                  SIMON
                    I m sure I can help you with that. 


      The plywood partitions that make the individual rooms don t 
      go all the way to the ceiling, so privacy is minimal.  Simon 
      opens one of the doors leading off the tiny hallway--

      THEIR POV:  BOBBY S ROOM

      --revealing the kind of two-person room you d expect in a 
      boys  boarding school or a minimum security prison, only 
      those would have better construction.  Bobby s bags have been 
      piled on one bunk; a SNORING MAN occupies the other one.

                                  SIMON
                    That s your roommate, Bobby.  
                      Oberstleutnant Dr. Dr. Max Ebeling, 
                    to give him his full title.  
                    Wonderful fellow, but no one wants 
                    to room with him -- he snores, as 
                    you see.  

                                  BOBBY
                    He could play the tuba and he 
                    wouldn t wake me.

      Bobby goes into the room, pulls his bags onto the floor and 
      sprawls on his bunk without undressing:  he falls asleep 
      almost instantly.  Simon shuts Bobby s door.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT TWO - 30.

                    you up.

      He leads her further down the tiny hall.


      The same size as Bobby s but much nicer because Simon doesn t 
      have to share.  Simon s fixed it up with ANTIQUE SILK AND 
      WOOL CARPETS both underfoot and hung like tapestries on the 
      walls.  He offers her the only chair; he sits on the bed.

                                    REBECCA

                    Yes, dammit.

      She pokes at her phone savagely, deleting one text after the 
      other.

                                  SIMON

      The team responds purposely and quickly to Bobby s 
      instructions.  The sedative knocks the patient out almost 
      instantly, allowing Bobby to insert the laryngoscope while 
      he s still giving his orders.

      Rebecca tears open a chest tube kit and makes a deep incision 
      between the Taliban s ribs.  Bobby takes a deep breath before 
      carefully inserting the endotracheal tube.  This time it goes 
      in the first try.  Rebecca gets the first chest tube in

                    Oh, yeah?  Tell them to watch this.

      She picks up a fresh scalpel, cuts a deep hole in the 
      Taliban s flank, then shoves her gloved index finger all the 
      way in.  For the Afghani soldiers, who turn pale at the 
      sight, it s a convincing demonstration that the Taliban 
      prisoner is indeed unconscious.  After a few more words from 
      Vans, the Afghani soldiers take off.  Vans turns to Rebecca.

                                  VANS
                    That was so cool, how you just 
                    stabbed him like that.

                    Did you meet our terp yet?  This is 
                    Vans.  Vans, Drs. Rebecca Kincaid

                    Nice to meet you, Vans -- but I 
                    didn t stab him, I made an incision.

                                  VANS
                    Whatever, you made the point.

      Col. Leclerc appears in the entry.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    What ve we got here, doctor? 

      Rebecca keeps working on the second chest tube; she knows by 
      now to keep her mouth shut.

                                  BOBBY
                    Adult male, history unknown, 
                      presenting with GSW s to mid thorax 
                    and LLQ abdomen.  We sedated and 
                    intubated and placed bilateral chest 
                    tubes for decompression.  He s had 
                    three liters each of LRS and 
                    universal donor whole blood but he s 
                    losing volume as fast as we give it.  
                    Recommend immediate laparotomy and 
                      thoracotomy to control the bleeding.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Without a CT scan?

                                  BOBBY
                    Yes, sir.  In my opinion the risk of 
                    fatal hypovolemia outweighs the 
                    benefits of imaging.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Very well, doctor.  Will?

      Will Willett instantly reappears at Colonel Leclerc s side.

                                  COL. LECLERC (CONT D)
                    This one s going straight to OR 3 
                    without passing Go and without 
                      collecting 200 dollars.  Surgeons 
                    are Dr. Kincaid and myself.
                          (to Rebecca)
                    Which do you want, the chest or the 
                    belly?

                                    REBECCA
                    The chest.

      Leclerc s impressed:  she s taken the more challenging of the 
      two procedures.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Good choice.
                          (to Bobby)
                    And good work, doctor.  I want you 
                    to follow this guy s post-op.

                    Fix up the numbers in the ICU and 
                    make sure he gets a CT scan.


      Rebecca and Col. Leclerc operate on the Taliban prisoner from 
      opposite sides of the table, with Leclerc well along in his 
      exploration of the abdomen while she s deep in the prisoner s 
      chest.  Every so often he flicks his eyes over to check on 
      her work.  His eyes don t reveal what he thinks.


      The ward s one big room with 14 beds that can be curtained 
      off from each other.  With the Afghani children and wounded 
      Marines, on top of the OTHER PATIENTS already here, the 
      ward s almost full, so Will Willett s creating more space by 
      putting the kids two in a bed.  Will picks up Aref, the 
      smallest kid, his arm now wrapped in bandages.  Aref looks 
      terrified.

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    What s his name?

                                  VANS
                    Aref.

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Hi, Aref!

      Will makes some funny faces, and before long has little Aref 
      laughing.  Meanwhile A YOUNG SOLDIER in a Canadian Forces T-
      shirt with an IV plugged in his arm gets out of bed.

                                  WILL WILLETT (CONT D)
                    And where do you think you re going?  

                                  YOUNG CANADIAN SOLDIER
                    Just over there, sir.  I don t need 
                    to take up a bed.

      The young Canadian soldier pulls his IV stand over to the 
      wall and takes a seat on the floor.  Not to be undone, TWO US 
      MARINES also drag their IV stands over to sit on the floor 
      next to the Canadian.  Will Willett s so moved by this 
      gesture that he has to clear his throat before saying...

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Thanks, guys.

                                  YOUNG CANADIAN SOLDIER
                    Not a problem, sir.

      CONTINUED:

      Will sees ANOTHER MARINE struggling to get up like the 
      others, only this one has a leg wound.

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Don t even think about it!  Your leg 
                    needs to be elevated, so stay right 
                    there.  That goes for the rest of 
                    you.  We have enough beds now.


      Rebecca and Col. Leclerc are closing the Taliban prisoner.  

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Very nice job on the thoracotomy.  
                    They trained you well at Miami 
                    General.

                                    REBECCA
                    Thank you, sir.

      Without raising his voice, Col. Leclerc instantly gets 
      everyone s attention.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Nobody move.  Hold very still.

      Rebecca and the OR staff all freeze.  Rebecca watches, wide-
      eyed, as Leclerc pulls the glove off his right hand, then 
      cautiously DRAWS HIS 9MM out of the shoulder holster he 
      always wears.  He takes careful aim at the floor past 
      Rebecca, who, obediently keeping still, does not turn to see 
      what he s aiming at.  BAM -- Leclerc FIRES A SINGLE SHOT.  
      Now she turns to see:

      A PIT VIPER

      with its head blown off.  The deadly snake was less then six 
      feet from her legs.

                                  COL. LECLERC (CONT D)
                    Could I get a fresh glove?

      A STUNNED NURSE pulls a glove onto his outstretched hand.

                          (to Rebecca)
                    I don t want you to think that s an 
                    everyday occurrence, because it s 
                    not -- not even here.

      RSM Kelly bursts in, an M-16 assault rifle at the ready.

      He picks up the snake and carries it off.

                    I have to admit, that was a first.

                    hear that.


      Rebecca comes in to her room for the first time to find her 
      bags, as promised, on her bunk.  Rebecca sits down, almost 
      too tired to shove the bags onto the floor.  This moment of 
      privacy and exhaustion reveals a vulnerability to Rebecca 
      which normally hides under her I-can-do-anything-better-and-
      faster facade she presents to the world.  That facade snaps 
      back in place when the door opens and MAJOR VANESSA PEDERSEN, 
      40 s, Danish, a no-nonsense psychiatrist, comes in.

                                  PEDERSEN
                    Well, hello.  You must be Rebecca.  
                    I m Vanessa Pedersen, your roommate.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT TWO - 40.

                    Pleased to meet you.

                                  PEDERSEN
                    And I m so delighted to see you 
                    awake and dressed and ready.  I was 
                    worried you d be too tired.

                                    REBECCA
                    Too tired for what?

                                  PEDERSEN
                    The Colonel didn t tell you?  We do 
                    a women s clinic, off the base.  
                    Afghani women won t come to the 
                    hospital, you see.  They d be 
                      dishonored if they re seen by men 
                    outside the family.  So the women 
                    from the hospital, we go to them.

                                    REBECCA
                    Actually, I am kind of tired.

                                  PEDERSEN
                    Oh.  Well, it s strictly volunteer.  
                    But I was hoping -- you see, we do 
                    get a lot of physical problems as 
                    well as the emotional ones.  In 
                    fact, most of the women we see are 
                      physically sick.

                                    REBECCA
                    Stands to reason that you d see a 
                    lot of sick people at a clinic.

                                  PEDERSEN
                    But I m a psychiatrist.  My medical 
                    training on the physical side is 
                    twenty years old.  I do the best I 
                    can, but even things like stitches, 
                    mine are pathetic.  But if you re 
                    really too tired...

      Rebecca uses her duffle bags to propel herself to her feet.

                                    REBECCA
                    I m not too tired.  Of course I ll 
                    come.

      FADE IN:


      Major Pedersen loads a bag with supplies as Rebecca hunts 
      through the shelves for something.

                      Dressings, tape, syringes... 
                          (sees Rebecca looking)
                    Help you find something?

                                    REBECCA
                    Do we stock pregnancy test kits?

                                  PEDERSEN
                    I never saw any.  Why?

                                    REBECCA
                    Don t some of the women who come to 
                    the clinic want to know if they re 
                    pregnant?

                                  PEDERSEN
                    I ve never had an Afghani woman ask 
                    me that.  I don t think they d 
                    regard it as a medical question.

                                    REBECCA
                    Well, suppose someone on the base 
                    thought she might be pregnant?  
                    There s got to be a way for her to 
                    find out.

      Major Pedersen regards her curiously.

                                  PEDERSEN
                    I suppose we d just send a urine 
                    sample to the lab.

      Rebecca smacks her forehead.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT THREE - 42.

                                  PEDERSEN
                    It can t do complex microbiology, 
                    but it s fully equipped for all the 
                    routine stuff.  Do you have a 
                    special reason for asking?

                                    REBECCA
                    Me?  No -- just a general question.

      If Pedersen suspects Rebecca s lying, she doesn t let on.  
      The PHARMACIST -- a US Army Captain -- comes in to start her 
      day s work and sees them already inside.  

                                  PEDERSEN
                    Rebecca Kincaid, this is Captain 
                    Mary Ann Wade, our pharmacist.

                                  CAPT. WADE (PHARMACIST)
                    Nice to meet you -- but I didn t see 
                    you and you didn t see me.  I ll get 
                    a coffee.  Lock up when you leave.

      She exits, leaving Rebecca confused.

                                    REBECCA
                    What was that about?  

                                  PEDERSEN
                    This is one of those grey areas.  
                    The top brass like it that we run a 
                    women s clinic, hearts and minds and 
                    all that, but there s not exactly a 
                    budget for supplies.

                                    REBECCA
                    Wait -- are you saying they want us 
                    to run a Women s Clinic, but we have 
                    to steal the supplies?

                                  PEDERSEN
                    Not stealing, exactly.  What was 
                    that phrase Col. Leclerc used?

      Regimental Sgt. Major Kelly appears in the doorway.

                    The colonel s compliments, Majors, 
                    and can he see you in his office?


      As in every military unit, an effort s been made to make the 
      commander s office look nice.  The one touch of individuality 
      is the Colonel s racing bike, hung on the wall over the sofa 
      where Major Ghezal Samizay sits.  Pedersen and Rebecca arrive 
      in the doorway.

                                  PEDERSEN
                    You wanted to see us, Colonel?
                          (seeing Maj. Samizay)
                    Ghezal!  What s wrong?

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    The Women s Clinic isn t happening 
                    today.  Major Samizay thinks we re 
                    going to be attacked, because of our 
                    High Value Individual.

                                    REBECCA
                    The Taliban we operated on just now?

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Hakim Monib.  Turns out he s the 
                    number three Taliban in Kandahar 
                    province.  

                                  AFGHAN POLICE MAJOR SAMIZAY
                    In all south Afghanistan.  It was on 
                    Sky News.  The Taliban must know 
                    that he would be taken to this 
                    hospital.  They will lose respect if 
                    they do not respond.  There are 
                    rumors flying everywhere.  That is 
                    why no women would come to the 
                    clinic today.

      Vans appears in the doorway.

                                  VANS
                    Excuse me, Colonel--
                          (noticing Maj. Samizay)
                    Auntie!

      He respectfully leans down to kiss her on each cheek.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    What is it, Vans?

                    Sorry, sir.  The fathers of the kids 
                    from Arghandab are here, they want 
                    to take the children now.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    They were supposed to come tomorrow.  

                                  VANS
                    They think we are going to be 
                    attacked today.  They demand to take 
                    their children.

                    If the father s want to take the

      He scribbles a prescription and hands it to Vans.

                                  COL. LECLERC (CONT D)

      M.P.s stand guard as Hakim Monib, the number three Taliban in 
      Southern Afghanistan, struggles against his restraints.

                    If he doesn t hold still, I m going 
                    to have to sedate him.

      ANOTHER INTERPRETER translates.  The Taliban replies by 
      spitting at the terp.  Bobby fills a syringe and plugs it 
      into the Taliban leader s IV line.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT THREE - 45.

                    hundred.

      The Taliban manages to say a few words before he conks out.

                                    INTERPRETER 2

      SEVERAL AFGHANI FATHERS expostulate in Pashto with Will 
      Willett, who stands in the doorway, preventing the men from 
      leaving with the kids.

                    Nobody s going anywhere without 
                    their antibiotics.

      Of course they don t understand him any more than he 
      understands them.  Vans comes running down the hall with 
      seven bottles of pills which he hands out to the fathers.  

                                  WILL WILLETT (CONT D)
                    Each kid gets two pills a day, one 
                    in the morning, one at night.

                                  VANS
                    They say the Taliban have many 
                    rockets hidden in the mountains.

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    They give the pills with food -- 
                    that s very important.

      Vans translates.  The Afghani fathers are getting the idea 
      that they re not leaving until they hear Will s instructions.  

                                  WILL WILLETT (CONT D)
                    Give them all the pills until

      Will steps back from the doorway to let them past.  The 
      fathers lead the kids away with FURTHER EXPRESSIONS OF 
      GRATITUDE which need no translation.  Then Will realizes Vans 
      still has a pill bottle in his hand.  Will looks back into 
      the ward.  The smallest child, Aref, is still there.

                                  WILL WILLETT

      Will picks up the little boy and brings him out into the 
      hall.  The Afghani men shrug as Vans asks about Aref.

                                  VANS
                    Nobody knows who he is.

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Not even the other kids?

                                  VANS
                    No, nobody.  They say he s not even 
                    from Arghandab.  He must be from 
                    another village.

      The Afghani fathers take their children out, leaving Will 
      standing there with the little boy in his arms.

                    Good.  OR 1 is prepped and ready, 
                    take him in there.  Bobby, why don t 
                    you scrub in with her?

                                  BOBBY
                    Happy to, sir.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Good.

      And he s off as swiftly as he arrived.

                    We ve got to put taps on his shoes 
                    or something so he can t creep up 
                    like that.

                                  BOBBY
                    You sure you re not too tired for 
                    surgery?

                                    REBECCA
                    I m never too tired for surgery.  
                    There s nothing that makes me feel 
                    more...

      She gropes for the right word.  Bobby tries to supply it.

      The TOC is the communications hub for the hospital.  
      Information constantly flows in across the bank of seven 
      computer screens:  the TOC monitors all military activity so 
      the hospital has some idea what to prepare for.  Col. Leclerc 
      and RSM Kelly stand behind the two people watching the 
      screens.  TOC 1 is SGT. HANNAH CORDAY, CF, and TOC 2 is TECH.

                    Okay, Sean, you know what to do.


      Will Willett, with young Aref in his arms, orchestrates a 
      procession of patients from the ward being carried on litters 
      or, in the case of the YOUNG SOLDIER and MARINES we saw 
      earlier, walking, propelling their own IV stands, out through 
      the EMERGENCY EXIT DOORS on the north side of the building to  
      A CONCRETE BUNKER ten yards away.


      The patients in here can t be moved, so NURSES and MEDTECHS 
      drape ballistic body armor over them and put helmets on their 
      heads.  Among these patients is PFC DAVID LOWEN of Dayton, 
      Ohio (the young marine who was the first patient in Bobby s 
      trauma bay).  He s off the respirator and LAUGHING and JOKING 
      with some of his MARINE BUDDIES who ve come to visit, among 
      them LANCE CORPORAL  WHITEY  WHITE who is finishing a story.

      CONTINUED:

      That causes them all to laugh so hard PFC Lowen nearly pulls 
      out his stitches.  The duty nurse, Major Suzy Chao (who we 
      met when Bobby and Rebecca first arrived) comes over.

                                  SUZY CHAO
                    What s so funny?

                    I guess so.  Listen, you guys are 
                    going to have to go to the bunker.

                                  LCPL.  WHITEY  WHITE
                    Oh, come on, ma am, we re already 
                    wearing our frag vests, we ve got 
                    our helmets.

                                  SUZY CHAO
                    Sorry -- if my Colonel catches you 
                    in here during an attack, there d be 
                    hell to pay.

      Grumbling a little, the visitors head for the exit.


      Bobby assists while Rebecca works to find the elusive 
      bleeding vessel represented by the shadow on the CT scan.  As 
      they work, a NURSE drapes ballistic vests over their patient: 
      ironically, the Taliban leader gets this protection, while 
      the surgeons trying to save him can t be encumbered so they 
      get none.

                    Good.

      They HEAR the WAIL OF SIRENS from around the base, followed 
      by the SOUND OF AN EXPLOSION powerful enough to shake the OR 
      table.  Rebecca and Bobby s eyes meet:  oh, shit.  But they 
      carry on working.  Another EXPLOSION rattles the whole 
      building.  The LIGHTS FLICKER.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      As Rebecca and Bobby continue their very delicate surgical 
      work, another EXPLOSION rattles the operating room.  The 
      lights flicker again, then GO OUT ENTIRELY.  Pitch black.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Anybody got a flashlight?  Anything?

      The HUM OF GENERATORS trying to kick in, then the lights come 
      back on to reveal a horrific sight:  A SPRAY OF BLOOD shoots 
      several feet into the air, pulsing with every heartbeat.  
      Rebecca s caught with nothing but a scalpel in her hand but 
      Bobby has a clamp and he uses it on the artery she nicked.

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    Holy crap.  Thanks, Bobby.  Suture,

                    Let s hang some more FFP just in 
                    case.

      The CIRCULATING NURSE hangs a bag of fresh frozen plasma and 
      plugs it into the Taliban Leader s IV line.  Rebecca finishes 
      her repair of the nicked artery.  Her eyes meet Bobby s.  She 
      knows she came close to killing this guy.


      The claustrophobic cement bunker is packed with hospital 
      staff and patients.  Little Aref is frightened by the 
      EXPLOSIONS going off.  Will Willett tries to distract Aref by 
      taking the boy s picture with his cell phone.  Aref s 
      suddenly fascinated by seeing his picture appear on the 
      little digital screen.

      PFC Lowen s Marine buddies (who have stripped down to T-

      cameras or cell phones.  They take pictures of Aref, who s so

      Aref s having the time of his life riding on Will Willett s 
      shoulders as we see the evacuation in reverse:  now, the 
      litter bearers and the walking wounded are heading from the 
      bunker back to the hospital. 


      The nurses remove the fragmentation vests they ve used to 
      cover the patients.  


      The Taliban prisoner gets wheeled into the recovery room just 
      outside the ICU where he s hooked up to monitors.  


      Rebecca and Bobby, utterly exhausted, stagger like zombies as 
      they come down the hall to the Ready Room.

      Rebecca and Bobby come in, and all hope of crashing vanishes.  
      The Ready Room s packed with the whole staff, with Col. 
      Leclerc standing at the white board along one wall.

                    Ah, good, you re just in time for 
                    the end of rounds.  Max?  

      OTHER STAFFERS make room for Bobby and Rebecca to sit.  As 
      Bobby s roommate MAX EBELING reports in a German accented 
      monotone, Rebecca starts to nod off.  ANOTHER DOCTOR pours 
      her a cup of coffee and taps her on the shoulder.  Thinking 
      she s been called on, Rebecca by reflex starts a report.

                    If you re happy, I m happy.  


      The Taliban leader gets pushed across the ICU to one of the 
      two detainee isolation rooms in the back.  Rebecca and Bobby 
      follow.  They re surprised to see TWO ARMED MEN IN CIVILIAN 
      CLOTHES waiting for the prisoner.  They could be anything:  
      CIA, private contractors, special forces.  We ll call them 
      CONTRACTORS for now.

                                  CONTRACTOR 1
                    You the surgeons?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yes, who wants to know?

      IN THE BACKGROUND 

      of what follows WE SEE Suzy Chao, the ICU Nurse, take Bobby 
      over to introduce him to PFC David Lowen and his Marine 
      buddies.  Meanwhile

      IN THE FOREGROUND

      Rebecca deals with the two contractors.

                                  CONTRACTOR 2
                    Never mind who we are, miss.

                                    REBECCA
                    It s  doctor,  not  miss,  and what 
                    do you mean, never mind who you are?  
                    Where are the M.P. s who were 
                    guarding him?

                                  CONTRACTOR 2
                    We took over.

                                  CONTRACTOR 1
                    When can he be moved?

                                    REBECCA
                    When he s well enough.

                                  CONTRACTOR 2
                    When will that be?

                                    REBECCA
                    When I say so.

                    Rebecca?  Got a second?

                    Any other stupid questions?  No?  
                    Then excuse me.

      She turns her heel and goes over to where Bobby s standing by 
      PFC David Lowen s bed with the patient s Marine buddies.

                                  BOBBY
                    This is Dr. Kincaid.  She s the one

      Without warning Lance Corporal Whitey White SUDDENLY 
      COLLAPSES, falling to the floor unconscious -- the light 
      moment turns deadly serious in a flash.

                                    REBECCA
                    Back up!

      The other Marines make room.  Bobby, Rebecca and Suzy Chao 
      all kneel beside the stricken Marine.  Bobby tries to feel 
      for a pulse as we...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FIVE


      Bobby s got his fingers on the young Marine s carotid artery. 

                                  BOBBY
                    I ve got a pulse, rapid and weak.

      They pull off Whitey s clothes to examine him, revealing the 
      huge bruise on his side that Will spotted earler.

                                    REBECCA
                    How close was he to the explosion? 

                                  PFC LOWEN
                    Next to me -- but he wasn t hurt!

                                  BOBBY
                    Was he unconscious at any point?

                                  PFC LOWEN
                    Only for a minute.

      Rebecca s feeling Whitey s abdomen while Bobby checks his 
      eyes with a penlight.

                                    REBECCA
                    Belly distended and rigid.

                                  BOBBY
                    And a blown pupil.  Get Dr. Hill,

                                    REBECCA
                    He needs a CT scan, right now.  Help 
                    us get him on a gurney.

      Whitey s horrified friends hurry to help.

                                  PFC LOWEN
                    What s happening?

                                    REBECCA
                    He s been bleeding internally.

                                  PFC LOWEN
                    But he was fine!

      The young Marine says this to their backs as they re racing 
      with the gurney out of the ICU.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                      COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT FIVE - 59.



      Bobby, Simon and Rebecca urgently view the films from the 
      young Marine.  Col. Leclerc s been summoned and looks over 
      their shoulders.  They re appalled by what they see.

                                  SIMON
                    He must have had a slow intra-axial 
                      hemorrhage since the IED went off.

                                    REBECCA
                    And a splenic rupture.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    You better take him in right now.


      The other visiting Marines cluster in the hallway outside OR 
      2, looking in through the battered plexiglass at Whitey 
      White s surgery.  They mercifully can t see the patient, only 
      the surgical team surrounding their friend.


      Simon lifts off a major part of the young Marine s skull to 
      allow the brain room to swell.  Rebecca operates on his 
      abdomen at the same time.  Rebecca looks up to see the 
      Whitey s buddies looking through the plexiglass.

                                    REBECCA
                    Pull the curtain, please.

      The circulating nurse does so.  Just in time.  The cardiac 
      monitor s ALARM SOUNDS.

      Rebecca s and Simon s eyes meet.

                                  SIMON
                    This is swelling like I ve never 
                    seen.  Brain stem damage, no 
                    question about it.

                                    REBECCA
                    He s not in fib?

                                    ANESTHESIOLOGIST
                    No -- electroshock won t help.

                                    REBECCA
                    He s not clotting at all, either.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT FIVE - 60.

                                  SIMON
                    Does anyone think there s anything 
                    more we can do?

      Silence from around the OR.  The frivolous side to Simon 
      we ve seen so far is nowhere in evidence now.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    All right.  I have 12:17, local time 
                    Kandahar.  Let s take a moment.  

      Simon, Rebecca and the OR staff stand silently by Lance 
      Corporal Whitey White s body, each paying their last respects 
      in their own way.


      It s a WIDE ANGLE so we see the tableaux but don t hear the 
      words as Rebecca and Bobby break the news to PFC David Lowen 
      and the other Marines.

      CLOSER ANGLE ON THE MARINES

      as they mourn for their lost comrade.

                                  PFC LOWEN
                    I m sure you did all you could.

                                    REBECCA
                    We did.

                                  PFC LOWEN
                    I was the guy that got hurt, not 
                    him.  He was fine!

                                  BOBBY
                    He wasn t, I m sorry to say.  He 
                    thought he was, but he wasn t.

                                    REBECCA
                    Maybe if we got to him sooner -- I 
                    don t know.  We re very sorry.

      Rebecca and Bobby catch each other s eyes; they step back to 
      give the Marines some privacy by pulling the curtain around 
      PFC Lowen s bed.  Then they go around the ICU, checking on 
      the other patients.  Rebecca goes over to the detainee 
      isolation area.

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    What the hell?

      Bobby and nurse Suzy Chao run over to her, and now they see 
      what she s seeing:


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT FIVE - 61.

      CONTINUED:

      THE ISOLATION ROOM

      where Taliban leader Hakim Monib was being cared for IS NOW 
      EMPTY.  No Taliban, no contractors guarding him either.

                    They didn t go past me.

      But there s no other way out -- apparently, at least.  But 
      Rebecca points to a section the flimsy plywood outer wall 
      that s just leaning there, having been pried open.

                                    REBECCA
                    Dammit!


      Rebecca and Bobby trot down the hall.  Rebecca s hopping mad.  
      They encounter Will Willett, giving a piggy back ride to 
      young Aref.

                                    REBECCA
                    You see Colonel Leclerc?

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    He was in his office a while ago.  
                    Something wrong?

                                    REBECCA
                    You bet there is.  Somebody stole my 
                    patient!

      They hurry on down the hall.  Behind them, the lab tech 
      Rebecca left the urine sample with comes into the hall and 
      tries to get her attention.

                                  LAB TECH
                    Oh, Doctor!

      Rebecca s so intent on finding the Colonel that she doesn t 
      stop, but Bobby does -- he turns to answer the lab tech as

      REBECCA ROUNDS THE CORNER

      into the administration hallway.

      BACK IN THE SOUTH HALLWAY

      The lab tech comes up to Bobby, report in hand.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT FIVE - 62.

                                  BOBBY
                    Okay, but it better be good news.

                                  LAB TECH
                    That depends on her friend.

                                  BOBBY
                    Her friend?  A friend back home?

      The lab tech smiles.

                                  LAB TECH
                    No, a friend here.  Not unless she 
                    carried a urine sample on the plane, 
                    and I can t picture that.

                                  BOBBY
                    No, neither can I.

                                  LAB TECH
                    You ll give this to her, then?

      Bobby rather reluctantly takes the report.

                                  BOBBY
                    Sure.


      Rebecca, meanwhile, looks into Col. Leclerc s office but he s 
      not there. Rebecca continues on down the hallway.  She 
      arrives at the doorway of 

      THE TOC (TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTER)

      which always has soldiers scanning the computer screens.

                                    REBECCA
                    Anyone seen the Colonel?

                                  TOC 1 CORDAY
                    I think he s outside.


      Rebecca falls on her bed, fully dressed, and this time, 
      mercifully, she can sleep.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
