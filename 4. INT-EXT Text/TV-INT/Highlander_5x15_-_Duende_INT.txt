      A dark room.  The staccato beat of Flamenco fills the air. 
      A MAN'S VOICE is lifting, soaring in the sad, rough growl
      of the Flamenco canto.  Then --

      The camera moves to A SPOTLIGHT on the floor, centering on
      a pair of women's FLAMENCO SHOES, as slowly, dramatically,
      one heel lifts -- then SLAMS DOWN like a sudden pistol-
      shot.  The other heel follows, as a FLAMENCO GUITAR bites
      into the mix.  With increasing speed, the heels beat a
      staccato tattoo on the floor.  As the tempo increases we
      see --

      YOUNG ANNA HIDALGO

      The dancer, 22 and very beautiful, caught up in the
      smoldering passion of the dance with a handsome dark-haired
      dancer named RAFAEL.  The sexual tension between the two
      dancers is palpable as the music and dance interweave as
      tightly as two lovers' bodies.  In the background, the
      Singer and Guitarist wail.  Around them, several DANCERS
      from the Troupe look on.  And among these stands --

      OTAVIO CONSONE

      Elegant, with a hard, aristocratic bearing, he stands aloof,
      set apart by a paternal, controlling air.  This is his
      Troupe, and he watches Anna with an appraising look, liking
      what he sees.

      He steps toward her, moving with a dancer's lithe grace,
      CLAPPING as he urges her on.

                                            CONSONE
                          Passion, Anna... let me see your
                          passion!  Let me feel it!

      Anna responds to his urging, increasing the intensity. 
      There is sweat on her lip, her eyes are closing in a near-
      trance.

                                            CONSONE
                        That's it... that's it.
                              (almost to himself)
                        Duende.

1401CONTINUED:1401

      With a final flourish, Anna comes to an abrupt stop,
      exhausted, the dance over.  Consone takes her hand, turns
      to the others.

                                            CONSONE
                        You see?  This is how you dance the
                        Baile Grande.
                            (to Anna)
                        Magnifico.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                              (shyly)
                        Thank you, Senor Consone.

      She lowers her eyes, flattered by his praise, and starts
      to turn away -- but Consone pulls her back, smiling.

                                            CONSONE
                        Stay... I have a surprise for you.

      Anna has no idea what he means.  She looks puzzled as
      Consone, still holding her hand, turns them to face the
      rest of the troupe.

                                            CONSONE
                        My people, tonight, I invite you to
                        share the most joyous moment of my
                        life.

      He takes a dramatic pause.

                                            CONSONE
                        The moment Anna Hidalgo consents to
                        be my bride.

      There's a BEAT of silence -- then several Dancers applaud. 
      Anna can only stare, dismayed and dumbfounded, as Consone
      beams.

                                            CONSONE
                        Anna?
                              (beat)
                        Have you nothing to say to me?

      She throws a panicked look at Rafael, who looks equally
      dismayed.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        Senor Consone... Otavio... I
                          couldn't... I'm...

      Consone smiles indulgently.

                                            CONSONE
                        The shy bride.  You'll get over it
                        soon enough, I promise.

      The rest of the Troupe laugh.

                                            CONSONE
                        And my life will be spent making you
                        happy.

      He raises her hand to kiss it tenderly -- but Anna pulls
      it away, blurts it out --

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        No, you don't understand.  I'm already
                          engaged!

      The room falls deathly silent.  Consone stares, his smile
      frozen in place, not believing his ears.  Anna quails before
      his look, forces herself to continue.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        To Rafael.

      Consone throws a hard look at Rafael.

                                            CONSONE
                          Impossible!

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        I'm carrying his child.

      Consone goes white.  Several of the women gasp, cross
      themselves.  A cold veil drops over Consone's eyes.  With
      growing anger, he grabs her arm.

                                            CONSONE
                              (exploding)
                        Puto!  Whore!

      He spits out the insult like snake venom, and slaps her. 
      As he moves to slap her again, Rafael charges in and grabs
      Consone's arm.

                                            RAFAEL
                        Leave her!

      Consone turns, pulls a short poignard, and as Rafael runs
      at him -- coolly drives it into him.  There are screams,
      gasps of horror as Rafael falls.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                        NO! 

      She starts toward Rafael, but Consone grabs her hair and
      pulls her close.

                                            CONSONE
                        As long as you live, remember this...

                        That was only the first cut.

      She struggles, a hand reaches his face, scratching him
      badly.  Consone shoves her away, and she falls over Rafael's
      body, sobbing.

                                            YOUNG ANNA
                          Rafael... RAFAEL!

      Consone sweeps out, his dancers parting before his cold
      rage like the sea.  As he reaches the door, he pauses.

      CLOSE - CONSONE

      He puts a hand to his face where Anna scratched him.  As
      he takes his hand away -- we see the scratches are HEALED. 
      Consone scowls and slams out the door.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:



      On the floor, highlighted by a spotlight, beautiful young
      dancer LUISA HIDALGO, Anna's 24-year old daughter, dances
      the Flamenco.  (Please note: the same actress plays Luisa
      and Young Anna.) The GUITAR strums, her heels flash --
      she's fiery and captivating.  Off to the side, two other
      FEMALE DANCERS clap in time.  The mood is bright and lively.

      MACLEOD AND RICHIE

      Are seated at a front row table, enjoying the show.  Richie
      is mesmerized by Luisa -- he hasn't heard what MacLeod is
      saying.

                                            RICHIE
                              (distracted)
                        It's a what?

                                            MACLEOD
                        The dance.  It's called a soleares.

      The Audience starts to clap as the accompaniment becomes
      more insistent and the pace builds.

                                            MACLEOD
                        She's telling how her lover left... 
                        How she can't live without him.

      Richie gives him a look.

                                            RICHIE
                        What part are you watching?

      He turns back to Luisa, looking smitten.

                                            RICHIE
                        Man, she is beautiful.

      MacLeod gives him a knowing look.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Better put your eyes back in your
                        head, Romeo.
                              (pointing)
                        That's Anna... her mother.

      In the wings, Anna Hidalgo.  47, mature, full-bodied.  Her
      life has been a struggle and it shows.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96514  "Duende"               6.    Final Shooting Script 11/16/96

      She's the dance-master of the troupe.  She watches Luisa
      with the proud, critical eye of a teacher and mother.

                                            MACTEOD
                            (a smile)
                        So behave yourself.

      With a final stamp of feet, Luisa finishes.  Richie and
      MacLeod join in the applause.

                                            MACLEOD & RICHIE
                        Bravo!  BRAVO!

      MacLeod's eyes go to Richie, who is clearly having a great
      time.  He speaks as they applaud.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It's been a while since we just hung
                        out together.

                                            RICHIE
                              (warmly)
                        Like old times.
                              (beat)
                        Thanks for inviting me up.

      Anna basks in the crowd's admiration for a moment, then
      steps out.  She's pleasant, working the crowd.

                                            ANNA
                        You've been a good audience, but to
                        merely watch Flamenco isn't to know
                        its spirit.  For that...
                            (a smile)
                        You must dance.

      Her gaze falls on Richie.

                                            ANNA
                        You, young man.

                              hesitation)
                        Come, I'm not asking you to bullfight.

      The audience laughs.  Richie squirms under the attention.

                                            RICHIE
                        I'd love to, really, but --
                              (beat)
                        Too many left feet.

      The audience laughs.

                        I see.  Then perhaps your friend?

      She smiles at MacLeod.  MacLeod opens his mouth to object,
      but Richie beats him to the draw.

                                            RICHIE
                          Absolutely.  He'd love to.
                          Wouldn't you, Mac?

      The audience starts to clap rhythmically, urging him on,
      and Richie joins in.

                                            ANNA
                              (teasing)
                          Finally, a man with courage.

      MacLeod can't refuse.  He moves onto the stage and takes
      his position with Luisa.  Richie settles back, looking
      smug.  Finally, MacLeod out of his element.

      ANGLE - THE STAGE

      MacLeod stands beside Luisa as she takes her stance.

                                            LUISA
                        The feet, so.  The arms like so.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Like this?

      He arches gracefully into the tensed, dramatic stance of a
      seasoned flamenco dancer.  Luisa smiles.

                                            LUISA
                        Exactly like that.

      A FLOURISH of guitar.  A hush falls, their eyes lock
        dramatically -- an electric current seems to surge between
      them.

      Luisa begins to move.  MacLeod follows, matching her moves. 
      Luisa becomes more serious, begins to challenge him, and
      MacLeod responds, improvising.

      ANGLE - RICHIE

      At the table, shaking his head.  He throws up his hands. 
      How the hell does the guy do it?

                        Of course... of course.

      as they dance, a study in grace and tension.

      He smiles modestly.  As their clattering HEELS build to a
      frenetic climax

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:



      MACLEOD'S BOOTED FEET

      Tap out the zapateado of the Flamenco.

      A GYPSY DANCER performs Flamenco beside MacLeod.  His shirt
      is open, barely covering his chest which is glistening
      with perspiration.  It is a dance of seduction and passion,
      the Gypsy Dancer turning her back on her partner
      flirtatiously, pretending to reject him, then drawn back
      in by the passion of his dance.

      The audience, a mixed group of Gypsies and Spanish ARISTOS,
      loves it.  Among them is DON DIEGO DE GLORIA.

      In the corner of the room sits Don Diego's daughter,
      THERESA, 22.  She is wearing a hooded cape.  She is with

                        proper.

      Theresa is progressive for the times.  She is clearly a
      woman of her own mind.

      The old Duenna can only nod in agreement.

      As the Gypsy Dancer and her Guitarist gather up their

                        Bravo, Senor MacLeod.
                            (to Consone)
                        Tell me, Senor Consone, is your
                        student as talented with the sword
                        as he is with the dance?

                        You flatter me, Don Diego.

                        That was as finely danced as anything
                        I have seen.  Where did a gentleman
                        learn to dance like a gypsy?

                                            CONSONE
                            (with a wink at MacLeod)
                        Perhaps he was a gypsy in another
                        life.

      ANGLE - THE DUENNA AND THERESA

                          Quickly!  We have to leave before
                        Your father sees us.

      But Theresa is already gone, moving toward MacLeod.

      Theresa arrives with her Duenna close behind.

                                            THERESA
                        You were wonderful.

                        I told her, Senor.

      MacLeod charms the Duenna.

                            (with a bow)
                        Ah, Tialita, the inspiration of a
                          beautiful woman brings out the
                          Flamenco in Any man.

      This last, with a sly wink in Theresa's direction.  She
      returns his smile warmly.  Her Duenna reacts with a flutter.

                        It isn't a proper dance for an
                          unmarried girl to see.

      MacLeod smoothly shifts his attention to the Duenna, the
      look between him and Theresa concealed as he turns to flirt
      with the old woman.

                                            MACLEOD
                        So true, Senora.  The passion of the
                          Flamenco can only be appreciated by
                        one who has known the passion of
                        life.
                              (striking a pose)
                        I dance to her -- the woman of
                          experience!

      The Duenna blushes, giggles like a schoolgirl -- then
      hastily raises her fan, trying to regain her stiff dignity.

                                            DUENNA
                        Senor MacLeod.  Such talk is indecent!

      But she's clearly flattered.  Don Diego laughs along;
      Consone leans over and puts in his two pesos.  He speaks
      to the Duenna but looks at Theresa.

                                            CONSONE
                        Talk of love is never indecent,
                          Tialita.  Surely you are not too old
                        to remember what it was to be young.

      Clearly, it's coming back to her.  MacLeod bows to the
      Duenna.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Perhaps you'll let me see you home,

      Luisa settles into the wide seat, obviously upset over the
      confrontation with her mother.

                        Like I need a chaperone or something.

      A hand offers a glass of champagne.  She turns and we see
      her date is OTAVIO CONSONE.  Consone is elegant, dressed
      in hip, expensive clothes, a glass of just-poured champagne
      in each hand.  She takes the champagne.  He smiles to her.

                        I'm your chaperone.

      He smiles disarmingly, glancing through the rear window at
      MacLeod, adopting a tone of studied casualness.

                          yourself crazy.

                                            ANNA
                              (lost)
                        Maybe I already have.

      Richie feels her anguish, and his heart goes out to her. 
      He wants to tell her the truth.

                                            RICHIE
                        No, don't think that.

      He puts his glass down and kneels beside her.

                                            RICHIE
                              (beat)

                          Sometimes something seems impossible
                        but it's not... It's just the way it
                        is.

                                            ANNA
                        What way is this, Richie?  How could
                        this be possible?

      She searches his face.  Richie has no answer.



      MacLeod, looking preoccupied, has placed a long, carved
      antique WOODEN BOX on the table.  He is looking at it,
      lost in thought, as Richie paces behind him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What did you tell her?

                                            RICHIE
                          Anything... nothing.  What could I
                        tell her?
                              (beat)
                        She's afraid she's going crazy.  Her
                        mind tells her it can't be him.
                              (beat)
                        But she knows it was, Mac.  She knows
                        it in her gut.

      MacLeod places his hands on the box without turning.  He
      opens the box, slides out a short blade, then draws out
      its companion sword -- the weapons used in the Destreza.

                                            RICHIE
                        What are you doing with those?

      He hefts them in his hands, his voice distant, eyes far
      away.  He turns the blades in his hands, and OFF this

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:



      The same blade, as MacLeod and Consone face one another.

      The floor of the studio is painted with four large circles,
      with guidelines painted inside each one.  Within one circle,
      Consone and MacLeod are practicing the Spanish sword
      discipline, destreza, the art of the Mysterious Circle. 
      In the background, other pairs do the same.  Each man holds
      a long-bladed sword and, in the left hand, a dagger for
      parrying.

      Consone catches MacLeod's blade against his dagger.

                                            CONSONE
                        Hold.

      MacLeod freezes in position and Consone uses the dagger to
      move MacLeod's sword down, correcting the angle of strike.

                                            CONSONE
                        The wrist.
                            (as MacLeod adjusts)
                        Good.  Yes.

      Consone disengages and steps out of the circle to inspect
      MacLeod's form.

                                            CONSONE
                        Head.  Heart.  Shoulder.  Gut.

      Consone claps out the rhythm as he calls out the strikes,
      like a dance teacher.  MacLeod moves around the circle,
      pivoting feet and body to take each new position, his sword
      aiming at the named region on an imaginary opponent.

                                            CONSONE
                        Hold.

      MacLeod stays locked in position as his teacher corrects
      minute form breaks.

                                            CONSONE
                              (adjusting MacLeod's
                              arm)
                        So.  And... so.
                            (of the long blade)
                        The line is direct.  The master of
                          destreza is like a surgeon.

      He steps back into the circle, into the place of MacLeod
      imaginary opponent.  MacLeod's blade brushes Consone's
      abdomen -- right on target.  Consone knocks it away with
      his dagger, positions his own long blade in line for
      MacLeod's heart.  MacLeod parries hastily with the dagger,
      pivots sideways to present a narrower target, presenting
      shoulder instead of exposed gut.

                                            CONSONE
                        Now, exstranjero!

      He presses the fight.  MacLeod is on the defensive, but he
      has clearly learned well -- he parries well, moving around
      the circle, holding his own.  But he's rushed, sweating,
      where Consone stays clinical.

                                            CONSONE
                          Control!  This is gentleman's work,
                        not your gypsy dance.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (great effort)
                          Whatever it takes.

      With an unscripted spin, MacLeod succeeds in getting past
      Consone's defense and drawing blood from his shoulder.

      Consone reacts in surprise and a burst of fury at being
      bettered.

      He binds MacLeod's blade with his own, steps inside the
      circle, and quickly buries two inches of his dagger in
      MacLeod's gut.

                                            CONSONE
                        You are a good student.  But you
                        still have much to learn.

      Consone laughs.  MacLeod grimaces as Consone discreetly
      withdraws his dagger, unseen by the other fighters.

                                            MACLEOD
                        That was not necessary.

                                            CONSONE
                        Are you the Master, now?
                              (MacLeod shakes his
                              head)
                        You must be relentless.  Were this a
                        fight to the death, would you let a
                        dagger in the gut stop you?

                                            MACLEOD
                        I would not.

                        The art of the swordfight lies not
                        only in winning -- it lies in not
                        losing.  Let yourself believe you
                        are defeated, and you will be.

                        The champion is a man who fights
                        until the final stroke.

      MacLeod nods thoughtfully, absorbing the idea.

                        Now, my young friend, a bath.

      He puts his arm around MacLeod, leads him out of the circle.



      A simple place.  A couple of stone benches, a small window,
      and steam.  Both MacLeod and Consone are in towels and sit
      on a bench.

                                            CONSONE
                        You have good instincts, MacLeod. 
                        You never make the same mistake twice. 
                        If I had another year with you, I
                        would make a real swordsman of you.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I'm thinking of staying in Madrid.

                        Are you?  And I thought you had too
                        much of the gypsy in you.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Theresa wants me to propose. 
                          Marriage.

      Consone is dumbfounded.  He stares at MacLeod.  Finally:

                        A young woman of quality doesn't

      Consone turns his head so that MacLeod will not see his
      anger.  MacLeod is thoughtful, reflective -- not yet seeing
      the anger smoldering in the other Immortal.

                                            MACLEOD

                        I am the son of a clan chief.

      MacLeod is blindsided by this.  He stares at Consone.

      MacLeod is gazing at one of framed PHOTOS on the wall: a
      photo of Anna, a striking young beauty, dancing.  She looks
      like a bird caught in mid-flight.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Beautiful.

      He moves past other photos of Anna in different poses,
      different costumes.

                        before.  They know we're friends.

                        Then we'll just have to find
                        Someone they don't know.

      And off his thoughtful look --



      A small apartment.  Stockings and dance leotards are strewn
      around, set out to dry.  Two of the female dancers from
      Annals troupe are there: GILDA wears a skintight aerobic
      outfit, works out to a loud TV aerobics class.  There's
      knocking at the door; Gilda's not stopping.

                                            GILDA
                        It's unlocked, Manuel!

      The knocking continues.

                                            ISABELLA
                        I'll get it.

      ISABELLA crosses the room wearing a skimpy bathtowel.  As
      she reaches the door it swings open --

      Richie steps in, shades on, looking the entrepreneur.  He
      takes in Isabella.

                                            RICHIE
                        Whoa!  Have I come to the right place!

      Isabella steps back, pulling up her towel.

                                            ISABELLA
                        Who are you?

                                            RICHIE
                        Richie, uh... Richard Redstone.

      He offers his hand.  Isabella takes it.  The towel slips. 
      We are on her back as she moves slowly to grab the towel.

                                            RICHIE
                          Sorry...

      Her friend steps into the breech.

                                            RICHIE
                        I saw you at the Club.  Got your
                        address from one of the musicians,
                        what's his name... ?

                        That's it, Ramone.  He said you might
                        be interested.

                                            GILDA
                        In what?

                        Whaddya say?  Interested?

      They look at each other, break into smiles.

                                            GILDA
                        Maybe.

                                            RICHIE
                        Great.
                            (the clincher)
                        But there were three of you.
                        Where's the other one?

                                            GILDA
                        Luisa's not here.  There's only the
                        two of us right now.

                                            RICHIE
                        Problem... this is a problem.  I
                        need three dancers.  Can't you give
                        me her number?

      Gilda and Isabella trade looks.

                                            GILDA
                        We don't know where she is.

      In slow motion, Theresa's hands seem to be reaching for
      the camera as she falls down the flight of stairs.

      Consone stands at the top of the stairs, his face
      unreadable.



      The Club is closed, dark and quiet.  Anna has just opened
      up.  She turns on a light, looking drawn, moving across
      the room with a pronounced limp -- her leg is bothering
      her tonight.  As she walks

                                            CONSONE (O.S.)
                        That does look awkward.

      She whirls around in shock: Consone is standing there.

                                            CONSONE
                        Tell me, does it hurt?  Does it bother

      Anna backs away, thrown by his appearance there, her mouth
      working.

                                            ANNA
                        It... it was an accident.

                        That's right, Anna, a terrible
                          accident.

      He starts moving toward her.

                                            CONSONE
                        September, 1986.  St. Germaine...
                        You were watching the autumn leaves,
                        Anna.  You were wearing a red coat. 
                        You looked lovely.  You never even
                        saw the car coming.



      Anna backs away from Consone.

                                            ANNA
                        No.

                        How is your dancing, Anna?

      She screams and lunges at him, but Consone sidesteps, and
      she crashes painfully to her knees, grabbing a chair for
      support.

                                            CONSONE
                        Such behavior.  Is that any way to

      She pulls at his coat, sobbing.
