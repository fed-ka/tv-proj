      PULL BACK from the image, which is now ON SCREEN in the 
        surveillance van. We ve tapped into the park s security 
      cameras in order to see from our van. 

      FIND folded among the bulky equipment D.C. BRENDA JOHNSON. 
      DET. TAO and BUZZ, are also cramped inside the van. One side 
      of BRENDA S HEADPHONES are turned away from her ear -- this is 
      how we ve been hearing Sanchez, who is wearing a mic. 

                                                                      DIP TO BLACK


      We hear Guero s threats continue as Brenda squints at the 
      MONITOR.

                                  BRENDA
                    Detective Tao, can you read this?

      She runs her finger along the TATTOO covering Guero s forearm.

                                  TAO
                     Trust No Bitch. 

                                   BRENDA
                    At least he s not afraid to be up 
                    front with his feelings.

                                  GUERO (ON MONITOR)
                    We been fighting for this park for 
                    two years. It s ours. And now our 
                    blood s all over it. 

      Brenda presses a button on her mic, speaks to Sanchez,

                                  BRENDA
                    Sanchez, who were the dead ones 
                    dating? Did any of those women 
                    switch sides?

                                    SANCHEZ (ON MONITOR)
                    Your bitches, they down with you?

      We PUSH INTO the black and white monitor Brenda watches and 
      the image FLOODS with color...


      There s a shave-and-a-haircut KNOCK. Gabriel leans in the door.


                                    GABRIEL
                      Department of Sanitation s all 
                    done. Can we release the scene?

                                  BRENDA
                    Sounds good to me.

      Brenda unplugs her headphones, bringing SILENCE to the small 
      van. She stands, stretches. Watches ON THE MONITOR:

      A Uniform unwraps the CRIME SCENE TAPE. Most of the Looky-loos 
      have gone; a few Homeless Guys wait to reclaim their trees and 
      benches. Among these people, one stands out: an OLDER BLACK MAN 
      with an erect military posture. He carries a small SCOPE and 
      walks to where the bodies used to be. WE GO TO HIM... 


      Tao s computer simulation fills the ROOM S SCREEN. He sits in 
      the back, with his LAPTOP. 


      IN THE SIMULATION

      Big Mousy, the silhouette to the left of the dead body, 
      reaches for a GUN at his waist as Payaso s silhouette stands. 

                                  TAO (V.O.)
                    From the way the bodies fell, you 
                    can see some time elapsed between 
                    shots. 

      Another red line darts from the roof, aimed at Big Mousy s 
      head. The red line -- the bullet -- PAUSES in mid air.

      IN THE ROOM

      Tao addresses the troops.

                                  TAO  
                    Not much time, but enough so that 
                    the other two victims had a moment 
                    to react. 

      Tao presses a button and...

      IN THE SIMULATION

      The bullet resumes its trajectory to Big Mousy s head. It hits; 
      he falls. Payaso s silhouette starts to run.

                                  TAO (V.O.) 
                    They had time to be afraid. 

      The last bullet comes from the roof. Hits Payaso in the back 
      of the head as he tries to run away. The silhouette collapses.

      IN THE ROOM

      Brenda steps in front of the projection of the computer 
      simulation. It covers her face, briefly, before Tao turns it 
      off and the florescent LIGHTS FLUTTER ON.


                                  BRENDA
                    Three match-grade precision bullets 
                    were found -- 168 grain, dove-
                    tailed hollow-point .308s. They 
                    left small entrance wounds and 
                      grapefruit-sized exit wounds. 
                          (looks to Sanchez)
                    Detective Sanchez, how many 
                      sharpshooters did you see in your 
                    years on the Gang Intelligence 
                    Team?

                                    SANCHEZ
                          (leaning against a wall)
                    None.

                                  BRENDA
                    What s the lay of the land?

      He walks over to a whiteboard that contains a CITY MAP and a 
      PHOTO DIAGRAM of the power structures ( the family tree ) 
      within each gang. 

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    The victims were not veteranos, but 
                    they weren t just jumped in, 
                    either. They were in the middle 
                      management of the East Side 
                    Catorce. This is a Latino gang that 
                    claims the blocks...
                          (shows on the map)
                    ...from east 14th street to 
                    Wilshire. MacArthur Park is where 
                    their territory overlaps with 
                    another gang called The Jokers. 

                          (then)
                    They re similar gangs. Both deal pot, 
                    rock, H. and recently, both branched 
                    out into firearms.  

                                  BRENDA
                    So they wouldn t have any trouble 
                    getting the gun?

                                    SANCHEZ
                    No one would. It s probably an H&S 
                    Precision Pro 2000.

                    Used by SWAT and available on the 
                    internet. But there s no one in The 
                    Jokers -- no one in either gang that 
                    shoots like this. No new members, no 
                    old members.

                                  FLYNN
                    So there s a sniper on the loose.

                                  BRENDA
                    That s one way to say it.
                          (to Gabriel)
                    Any luck with the surveillance tapes?

                                    GABRIEL
                    The Park Plaza Hotel had a cooking 
                      convention in the lobby. There were a 
                    lot of people there yesterday. A lot.

                                  BRENDA
                    Flynn, would you please check those 
                    tapes. See if any of the faces pop out 
                    at you. I think we may be looking for 
                    someone with military or police 
                    training who also has a record. Lt. 
                    Provenza can help you.
                          (as Provenza moans)
                    Sgt. Gabriel and Lt. Tao, it was 
                    probably picked up on the street, but 
                    check and see who s bought an H&S 
                    Precision Pro 2000 in the last year. 
                    That s internet and retail. 


      POPE enters. The room comes to a stop. Pope nods to Brenda. 

                                  POPE 
                    Press conference. I want Sanchez to 
                    do it.

                                    SANCHEZ
                          (heavy Hispanic accent)
                    Do you wan  me to do it in Espanol?

                                  POPE
                    Couldn t hurt. C mon.

                                  BRENDA
                    Wait wait wait. 
                          (nods to Pope)
                    In the hallway.


      Pope and Brenda, pas de deux.

                    If you go on the air and tell Los 
                    Angeles to be on the look out for a 
                    sniper, it ll be D.C. all over 
                    again. People won t get out of 
                    their cars to get gas. 

                                  POPE
                          (she has a point)
                    The press already assumes this is a 
                    gang shooting. Does it help you to 
                    let them go on thinking that?

                                  BRENDA

                    Well, but the East Side Catorces 
                    are going to retaliate against the 
                    Jokers.

                                  POPE
                    You can t have it both ways, 
                    Brenda. Which would you rather?

                                  BRENDA 
                          (after a beat)
                    Okay. Gang violence escalates. 

      Pope exits. Off Brenda s conflicted expression, we cut to:

      A PHOTO:

      Another East Side Catorce lies face up in the dirt, single 
      shot to his head, half his brains on the sidewalk.

                                  FRANNY (O.S.)
                    That s Shorty you have there. It 
                    wasn t an important murder...


      Brenda with FRANNY SEVILLE, our homicide analyst. Brenda s 
      reviewing TWO CASE FILES. One features that brainy PHOTO next 
      to that dead guy s MUG SHOT. He was called  Shorty. 

                                  FRANNY
                    ...at the time. Single vic. Gang 
                      territory.

      She shrugs. Brenda looks at both the CRIME SCENE PHOTO and the 
      MUG SHOT of the other victim.

                                  BRENDA
                    And this other one,  Topo ?

                    Same deal.
                          (then)
                    What is that perfume?

                    No. I mean yes. But good. We didn t 
                    find any casings or bullets at either 
                    scene. I can t explain the casings, but 
                    the bullets have such velocity that 
                    they either disintegrate on contact or 
                    go through the head and deep into 
                      whatever s behind the target.

                          (indicating Franny)
                    Using my homicide analyst again, I 
                    see.

                                  BRENDA 
                    Captain Taylor, didn t you think 
                    these two gang killings--

                                  TAYLOR
                    Which two? Gang killings account 
                    for sixty percent of the homicides 
                    in this city.

                                  BRENDA
                    East Side Catorce. Happened last 
                    month. Two vics killed the same

                    A Catorce gets shot? He usually did

                    And the shooter ll probably get 
                    taken care of by the Jokers. It s a 
                    two-fer. Garbage in, garbage out.

                                  BRENDA
                    Would you be saying this if the 
                    victims were black?

      The temperature in the room changes. Taylor grows calm, very 
      still -- that too-stillness of anger. 

                                  FRANNY
                    I can go.
                        BRENDATAYLOR
      No.Yes.


      Franny goes. Taylor is her boss.

                                  TAYLOR 
                    These boys kill cops. So when they 
                    turn up dead I don t think black, 
                    brown, yellow, or white. The only 
                    color I see is blue. The gangs 
                    didn t start because of the police. 
                    They won t end because of the 
                    police. We just contain them.

                                  BRENDA
                    So investigating these murders is a 
                    waste of time.

                                  TAYLOR
                    How you allocate your resources is 
                    up to you, Chief.

      Taylor exits. Brenda watches him go. Thinks for a moment. 
      Thinks about the one person who does care.



      Outside her office, we see the Murder Room is empty, except 
      for the cleaning crew. 

      Brenda sits across from Col. Walter. He sits with perfect 
      posture and, like James Duff, radiates power. Col. Walter 
      taps his Marine Corps RING on the chair as they take a beat 
      to size each other up. 

                                  WALTER
                    I was glad to get your call.

                    I know the esteemed place women 
                    hold in the military. Pretty gutsy 
                    for you to come to a girl for help.

                                  WALTER
                    Well, you kept the press out of 
                    this. So you know what you re doing 
                    here. And your reputation cancels 
                    out your gender. Seven years in the 
                    CIA, four years in D.C., three and 
                    a half years Atlanta P.D. One 
                    marriage that... didn t end well. 
                    And your father was a Captain in 
                    the Army. So you know the drill.

                                  BRENDA
                    Well, I ve gotten to know you a 
                    little, too, Colonel.
                          (checking her NOTES)
                    Your most famous shot was from a 
                    moving boat on the Mekong Delta. 
                    Blew off the head of an enemy 
                    sniper from 900 yards. You had 72 
                    confirmed kills in Vietnam, 9 short 
                    of the record. 


                                  WALTER
                    You got my military file.

                                  BRENDA
                    It was a big help.

      She holds up a FILE that is completely redacted. Blacked out 
      page after blacked out page.

                                  WALTER 
                    Did you get my son s files as well?

      Brenda reads from a LESS-REDACTED MILITARY FILE. Shows the 
      Colonel (and us) a PHOTO of D.B. Walter Jr.

                                  BRENDA
                    Master Gunnery Sargent D.B. Walter 
                    Jr. was in a sniper unit as part of 
                    the invasion of Afghanistan. He was 
                    sent home in the spring of 2003. 
                    Because?

                                  WALTER
                          (a beat)
                    The road to his advancement was 
                    closed.

                                  BRENDA
                    Could you be more vague?

                                  WALTER 
                    The important thing you need to 
                    know is that two months after he 
                    came home, a stray bullet killed 
                    his wife, Donna. She was a social 
                    worker. Shot by an East Side 
                    Catorce. Wonderful girl. Wonderful. 

                                  BRENDA
                    Is her case still open?

                                  WALTER
                    Yes. Still interested in my 
                    opinion?

                                  BRENDA
                    Very.

                                  WALTER
                    That s why my son s doing this. You 
                    people can t find the guy who 
                    killed her. And he won t stop now 
                    until every Catorce is dead.

                                  BRENDA 
                    Why didn t your son seek revenge 
                      immediately?

                                  WALTER
                    Thought the LAPD was going to do 
                    it s job. He waited. Nothing 
                    happened. Last Christmas he walked 
                    out of the house and never came 
                    home. Set off to fight this war.

                                  BRENDA 
                    Tell me how you can help me.

                                  WALTER

                    You ll never find my boy on your 
                    own. He s behind enemy lines now. 
                    Disguised within that community. 
                    But I can tell you how he thinks. 
                    Might even be able to figure out 
                    who he plans to kill next.

                    I need your son s complete military 
                    records. Ones that aren t redacted. 

                                  WALTER
                    I want a list of every known East Side 
                    Catorce. Their names, their addresses.

                                  BRENDA
                    I want your records, too.

                    I ll give you the lists. 

  

      Brenda walks the Colonel to the elevators. He carries a THIN 
      MANILA FOLDER with the gang lists inside. 

                                  BRENDA
                    What are you hoping to get out of 
                    this? Helping me find your son?

                                  WALTER
                    If you get to him first - without

                          (the Colonel takes a beat)
                    My wife died fourteen years ago. 
                    And you know what it s like. Moving 
                    from post to post. Base to base. 
                    Your family becomes everything. My 
                    boy is all I have left. And I m 
                    pretty sure - if I m there when you 
                    find him, we can take him alive. 

      The elevator arrives, doors open.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    So. Partners then?

                                  BRENDA
                    Partners.

      Walters enters the lift. Brenda watches as the doors close on 
      their uncertain future.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Brenda stops by. She stands in the open doorway to Taylor s 
      office. She does not enter. Taylor doesn t look up. 

                                  TAYLOR
                    Well? I know you can talk.

                                  BRENDA
                    I need your help.

                                  TAYLOR
                          (delighted)
                    Again?

      He takes his reading glasses off. Gives her his full 
      attention. She shows him Walter Jr. s military PHOTO.


                                  BRENDA 
                    Does this face look familiar?

      He waves her in. She approaches his desk. He takes the photo.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    His wife was shot in 2003, spring. 
                    She was a social worker checking on 
                    a foster kid when she was hit by a 
                    stray bullet. 

                                  TAYLOR 
                      I remember the case. What was the 
                    last name?

                                  BRENDA
                    Walter.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Don t think so...


      Taylor pulls down a thick BINDER, looking for...

                                  TAYLOR
                    It was Quinn. Donna Quinn. She kept 
                    her maiden name.

      We see a PHOTO of DONNA QUINN: smiling and wholesome and 
      forever twenty-two.

                    Looks like several East Side 
                    Catorces were interviewed but...

                                  BRENDA
                    Nothing?

                                  TAYLOR
                    Nada. 

                                  BRENDA
                    Her husband came to see you.

                          (surprised she knows)
                    As a matter of fact, yes. He wanted 
                    to know why we weren t doing more. 
                    We offered a reward, set up a tip 
                    line. Re-canvassed the neighborhood 
                    again. I told him I didn t know 
                    what else to do.

                                  BRENDA
                    How did he act? Was he angry, did 
                    he lash out at you?

                                  TAYLOR
                    No. He was very calm. Very 
                      respectful. Just like his father.

                                  BRENDA
                          (surprised)
                    When did you meet his father?


                                  TAYLOR
                    Must ve been January 2004. He came 
                    to report his son missing. Asked to 
                    speak only to me. Wanted to go 
                    straight to the top.

                                  BRENDA
                    And...? Did you look for his son?

                                  TAYLOR
                    I filed the missing persons report. 
                    But we never found the boy. Or even 
                    the car he d been driving. He was 
                      definitely licensed to carry a gun -
                    - many guns -- and... I... well, I 
                    assumed he killed himself.

      She follows him into his office. He goes round to his desk.

                                  TAYLOR
                    The suicide rate for returning vets 
                    is somewhere in the seventeen 
                    percent range. I looked at his 
                    father and thought,  Here s a guy 
                    who would rather believe his son is 
                    missing than think the boy took his 
                    own life.  Never underestimate the 
                    power of grief.

                                  BRENDA
                    But if we assume his son s alive, and 
                    is seeking revenge for his wife s 
                      murder....  Five Catorces are dead. I 
                    believe Walter Jr. would stop this 
                    killing spree if he knew that he d 
                    already shot her killer -- which I m 
                    sure you d prefer, Captain -- or that 
                    we d made an arrest... which would 
                    also make you look good.

      They ve got a blown-up DMV PHOTO of Colonel Walter. They re

                    don t plan on losing him, ma am... 
                    That s why we re sitting here.


      He presses the  OFF  button on his phone. Through the window on 
      the driver s side of the car, we see the Gas Company Man with 
      blue overalls and blue baseball cap exits the Pantry.

                                  PROVENZA (CONT D)
                    My ex-wife used to call me like 
                    that. State the obvious. 

                                  FLYNN
                    Which ex-wife was this?

                                  PROVENZA
                    Number two and number four. I 
                    forgot how annoying she was and 
                    married her twice. 

                                  FLYNN
                    Did you divorce her or did she...

                                  PROVENZA

      Gabriel waits with JESUS GARCIA, a.k.a. PATO. He s a mean-
      looking Catorce veterano who is about twenty-seven -- ancient 
      in gang years. Pato can sense Gabriel s unease and rides him.

                                  PATO
                          (like a black gangster)
                    Whazzup, my brother? Lookin to buy 
                    some blunts? Where s yo  ho at, 
                    nigger? Cuz I can tell you da 
                    Original Gangster, yo.

      Tao passes by, hears that. Gabriel looks upset.

                                    GABRIEL 
                    I am not your brother.

                                  PATO
                    Don t like Mexicans. I could tell. 
                    Watch your back, brother--

      Finally, Sanchez rounds the corner, intercepts.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Jesus. 

                                  PATO
                          (re: Gabriel)
                    Where d you get this fool, man? 
                    Come with the new job?

      Sanchez pulls Pato away from a fuming Gabriel.


      Tao finds Pope standing over the monitors, operated by Buzz. 
      Tao looks to Pope but says nothing. Not sure how to say it. 
      Pope reads on Tao s face that something is terribly wrong.

                                  POPE
                      Prolonging it isn t going to make 
                    it any better. Spill.

                                  TAO

                    It seems that Colonel Walter has 
                    evaded surveillance.

      Gabriel enters, still pissed off.

                                  POPE
                    Who s Colonel Walter and why is he 
                    under surveillance?

                                  TAO
                    Someone the chief wanted us to 
                    follow. Maybe I should tell her.

                                  POPE 
                          (indicates monitors)
                    No. No. She and Taylor are playing 
                    nice for a change. Let s just enjoy 
                    the moment, shall we?

      ON THE MONITOR: Brenda and Sanchez sit at the table across 
      from Pato. Taylor leans against the wall behind them.

                                  PATO (ON MONITOR)
                    Que pasa, Julio...

      WE PUSH INTO the monitor, and GO TO THEM...


      Pato indicates Brenda and Taylor as he speaks to Sanchez,

                                  PATO
                    You need your mommy and daddy to 
                    watch out for you, man? Can t come 
                    in here by yourself? Or, is he...

                          (re: Taylor)
                    That other one s daddy? The fool? 
                    They look alike.


      Gabriel shakes his head, rolls his eyes. Tao turns to him,

                                  TAO
                    Don t sweat it, Original Gangster.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Please... O.G., if you must.


      Brenda begins.

                                  BRENDA

                          (imitating her accent)
                     Meeester Garcia...

                          (to Brenda)
                    Speaky Spanish?

      Brenda places DONNA QUINN S PHOTO in front of Pato.

                                  BRENDA
                    Likey prison? Spring, 2003, this 
                    woman, Donna Quinn, was shot.

                                  PATO
                    I don t know about that.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Witnesses saw a gangster Cutlass 
                    speeding away from the house.

                                  PATO
                    Every homie in the city s gots a 
                    Cutlass. That don t mean nothing.

                          (checks file)
                    Martin Garcia,  Mosca,  had a car 
                    like that registered to him. 


                                  PATO
                      Preguntas, preguntas -- hay un hombre 
                    who just was buggin  me about this. 
                    Buggin  a couple of us.

                                  BRENDA
                    What did that man look like?

                          (mimicking her accent)
                    Do you like your men that color? 

      Brenda ignores him, taking in the answer...

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Enough, Jesus. Tell us who shot that 
                    woman. And speak in English, you 
                    speak perfectly good English.

                    Bitch is dead. Rest in peace.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    We re not saying you did it, but 
                    you were there.

                                  PATO
                    No man. Spring, 2003, I was riding the 
                    beef. I was in County, man. Wayside. 

                                  BRENDA
                    She was shot March 22. You were 
                    released four days before.

                                  TAYLOR
                    And the person that lived in the 
                    house where she was shot? He was 
                    rumored to have killed your cousin. 
                    So he had some payback coming. 

                                  PATO
                    Sounds like you know more than I 
                    do, so why you asking me all these 
                      questions?


                                  BRENDA
                    Because the Jokers didn t do the 
                    shootings in the park. Your friends 
                    were killed by a sniper. 

                                  PATO
                    No way.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Same guy shot Shorty and Topo, too.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Think about it: one shot to the 
                    head. Each of them.

                                  BRENDA
                    It s retaliation for Donna Quinn s 
                    death. 


      This is all news to Pope.

      Pato says nothing. His PHONE RINGS. 

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Think of your hija. Your abuelita.

                    That two kids died last night is a 
                    tragedy, yes. But what s going on 
                    between The Catorces and The Jokers 
                    is an ongoing war. Which gives you 
                    some time to break this guy in 
                    half. And that s what I expect you

                    I - I was trying to find him before 
                    you did. Get him out of the

                    My boy s not a murderer. He s a 
                    soldier. And who is he killing? The 
                    enemies on our streets. 

      Brenda lays out the CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the boys  bodies.

                    Let me introduce you to Miguel and 
                    Luis. They were also killed last 
                    night. Why? Because they were 
                    standing next to a Joker whom the 
                    East Side Catorces decided to blow 
                    away in retaliation for your son s 
                    attacks. Look at them Colonel. Two 
                      nine-year-old boys. Are they our 
                    enemies, too? Or are they just 
                      collateral damage? Acceptable 
                    losses in your son s private war?
                          (off Walter s distress)
                    Will this stop him? Innocent lives 
                    lost while he goes about exacting 
                    his revenge. Probably not. 
                          (throwing more PICTURES on

                    The road to your son s advancement 
                    was closed you said. Why? Because 
                    U.S. forces mistook celebratory 
                    gunfire at an Afghanistan marriage 
                    ceremony for a hostile attack. A 
                    group of American soldiers ended up 
                    shooting every member of the 
                    wedding party. Including women and 
                    children. Your son was there.


                                  WALTER
                    That - that was an accident.

      A black man in a DASHIKI walks toward the camera passing 
      through the buyers and purveyors of the cooking convention, 
      swinging a KNAPSACK, bumping into a Mailman. The Dashiki s 
      eyes are covered; it s hard to see his face.


                                  WALTER (O.S.)
                    Freeze it there.

      IN THE ELECTRONICS ROOM

                                  WALTER
                    Is it possible to see that

      He presses a few buttons and...

      ON THE MONITOR

      The Dashiki Man s face is much bigger. We see him walk past 
      the Mailman again. 

      IN THE ELECTRONICS ROOM

      Brenda watches the Colonel s face. The Colonel leans in 
      close, studying the frame. And sighs.

                                  WALTER
                    That s not him. I can only assume 
                    my son learned the hotel so well 
                    that he was able to avoid the 
                    cameras. All right. The victims.

      The Colonel reaches for his WALLET. Inside, folded among the 
      bills, is a faded PHOTO clipped from the newspaper.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Some months after Donna died an 
                    article ran in The Times with this 
                    photo. Some rap star was introducing 
                    a new line of clothing, said his 
                      inspiration came from the streets. 


      We see the PHOTO: Ten East Side Catorces make gang signs, 
      show off their tats. 

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Look how fat and happy they are. It 
                      infuriated my son. Infuriated me.

      There are four Catorces left in the photo. One face we don t 
      know, and next to that:  Pato,  a.k.a. Jesus Garcia. Col. Walter 
      points to the face we don t know.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    This guy is next. Name s Hector 
                    Vasquez.  Toker. 


      Brenda on Pope s ass.

                                  POPE
                    No way.

                                  BRENDA
                    A man s life is in danger--

                                  POPE
                    This guy --  Toker  -- spent two 
                    years in juvie for assaulting his 
                    mother, jacked two cars and who 
                    knows what else. I m not giving you 
                    SWAT -- I m not giving you anybody 
                    else -- to protect a gangbanger.


                                  BRENDA
                    But my team is my team, right? 

                                  POPE
                    Have you ever breached a house?

                                  BRENDA
                    What if Taylor helps me?

      And off Pope s surprised reaction, we cut to:


      Brenda speaks to Taylor, 

                                  BRENDA
                    Will you take tactical?

      Taylor, a little surprised, nods -- you bet.

      The room s in motion. PHOTOS of Walter Jr. and Toker dominate 
      the Murder Board. 

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Hey everybody. I remind you that 
                    our sniper, Walter Jr., was trained 
                    by the best. But he s out to kill 
                    the Catorces, not us. We ll 
                    surround this Toker guy, and 
                      anticipate the shot. Toker lives at 
                    113 Lucas Avenue. Far as we know, 
                    he s alone. All attacks have 
                    happened under the cover of night, 
                    which gives us forty-five minutes. 
                          (then)
                    Taylor s been kind enough to head 
                    up this operation.

      As she hands the ball off to Taylor, no one can really believe...

                                  FLYNN
                          (to Provenza)
                    She s delegating?

                                  PROVENZA
                          (looks out window)
                    What do you know. Pigs can fly.

                                  TAYLOR
                    When we surround the house, wait for 
                    me to give the go signal. Flynn, I 
                    want you to be my high eye on the 
                    building across the street. And make 
                    sure you re wearing your vests. 
                          (then)
                    Let s move it!

      As they head out, Sanchez stops Taylor. Loud enough for 
      Brenda and Gabriel to hear, Sanchez says (about Gabriel)...

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Maybe it would be better if we left 
                    the O.G. here.

                                  TAYLOR
                    You underestimate him.


      Sanchez nods, follows Taylor out. Gabriel turns to Brenda,

                                    GABRIEL
                    Do you want me to stay back?

                                  BRENDA
                    You heard Captain Taylor.

                                    GABRIEL
                    USC may be in South Central, but it 
                    didn t exactly prepare me to work 
                    there. I was trained to be a white 
                    man.

                                  BRENDA
                    So was I. Get over it.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Am I riding with you, ma am?

                                  BRENDA
                          (heading the other way)
                    I ll meet you at the house.


      Brenda, on the move, glances into the electronics room. She 
      can see Col. Walter hasn t moved from watching the 
        surveillance tape. Brenda then enters...


      The Colonel looks up from the tape, still defeated.

      Brenda puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. Walter looks 
      up at her.

                                  BRENDA 
                    I promise you, sir, I will do 
                      everything in my power to bring 
                    your son in alive.  

      She stares at him for a moment, then turns and exits. 

      The Colonel sits for a moment. Then straightens. Stands. Goes 
      back to the controls on the media console and turns back on 
      the screen. Hits rewind and once more freezes the somewhat 
      blurry picture of the Dashaki Man walking through the lobby 
      of the Park Plaza hotel...

      ...and off the Colonel s reaction, we...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Fritz puts the KEY in the ignition.

                                  FRITZ
                    What do you feel like? Drive-thru?

      He looks in his rearview mirror. Brenda hunches down on the 
      seat; not even her hair is visible to the outside.


                                  BRENDA
                    Oh, whatever -- sounds good. Hey, 
                    watch the doors and tell me if a 
                    tall black man is leaving. 

      Fritz looks.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    He s got perfect posture, he s 
                    6 2 ...

      FRITZ POV: 

      Sure enough, Col. Walter heads out of Parker Center.

      RESUME

                                  FRITZ
                    Is he coming to dinner with us?

                                  BRENDA
                    No. This is actually less about us 
                    going to dinner and more about a 
                    joint operation between the FBI and 
                    the LAPD.

                                  FRITZ
                    Okay. Should I ask what it s about 
                    or be pleasantly surprised?

                                  BRENDA
                    I think pleasantly surprised.

                                  FRITZ
                    Is this official?

                                  BRENDA
                    Well, of course it is. We re 
                    just... a little behind on our 
                    paperwork is all.

      Fritz, watching the Colonel, tells Brenda,


                                  FRITZ 
                    He s pulling out of the lot.

                                  BRENDA
                    Could you follow him, please. And 
                    be extra careful because he s good 
                    at detecting surveillance.

      Fritz starts the car and his Navigation System springs to 
      life. A disembodied WOMAN S VOICE welcomes him.

                                  NAV. SYSTEM (O.S.)
                    Hello, Mr. Howard. The time is 7:32 
                    PM. Your location is 34 degrees 
                    North by 118 degrees West.

                                  BRENDA
                    Who is that?

                                  FRITZ
                    I call her Tara. I think it s the 
                    same woman who does voice mail. 
                    She s my navigation system.

                                  BRENDA
                    I have got to get one of those.

      Fritz looks in the rear view mirror to see Brenda.

                                  FRITZ
                          (gunning the accelerator)
                    I must really like you.


      We HEAR but do not SEE Brenda. Fritz, eyes on the road,

                                  FRITZ
                    You know what I would ve done. I 
                    would ve put an auto-trak on his 
                    car or a GPS homing device on his 
                    wallet or-- 


                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    We don t have FBI money -- that s 
                    why I m crouching in the back of a 
                    Toyota! 
                          (then)
                    What s he doing? Do you think he 
                    knows he s being followed? 

      Fritz studies the traffic.

                                  BRENDA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Don t look directly at him!

      Fritz turns in his seat to look at her.

                                  BRENDA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Don t look at me, either!

                                  FRITZ
                    You know, when I imagined you in my 
                    back seat, this isn t what I had in 
                    mind.
                          (then)
                    He s slowing down... he s stopping. 


      Fritz reports back to Brenda.

                                  FRITZ
                    He s knocking on the door of a 
                    house.


      A little girl answers the door. 

                                  FRITZ 
                    Now he s speaking to a little girl. 
                    And he s getting back in his car.


                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    Stay on him.

                                  FRITZ
                    Okay. But who the hell is he? I 
                    feel the need for a briefing.


      Fritz, focusing on the road, grows very serious.

                                  FRITZ 
                    I don t know about this. Your 
                    colonel could have a rifle in his 
                    back seat or something. Uh-oh...

                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    What? What is it?


                                  FRITZ
                    I think - I think he s winking at 
                    me.

      We SEE her now when her PHONE starts RINGING. She struggles 
      to find it while staying crouched down.

                                  BRENDA 
                    Fritz! Come on.
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah?


      Brenda grips her PHONE.

                                  BRENDA
                    Jesus said The Colonel was out on 
                    the street talking to these guys. 
                    He must ve known.

                          (slams phone shut)
                    Damn it!

                                  FRITZ
                    What?

                                  BRENDA
                    I knew it. He lied to me.  

                                  FRITZ
                    You want me to turn around?  Cause 
                    he stopped his car again -- I 
                    think.

                                  BRENDA
                     You think? 

                                  FRITZ
                    I m driving parallel -- he stopped or 
                    parked his car on the last block.

                                  BRENDA

                    Then let me out!

      Fritz LOCKS the doors.

                                  FRITZ
                    Not unless you keep your phone on.

      She makes a big show of opening her phone. Punches three 
      buttons. His phone RINGS. He answers, delighted.
