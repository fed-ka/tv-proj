      INT. ALEX S KITCHEN - MORNING

      SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA.  A beautiful woman ALEX MEYERS (late 
      30 s) talks on her Bluetooth, while correcting her daughter s 
      homework and feeding celery to a rabbit. 

                                  ALEX
                          (into Bluetooth)
                    None of the evidence is admissable.  
                    It s all fruit of the poison tree.

      Alex hits mutes and turns to her 8 year old daughter, 
      FRANKIE, who s eating breakfast and points to her homework.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Only one wrong.  The capital of 
                    Illinois is Springfield.
                          (off Frankie s look)
                    I know.  It makes no sense.
                          (rabbit nips her)
                    Ow.  Claude, you re literally 
                    biting the hand that feeds you. 
                          (into Bluetooth)
                    Okay, next. Did you read the 
                      deposition?

      INT. PETE S BEDROOM - MORNING 

    A handsome Southern California man, PETE RIGGINS (late 30 s) 
      puts on a wet suit.  On his bed sleeps a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (mid-
      20 s). She wakes up.

                                  WOMAN
                    Where are you going?

                                  PETE
                    To get us some breakfast burritos.
                          (off her look, re: wet 
                            suit)
                    Maybe do a little surfing first.  
                    Are you a surfer, Tammy? 

                                  WOMAN
                    Tara.

                    Too soon for nick names? 

      INT. GYM - HOUR LATER

      Alex finishes up on a treadmill.  A CUTE GUY approaches, 
      notices she s not wearing a ring.NBC "Bent"  Writer's Draft     2/1/11      2.



                                  GUY
                    Hey, I m going to the juice bar.  
                    Any interest in a smoothie? 

                                  ALEX
                    Sure, I ll take a banana blueberry.  
                    Frankie, what do you want?

      Reveal Frankie reading a book about whales on a stationary 
      bike.  The guy s taken aback, not the sexy gym moment he was 
      after. 

                                    FRANKIE
                          (re: Alex)
                    She just got divorced.  It s all 
                    about the kid right now.

      Alex nods in agreement, the guy walks off, shot down. 

      INT. BREAKFAST BEACH SHACK - A LITTLE LATER

      Pete waits as a family places their order at the counter, 
      then steps up to a cute girl, LUCY.

                                  PETE
                    Lovely Lucy.  One bacon egg 
                    burrito.

                                  LUCY
                    Only one?  No lady love last night?     

                                  PETE
                    You know there s only you.  Extra 
                    salsa, por favor.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - HALF HOUR LATER

      Alex waves out the window to her daughter as she boards the 
      school bus.  Her cell rings.  The office again.  She looks 
      down at her briefcase, Claude is gnawing on it.

      INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - HALF HOUR LATER

      Pete, his hair wet from surfing, sits in a GAMBLER S 
      ANONYMOUS MEETING.  He eats a breakfast burrito while 
      listening to a woman share.    

      EXT. ALEX S HOUSE - LATER THAT MORNING

      Pete gets out of his truck in front of a craftsman in need of 
      some serious work.  He takes a deep breath.  He s nervous.  
      It s his first walk through since rehab.  He knocks.  Alex 
      answers.  Pete relaxes.  She s gorgeous.  Gorgeous women like 
      Pete.  He flashes his killer smile.  She doesn t bite.NBC "Bent"  Writer's Draft     2/1/11      3.



                                  ALEX
                    I thought you were coming at nine?

                                  PETE
                    Sorry.  I had another job.  Hi, 
                    Pete Riggins.  You must be Alex.

                                  ALEX
                    Was it in the ocean?  You smell 
                    like saltwater.

                                  PETE
                    Thank you.           

                                  ALEX
                    More of an accusation, than a 
                      compliment. 

                                  PETE
                    I m going to take a mulligan here.  
                    Hi, I m Pete.  Sorry I m late.  I 
                    was surfing.  

                                  ALEX
                    Hi Pete.  I hope you re a good 
                      contractor because your first 
                      impression kind of blows. 

                                  PETE 
                    I m the best.  In America.  I can t 
                    vouch for what s happening down in 
                    South America.  They re super 
                    handy. 

      They walk through Alex s small living room to the kitchen. 

                                  ALEX
                    So I got your name from Brad and 
                    Cindy Laughlin...

                                  PETE
                    The Laughlins.  Cool.  Yeah, I had 
                    to turn that project over to my 
                    foreman.  I got real busy.

                                  ALEX
                    And Brad fired you.  Because you 
                    were sleeping with Cindy.

                                  PETE
                    That was a factor too.  Can I be 
                    honest?  

                                  ALEX
                    Doesn t seem like it. NBC "Bent"  Writer's Draft     2/1/11      4.



                                  PETE
                    The Laughlin project wandered into 
                    a moral gray area but have you seen 
                    their kitchen?  I knocked it out of 
                    the park. 

                                  ALEX
                    Cindy was very impressed. 

                                  PETE
                    And I think Brad was too.  In his 
                    heart of hearts. 

      They enter the kitchen.  It s cramped and out-dated.  Alex 
      rolls out some plans.  Through out the following, Pete is 
      doing a walk-thru; inspecting counters, opening cabinets, 
      running the sink, etc..   

                                  ALEX
                    I want to totally re-do it.  
                    Floors, cabinets, new appliances.  
                    And I want blow out this wall and 
                    put in a breakfast nook.  What do 
                    you think?

      He notices a food stain on the plans.

                                  PETE
                    I think someone s got a jelly 
                    problem.   
                          (then, re: boxes)
                    So, are you just moving in? 

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah.  I m downsizing.  Divorce.  I 
                    recently released a bastard back 
                    into the wild.          

                                  PETE
                    The beach is a good habitat for 
                    bastards.  We thrive here.  He s in 
                    the old house?   

                                  ALEX
                    Nope, he got a smaller place.  In 
                    prison. 

                                  PETE
                    He s not in for anything violent or 
                    jealous in nature I hope. 

                                  ALEX
                    He defrauded medicare but at least 
                    he gave the money to his mistress.  NBC "Bent"  Writer's Draft     2/1/11      5.



                                  PETE
                    And you let him get away?

      She smiles, he does too.  She stops smiling. 

                                  ALEX
                    Listen, Pete, if you get this gig, 
                    it s because you re cheap and 
                    you re good.  I ve got a full 
                    plate.  I m not looking for 
                    anything else.

                    Anything else...?

                                  ALEX
                    You know, Laughlin like.

                                  PETE
                    Am I holding two wine glasses?  Are 
                    my pants off?  I don t feel like 
                    I m being inappropriate.

                                  ALEX
                    I m just saying, there ll be no 
                    monkey business.  

                                  PETE
                    I hate monkey business.  I never 
                    use that phrase.  
                          (exiting)
                    I ll get numbers to you by Friday.

      Pete turns around.

                                  PETE
                    That doesn t give me much time.

      She closes the door on him.  He smiles, intrigued.

      Pete sits with his crew; BRETT (30 s), cabinet maker, surf 
      buddy and consummate Dad to his son DEVIN (3), who sits next 
      to him.  Next to them are ARTURO (20 s), a good-looking 
      cabinet maker apprentice, and VLAD, (30 s) an Eeyore-like

      INT. ALEX S KITCHEN - A FEW DAYS LATER

      Pete enters with his crew.  Alex is there, Frankie s playing

                    Sorry, I m late.

                    Way to solidify low expectations.  
                    Did you have a nice surf?  I saw 
                    big waves on the beach cam.

                                  PETE
                    I was dropping my Dad at work but 
                    I m stoked you know about the cam. 

                                  ALEX
                    Can we put a moratorium on 
                     stoked ?    

                                  PETE
                    Can you use a bigger lawyer word 
                    that means  stop ?   
                          (noticing Frankie playing)
                    Is that Pachelbel?

                    I go to weddings.

                                  ALEX
                    Frankie, say hi to Pete.

                          (a little coolly)
                    Hi Pete.
                          (gets up, crosses over)
                    Do you have a nail gun?  

                                  PETE
                    Arturo s got it.  Always.  It s 
                    kind of his thing.  

                                    FRANKIE
                    When he gets a chance, could he 
                    shoot this piano?

                                  PETE
                    It did sound kind of sick.

      Frankie remains cool but stifles a smile.  A cute girl, 
      beachy, mid-20 s enters.  This is SIMONE (mid-20 s), 
      Frankie s nanny.  NBC "Bent"  Writer's Draft     2/1/11      15.

                    No fair.  What beach are you guys

                    Frankie s sunblock and suit are in 
                    the bag.  Do you have yours?

                    Oh, I thought that was a two piece 
                    sandwich bag.   

      Frankie and Simone head out and Alex starts putting papers in 
      her briefcase.  Pete s crew starts filing in, ad-libbing 
      greetings with Alex.

                                  PETE
                    Before you go, I was looking at the 
                    plans.  What do you think of adding 
                      a sky-light?

                    So when are you done with demo?  I 
                    want to get it on the board. 

      She grabs a pen and looks at the giant, color coded calendar.

                    You marked on your calendar when to 
                    buy another calendar?

                    I stay on top of things.  It helps 
                    me show up places on time.

                                  PETE
                    That s the most organized cry for 
                    help I ve ever seen.

                                  ALEX
                    It s your first day, go easy on the 
                    snark.  You re still on probation.  

      She leaves, Pete watches her go.

                    So what s going on with you and the

                    She s all over me.  And she smells

                    I know.  What s up with that?

                    Really?  Sweetie, I m sorry.

                    He said he s going bald.

                    No, not in this state.  Maybe 
                    Nevada.

                    She climbed up the trellis and then

                    I fell asleep reading a brief.  
                    That thing was like a Xanax.

      Pete climbs up a ladder as Alex and the crew stare up at an 
      anxious Frankie.  Brett turns to Alex, re: Devin.

                                  BRETT
                    You ve got to watch them like

      Screwsie and Alex enjoy a glass of wine.  Through the kitchen 
      window they can see Pete and the guys working.  The crew

                    I think about getting my brief

                    convict Dad than her heroic single 
                    Mom.  I think about how it d be 
                    great if my sister wore a bra.

                          (off her look)
                    Not monkey business fun.  Clean 
                      contractor, client fun.  Spackle 
                    fights.     

                                  ALEX
                    Can you restrain yourself?  Not 
                    hump everything?

                                  PETE
                    I m not a collie. 

                                  ALEX
                          (beat, then)
                    Okay, one more shot.  Be at my 
                    house Monday. 7 am.

                                  PETE
                    Awesome.  8 would be better.

      She shoots him a look.  The manager makes James stop singing.  
      Pete and Alex clap.  James takes a bow, tells Frankie to do 
      the same.

      INT. ALEX S KITCHEN - A FEW DAYS LATER

      Pete and Alex stare up at a hole in the ceiling.  The crew 
      comes in and out of the room unloading stuff. NBC "Bent"  Writer's Draft     2/1/11      34.



                                  PETE
                    Your new sky-light.  Nice, huh?

                                  ALEX
                    It ll have glass, won t it? 

                                  PETE
                    It s extra but if you want to 
                    splurge.  Look at that SoCal light 
                    pour in.

                                  ALEX
                          (starts to exit)
                    Don t gloat.

                                  PETE
                    Hey Alex...
                          (she stops)
                    Thanks for giving us another 
                    chance.  

                                  ALEX
                    Sure.

                                  PETE
                          (smiles)
                    I m totally stoked. 

      She rolls her eyes and exits to work.  Pete watches her go.  
      Beat.  He opens up a cabinet and pulls Devin out.  

                                  PETE (CONT D)
                    We live to fight another day, huh 
                    little man? 

                                  DEVIN
                    Si.

                                  PETE
                    It s like my Dad always says;  I 
                    may be bent, but I m not broken.

      Devin nods.  Alex pokes her head in. 

                                  ALEX
                    Please find that kid some day care. 

                                  PETE
                      Absolutely.

      Brett and Arturo file in, Arturo grabs Devin, as we;

                                                                          FADE OUT.
