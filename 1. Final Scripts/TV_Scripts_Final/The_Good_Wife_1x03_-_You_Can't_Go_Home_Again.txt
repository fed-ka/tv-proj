      FADE IN:

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - BATHROOM/BEDROOM - MORNING11

    The SOUNDS of MORNING CHAOS; shouting, showers and loud music 
      over:  FEMININE HANDS as they apply lotion, check a nail, 
      strap on a watch... pick up a wedding band.  A moment s 
      hesitation before it s slipped on.  ALICIA is late.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Let s go, guys -- fifteen minutes!

    She launches out into --

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - HALLWAY/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS22

      Calling out as she goes.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Grace, you need to eat, and soccer 
                    tryouts are today.  

    She heads for the coffee pot, turns off the oatmeal, as GRACE 
      enters, dressed, but not a morning person, and not hungry.  

                                  GRACE
                    I hate this school, why would I 
                    want to play for it? 

                                  ALICIA
                          (not indulging her)
                    Grandma will pick you up at the 
                    field around five-ish -- 

                                  GRACE
                    Can t find my cleats anyway.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And you re just now telling me?
                          (off her shrug)
                    Probably still packed -- at least 
                    tryto like it here.  

    The RINGING PHONE lets Grace off the hook.  Alicia grabs it, 
      exasperated and on the move again.  We FOLLOW HER into -- 

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS33

      Picking up after everyone as she goes.

                                  ALICIA

                    Hello?

                    Peter Florrick.

    His voice stops her, as it always does -- partly making her 
      heart flutter, partly pissing her off.

      Stuffed with boxes -- everything from the old life that 
      doesn't fit with the new.  Starts her search for the cleats.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Hi, Peter.

      INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. TAMMS CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION - PHONE ROOM - SAME TIME55

      PETER sits at a table, phone at his ear, brightening at her 
      voice.  Behind him a line of prisoners wait their turn.  

                                  PETER
                    This a good time?

                                  ALICIA
                    ... Sure.  You alright?

                                  PETER
                    Hanging in there. 
                          (awkward beat; then)
                    Kids around?  Can I talk to them?

                                  ALICIA
                    Actually, Zach s still in the shower 
                    and Grace just sat down to eat.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   3.
      CONTINUED:55


                                  PETER
                    Oh.  Tried to call earlier but the 
                    line was long...

      Alicia s distracted, checks her watch while still rooting 
      around boxes.  Or maybe there s not much left to say.  

                                  ALICIA
                    So...

                                  PETER
                          (awkward beat; then)
                    Used to be more comfortable with 
                    each other s silences, didn t we?

    And they did.  Alicia tries to stay focused on the search. 

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry, we re just really 
                    running late.  Do you think you 
                    could try back later?

                                  PETER
                    Yeah.  Just tell them I called.

                                  ALICIA
                    I will.  Bye.  

                                  PETER
                    Bye.

    He hangs up.  Misses her.  END INTERCUT.  Then, eureka --

                                  ALICIA
                          (re: cleats; calls out)
                    Found  em!  

    And she also finds a trophy... along with a photo of a 
      beaming Grace and a proud Peter, holding the same trophy in 
      front of their elegant Highland Park home.  

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    We should never have had to move.  

      Alicia turns to see Grace in the doorway, witness to her 
      mother s nostalgia.  The girl takes her cleats, pads off.  On 
      Alicia, left with the sentiment...  THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   4.



      INT. 28TH FLOOR - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY66

    Ten seconds into a new associates staff meeting.   WILL, 
      DIANE, CARY and 20 other fresh-scrubbed types as a harried 
      Alicia slips in, discreetly takes a seat at the table.  It s 
    not commented upon, but not unnoticed either.  

                                  WILL
                    A first year associate s primary 
                    job is to clock billable hours.  
                    And with those numbers down in each 
                    of your departments, clearly, some 
                    of you aren t doing yours.

                                  DIANE
                    Now, that s not to say you re all
                      under-performing -- one of our 
                    newest associates clocked 225 hours 
                    last month alone.  

      Everyone in the room knows she means Cary -- including Cary.

                                  WILL
                    But most of you can do better.  So 
                    while this meeting isn t about 
                    naming names, it is about asking 
                    you to step up.  

      Alicia squirms a bit, not in the high billable hours club.  

                                  DIANE
                    And if you can t do that, at least 
                    sign a few new clients.

      Obligatory chuckles.  But not from Alicia, who s not in the 
       signed clients  club either.

                                  SECRETARY 
                          (at door)
                    Pardon the interruption, but 
                    someone s here to see Mrs. 
                    Florrick.  I believe it s your son.

      Instant red flags for Alicia -- did something happen to Zach?  
      Diane subtly shoots Will a look as Alicia gathers her things.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m so sorry -- please excuse me.  

    We follow her out into --THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   5.



      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS77

      Where she quickly maneuvers past co-workers with increasing 
      anxiety until she reaches --  

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS88

      Alicia scans for her son, but instead spots KENNY CHATHAM -- 
      who s a few years older than Zach, a lot rougher, and not at 
    all how Alicia remembered him.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Kenny?  Is that you?

                                  KENNY
                    Mrs. Florrick -- been awhile, huh?

    He gives her a familial hug.  She s startled by his presence 
      here, and perhaps more by his delinquent-like appearance.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (covering)
                    Wow, you ve... grown.
                          (looks around)
                    Are your parents with you?
                          (realizes they aren t)
                    What are you doing here?  

                                  KENNY
                    Um... I think I need a lawyer.  

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY99

      Alicia has pulled Kenny into a side room for privacy.  But 
      that doesn t exist when you re surrounded by glass.  

                                  KENNY
                    Last night, me and this guy Brian  
                    went to my buddy s house to get... 
                    we were lookin  to party, you know?

                                  ALICIA
                    To get what?

                                  KENNY
                    ... Some dank.  Weed or whatever.  

      Alicia s amazed and disappointed by the changes in this kid.

                                  ALICIA
                    Weren t you just a Boy Scout?  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   6.
      CONTINUED:99


                                  KENNY
                          (shrugs; then)
                    Anyway, right after we got there, 
                    this security guard rolls up and...  

                                  ALICIA
                    And...?

      This is the hard part.  Out of shame, embarrassment, or both.  

                                  KENNY
                    I kinda freaked... so I ran.    
                          (then)
                    This morning, when I went by Bri s 
                    house, there were cops there.  
                    Heard he got arrested.  

      Kenny deposits a baggie of pot on her desk; she s mortified.  

                                  ALICIA
                    What are you doing?  What is this?

                                  KENNY
                    Figure they re after me next.  

      Alicia becomes aware of Diane and Will crossing past and 
      glancing in.  Great.  Quickly covers the baggie with papers. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Look... I m not sure I understand 
                    what happened but if you were 
                    buying pot --

                                  KENNY
                    We weren t.  Spencer was giving it 
                    to us.

                                  ALICIA
                          (dubious)
                    The bottom line is, if you and your 
                    friends broke the law, you need to

                    Yeah, but... I d still need a 
                    lawyer, right?

    She can t argue that.  Sees more rubberneckers looking in.

                    You know how they are.  

    He wears their disapproval on his sleeve.  She feels for him.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Is there anything else to this 
                    story?  Anything at all?  

    He shakes his head.  Alicia makes a decision, though 
      reluctantly so.  Glimpses KALINDA in the bullpen.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Don t move.  
                          (re: pot)
                    And get rid of that.

      Kenny re-pockets the pot as Alicia goes out into --

                    Actually, it wasn t Zach, he s a family

                    I m not sure yet, but I was hoping 
                    if I could drive him home...

      Will hesitates, works hard to not show his disappointment.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    I know.  I ll make up the time.    

    He nods reluctantly.  She smiles, goes.  Off Will, concerned.  

      INT. ALICIA S CAR - MOVING - MORNING1212

      Alicia behind the wheel.  Kenny stewing as he rides shotgun.

                                  ALICIA
                    So... did you not go to school 
                    today because of this?

                                  KENNY
                    Haven t been going.  Probably do a

                     Bout six months ago.  You guys had 
                    already moved by then.

      Wow, a lot has happened since she left.  Kenny sees her 
      processing this, reads it as judgmental.

                                  KENNY (CONT D)
                    I remember your being way cooler

                                  ALICIA
                    Out of respect, Kenny.  You still 
                    live at home.  You and I both owe 
                    your parents that much.

                                  KENNY
                    Youdon t owe  em anything.  They 
                    blew you off.  That s who they are.

    She considers this, doesn t argue the point.  A beat as they 
      draw nearer...

      EXT. CHATHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS1313

      Alicia heads past a landscaped yard and up to the front door 
    of a large, traditional home.  Alicia becomes aware of 
      VOICES.  Lots of them.  A charity function?  A social 
      gathering?  Alicia looks back at the car; Kenny meekly waves, 
      slumps out of view.  Alicia steels herself, rings the bell.  
      LAUREN CHATHAM opens the door.

                    Hi Lauren.  

      Lauren is stunned to see her.  So are a dozen female 
      contemporaries hovering in the b.g.  

      Clearly, she s the subject of intense curiosity.  Lauren, for 
    her part, doesn t know how to handle this unexpected visit.

                    like this, but... I need to talk to

      FLASHBACK - TEN YEARS EARLIER - DAYA14A14

      Alicia is an regular participant in these community meetings.  
      Stands near a punch bowl as Lauren sidles up.  Whispers --

                                  LAUREN
                    Unless we can start serving 
                    cocktails, I m quitting the board.

                                  ALICIA
                    You re terrible, you know that?

      They grin as 8 YEAR OLD KENNY steps up, wanting Mom s 
      attention.  Instead, he gets Alicia s; she smiles at the boy, 
      smooths his hair as-- 

                                  LAUREN
                    Honey, Mommy s busy.

      Alicia feels for the disappointed boy as he pads off, leaving 
      Lauren to survey the room, ostensibly put upon.  

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    I m just saying... someone else has 
                    to start hosting these meetings.

                    Maybe.  But I couldn t do it 
                    without you.

    It seemed sincere.  At the time.  Then, Lauren notices an 
      urbane woman across from them, noting --

      INT. CHATHAM HOUSE - DEN - DAY1515

      Well-appointed.  Alicia faces a tense Lauren.

                                  ALICIA
                    My guess is you can probably clear 
                    all this up at the station.

                                  LAUREN

                    by other people... 
                          (then)
                    Where is he now?

                                  ALICIA
                    In the car.  Asked me to smooth the 
                    waters.  

    The irony.  Lauren is embarrassed and paranoid.

                                  LAUREN
                    You didn t have to drive all the way 
                    out here.  You could ve just called. 

                                  ALICIA
                    I could have.  But a boy I saw grow up 
                    asked me for help.  And his mother used 
                    to be a friend.

    Of the fair-weather variety, it turns out.  They lock eyes 
    but are interrupted by a frantic PARTY-GOER --

                                  PARTY-GOER
                    You need to come outside.

      Lauren rushes out as Alicia s CELL RINGS.  She follows, still 
      stung as she answers her phone--

      Where she sees Kenny cuffed, face down on the ground as he s 
      searched by POLICE -- who confiscate the baggie of pot.  
      Lauren, meanwhile, is hysterical, held back by the Partygoer.

      INT. LAW LIBRARY STAIRS - DAY1818

    On the move, as Kalinda debriefs Alicia.

                                  KALINDA
                    Police are alleging that Kenny 
                    Chatham and Brian Keller broke into a 
                    guest apartment on property owned by 
                    Carl and Wendy Rankin.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Wait a minute, they broke in?

                                  KALINDA
                    Nothing was reported stolen but --

                                  ALICIA
                    Kenny said they were at a friend s.

                                  KALINDA
                    The Rankin s 17 year old son, 
                    Spencer, lives above the garage, 
                    but wasn t home at the time.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Is that why the police think it was 
                      a burglary?

                                  KALINDA
                    That, and they have Kenny and 
                    Brian s fingerprints on a window

                    Theory is the boys encountered a 
                    security guard as they were 
                    leaving, struggled with him, then 
                    shoved him down the stairs.  M.E. 
                    says the guard died of blunt 
                    trauma, likely from hitting his 
                    head on concrete, at approximately 
                    11:20 p.m.

                    And because he died during the 
                    commission of an alleged burglary, 
                    Kenny s looking at felony murder.

      Alicia steps in -- this isn t Tamms and the offenders aren t 
    in uniforms.  They re drunk, homeless or just plain criminal.  
      Kenny s among them, rushing forward with words spilling out.

                    couldn t hear me, he was still inside.

      He s scared, pleading.  Alicia wants to believe him but --

      Alicia hustles in, nods hello to a vacuuming janitor.  Passes 
      Cary s office and, of course, he s already there, offering a 
      wave.  Alicia heads into her office, settling in when --

                    the lesser charge of burglary and 
                    agreeing to testify against Kenny.

      FLASHBACK- CAPSTONE PREPARATORY SCHOOL- 3 YEARS EARLIER- DAY2626

      Alicia drops off a nervous 12 year old Grace (geeky in 
      braces) on her first day of high school.  

                                  GRACE

                                  ALICIA
                    Grace, this is the best school in 
                    the county.  It has a great 
                    academic program and a very good 
                    sports program.  Just give it time.  
                    I think you re really going to love

                    friends.  

    He looks at Alicia, suspicious of her natural authority.  He 
      picks up his gear, starts to go.  Cary gets in step with him.

                     Cause the cops are saying he broke 
                    into your place.  And you know why 
                    they re saying that?  Because they 
                    don t get how good a friend you are

                    were asleep when he got home.  

      Kalinda falls in step with them, notes in hand.  But neither 
    are particularly listening, still arguing about strategy.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT BUILDING - FOYER/FRONT DOOR - MORNING2929

      Alicia herds the kids out toward the front door.  

                                  ZACH
                    Bet the bus is already here.

                                  GRACE
                    Maybe if you didn t hog the shower--

                                  ALICIA
                    Just keep it moving...

    But they open the door to see Lauren there.  

                                  GRACE
                    Mrs. Chatham?

                                  LAUREN
                    Oh my god... look at both of you.  

                                  ZACH
                    Hey.

      Awkward hugs all around.  What s she doing here?  Then --

                                  ALICIA
                    You guys better get going.

      Grace and Zach take off, leaving Alicia alone with Lauren.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Did you want to come in?

      Lauren crosses the threshold, stepping into the foyer.

                                  LAUREN
                    I d heard you d moved, didn t know 
                    where.  Wasn t easy to track down

                            (understands her need)
                    Right now, we re looking for 
                    someone who can place Kenny at or 
                    near your house at the time of the 
                    murder.

    She nods.  An awkward beat.  

                                  LAUREN
                    I talked to Richard.  We ll pay 
                    Kenny s legal fees.  
                          (off Alica s nod)
                    Wasn t easy to get him to budge.  
                    I m sure you remember how 
                      controlling he can be. 

                                  ALICIA

                    How are things between you?

                                  LAUREN
                    The same.

      FLASHBACK - HIGHLAND PARK - BACK YARD - FIVE YEARS AGO - DAY3030

      A backyard BBQ.  Alicia and Peter happy, holding hands and 
      holding court with friends.  Intellectual peers and partners.

                          (beaming; re: Alicia)
                    Get this, I leave to get drinks and 
                    by the time I get back, she has the 
                    governor literally backed into a 
                    corner, nailing him on his lack of 
                    support for the arts.

                                  ALICIA
                    I was just asking him to explain 
                    his position...  

      Laughter.  Alicia glances at Lauren and Richard. Together, 
    but apart -- their body language telling the story. 

      A sob snaps Alicia out of her memory.  It s Lauren.  

                                  LAUREN
                    Kenny was all I ever really had.  

    She starts to cry, folding into Alicia s arms.  Off Alicia.    THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   29.



      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY3131

      Cary hustles after ASA Raines.  

                                  CARY
                    There she is.  What s a nice girl 
                    like you doing at a place like the 
                    State s Attorney s office anyway?

                                  RAINES
                    I became an ASA because I like 
                    duking it out in court, not over 
                    lunch.

                                  CARY
                    Too bad, because that s what I was 
                    about to suggest -- talked with my 
                    bosses.  We re on board with a plea 
                    bargain in the Chatham case.

                    And trust me, a young male running 
                    in this neighborhood after 11 -- 
                    definitely would ve been noticed.  

    As they head across the street, Kalinda takes note of the 
      pristine surroundings.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Think they ve got enough manicured

                    Pretty, doesn t seem like a good 
                    fit though -- your living here.  
                    Was it?

                                  ALICIA
                    Did it for over ten years, liked it 
                    at the time. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Ignorance is bliss, I guess.

    It stings, but before Alicia can respond, Kalinda knocks.

      INT. HIGHLAND PARK - NEIGHBOR S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER3333

      Alicia and Kalinda question SHELLY DELGADO, an RN who tends 
    to a wheelchair-bound elderly woman, ELEANOR ABERNATHY.  

                                  SHELLY
                    Everyone s pretty shaken up.  This 
                    sort of thing just doesn t happen 
                    here.  Scandal maybe, but murder?

      Then Shelly remembers who s standing there -- Alicia.  Oops.

                                  KALINDA
                    Were you on duty when it happened?

                                  SHELLY
                    You tell me.  I work second shift -- 
                    2 to 11 p.m.  Not that I ever get out 
                    on time.  My relief s always late.

                                  SHELLY
                    Don t know off the top of my head, 
                    but I can check my time card.  
                          (starts digging in purse)
                    Got a copy of it somewhere...

                    Shelly, when you wereleaving, do 
                    you remember seeing anyone on the 
                    street?  Anyone running?  

                                  SHELLY
                    Not really... I mean I think I saw 
                    someone go inside across the way.    

                                  KALINDA
                    You mean through the front door?

                                  SHELLY
                    Yeah, because they turned the yard 
                    lights off right after -- made it 
                    hard to fill out my timecard.

                                  ALICIA
                    Was this person male or female?

                    Sorry, didn t get that good a look.

      It s not much, but it s something.  Alicia becomes aware of 
      someone staring, turns to see that it s Eleanor.

      Alicia and Kalinda look at a map of the area.  

                                  ALICIA
                    The Rankin house is about half a 
                    mile west of here.  

                                  KALINDA
                    The security guard called into 
                    operations at 11:15 to say he was 
                    doing a perimeter check and he was 
                    dead by 11:20.  

                                  ALICIA
                    The prosecution would argue that 
                    there was still time for Kenny to 
                    have attacked the guard and made it 
                    home on foot by 11:25 -- but is 
                    that even possible?

      Alicia driving.  Slowly.  Kalinda looking out the window.  
      More manicured lawns, more neighborhood association signs.  

                                  KALINDA
                    The average teenage boy sprinting 
                    would likely be in the range of 8 
                    to 10 miles per hour.  

                                  ALICIA
                    How do you even know that?

                                  KALINDA
                    Would you believe me if I told you I 
                    was a track coach in a previous life?

                    Okay, been two minutes and we re --

      Just then a well-heeled road-rager HONKS, then passes 
      impatiently.  Kalinda immediately flips him off.

                    It s good for the soul.

      Alicia considers this; part of her would love to flip off 
      Highland Park.  But... --

                    Guess there s no chance the S.A. 
                    will let us in without permission.

                    with the department anymore.  

      Kalinda smiles, best she can do is pictures.  Then, CARL

                    false information.  There was never 
                    any permission given to enter, and 
                    there was never any pot and he s never 
                    going to testify -- you got that, 
                    lady?  Now get the hell off my

      With that, he turns, goes.  Off Alicia and Kalinda.

    the back of it.  Electricity between them.  But her CELL 
      RINGS.  She answers, holds a finger up -- give me a sec.

      JUDGE HESTER JAMES (late 40 s) addresses the court, she s 
      tough, she s black, and she can smell fear -- particularly on 
      young lawyers.  Cary shuffles papers, glances at ASA Raines 
    who barely acknowledges him now.  Alicia takes note, then 
      tries to offer a comforting smile to a now jump-suited Kenny.  

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Which is another way of saying both

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - COURTROOM - LATER4141

      Officer Diaz (seen in teaser), is on the stand; Diaz is 
      tough, buff and dead serious.  A confident Raines grills him.

                                  DIAZ
                    At 11:24 p.m., he was pulled over 
                    for speeding, approximately four 
                    blocks from the Rankin house.

                                  RAINES
                    And Officer Diaz, did Brian give 
                    any statement at that time?

                                  DIAZ
                    Yes, he did.  He immediately 
                    confessed to having fled the scene 
                    of a burglary on Belson Street.

                                  RAINES
                    So, in effect, he placed himself at 
                    the crime scene.  

                                  DIAZ
                    Yes, and was arrested at that time.

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    In your experience, do spontaneous 
                      confessions such as this tend to be 
                    accurate?

      Cary considers objecting, but how do you object to the judge?

                                  DIAZ
                    Typically, the perpetrator won t 
                    have had enough time to concoct a 
                    story, so yes.  They usually are.  

                                  RAINES
                    Nothing further.

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Mr. Uh-goes...

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Whatever.

      Cary rises, approaches Diaz, who looks much bigger up close.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   40.

      slides him a note: no mention of killing when arrested.

                    Officer Diaz, when Mr. Keller had 
                    this  spontaneous utterance , did he

                          (ignores the implication)
                    My interests have never been in 
                      litigation.

                                  RAINES
                      Prosecution calls Brian Keller.

      BRIAN KELLER (a bigger, badder version of Kenny) is in a suit 
    and tie, rises from the gallery, approaches the stand.  

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - COURTROOM - LATER4242

    ASA Raines with Brian, who is now the picture of innocence.  
    On a nearby table, an architectural model of the crime scene.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Kenny wanted to get high and said 
                    he knew where he could get some 
                    weed.  He never said anything about 
                    breaking in, so I was surprised 
                    when he asked me to help jam the 
                    window open.  I mean, I did it 
                    but... I was kinda freaked out 
                    after.  So I went downstairs.

                                  RAINES
                    And did what?

                                  BRIAN
                    Waited for him so we could get the 
                    heck out of there.  But then I saw 
                    the security guard.

                                  RAINES
                    Did he see you?

                                  BRIAN
                    No, I hid behind a tree. 
                          (pointing to model)
                    Right in there.

                                  RAINES
                    I know it s difficult, but could 
                    you tell the judge what you saw?

      Brian glances at Kenny, who then turns to Alicia --

                                  KENNY
                          (sotto to Alicia)
                    I can t believe he can lie like this.

                    People do it all the time.

                                  BRIAN
                    Um... the guard started going up 
                    the stairs.

                                  RAINES
                          (pointing to model)
                    Here?

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah and I guess he kinda surprised 
                    Kenny because they got into it and 
                    then... Kenny sorta shoved him and 
                    the guard fell backwards.  And 
                    then... he just stopped moving.

      Alicia studies the model.  All lawn, only the one bush.  Cary 
      follows Alicia s gaze, curious.  What s she seeing?

                                  CARY
                          (sotto)

                    Nothing, just manicured lawns...

                                  RAINES
                    So from where you were standing, 
                    there was a clear view of the crime.

                                  BRIAN
                    Yes.

      It s damning testimony and Raines knows it, nods to the Judge 
    -- finished with Brian.  Cary rises to cross but --

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    That s plenty for today.  Court s 
                    adjourned til 9 tomorrow.  

      Kenny looks between Cary and Alicia, not sure how to feel.  
      Alicia turns back to the gallery.  Still no parents.

      Cary s burning the midnight oil, law books and files spread

    But something about the way Cary has brought this up doesn t 
      quite sit well with Will.

                    Yeah, know what s great about someone 
                    like Alicia?  She s a natural,

    he was...

      Lauren and Richard in the gallery.  Cary sits at the defense 
      table with Kenny.  Looks around, nervous, checks his watch.  

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Are we waiting for divine 
                    inspiration, Mr. Agos?

      Cary approaches Brian, who s on the stand.  The model of the 
      crime scene is still present.

                    You testified that while Kenny was 
                    upstairs, you were waiting down 
                    below, is that correct?

                                  BRIAN
                    That s right.

      Alicia enters the courtroom, hands documentation to the court 
      clerk before taking a seat at the defense table.  

                                  RAINES
                    Your Honor, all this has been

                    Like you just said, around 11:20 or so.

                    It s already been stated that he 
                    was arrested at 11:24.

                                  CARY
                    So it was just four minutes between the 
                    killing and the time of your arrest.

                                  BRIAN
                          (getting annoyed)

    The room has been cleared.  Only Raines, Alicia and Cary 
      remain, still seated at their respective tables.  Judge James 
      stands before them, hands resting on the prosecution s table. 

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    That you would pursue a charge of 
                    this magnitude without a thorough 
                      investigation is unconscionable.

                    evidence linking the defendant to 
                    the murder, no eyewitness testimony 
                    other than that of a co-defendant 
                    with a vested interest in the

                    counsel to find a more equitable 
                    solution.

    But Alicia s not so sure she believes this.  She studies the

    has done nothing to bring them closer.  Awkward beat.

      sleigh bed.  Her eye catching sight of something -- a mark on

                                  PETER
                    That your idea of a notch?

                          (grins; then)
                    You think they heard us?

                    The kids?  Maybe you.  

    He kisses her.  

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Not bad for an old married couple, 
                    huh?  
                          (then)
                    I love you.

      Alicia looks at him, holds his gaze.

                                  ALICIA
                    I love you, too.

    And she does.  Caresses his cheek. But his cell phone rings.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Don t.

    But it s so hard not to... 

                                  PETER
                    It could be work.

    He reaches for it, to her sadness.  Answers --

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Peter Florrick.

    His face has just the slightest of shifts.  He cups the 
      phone, says to Alicia --

                    Office emergency.  Just be a 
                    minute.

    He gets out of bed, heads for the bathroom.  Turns on the 
      light, closes the door on her.  Alicia listens to his muted 
      voice as he talks to someone... 

      She s jolted from her memory by the NEWS ANCHOR on TV --

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (O.S.)

      Alicia pulls her hand away from the headboard, sees it all 
      much more clearly now: Highland Park, Peter... herself.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT5454

       War room  might be a better description.  Diane sits at the 
    far end of a long table.  Piled on the table, the whole of 
    the Sheffrin-Marks case: briefs, boxes, files -- stacks and 
      stacks of them.  Cary stops by, heading out for the night.

                    the midnight oil.

    She looks up, surprised to see him there.

                    Cary.  How are you?

      Cary turns to go.  Diane returns to focus to her legal 
      briefs, not looking up as she offers --

                    Keep up the good work.

      Cary stops, turns back, smiles --

                    Thanks.  I intend to.  

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - GRACE S ROOM - NIGHT5555

      Grace sits at her window, looking out as Alicia enters.  





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   56.

                                  ALICIA
                    Hey.  It s after ten.  What are you 
                    doing up so late on a school night?  

                                  GRACE
                    Just looking out at the view.  

                                  ALICIA
                    It s nice, isn t it.

      A beat as they stare out.  Sit close.  Grace looks at her 
      mom.  Maybe she s been too hard on her.  Offers --

                                  GRACE
                    It s a cool room.  Smaller than my 
                    old one though but... 

      Alicia smiles, kisses Grace s head.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Know what I was thinking earlier?  
                    You hated your old school when you 
                    first started going there.  

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah.  I kinda did.

      They look out the window together.  Not unhappy.  Grace 
      considers the view, makes a decision to reveal --

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Today... I m sorta glad we moved.

      This is a surprise for Alicia.  But one that makes her feel 
      better about everything.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Me, too.

    Off Alicia, home.
