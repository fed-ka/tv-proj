      Pristine field.  New stadium.  We re in one of LA s more 
      upscale neighborhoods.  A sea of mostly WHITE families 
      APPLAUDS politely as the PRINCIPAL announces cap and gown-
      clad GRADUATES, who WALK UP to the stage for their diplomas.  

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Sydney Michelle Vanowen...  Gregory 
                    Jasper Volk...

      ANGLE ON: DAN and KATRINA Yoder, early forties.  Dan s 
      affable and fun, but not known for ROLLING with PUNCHES.  
      Katrina PRESENTS as confident and together; only Dan is 
      allowed behind the CURTAIN.  Dan NOTICES: 

                                  DAN
                    She s texting!

      MOLLY Yoder (prickly, feminist, rare-do-well), sits among her 
      peers, thumbing her iPHONE.

                                    KATRINA
                    Let it go, Honey.  

      But Dan takes out his PHONE and FIRES OFF a text...

      ANGLE ON:  Molly, who LOOKS UP at her dad, rolls her eyes and 
      puts her phone away.  As the list of grads nears the end, Dan 
      and Katrina look WORRIED.  They hold HANDS for support.  
      Dan s eyes are squeezed shut; his lips MOVING.   

                                    KATRINA (CONT D)
                    Are you praying?

      The principal reads a DIPLOMA, his face registering SURPRISE.    

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Molly Julia Yoder.

      Dan SPRINGS out of his seat, FISTS RAISED in triumph...

                                  DAN
                    YEAH!!!  WHO-HOO!!!  THERE IT IS!!!

      Everyone STARES.  Molly DIES of embarrassment.  Katrina YANKS 
      Dan back into his seat.  He composes himself, then notices 
      the GLARE of the couple next to him.                                                                                   2.


                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  That really could have gone 
                    either way.


      This school s ROUGHER around the edges; the grads and their 
      families mostly LATINO.  PRINCIPAL ORTIZ is introducing...

                                  PRINCIPAL ORTIZ
                    ...A young man who represented our 
                    school with distinction in Model 
                    UN, and a founding member of our 
                    math team.  Our valedictorian, 
                    Junior Hernandez.

      APPLAUSE.  As JUNIOR, an earnest, nervous over-talker, steps 
      to the PODIUM, his dad, CHUEY, late-thirties, inked up ex-
      gangster, NODS proudly, TEARS streaming down his face.  Next 
      to him, his other son, DEMETRIO, twelve, is filming on his 
      phone; next to HIM is Chuey s ex-wife LISETTE.  

      ON STAGE, Junior places his iPAD on the podium, CLEARS his 
      THROAT and leans into the mic...

                                  JUNIOR
                    Fellow graduates: As Principal 
                    Ortiz mentioned, I am a mathlete.  
                    But in a way, we re all mathletes, 
                    forced to solve life s problems, 
                    both simple and complex.  I m 
                    reminded of the words of basketball 
                    legend Michael Jordan...

      INSERT: iPad screen.  Over Junior s speech, a TEXT pops up:  
      I M PREGNANT.  Junior s EYES go WIDE, his mouth cottons.  
      Chuey and Lisette look concerned.  The crowd FIDGETS.  
      Finally, Junior can only CROAK OUT:

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      MURMURS from the puzzled audience as he SKULKS back to his 
      seat.  Chuey STANDS, calls out:

                                  CHUEY
                    Short and sweet!  Brevity, yo.  

      He APPLAUDS loudly, rallying others to join him -- but a 
      SMATTERING of sympathetic claps is the best they can offer. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                END OF COLD OPENING                                                                                   3.


                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      The COURTYARD is dense with RELATIVES.  A sign reads CONGRATS 
      JUNIOR!  Chuey GRILLS meat and HUGS people; Lisette sets out 
      food.  Demetrio is showing Junior something on his LAPTOP.   

                                  DEMETRIO
                    Look what s on Youtube.

      He plays a VIDEO of Junior s ill-fated SPEECH:  

                                  JUNIOR (ON LAPTOP)
                    Thank you.

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    Thanks for finding that.  And, I m 
                    guessing, for posting it.  

      Demetrio SMILES.  Junior APPROACHES his PARENTS, who HUG him.  

                                    LISETTE
                    So proud of you. 

                                  CHUEY
                    My man.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Dad, I m fairly certain the 
                    barbecue tongs are in my hair.

                                  CHUEY
                          (wiping Junior s hair)
                    Sorry.  Little extra body.

      Molly has ENTERED.  She APPROACHES Junior and his parents.

                                  MOLLY
                    Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez. 

                                    LISETTE
                    Molly!  
                          (then, tentative)
                    So...  congratulations?

                                  MOLLY
                    Yup.  I made it.  

                                  CHUEY
                    Atta girl!  Hey, grab a plate.  You 
                    like meat?

                                    LISETTE
                    Chuey, she s a vegetarian.                                                                                   7.


                                  MOLLY 
                    Yeah, sorry.  I don t eat anything 
                    with a face.

                                  CHUEY
                          (holds up slab of meat)
                    No face on this bad boy.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Anyway, we should, um... 

                                  MOLLY
                    Yeah...  

      Chuey and Lisette watch Molly and Junior WALK AWAY.

                                    LISETTE
                    What do you think s going to happen 
                    with them?

                                  CHUEY
                    I think it s gonna go toes up.  And 
                    soon, he ll have Stanford girls 
                    followin  him around like process 
                    servers.  

                                    LISETTE
                    They seem pretty into each other...

                                  CHUEY
                    That s my worry.  Girls can take a 
                    man off his path...

                                    LISETTE
                    As I learned when we were married.

                                  CHUEY
                    That s on you, too.  For a smart 
                    lady, you shoulda  chosen better.

      ANGLE ON: Junior and Molly; they ve found a pocket of 
      PRIVACY.  They sit in the official TEENS IN LOVE pose (arms 
      around each other, hands in each others back pockets).  He s 
      nervously spilling WORDS all over her.      

                                  JUNIOR
                    Okay, first of all, and I hope this 
                    goes without saying, yet at the 
                    same time, it bears repeating, my 
                    love for you is oceanic.  It s a 
                    hothouse tulip that blooms daily.  
                    It s our expanding universe...                                                                                     8.


                                  MOLLY
                    I love when you say stuff like 
                    that.  And I love you too.  But you 
                    know that for me, the words don t 
                    come as... um... 

                                  JUNIOR
                    Easily?

                                  MOLLY
                    Yeah.

                                  JUNIOR
                    That s okay, I feel what you re 
                    putting out to me.   
                          (beat)
                    So, I guess we should pivot, and 
                    discuss the goings-on in...  there.

      Junior discretely points toward Molly s BELLY.

                                  MOLLY
                    Yeah, let s pivot. 

                                  JUNIOR
                    Well, first and foremost, you need 
                    to know that I m planning to do the 
                    right thing...

                                  MOLLY
                    Why is it up to the guy to do the 
                    right thing?  How do you know I m 
                    not gonna stick you with the baby?  
                    Our society s so patriotic...   

                                  JUNIOR
                    Do you mean  patriarchal ?  

                                  MOLLY
                    Probably.
                          (then)
                    Okay, my parents ll have your 
                    parents over for dinner tomorrow; 
                    we tell  em then.  My dad won t 
                    kill me if there are witnesses.

                                  JUNIOR
                    I agree we should get them 
                    together.  But I can t keep this 
                    from my parents until tomorrow.                                                                                      9.


                                  MOLLY
                    Why?  I keep stuff from mine all 
                    the time.  They still don t even 
                    know you exist.  No offense.  

                                  JUNIOR
                    How can you live like that?

                                  MOLLY
                    It s easy.  They give me my space, 
                    I take it, and every New Year s 
                    Day, we have a long talk about how 
                    we re all gonna be closer.  

                                  JUNIOR
                    My parents are my best friends.  We 
                    share everything.  They adore me.  

                                  MOLLY
                    Please don t make me throw up at 
                    your party.    
                          (then)
                    Fine, I ll tell  em.  I just hope 
                    my dad s head doesn t fly off and 
                    hit anything valuable.     

      Junior takes Molly s HANDS and looks into her EYES...

                                  JUNIOR
                    Molly, obstacles don t have to stop 
                    us.  If you run into a wall, don t 
                    turn around and give up, figure out 
                    how to climb it...

                                  MOLLY
                    Is that your graduation speech?

                                  JUNIOR
                    The moment was crying out for it.  


      At this bustling bagel/sandwich shop, Dan SITS at a table, 
      eating a BAGEL and COFFEE, and reading emails.  

                                  CHUEY (O.S.)
                     Scuse me.

      Dan looks up; Chuey is there.  There s some TENSION here.  

                                  DAN
                    What is it?                                                                                   10.


                                  CHUEY
                    I think you know.

      Chuey points to a SIGN: NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR DRINK.   

                                  DAN
                    What about it?

                                  CHUEY
                    How s the coffee?

                                  DAN
                    Fine.  Robust.

                                  CHUEY
                    Good.  I m glad...  Wouldn t be 
                    from Starbucks, would it?

                                  DAN
                    No.  

                                  CHUEY
                    Then I guess it s a coincidence I 
                    found this in the trash...

      Chuey holds up a STARBUCKS cup.

                                  DAN
                    Not mine.

                                  CHUEY
                          (re: name on cup)
                    No?  Your name s not Dan?

                                  DAN
                    Common name.  
                          (busted)
                    Fine, you solved the case.  You 
                    cracked it wide open.  

                                  CHUEY
                    You actually snuck it in, switched 
                    cups and then lied about it?  
                          (shaking head)
                    Cold blooded...

                                  DAN
                    Yes, it was all an unsuccessful 
                    attempt to avoid this.  Look, as 
                    I ve told you many times, it s 
                    nothing personal; I happen to 
                    prefer Starbucks coffee.                                                                                   11.


                                  CHUEY
                    Then go there and drink it.  Maybe 
                    they got a nice Norah Jones CD for 
                    you at the counter...  

                                  DAN
                    I m not a Norah Jones fan.  
                          (then)
                    Not her new stuff, anyway.  

                                  CHUEY
                    Just so I know, what other rules 
                    don t apply to you?

                                  DAN
                    Look, every day for months, I ve 
                    come in here and spent money.  Does 
                    it really matter if I bring my own 
                    coffee?  

                                  CHUEY
                    Just tryin  to run my business.  Do 
                    I go upstairs to your orthodontics 
                    office and sneak in my own braces?  

                                  DAN
                    Here s a thought.  Maybe serve the 
                    bagels without the giant side of 
                    shoulder chip.  

                                  CHUEY
                    It s my lucky day.  Got a free 
                    lecture on business management from 
                    a dude with sunglasses on his head.

                                  DAN
                    I need them, with all the sunshine 
                    radiating from your personality.  

                                  CHUEY
                    Sorry I lack the charm of someone 
                    who s a known smuggler and a liar.

                                  DAN
                          (getting up)
                    I don t need this.  From now on, 
                    I ll go three blocks out of my way 
                    for the friendly service and 
                    passable food at Bernie s Bagels!  

      As Dan EXITS...                                                                                 12.


                                  CHUEY
                          (calling after)
                    I ll call Bernie and warn him! 


      Chuey ENTERS, arms full of Stanford apparel.  He APPROACHES a 
      CLERK and dumps the stuff on the COUNTER.

                                  CHUEY
                    Need to return this...

                                  CLERK
                    Reason for return?

                                  CHUEY
                    I have a boy; he s everything to 
                    me.  He woulda been the first 
                    person in his family to go to 
                    college.  Not just any college, 
                    Stanford!  When I was his age, I 
                    hadn t even heard a Stanford.

                    Didn t know there was a place where 
                    knowledge grew on trees, just 
                    waitin  to be picked.  But my boy 
                    was gonna be one of those young 
                    people, pickin  knowledge off those 
                    beautiful trees.  Then, in one 
                    moment, a dream evaporates. 
                          (re: dog hoodie)
                    And this one was too small.   


      MONTAGE:  Scenes of EVERYONE having fun, including...  

      -Junior plays a BASKETBALL arcade game.  He misses.  Demetrio 
      steps up, MAKES a shot, and wins a big stuffed ANGRY BIRD.

      -Junior and Demetrio BATTLE in BUMPER CARS.  Chuey sits in 
      his car, WATCHING them, smiling broadly...  out of NOWHERE, 
      Lisette crushes him with HER car.                                                                                 33.


      -Dan, Katrina and Molly on the CAROUSEL, SMILING, just like 
      in the PHOTO earlier. 


      Dan and Katrina sit at a TABLE drinking sodas.

                                    KATRINA
                    Thanks for today, Honey.

                                  DAN
                    Hey, my wife wants Knott s Berry 
                    Farm, she gets it.  It s who I am.

        Chuey, Lisette and Demetrio JOIN THEM, Chuey with CHURROS.

                                  CHUEY
                    Hooked us up some churros...  

                                  DAN
                    Ah, the donut of your people.

                                    KATRINA
                    Dan...

                                  DAN
                    It s okay, we re at that place now.
                          (off Chuey s glare)
                    Or maybe not.  Where s Molly?

                                  DEMETRIO
                    She and Junior are going on the 
                      Boomerang.

                                  DAN
                    You know, seeing them together 
                    today?  He s got brains, she s 
                    got...  him.  Maybe they ll be--  

                                    LISETTE
                          (realizing)
                    She can t go on a roller coaster.  
                    She s pregnant!  

      On their PANIC... 

                                                                      QUICK CUTS:


      Molly and Junior at the FRONT of the LINE...

      Dan, Chuey, etc, RUNNING across the park...                                                                                 34.


      Molly and Junior SIT in the front car of the BOOMERANG...

      Everyone LOST, consulting a MAP; Chuey and Dan ARGUING...

                        CHUEYDAN
      The Corkscrew!  It s behind Please stop saying 
      the corkscrew... Corkscrew !...

      A bored ATTENDANT locks down Molly and Juniors  SAFETY BAR...

      Dan, Chuey, etc, ARRIVE at the RIDE and push through the 
      LINE, APPROACHING the loading platform...

      The ATTENDANT pushes a BUTTON; the roller coaster STARTS, 
      slowly CLIMBING the big first HILL...   

                                    KATRINA (O.S.)
                    Stop!!!

      Molly and Junior TURN to see their frantic PARENTS. 

                                    LISETTE
                    Molly can t ride!  She s pregnant!

      Molly and Junior s eyes go WIDE with PANIC...  

      ANGLE ON: The attendant, who now sits in a chair by the 
      CONTROLS, GROOVING to music; he s got EARBUDS in...

                                  CHUEY
                    Stop the ride!!!

      But the attendant remains OBLIVIOUS.  Molly and Junior s CAR 
      is NEARING the CREST of the hill...    

                                    KATRINA
                    Somebody do something!

      Dan grabs Demetrio s ANGRY BIRD and THROWS IT...

      MUSIC: THE ANGRY BIRDS THEME...

      SLOW MOTION: The ANGRY BIRD FLYING across the TRACK, 
      eventually HITTING the ATTENDANT in the head...  

      END SLOW MOTION; END MUSIC.

      The ATTENDANT LOOKS UP, WTF?!, YANKS OUT his earbuds, then 
      SEES/HEARS everyone YELLING/WAVING at him to stop.  He 
      reaches for the BUTTON.  As the car INCHES over the hill...

      SFX: THE HYDRAULIC SOUND OF THE BRAKES.

      The ride GRINDS to a STOP.  Molly looks SHEEPISH...                                                                                   35.


                                  MOLLY
                    Sorry, guys.  Brain fart...

      Dan, Chuey, Katrina, Lisette and Demetrio watch, RELIEVED...

                                  DAN
                    This is gonna take some doing.

                                  CHUEY
                    Least you re gettin  more involved.

      On Dan s reaction...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      DAN AND KATRINA S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING

      Dan lounges on the BED, drinking a beer.  He s talking to the 
      closed bathroom door. 

                                  DAN
                    Talk about things that could only 
                    happen to Molly.  
                          (then)
                    But we were there for her, which, I 
                    have to say, felt pretty good, you 
                    know?

                                    KATRINA (O.S.)
                    Uh-huh.

                                  DAN
                    I mean, it s not often she lets us 
                    be parents anymore.  
                          (then)
                     Course, this little curveball s 
                    gonna sidetrack the renaissance a 
                    few years, but I guess I can live 
                    with that...
