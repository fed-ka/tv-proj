                                        TV REPORTER (O.S., CONT'D)
                        ...as looky-loos arrive from across
                        New England, hoping for a glimpse
                        of the reclusive soothsayer... 

          Moving back to find Bruce on the couch with a very
            affectionate girl snuggling up against him... in fact, we
          may recognize Stillson's volunteer girl KATIE...

                        KATIETV REPORTER (O.S.)
              What's he really like?Our own prognosticator,
                                                        Dr. Tom is up next with

                all this)it's going to rain or shine
            I'll tell you what he'sbetter than your
            not.  He's not the nextbarometer...
            link in the evolutionary
              chain.

          He watches the TV set with disdain, worried about Johnny...

                                        BRUCE
                        He's... just a guy.  Just Johnny
                        Smith.   



          Johnny sits alone at the head of his long dining table
          drinking a cup of coffee, reading something on his
            laptop... nothing but the ticking grandfather clock to
          keep him company... 

          Alone like Charles Foster Kane...  Like Elvis...

          The doorbell sounds.  Johnny looks up...  



          Using his flat-screen TV's remote control, Johnny brings
          up the view from the security camera on his gate.  It's
          RAUL (17, Hispanic), the grocery boy, arms full of
          groceries.  Johnny is relieved, even happy to see him.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (into intercom)
                        Hey, Raul!  Hang on, I'm clicking
                        you in.

          Johnny pushes the button releasing the gate.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - TEASER - 12/9/02 GRN    3.

          MOVING WITH HIM to the kitchen door where he releases the
          security alarm by pressing a sequence of five numbers...
          then unhooking a deadbolt or the latest equivalent of
          serious locks... to let Raul in...

          And we may notice that Johnny is engaging the delivery
          man more than you or I might... like he's appreciating
          the company... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        How ya doin', Raul. 

                                        RAUL
                        Fine, Mr. S.

          He carries in the bags, lays them on the kitchen counter...

                                        JOHNNY
                        So.  How're things down at the
                        store?

                                        RAUL
                        Got this whole new organic fruit
                        and vegetable department, you
                        ought to come down, check it out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can I get you a beer or something?

                                        RAUL
                        Ah, wish I could, Mr. S... I got
                        other deliveries...

          Johnny's disappointed the kid has to rush off...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Keeping you busy, huh?

                                        RAUL
                        Hey, we got in that H agen-Dazs
                        butter pecan you like... we should
                        put it in the freezer...

          He starts to take a few items out of the bag in search of
          the ice cream bag... one of the items is a jar of capers...

                                        RAUL
                        Oh yeah and I found your missing
                          capers... they put it in the wrong
                        bag last week... went to another
                        address... old man named Grissom,
                          a shut-in... guy never wants me
                        to leave... like I really have
                        time to play chess with him, you
                          know...?

          He puts the ice cream in the freezer...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (self-conscious)
                        Yeah... it's a shame when you
                        gotta look forward to the groceries
                        being delivered for a little
                          company.  

                                        RAUL
                                  (oblivious)
                        If I could just get you to sign...

          Johnny signs an electronic pad like all the delivery guys
          use nowadays...

                                        RAUL
                        And if I could ask you to sign
                        once more... 

          He pulls a tabloid out of the bag...  JOHNNY CUT AND PASTED
            APPEARING TO TOUCH ELVIS WITH THE HEADLINE, "JOHNNY SEES
          ELVIS' SECRET PAST"...

                                        RAUL
                        For my personal John Smith

                        racks down at the store.  

          As Johnny signs his autograph...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't let me catch you selling
                        these on EBay.

                                        RAUL
                        Thanks, Mr. S.    

          As Johnny opens the door to let him out, the alarm
            sounds...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oops, it resets automatically...

          Johnny punches the code in again to turn it off... Raul's
          exit is a little chaotic and he's actually already gone
          by the time Johnny says --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good to see you... Raul.

          And Johnny's alone again... he turns to his groceries,
          sighs just a tad...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dinner for one... defrost a little
                        veal to go with my capers... for
                        a nice piccata... catch up on the
                        third season of X Files...

          And as he picks up the jar of capers... RAMP TO HIS FACE... 
          HEAR THE WHISTLE OF A TEA KETTLE...



            A hulking yet frail old man who walks with a cane (not
          unlike Johnny's) is in his kitchen pouring himself some
          tea... this is JEFFREY GRISSOM, 79, who has a grim, almost 
            Scandinavian face.  Finding Johnny standing there holding
          the jar of capers in his hand...

                                        JEFFREY
                                (talking to himself)
                        Now I'll have my tea.  In a moment,
                        I'll think, 'I'm the man who's
                          drinking the tea; I'm the man
                        making this tea, that's here in
                        the cup, disappear."

          The old man speaks the words seriously and slowly, a kind
          of 'to do is to be' mantra... and as he leaves the kitchen,
          Johnny following, he does a curious thing... he moves to
          a mirror in the hall... Johnny and we are not at an angle
          to see his reflection so we cannot be sure what he sees...
          but his eyes are sad as he reaches out to touch the mirror
          and he says...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Where have I gone?

            Whereupon the vision ends and we return to --



          as he reacts curiously and puts down the jar of capers...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - TEASER - 12/9/02 GRN    6.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Poor guy... I ought to give him a
                        call... maybe he likes the X
                          Files...

          He starts putting the rest of his groceries away... on a
          whim, glances into a small kitchen mirror to see his own
          reflection which is perfectly normal. 

          That's when it begins...

          Johnny looks down at...


88HIS HAND -- HIS THUMB IS MISSING

          That's right... it's missing... gone... 


          JOHNNY

            reacts... pushing in to his face as it fills with shock
          as he looks back to...


          HIS HAND BUT THIS TIME TWO FINGERS ARE MISSING


          JOHNNY

            reacts...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, vision, not real... can't
                        be real... fingers can't be
                          disappearing...

          He holds up both hands...and fingers (different ones on
          each hand) are simply not there... in a panic, he moves
          to the phone and picks it up, dials 9-1-1 with the last
          finger he has left... but the phone falls to the floor as
          he looks to see his entire hand is gone (all the
            disappearances take place off camera)... and as we cut to
          a new...


          ANGLE - JOHNNY HAS NO ARMS

          and this is a terrifying nightmare... the phone is
            squawking on the floor...

          Johnny crawls onto the floor like a worm... talks into

          And the terrifying vision ends as Johnny finds himself...

          still holding the jar of capers as he was when his first
          vision watching Jeffrey began... and he's sweating and

                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:


          The next day.  Johnny is being examined by DR. GIBSON
          with the penlight in the eyes...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why does every doctor insist on
                        shining a light in my eyes?  I
                        don't see these things with my
                        eyes...

          She finishes... 

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Your eyes don't know that.  I can
                        always detect pupillary fluctuation
                        after you've had a vision...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, I'm not even sure this was
                          a vision... it was more of... of
                        an hallucination...

          She examines brain wave readouts... and he's quite serious
          as he says --

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        I'm scared I'm really losing it
                        this time, doc.  I mean what if
                        my synaptic paths are
                          deteriorating?

          She looks at him with compassion.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        I don't see any evidence of...

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...they could be burning out from
                          excessive neuron activity...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        You've been on the internet again,
                        haven't you...

                          triggered some anxiety and this

                        Car accident, a few years ago.

                        Remarkable how fragile the human
                          skeleton is.  How easily joints
                          rupture, bones crack.  Can I get
                        you something?  I opened a bottle
                        of a dry Rioja...

                        Maybe just a diet coke...

          Jeffrey stares at him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        The Rioja sounds fine.

          Jeffrey goes to a wall bar, slides a door open to reveal
          glasses and bottles of wine... to pour...

                        I only drink a glass or two...
                        and the bottle is never the same
                        the next day... one of the
                          disadvantages of living alone... 
                        do I open the bottle or do I not
                        open the bottle... knowing that
                        much of it will be wasted...

          He hands it to Johnny and as he does... RAMP TO JOHNNY'S
          FACE... as we HEAR the old man YELL from a VISION...

          Johnny follows the sound... into the kitchen where he
          finds Jeffrey on the floor... did he fall?  But no... on
          closer inspection, we see the horror in Jeffrey's face
          and notice that one of his arms and one of his legs are

          in his kitchen... but it is the same nightmare... the
          VISION ENDS...


  1414RESUME JOHNNY AND JEFFREY

          as before... Jeffrey has noticed Johnny's vision...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Is anything wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  Since the accident... I just
                        'go away' for a few moments now
                        and then...

                                        JEFFREY
                        I know exactly what you mean.

          Johnny wonders about the mystery of this man and these
          visions as his eyes catch on an old, old photograph of a
          charming 1920s farmhouse with a little boy standing with
          his parents in front of it... There is a very distinctive,
          leaded glass window in a prominent place on the front of
          the house...

                                        JEFFREY
                        The house I grew up in.

          Johnny puts down his cane and picks up the photo, studies
          it... 

                                        JEFFREY
                          I haven't been there since I was
                        six years old.  When I retired
                        here in Maine, I wanted to find
                        that house, if it still exists. 
                        But now my health's failing and...

                        I could look into it.

            Jeffrey's eyes light up.

                                        JEFFREY
                        Oh, I wouldn't want to--

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's no trouble.  

          The door opens suddenly, startling Jeffrey...

                                (her own set of keys
                                in her hand)
                        Hello?

          As Jeffrey turns, he accidentally knocks his wine glass
          over; fortunately it's almost empty and...


          CLOSE - A SINGLE DROP FALLS ON THE HARDWOOD FLOOR 

          Johnny retrieves the glass for him as...


          ANGLE AT THE DOOR

          ALMA (30's, plain), Jeffrey's assisted-care nurse, walks
          in carrying a bag full of nurse's accoutrements.  She has
          the calm passive-aggressive quality that Nurse Ratchet
          had in Cookoo's Nest...

                        I have sort of a psychic ability...
                        to see things...

            Jeffrey's eyes narrow...

                                        JEFFREY
                          I believe I have heard of you. 
                        The coma victim.  You're the one

          Johnny smiles at him, this guy may be old but he's
          remarkably sharp.  Jeffrey's mind works as the scene

                        Last week he gave his watch to
                        the refrigerator repairman.

                        the house.  Why not let him try?

          She smiles a patronizing Ratchet smile at him...  He glares
          at her.

          Jeffrey hands him his cane... except it isn't Johnny's

                        kind of window...

          Moving back to see Johnny and Bruce standing with a
          CURATOR, (female, 35) over a desktop filled with books
          and photographs of old houses and barns...

                                        CURATOR
                        Then it was probably a Winchell.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A what?

                                        CURATOR
                          Hieronymous Winchell, 1865 to
                        1932.  He was famous for his leaded
                        glass windows... 
                                  (wistfully)
                        A lost art, really...  His company
                        built homes in Northern Maine in
                        the early 1900s.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can you narrow that down a little?

                                        CURATOR
                        Give me a minute.  I'll give you
                        the names of a couple communities
                        where the houses were most common.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          The curator moves away.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Bruce)
                        Maybe he'll recognize the name of
                        one of the towns...

                                        BRUCE
                        You really think he'll be up to a
                        field trip if he does?

                        up in before he dies... it's
                          important to him... the old guy

                        That's why you think you got these
                        strange visions...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's the only explanation I can
                        think of... the isolation -- it
                        must really take a toll on a lot
                        of elderly people...

                                (pointed)
                        Yeah.  And a lot of not-so-elderly
                        people.

          The curator returns with some printed material...

                        Thank-you.  This is really helpful.

                        1-3-3-zero Winding Wood Way in
                        Cleaves Mills.  He was there
                        yesterday, but today...

                                        WALT
                        Let me guess... a woman answers
                        the door and says she doesn't
                        know who you're talking about...

                                (obvious)
                        She called the police.

                                        WALT
                        You're damned right she called. 
                        A Mrs. Stade who lives at 1-3-3-
                        zero Winding Wood Way.  I don't
                        suppose you have any evidence of
                        this guy you think you saw...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think I saw him... I saw
                        him... I'm not crazy...

                                        WALT
                        No, you just have visions.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, John, maybe this guy used to
                        live in that house or is going to
                        live there in the future...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This was not a vision.  I don't
                        talk to visions.  I don't drink
                        wine with visions.  You think...
                        I can't tell the difference between
                        the real world... and a vision...?   

          He looks at Walt and Bruce -- a long beat as they eye him - 
          neither answers too quickly...

                        up out of my imagination, okay... 
                        he got my capers, understand?

          Johnny and Bruce stand by the checkout counters talking

                        Look, I'd really like to keep
                        this quiet.

                        Keep what quiet?  

          Grimacing, the manager conspiratorially pulls Walt, Johnny
          and Bruce to the side.

                                        MANAGER
                                  (whispering)
                        Raul was deported.

                        Look, how was I supposed to know
                        he was an illegal?  He had a
                          driver's license.  Apparently it
                        was a fake driver's license, but... 
                        I run an honest business here--

                        in.  Whole nine yards.  Right
                        here in Cleaves Mills.  Can you

          see that, although from the back she looked EXACTLY like
          the Alma in Jeffrey's house, now that we see her face, we
          see it's a DIFFERENT woman entirely...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not her.

                        What... Bruce...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is not Alma.

                                        BRUCE
                        This is Alma.

                        This is not the right Alma.

                                (to Alma)
                        Are there any other home care

                        Alma, have you seen my friend
                        John before...

                        Sure.  Around the hospital, once
                        or twice.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah.  Because he has a problem
                        in his head.

                                        BRUCE
                        You weren't at a client's yesterday
                        with him...

          She shakes her head, puzzled beyond words... moves quickly
          away...

                        Sorry we bothered you, ma'am.

          Johnny looks as befuddled as we've ever seen him...

                        Just... just do me one last favor.



          It's completely redecorated... nothing is the same as it
          was yesterday... The husband moves away to join his wife
          who is holding her child...

                        You mind if I look around?

                        This... this is ridiculous.

          Stade nods, go ahead.  Walt moves out of sight toward the
          bedrooms as Johnny hangs back with Bruce... sotto --

                          Everything's different... they
                          replaced everything... obviously
                        to make it more difficult for me
                        to get visions... 

          Bruce looks at him, worried about his friend... Johnny
          touches things as he goes... but is getting nothing...

                        The picture of the Winchell house --
                        it was on the mantle... the bar
                        was over here... glasses in here,
                        he poured a Rioja, 2000... he
                        said it was a good vintage...
                        and...

          As the memory hits Johnny... he looks to the hardwood
          floor and we do an incredible FX ZOOM to the spot where
          the wine glass fell... and find just the slightest trace
          of crusty, dried wine residue where the drop fell...

          Johnny kneels down and slowly reaches out his finger to
          touch the barely perceptible purple dot... and as he does -
          RAMP TO HIS FACE... as an incredible vision occurs all
          around him...



          Incredibly fast motion.  Jeffrey Grissom is on a gurney
          being wheeled out... he's alive and awake but grim...
          Alma leads the way... followed by a crew that removes all
          the old furniture, does light construction work on the
          wall unit... then brings in new furnishings... followed
          by the arrival of the Stades including the kid... and
          this all takes maybe fifteen seconds...          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 2 - 12/9/02 GRN    29.

                        You.  Jeffrey liked it.  He saw a
                        singer in Paris singing it once. 
                        It stayed with him for some reason.

                        'It's just the thought of you...'

          Sure, Bruce remembers it...

                        That's a darn good question, Sarah.  

          Walt shakes his head...

                        Is anything missing?

                        I don't know.

                        I don't think he should stay in
                        the house.

                                        WALT
                        Sarah's right.  Why don't you
                        check into a hotel.  Or maybe
                        even the hospital for a once-over.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't need a once over, Walt. 
                        I'm not seeing things.  I mean I
                        am seeing things.  But they're
                        real things.

                                        WALT
                        I'll let you know what we find in
                        the morning. 

          He hangs up, looks at Sarah, shakes his head with
          concern...

                        I liked it better when he was
                        calling you all the time 'stead
                        of me...



          As Johnny casually checks the van as he goes by... then
          looks in his rear view mirror... as headlights pull out
          onto the road behind him... his mind works...



            following at a safe distance... no need to keep visual
          contact, a display on a tracking device tells them what
          he's doing...

                        He's stopping.  Move closer.



          Stade looks through binoculars at the store... Alma checks
          her watch...

                        My dogs must be getting hungry.

          An immigration clerk (30's, male) stands across a counter
          from Johnny/Jeffrey.

                        Passeport, s'il vous plait.

            Johnny/Jeffrey hands the clerk his passport. 

          CLOSE ON the passport.  It is a United States passport,
          has Jeffrey Grissom's picture on it and his name underneath
          the picture.  Suddenly, we go into --


          A MONTAGE

            Johnny/Jeffrey handing Immigration Clerks his passport,
          keeping CLOSE ON the two sets of hands and the passport
          itself.  The clerk's hands should change, as do the visible
          sleeves of his uniform and the counter top. 
            Johnny/Jeffrey's hands remain the same, although his suit
          changes.

                        Pass, pazhalsta.

          The passport still has Jeffrey Grissom's picture on it,
          but now it is a Soviet Union passport and the name is a
          Russian name, Denis Petrovich Alekseyev, written in the
          Cyrillic alphabet.

                                        CLERK#3'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          Reisepasse, bitte.

          Now it switches to an East German passport -- the picture
          is the same, but now the name reads: Ernst Allmenroder.

                                        CLERK#4'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          Paszport, Prosze.

          Same picture, Polish name: Andrzej Lukawski.

          Same picture, Czech name: Milan Havel.

            recognize landmarks...

                                        JEFFREY
                        It's so different now...  I mean,
                        the roads were gravel back then,
                          everything's new--

          Except, perhaps, the following which suddenly catches
            Jeffrey's eye:


  61A61AHIS POV - A LANDMARK

          an old church, unchanged over the years, the one
          anachronism in a neighborhood full of new houses...



          Push slowly into his face... finally... softly...

                                        JEFFREY
                        If there are railroad tracks --
                        in about a mile... there will be
                          a turnoff to the left... take it.



          they go over the railroad tracks... an old dirt road to
          the left...

                                        JEFFREY
                        There.  Turn there.

          Johnny turns...



          Jeffrey looks confused... 




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN   48A.

                                        JEFFREY
                        There's another road.  There's
                          supposed to be another road.

          He climbs out of the Jeep...          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN    49.*



          As Johnny enters... Alma and the Stades with him...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Jeffrey, we should be going...

          There's no response...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Jeffrey?

          All they see is --


            REACTIONS

          Alma's eyes panic, her look sends the Stades into action... 
          they quickly move all over the house and return, shaking
          their heads... but in fact, he has...

            Disappeared.

          And all that's left is...


          JOHNNY'S POV - JEFFREY'S CANE LEANING AGAINST A WALL


            ALMA/ROSEMARY

          glares at Johnny, barely able to talk.  Tight and
          controlled (Note: This is a quote from the end of "Three
          Days of the Condor") --

                                        ALMA/ROSEMARY
                        You dumb son of a bitch.  You've
                        done more damage than you know.

          She rushes out with the Stades.


          ANGLE - JOHNNY AND THE CANE

          He moves to it and picks it up... and as he does... PUSH
          TO JOHNNY as he sees --


  7171CLOSE UP CLERK'S HANDS

                                        CLERK#6 (O.S.)
                        Passeport, s'il vous plait.

          The clerk accepts the passport which is loudly STAMPED to
          pass through.  As the stamp hits the passport....



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN    52.

          ANGLE TO SEE THE STAMP LIFTING OUT OF FRAME  

          to reveal Jeffrey's current photo with a new name, Pablo
          Arevalo.  In the photo, Jeffrey is grinning.


  7272RESUME JOHNNY

          as he holds the cane and smiles... deciding to take it as
          a souvenir, he walks casually out of the house... as the
          soundtrack reprises "Winter Snow"...*
