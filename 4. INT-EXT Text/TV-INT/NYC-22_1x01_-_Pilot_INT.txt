      KENNY MCCORMACK(23), slightly built, calm, intelligent-eyed, 
      exits commuter train from Long Island carrying dry cleaning.

    He walks across a seedy arcade to the subway entrance to 
      continue his journey.


      GEN(WHITE HOUSE) PERRY (26), golden-haired Cali girl, tall, 
      surfer athletic, stands against a center pole, trying to keep 
    her dry cleaning from getting crushed.

    The train stops at 96th and Columbus.

      Gengets out.

      GEN SPOV - All the other dry cleaning carriers exiting from 
      different subway cars.

      Beside the 6 we've met, there s another half dozen we 
      haven t.                                                                                    2.



    Day tour coming in; midnight shift leaving; victims on 
      benches, community advocates milling, last night s collars 
      sleeping in cells.

    We see them all enter; dazed, jazzed, scared a little; the 
    dry cleaning in their arms consisting of half a dozen never-
      worn patrol and dress uniforms.

      Kiterunner approaches the Desk Sergeant, ROY RYAN (42).

                                  KITERUNNER
                    Hey Sergeant, my name is Basir

                                  KITERUNNER
                    What is?

      Ryan stares at him as if he s brain dead. Kiterunner moves 
    on.

                                  TONYA
                    How you doing sir, Tonya Perez

                      Downstairs.

    But as she moves off with her bushel of uniforms, he raises 
    his eyes to study her ass.


    Two kinds of energy; the routine laid back movements of the 
      vets; the herkyjerky chicken without a head vibes of the                                                                                     3.

      KITERUNNER S POV - THE VETS

      Some, but not all, of the old timers are giving him a 
      thousand yard stare.

                                                                    FLASHBACK TO:

      Talibantowards a waiting truck. His family is pleading with 
    the guy to let him go.

      Kiterunner (15) grabs the fighter s arm. The guy raises his

      Kiterunner, a martial artist, breaks his arm. You can hear it 
      snap. The guy is moaning in the dirt.

    As Kenny jams his uniforms inside, the others lay theirs on 
    the bench in front, waiting their turn.

      CLOSE ON   A BOOT, kicking all the uniforms to the floor;

                    Gun Clappin Goons on 115th and 6th 
                    have been talking smack on Twitter 
                    and MySpacefor the last three 
                    weeks, and finally last night a 
                    GCG, Trevor Lemon, got shot in the 
                    leg, suspect in the wind, so we re 
                    expecting payback today, tonight 
                    tomorrow the latest, a full out run 
                    and gun war, the battle lane as 
                    always for these two sets, straight 
                    up and down 6th Avenue from 
                    Footpost41 to 43... We ll be on 
                    top of it as much as we can but 
                    we re stretched, so gonnaneed 
                    help, especially from you rooks on 
                    those footposts, you re right in 
                    the line of fire, you see any young 
                    kid out there carrying a cane but 
                    not limping? You confiscate it. You 
                    see anyone with a backpack they 
                    could have a gun in there, stop him 
                    and search that bag. Keep your eyes 
                    open, be careful and stay on your 
                    radios.

                    22nd Precinct round of applause 
                    welcome...

    PAN OF ROOKIES   as they wait.

    PAN OF VETS - Stony stares... Dead silence.

      CLOSE ON - one clueless rook who starts applauding, then 
      mortified, stops.

    As YODA drives them to their posts:

      ROOKIE S POV   FROM INSIDE THE MOVING VAN

      Rolling view of the precinct starting with apartment houses 
    on the side streets, brownstones, retail shops, bars and 
      restaurants on the avenues   solid urban middle class - then 
    as they head further north, to more down-at the-heels 
      streets; mix of old Harlem tenements and brownstones starting 
    to be gentrified; a cappuccino joint cheek and jowl with a 
      bodega; a wine bar next to a funky barber shop; funeral home 
      next to a day spa.

                    My name is Sergeant Larry Rivers. 
                    There are some who call me Yoda. I 
                    don't like it. I m your field 
                    training officer. Here s my order 
                    of the day... Don t get hurt, don t 
                    hurt anyone, keep your mouth shut 
                    and your eyes open; in essence, 
                    just stand there. Anything jumps 
                    off, you radio me; I ll be circling 
                    all tour. Your posts are two blocks 
                    long contiguous to each other, 
                    contiguous means next to. You share 
                    the post with your partner but 
                    you re not hanging out, you re not 
                    telling jokes. You re learning the 
                    lay of the land. Tomorrow I ll 
                    teach you how to write a summons.

      Yoda driving in silence, the two of them in the middle seat.

      TONYA S POV   On the seat next to Yoda; a large can labeled 
       Decomposition Crystals .


      It s well appointed, books, art, furniture, dead quiet.

      A key turns in the door and the super, Yoda, Lazarus and 
      Tonya enter.

      Except for Yoda, they all react like they ve been hit with a 
      titanic stinkbomb.

    The super gags, then bails.

      Lazarus and Tonya are gasping.

                                  YODA
                    In here.


    In the tub, lays a 92-year-oldcorpse, head unsubmerged, arms 
      resting on the sides as if still alive.                                                                                    22.


      Lazarus and Tonya are reeling, as Yoda calmly sprinkles some 
    of the decompcrystals around the room to tamp down the 
      stench.

                                  YODA
                    What you got here is your basic 
                    suspicious DOA. I need you two to 
                    baby-sit this until the ME arrives.

                                  TONYA
                    What s suspicious? He s a million 
                    years old.

                                  YODA
                    He lived with his son, the kid 
                    never reported it, and he s nowhere 
                    to be found.

                                  LAZARUS
                    Can t we wait outside the 
                    apartment? He s not going anywhere.

                                  YODA
                    No.

                                  TONYA
                    What did we do?

                                  YODA
                    You graduated the academy this 
                    week, that s what you did.

                    way you ll get the smell out.


      Yoda driving White House and Franchise somewheres.                                                                                    24.

                    There was a cop retired about 
                    twenty years ago died last winter 
                    always lived in the precinct. Back 
                    in the day when this whole area was 
                    like hell s hundred acres, every 
                    cop in the house moving to the 
                    suburbs, this guy raises a family 
                    here because he liked the people.

      Yoda pulls up to an old multi-family brownstone, right on the 
      dividing line of affluence and hardship.

      Rundown but respectable, the three of them climbing murky 
      stairs.

                    Ginny sgot a bit of a problem.

      GINNY(74), diminutive, feisty, glasses and a housedress, is

                    Can you fix a toilet?

                    Whoa, wait, turn the shut off

                    Behind the toilet, down, right 
                    there, no, the other way, the other

                    You know what pissedme off about 
                    you? You could have been one of the 
                    great ones but you had to be a 
                      playa-jerk. No interest in defense, 
                    got so much as a runny nose you 
                    benched yourself, missed practices, 
                    out of shape, hitting every pimp 
                    and felon nightclub in the country, 
                    and jumping into the stands that 
                    time to go after some knucklehead 
                    heckler? What were you, twelve?

                    Do you want me to take over?

                                  FRANCHISE
                    I got it.

                                  GINNY
                    And then you show up that year 35 
                    pounds overweight and lose the 
                    point guard slot to Reggie Mayo? 
                    Reggie Mayo! You could ve eaten him 
                    for breakfast. In fact you looked 
                    like you did eat him for breakfast.

      Franchise, stressed, takes it out on the plunger, slamming it 
      into the water like harpooning a whale, and soaking himself.

      Lazarus and Tonya in the living room, dying, opening all

                    I once wrote a piece on a bad 
                    police shooting involving his 
                    nephew up in the Bronx. You think 
                    that s why? Guy never even said 
                    anything to me.

      Tonya gives him a hard knowing look that s difficult to 
      decipher and leaves the apartment.


      Tonya cursing to herself as she waits for the elevator.

    ON TONYA   As the elevator door opens. What she sees, at 
      first shocks, then slow- burn angers her.

      REVERSE   ANNA FOSTER (31) standing there with a punch bruise 
    on her cheek.

                                  TONYA
                    Hey, you live here?

                          (hiding her bruise)
                    No. I mean yeah.

                                  TONYA
                    Take me to your apartment?

                    No.

                                  TONYA
                    I just want to see everything s OK.

                                  ANNA
                    Everything s OK.                                                                                    27.


                                  TONYA
                    I just want to talk. Which 
                    apartment?

      Tonya steers the woman down the hall, taking over.

                                  ANNA
                    Please...

                                  TONYA
                    Is he in there?

                                  ANNA
                    Please stay out...

                                  TONYA
                    It s either me or the entire 7th 
                    cavalry.

      Anna, against her will, unlocks the door to 


      thatis nicely appointed but is in a state of chaos.

    Her husband, ERIC ROYCE (33) drunk, wild-eyed, appears, gawks 
    at Tonya.

                                  ERIC
                    Who are you?
                          (to Anna)
                    What did you do?

                                  TONYA
                    Sir, what happened to her face?

                                  ERIC
                    I don t believe this! You know it 
                    was an accident!

                                  ANNA
                    Eric, I m so sorry...

                                  TONYA
                    Sir, look at me.

    As she reaches for her radio, Eric walks out of the room.

    And before she can finish her sentence, he s returned with a 
      shotgun.                                                                                    28.

                          radio)
                    I gave her everything she ever 
                    wanted for ten years, get fired for 
                    doing the right thing, and now 
                    she s leavingme?

                                  TONYA

                    What do I do, what do I do, what do 
                    I do...

      Tonya furtively eyes her gun across the room.

                                  TONYA
                    For starters, how about you don t 
                    make it worse for yourself.

    She inches forward, her gun a little closer.

                                  ACT TWO


      Tonya is seated on the floor, Anna standing against a wall, 
      Eric waving the shotgun from one to the other as he paces 
      like a liquored up loon.

                                  ERIC
                    Top pharmaceutical salesman in my 
                    division for seven years running, 
                    never made less than six figures in 
                    commission but I always plowed that 
                    back into deferred stock because 
                    this new cholesterol pill we were 
                    developing was going to blast 
                    Lipitorright off the market, just 
                    hang on for FDA approval. Shock of 
                    the century, FDA gives it thumbs 
                    down. Why?
                          (patting his own bald 
                          head)
                    It, caused, baldness. The stock 
                    went through the floor, and I had 
                    three and a half million in 
                    deferred commissions and bonuses 
                    drop to thirty thousand dollars 
                    overnight... Then I find out half 
                    my bosses and their pals sold off 
                    most of their stock only two months 
                    before the FDA made its 
                    announcement. Made out like 
                    bandits. I contact the SEC, SEC 
                    says two months is too long before 
                    the sell off to qualify for insider 
                    trading, sends me on my way. Three 
                    days later I get fired, no reason 
                    given. The SEC says if it s 
                      retaliation it didn t leak from us, 
                    maybe you should get a lawyer and 
                    what does shesay? What does my 
                    loving wifesay? I m leaving you...

                                  ANNA
                    Eric, that all happened two years 
                    ago. It s been two years living 
                    like this. I can t take it anymore, 
                    you just won t let it go.

                                  TONYA
                          (inching forward again)
                    That s one hell of a story...

      Eric points the shotgun at her, freezing her forward motion.                                                                                    30.

      Franchise drops the plunger in disgust. White House steers 
    him out of the bathroom.

    As White House improvises a plumbing snake, Franchise moves 
    to the living room hung with old family photos and police 
      commendations for the dead husband.

    He casually looks out the window.

      FRANCHISE S POV   A dry cleaning shop across the street.

    He sees someone big and streetyexit the shop - race, 
      features, indeterminate. Doesn t think much of it.

    But a moment later, someone in the shop is placing a potted 
      Aspidistra in the front window.

    He quickly scans the street looking in vain for that big 
      dude.

      He s gone. Franchise looks worried. Did he recognize that 
      guy?

      Franchise enters. A smallish elderly couple, Hispanic man, 
      ELIAN(64) and his Asian wife, MEI(65) are behind the 
      counter. They seem frightened of him for some reason, jumpy 
    as hell.

    Not sure how to play it, Franchise clams up.


      Lazarus in his underwear, is still writing, still alone.

    He checks his watch   where s Tonya?


      Lazarus, buttoning up his uniform, exits DOAapt. Worried, he 
      heads for the elevator then hears from behind an apartment 
      door down the hall...

                                  ERIC (O.S.)
                    Shut up! Just shut up!

                    Eric, I m trying to help you 
                    here...

      Lazarus moves to the apartment door.

                                  LAZARUS
                    Hello, police. Open up.

      There s dead silence. Lazarus takes out his radio, is ready 
    to call it in, when the door swings open, Tonya standing 
      there.

      Lazarus sees Eric off at an angle, his shotgun aimed at 
      Tonya s back.                                                                                    36.

      Lazarus and Tonya seated on the floor, as Eric rants and

                    I get a lawyer like the SEC says, 
                    but I have no money. My old 
                    company? They have lawyers sitting 
                    around all day making paper 
                    airplanes, just waiting for cranks 
                    and whistle blowers like me to try 
                    to make waves. All they have to do 
                    is outspend me, and they win so I 
                    have to be my own lawyer. I m all 
                    day, every day in the library, 
                    reading, preparing, filing, two 
                    years of banging my head against 
                    the wall and I can t even get in 
                    front of a judge, I can barely make 
                    my nut, I can barely feed my 
                    family, I can t even take care 
                    of...

                                  LAZARUS
                    Listen to me, Eric. You play this 
                    the right way, you put down the 
                    gun, your story comes out, the 
                    lawyers will line up for you just 
                    for the publicity and you ll get 
                    your day in court. But... if you 
                    play this wrong? That s a whole 
                       notherkind of story cycle.

                    put us up.                                                                                    37.


                                  TONYA
                    Who s  us ?

                                  ANNA
                    It was supposed to be temporary, 
                    Eric, we need a break from each 
                    other.

                                  ERIC
                          (singing  Have Mercy )
                    Went to see the gypsy, here s what 
                    the gypsy said, she said Eric, your 
                    girl she s gonnaleave you, her 
                    bags are packed up under the bed, 
                    have mercy, have mercy baby...

                                  ANNA
                    Eric stop it, just stop!

      ANGLE   TONYA looks to the guns across the room, looks to 
      Lazarus, as Eric takes another slug.

                                  TONYA
                    Eric can I stand up? My back, I 
                    have a bad disc.

                                  ERIC
                          (tearing up as he rants)
                    You know where I work now? Gold s 
                    Discount Electronics. Can I 
                    interest you in a Blue-Ray of the 
                    new re-expanded Avatar? Or perhaps 
                    our new Gorilla cable? I mean,  cuz
                    you don t know what it s like to 
                    watch a football game on TV until 
                    you watch it with a Gold's Discount 
                      Electronics Gorilla cable.

      Tonya slowly rises, Lazarus, alarmed, has no choice but to 
      rise too. She gestures for him to step away from her, to 
      create two separate targets.

      Panicked, Eric s aim swivels between the three of them.

                                  TONYA
                    I told you I have a bad disc.

                                  LAZARUS
                    Eric, help us help you.

      Suddenly a look of epiphany comes over Eric s face; and he 
      actually smiles.                                                                                    38.


                                  ERIC
                    You want to help me?

      Startling them both, he kicks their guns back to them across 
    the floor.

                                  ERIC (CONT D)
                    Lock and load!

      They scoop up their guns and aim at his head, Eric with the 
      shotgun on his wife.

                                    TONYA/LAZARUS
                    Put it down! Put it down!

                                  ERIC
                    I kill her, you kill me, suicide by 
                    cop right?

      It s a 3-way stand-off.

      Suddenly, from a back bedroom a baby starts to wail.

                                  TONYA
                          (calmly)
                    You kill her, we kill you, who gets 
                    the baby?

      Eric quickly claps his hands to his ears to shut out the 
      wails.

      They have a split second to blow him away, but being rookies, 
      they hesitate to kill.

      Then Eric recovers, the  opportunity  lost, his shotgun back 
    on his wife.

                                  ACT THREE


      Three guns in a standoff.

    The baby in the other room is crying harder. 

                                  ANNA
                    Eric, please! Let me see to her!

                                  ERIC
                    All I ve ever done my whole life is 
                    work as hard as I knew how, take 
                    care of the people I love and try 
                    to do the right thing. You know 
                    what I mean? Who in their right 
                    mind would raise a child in a world 
                    like this?

                                  ANNA
                    Eric, I m begging you... Come with 
                    me.  See her.

                                  LAZARUS
                    Hey Eric, listen to me, look at me, 
                    I busted my ass for 14 years, go 
                    into work one day, my stuff is 
                    already in a box on my desk. I 
                    crawl into a bottle for an entire 
                    year after that and lose my wife 
                    and child. I was broke drunk and 
                      familyless. But I pulled myself 
                    together, and the world came back. 
                    It comes back, Eric.

                                  ERIC
                    Did your wife come back?

                                  LAZARUS
                          (hesitates, lies)
                    Yes.

      Eric can tell he s lying, is fixed on the haunt in Lazarus  
      eyes.

                                  ANNA
                    Eric, please, I ll stay with you, I 
                    swear.

                                  ERIC
                    Stay with me where, in prison? In a 
                    psych ward?                                                                                    40.

                    Somebody better check out that 
                    baby.


      T-Rex, big-eyed, jumpy walks to the soda cases in the back of 
    the musty cramped store. In here he looks like the pre-
      pubescent child that he is.

                                  KENNY (O.S.)
                    How you doing.

    Kid flinches as Kenny makes himself a coffee.

      Baby squalling out of sight.

      CLOSE ON - LAZARUS   Sweating, coiled, getting ready to 
      actually head shoot the guy but not knowing if he can take 
    him out before he squeezes one off into his wife...

      ...when the wife suddenly stuns everybody by grabbing the 
      muzzle of the shotgun with both hands and putting it to her 
      chest.

                                  ANNA
                          (screaming)

                    You won t stop drinking, you won t 
                    stop fighting them, and I just 
                    can t live like this! So kill me, 
                    kill yourself, let my sister take 
                    the baby! End it, just end it!

      Lazarus and Tonya are yelling to get his attention.

                                  ERIC
                    I ll do it!

                                  ANNA
                    Then do it!

    The baby still screaming in the other room.

                                  LAZARUS
                    Eric! Look at me! Look at me!

                                  ANNA
                    It s OK, Eric, just do it.                                                                                    49.

                    Trust me.

                                  LAZARUS
                    What?

                                  TONYA
                    Cover me.

                          (utterly confused)
                    What? Wait...
                          (then)
                    Hey Eric!

      Without a word Tonya explodes out of the living room and 
      charges to the baby s room, SLAMMING THE DOOR behind her.

      Lazarus still has his gun aimed at Eric; Eric has his gun 
      trained on his wife. He s banging on the baby s bedroom door 
    but he can t afford to look away from Lazarus.

                                  LAZARUS
                          (gun trained)
                    You look at me! You stay out of

                          (shouting through the 
                          door)
                    What are you doing! What s 
                    happening!

      Lazarus makes eye contact with a now hyperventilating Anna, 
      then...

                                  TONYA (O.S.)
                          (from behind the door)
                    Somebody call an ambulance for the 
                    baby!

    At that, Eric freaks and shoulders his way into the baby s 
      room where Tonya has been waiting for him out of his sight 
      lines and elbows him in the face, then grabs the barrels of 
    the shotgun, raising them high while bullinghim backwards 
      into the living room.

      Anna, ignoring them both, goes charging into the baby s room.

    ON ERIC AND TONYA   wrestling for the shotgun.

    ON LAZARUS   leaping in from behind, getting Eric face down 
    on the floor, the shotgun skittering across the room.

    ON TONYA   cuffing him.

    ON ANNA   running back in with the crying (but healthy) baby 
    in her arms. (It was a ruse on Tonya s part.)

                    BACKUP. And youtwo [White House,

                    like the Bickersons, got no focus 
                    out there except for each other. If 
                    you don't get it together, you re 
                    looking at transfers to separate 
                    boroughs. You[Kiterunner], you got 
                    way too big of a chip on your 
                    shoulder, unless you start cooling 
                    out, you're not gonnamake it on 
                    this job at all, and you[Lazarus], 
                    you let your partner just wander 
                    off, then you disobey a direct 
                    order by wandering off yourself? 
                    But you [Tonya], you are the 
                    greatest screw-up in this room, not 
                    only do you disobey a direct order, 
                    but you WALKED INTO A DOMESTIC ON 
                    YOUR OWN, ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS 
                    MISTAKES IN THE BOOK, you put your 
                    ownlife at risk, you put your 
                    partner'slife at risk, you put 
                    that woman'slife at risk.

                                  TONYA
                    Hey, I wasn't the one with the 
                    shotgun.

      Tonya talking back makes everyone flinch.

                                  YODA
                          (quietly)
                    I am one heartbeat away from 
                    telling you to clear out your 
                    locker.

      Tonya holds his stare, not backing down. You could hear a pin 
      drop.

    Our four male rookies are redressing into their civvies.                                                                                    54.

                    Anybody feel like throwing back a

                    So?

                    Too early for me, man.

                                  LAZARUS
                    Really? Just a beer.

                                  KENNY
                    See you tomorrow, bro.

      Lazarus watches the three young men exit, feeling his age.

                                  LAZARUS
                    If anybody changes their mind, I'll

                    You're going to start in on me all

                                  TONYA
                    No. You answer this. Why'dyou

      Yoda pulls the van over on a deserted sidestreet.

                          (softly)
                    You can't do that, Larry.

      They fall into a clinch, madly kissing and ripping each 
      other's clothes off, wrestling their way into the back seats.

                                  TONYA (CONT D)
                    You can't do that...

      Franchise, grim-faced, alone, ascending.

      Doors open on the eleventh floor.


      Franchise heading to apt 11G.

      Franchise knocks hard.

                    Open up.

      A long beat, then the door opens. Mo Bailey stares at him.                                                                                    58.


      FRANCHISE'S POV - APT. INTERIOR. On the dining table; a dozen

                    on the walk over.


      Crowded, sports on three TVs.

      Lazarus, writing in a notebook on the damp bar, has been 
      there for hours and he looks it. 

    He rises and heads through the loud room to the bathroom.


      Awful, super narrow, dingy.

      Lazarus enters. The stall is being used.

      Waiting, he stares at himself in the flecked mirror.

    The stall door opens up.

    And suddenly he's face to face with the Shannon Bar Stomper; 
    the guy is massive and undeniably himself from shaved head to 
      silver tipped boots.

      They stare at each other, reading each other's minds.

      Lazarus is off duty and high, without gun or radio. He is 
      scared.

    The Stomperknows Lazarus isn't going to do shit.

    The bathroom is so narrow that The Stomperbrushes Lazarus on 
    his way out the door.                                                                                    59.


      When they're chest to chest The Stomperlooks into Lazarus' 
      eyes and smiles.

    And then he's gone.

    ON LAZARUS - Punkedto the max.
