Sparks, noise, metal and grime. JOHN BLAZE (30s, ruggedly
handsome) is running late. He sprints across the workshop
floor, shedding his welder's kit as he heads for the time clock.
CLUNK! He punches out -- but LITTLE MIKE (50s, trailer trash
fast) has caught him in the act.
LITTLE MIKE
where do you chink you're going, Blaze?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
BLAZE
Sick, cutting out early.
LITTLE MIKE
The hell you are!
Blaze jumps on his bike - a muscular, battered BSA.
LITTLE MIKE (CONT'D)
Get back to work or your ass is fired!
BLAZE
Aaa n? You say that every time.
Blaze kicks-starts the bike. It ROARS thunderously.
LITTLE MIKE
(over the noise)
Well I mean it this time!
BLAZE
(gunning the throttle)
See you tomorrow, Little Mike!
The bike HOWLS, hauls up on its back wheel. Screams out the
shop leaving Little Mike holding his ears. The other workers
WHOOP and HOLLER, especially when Blaze snags a pair of BOLT-
CUTTERS from a passing tool rack on the fly.
CHUCK AND RITA SIMPSON (50s) are eating Chinese food with
their daughter, ROXANNE (20s) and Blaze. Roxanne is
beautiful, easygoing. She's also seven months pregnant.
The Simpsons are simple, working-class folk. Judging by the
strained atmosphere, it's evident that they don't care too
much for Blaze.
RITA
(TO CHUCK)
Hon, would you pass me the vegetables.
Chuck obliges, takes a drink of his beer, nods to Blaze.
CHUCK
So how're things going at the shop, John?
BLAZE
(scarfing down his food)
Good, good.
CHUCK
(not buying it)
Yeah? Cause Mike says you've been
slacking off, horsing around.
ROXANNE
(annoyed, protective)
DALD __
BLAZE
(ALL SMILES)
It's okay, Rox.
(CONTINUED)
S.
CONTINUED:
Blaze sets his fork down, wipes his mouth with his napkin.
Conjures up his best earnest look.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Truth is, Mr. Simpson, I've been thinking
about clearing out of there. Maybe
opening up a shop of my own --
Roxanne raises an eyebrow at this. News to her.
BLAZE (CONT' D)
See, I've been saving up. You know, for
the baby and all. And I--
DOORBELL. Roxanne rises to get it.
CHUCK
You were saying?
BLAZE
(distracted, looking to the
DOOR)
Right, so anyway --
ROXANNE (O. S . )
JOHN --
Blaze looks over. Two Sheriff's Deputies, LUCAS COLE and
RICK GEORGE, are standing in the doorway. Roxanne looks
pissed -- like this isn't the first time this has happened.
Blaze stands, approaches. Clearly, he knows them both.
BLAZE
(cocky, wary)
Lucas. Rick.
COLE
Johnny. We'd like you to come down the
station.
Their demeanor is hard. Won't take "no" for an answer.
BLAZE
(INSOLENT)
Can I finish eating?
Nope. Blaze squirms, feels Roxanne's eyes on him. He turns
to her, tries to explain.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Don't worry, hon. It's just routine --
ROXANNE
(TERSE)
It is by now. Just let me know if you're
staying overnight.
She goes back to her dinner.
CUT TO:
Blaze enters. The apartment is dark- TV flickers. Roxanne
is sleeping on the couch. On the coffee table: Chinese
leftovers, fortune cookies.
BLAZE
Hey.
She's sound asleep. He crouches, touches her face.
BLAZE (CONT' D)
Hey.
Roxanne barely stirs, deeply groggy.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Everything's cool.
ROXANNE
(SLURRED)
You're going to jail.
BLAZE
No. No. Everything's okay. Jed and
Murph just got a little boisterous at The
Prairie Dog last night. Cops wanted to
read us the riot act, that's all --
She yawns, curls up, starts to drift away again.
ROXANNE
I was worried about you. And I don't
like your friends.
But Blaze won't let her go back to sleep. He jostles her.
BLAZE
Listen, I want to show you something --
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ROXANNE
I'm sure you do. But I'm half-asleep and
you're an ass-hole.
BLAZE
I'm serious, Rox. This is important.
He drags her up off the couch. Makes her stand up. She
MOANS, scowls, but he gets her on her feet.
ROXANNE
John, I have to go to work tomorrow
BLAZE
(offers her coat)
Put your coat on. You'll be glad you
did. Promise. It'll be an adventure. A
mystery tour.
ROXANNE
This better be good.
She stomps to the bathroom. Blaze chuckles inwardly. Steals
a fortune cookie from the left-overs, snaps it open --
The fortune is blank. Both sides. He tosses it away.
CUT TO:
COYOTE EYES
glittering black, watching.
ROXANNE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
WHAM! Blaze enters, drenched from head to toe, frantic.
Roxanne's arms are filled with laundry.
BLAZE
We gotta go. Get your stuff together.
ROXANNE
What happened? What's wrong?
Roxanne follows Blaze into the bedroom.
ROXANNE (CONT'D)
What did you do?
BLAZE
I fucked up. The police are coming.
Grab your things. We have to go.
She sags, clearly been through this before. He tosses a
suitcase onto the bed, looks back at her.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Just do it, Rox!
FOLLOWING BLAZE
as he storms into the bathroom. Reaches behind the high
cistern, retrieves a hidden HANDGUN. He jumps down. Tears
the side panel off the old bath tub. There's a stack of FLAT
BLACK BOXES hidden within. Blaze drags them out, drops one -
It pops open, spilling UNCUT DIAMONDS all over the floor.
Blaze CURSES, struggles to gather up the loot.
ROXANNE (O.S.)
Jesus, Johnny --
ON ROXANNE
standing in the doorway. She sawit all.
Blaze climbs behind the wheel, guns the engine even before
Roxanne has buckled in. He gnashes into reverse, grinds the
car into a backwards spin --
11.
-- passing a POLICE CAR coming the other way. Roxanne
glances at Blaze, angry and disappointed.
Blaze struggles. The rain. The wipers. The fogging
windshield. It's a bad time to be Johnny Blaze.
BLAZE
Fuck.
BLAZE'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR POV:
The cop car is turning, heading back in their direction.
ROXANNE
JOHN --
Blaze floors the gas. The speedometer leaps.
Blaze fights to keep it together. The road ahead is
dangerously winding. Tires SQUEAL as he hauls a sketchy turn.
Roxanne gasps, fearful, bracing herself. The police are
gaining. FLASHING LIGHTS flood the interior.
ROXANNE
Slow down, John --
Another sketchy turn. Blaze spins the wheel, brakes, hard.
Too hard. The car hydroplanes, finds purchase --
ROXANNE (CONT ' D )
SLOW DOWN!
LIGHTNING flashes, and suddenly, there's a
COYOTE
or, the road, right in their path.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
Blaze jerks the wheel. Roxanne SCREAMS. The car skids,
slews off the road, CRASHES through a guard rail --
It plunges down a washout, flips end over end, shedding glass
and wreckage, finally SLAMMING to a dead stop at the bottom
of a rocky arroyo.
INSIDE THE EL CAMINO
Blaze stirs, blood streaming down his face. The windshield
is blown open. Rain pours in.
BLAZE
Roxanne --?
He struggles to free himself from his seat, SEES a torn seat
belt hanging beside him -- the passenger seat mr)ty.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Roxanne?!
ANGLE ON Blaze, grief-struck, handcuffed, thrashing about as
Troopers try cc restrain him.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
BLAZE
Get your fucking hands off me!
Lucas Cole, the deputy who questioned Blaze earlier,
approaches. Blaze SEES him and calms down a little.
BLAZE (CONY' D)
Please. Just let me see her.
Cole nods to his men, who ease up on Blaze. He guides Blaze
over to an observation window --
THEIR POV
Roxanne lays in a surgery bay, DOCTORS and NURSES milling
around her.
DOCTOR (O.S.)
Mr. Blaze --?
Blaze turns, SEES a nervous DOCTOR standing behind him.
BLAZE
Is she going to make it?
DOCTOR
(blinks, stutters)
Mr. Blaze, I --
BLAZE
)_a ch= going r4 make i r?
DOCTOR
We don't know. She's critical. Her
injuries are grave. There's a real
chance she won't --
BLAZE
What about the baby?
The doctor hesitates, glances at Cole.
DOCTOR
I'm so sorry. We did everything we
could.
Blaze's will shatters as the full realization of what he's
done slams into him. Tears sting his cheeks. Cole gives him
space. Whatever punishment awaits Blaze can't be any worse
than the hell he's living through now.
14.
CLOSE ON Roxanne, on life support, hooked up to an array of
monitors. Sleeping Beauty, still as death. Blaze sits
beside her bed. Handcuffed. Numb. Rain streams against a
nearby window. Tree limbs tap against the glass, like ghosts
scratching to get in.
TWO STATE TROOPERS stand guard at a respectable distance,
MURMURING to each other. Elsewhere --
BOOTS
walk purposefully on linoleum. Passing bay after bay.
Beyond the Troopers, SOMEONE is approaching, half seen
through layers of glass.
Blaze HEARS the footsteps, lifts his weary head. The shadow
keeps coming, half-glimpsed between partitions as it draws near.
THE ICU LIGHTS
flicker and weaken as if some unseen force were sapping their
intensity. Blaze glances at the machines. Still ticking --
AMBROSE STARKE ( 60S)
steps into view. Duster-coat. A wide-brimmed cowboy hat. A
smiling stone face. Blue eyes flecked with silver grey. He
steps between the Troopers. They keep talking, don't even
seem to notice him.
STARKE
You look like you could use some help.
Blaze glances at the troopers. They're still completely
unaware of Starke's presence. It's as if Starke and Blaze
have somehow stepped a split-second sideways in time.
The lights around them continue to dim. The second hand on
the wall clock stops. An eerie, dreamlike moment -- the wind,
the rain, the tree branches tapping against the window pane.
BLAZE
(LOST)
She's dying.
Starke nods, places a COIN in Blaze's palm.
STARKE
If I could help her, would you be willing
co make a deal?
(CONTINUED)
15,
CONTINUED:
Blaze looks at the coin -- gleaming, golden, embossed with a
soaring eagle on one side, a coyote on the obverse.
BLAZE
What kind of deal?
STARKE
She lives. You work for me.
Something about Starke's eyes. Commanding and haunting at
the same time.
BLAZE
What kind of work?
Starke just keeps smiling. Lays a comforting hand on Blaze's
shoulder as we drift towards Roxanne's beeping EEG.
WOMAN (V.O.)
When I was young, I was told that our
souls wander while we sleep. Sometimes
they get lost. Sometimes they never make
it back --
FADE TO BLACK:
SUPER TITLE: "FIVE YEARS LATER"
FADE IN on John Blaze as he switches on the light, looks in
the mirror. Those five years of work have taken their toll.
A haggard reflection gazes back at him, He stares. And
stares. Right into his pain.
WOMAN (V.O.)
-- but if they dQ return, they bring
messages. And I guess thhat's how the
dead speak to us -- in memories that may
be dreams, and dreams that feel like
memories.
Blaze turns off the light.
CUT TO:
The store is empty. The CLERK prices cigarette packs, eyes a
suspicious Native American woman, NOMI (30s), as she loads a
basket with basics. Nomi sets the basket down on the
counter. The clerk starts scanning the bar codes.
[ C ONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
CLERK
Just passing through?
Nomi nods, uneasy. She glances over her shoulder, searches
out her half-breed daughter --
RAIN (8) ,
who is sorting intently through a rack of cheap toys. The
kid is quiet, soulful, old beyond her years.
CLERK (CONT ` D )
Where you headed?
NOMI
(DISTRACTED)
What?
CLERK
Where are you headed? Late night, storm
like this --
NOMI
What do you care?
CLERK
(shrugging, defensive)
Just asking.
He keeps packing. But he knows she's trouble.
RAIN (O.S.)
I like this.
Nomi turns, SEES Rain clutching a toy -- a glow-in-the-dark
Halloween skeleton.
NOMI
It's too much, baby. Put it back. I
don't have enough money for that.
Rain stares right at Nomi -- and brazenly slips the doll into
her coat pocket. Nomi glances at the Clerk. He didn't notice.
Blaze sweeps aside a curtain, studies the slowly darkening
landscape outside with tired resignation.
WOMAN (V.0.)
-- and they spend the rest of their lives
trying to make up for it.
CLICK' Blaze Curns on the TV, watches a weather snippet.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
PAN OVER Blaze's belongings on the bureau -- a duffle bag,
old photographs of his previous life with Roxanne, a
collection of blank postcards. Tucked amidst the photos is a
sonogram featuring a ghostly image of an unborn child.
WEATHERMAN
-- scattered thunderstorms firing along a
stalled frontal boundary. Damaging
winds, hail, and isolated tornadoes will
be possible across the Dakotas and Upper
MIDWEST --
Blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies it. The map is
crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to city,
along with all sorts of arcane, personal notations. Blaze
traces his finger down to his present location: DEADFALL.
Nomi glances at Rain, who clutches her new skeleton toy.
NOMI
Seatbelt.
Rain dutifully fastens herself in.
NOMI (CONT'D)
Hey, bug. You hungry?
Rain shakes her head-
NOMI (CONT'D)
Want to listen to music?
(off Rain's sullen shrug)
Look, we won't have to keep moving around
forever, okay? I'll figure something
out. I promise.
Rain looks at her mother. She's heard it all before-
WHAM! Somebody rams the truck from behind. Rain SCREAMS.
Blaze reaches for a pack of cigarettes, lights a match. He
stares at the match flame for a moment -- for the flame is
behaving strangely, bending towards Blaze as if it were drawn
-o T>; m. Blaze shakes out the match, then retrieves --
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
THE COYOTE/EAGLE COIN
He stares at it ruefully, then places it on the map and sets
it spinning. We get the sense that this is a ritual he has
performed many times before. As we MOVE IN on the coin --
On Blaze, watching the coin with a growing sense of fatalism.
Spinning. Spinning. But starting to slow now --
EXT_ ROAD - DUSK
WHAM! The Bronco collides with Nomi's door again. Glass
shatters- Rain WAILS, terrified. Wind and rain rush in --
BLOWOUT! Front offside tire. Nomi loses it, careens right,
carves off the shoulder into a muddy culvert, SMASHING over
rocks, sagebrush, fence posts and barbed wire --
After a few dozen tortured yards, the pickup shudders to a
stop. The Bronco and the Tundra haul up nearby, engines
CHUGGING like hungry beasts.
IN THE PICKUP
Nomi angrily drags her seatbelt off, snatches a revolver from
the glove box. She looks to Rain:
NOMI
Stay here. And lock the doors.
Nomi climbs out into the rain, SLAMS the door. Rain works
the locks, but the driver's side is all bent up and twisted --
20.
On Blaze, watching the spinning coin. He shuts his eyes, as
if he could stave off what he knows is coming next. As if he
could contain the thing that is, even now, clawing its way
into his body from some dark circle of hell.
The coin slows. Blaze opens his eyes, a look of dread
washing over his face. He stares at his hands -- they're
shaking, emitting a HEAT HAZE.
The coin comes to a stop, coyote-side up.
Blaze SCREAMS, his body wracked with pain. He begins to
violently shake, his muscles twisting in unnatural
contortions. With a combustive WHOOSH his face abruptly
CATCHES FIRE and --
Graveyard shift but the floor is busy. Too many accidents,
too few staff. And the POLICE and PARAMEDICS hovering here
and there are just getting in the way.
ON BLAZE,
stumbling through the crowded ward, head down, in obvious
pain. OR. QUINLAN ( 30s, harried), struggles to keep up,
filling out paperwork on the fly.
QUINLAN
Sir, you have to tell me your name.
BLAZE
I just need to sit down for a moment.
And I need some forceps, gauze, tape --
QUINLAN
I'll decide what you need, alright?
Name?
Blaze hauls a curtain aside, finds an empty surgery bay,
prepped and ready to go.
27.
CONTINUED:
SHOUTING MEDICS tear past, pushing a SCREAMING BURN VICTIM on
a gurney. Blaze ducks into the curtained bay. Quinlan
follows.
QUINLAN (CONT'D)
Sir, I can't help you if you don't
cooperate.
(beat, pointedly)
Are you on something? Drugs?
Blaze pulls at his jacket, easing it over his battered body.
BLAZE
No, no. Do I look like troub-unghhh --
He grimaces as the jacket comes off. Bullet wounds, shotgun
damage, torn flesh, and a lot of BLOOD.
QUINLAN
(TAKEN ABACK)
Oh -- my. What happened to you?
Blaze sits back on the bed, sets about cleaning his wounds
with tools laid out on a tray nearby.
BLAZE
Motorcycle accident. Couple abrasions,
maybe some rib fractures --
(Quinlan tries to help)
Just step back, I'll handle it --
QUINLAN
Those are bullet holes.
Blaze cleans the wounds she's referring to, grits his teeth
as he swabs gauze deep into his flesh.
BLAZE
Nah. They're just -- gouges. Surface
damage. They'll heal up fine. Ungh -
do you have any -- painkillers?
QUINLAN
(assertive now, plainly
SUSPICIOUS)
This was no motorcycle accident.
Somebody has cauterized your wounds
Blaze inserts the forceps into a particularly nasty wound.
BLAZE
Percocet? Vicodin, maybe?
28,
CONTINUED: (2)
Blaze pulls a vicious shard of metal out of his side, stifles
a SCREAM, fights to keep it together.
BLAZE (CONT' D)
Just. Give. Me. Something. For. The.
Pain.
He staunches the blood, fixing her with such a stone stare
that she involuntarily backs away.
QUINLAN
I'm sorry -- but I need to report this.
Stay right there.
Quinlan backs out through the curtain. Blaze sighs, tapes a
thick gauze patch over the wound, eyes hunting. He SEES a
drug cabinet, breaks into it. Fills his pockets.
Moments later, Blaze is stumbling away. He pops the cap of a
pill bottle, dry-swallows a half-dozen painkillers --
To his right, a PARAMEDIC TEAM works on the shrieking burn
victim we saw earlier. Blaze stops, horrified --
It's FUSCO, eyes rolling wildly, charred nearly beyond
recognition. Flailing and convulsing, fingers nothing but
exposed, blackened bone --
ON BLAZE,
backing into a quiet corner. He suppresses a sob, fumbling a
hypodermic as he fills it with stolen morphine. He jabs the
spike into his leg, sags as the drug takes effect.
After a moment, Blaze calms, gets his bearings, notices that
he's leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned --
A WANTED POSTER,
helpfully illustrated with a mug-shot of Blaze's own face.
Blaze tears the poster down, stuffs it in his pocket, then
realizes that SOMEONE is watching him. He turns, SEES --
NOMI
sitting on a nearby bed. Beaten, bruised, desolate. A PAIR
OF STATE TROOPERS are questioning her. She stares past them,
straight at Blaze. She recognizes him.
(ICN-=NU_^)
29.
CONTINUED:
Ice water floods Blaze's veins. He hurries away.
CUT TO:
Dark, shadowy. Curtains drawn tightly shut. Every corner
crammed with bric-a-brac. On the TV: the football game.
Blaze sits on a collapsing couch. Nomi hovers nearby. Her
grandfather HENRI LAFORTE (80s, emphysemic), rambles on in
Dakotan, pausing only to suck on his oxygen mask. He keeps his
eyes on the game the whole time, never once looking at Blaze.
BLAZE
(aside, to Nomi)
Does your grandfather understand English?
(:,NT=NLE_-)
32,
CONTINUED:
NOMI
He understands. He just refuses to speak
it.
Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts,
impatient, finally sits forward.
BLAZE
Listen, I don't want to be an ass-hole,
but can we just fast-forward the whole
Yoda routine?
The home team scores! Laforte WHOOPS wildly, loses his mask,
COUGHS uncontrollably. Blaze stands. He's out of there.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Feel better, old man.
LAFORTE
(rasping, in English)
Give me the coin.
Blaze stops, cocks an eyebrow at Nomi. She shrugs. Blaze
hands over the coin. Laforte studies it, starts speaking in
Dakota again. Nomi translates:
NOMI
The man you're looking for goes by lots
of names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota,
he's Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look at
him straight on, you might see a human.
Look at him out of the corner of your eye
at one of the in-between times -- dusk or
dawn, you might see something else.
BLAZE
What does he want?
LAFORTE
Wacokico. Vengeance.
BLAZE
Why?
NOMI
Because it's his nature.
Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate.
NOM I (CONT' D )
Long ago, Coyote could change his shape,
chop his body into little pieces, causing
all sorts of mischief.
(MORE)
(coNT=NLE)
33.
CONTINUED: (2)
NOMI (CONT'D)
But Eagle, he had a clear eye. And he
saw Coyote for what he really was. So he
swooped down, scattered those pieces to
the winds.
(beat, drawing a breath)
The first men, they found the pieces, and
not knowing what they were, they ate
them. And that's, how all men came to
have a little piece of Coyote in their
hearts. Now Coyote, he'll promise
anything to get those pieces back.
There it is. Blaze exhales. He studies Laforte, those
ancient, wise eyes.
BLAZE
I've been looking for this man for five
years now, storm-chasing --
(pulls out his map)
Tracked him halfway across the country.
How do I make him lift the curse?
LAFORTE
Ta ocanzeke kin akta a'ikoyake. T'e
sniya kel rrrani. Takuni a'ikoyake sni
ya'un kte hantana, wocanzeke kin ekignaka

NOMI
My grandfather says you've been looking
in the wrong place. You need to look
inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke's
weapon. An extension of his rage. But
it can't ride people unless it has
something to latch onto in the first
place. You understand?
Blaze nods. He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back,
returns his attention to the game. But as Blaze starts to
rise, Laforte says one final thing:
LAFORTE
Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay?
Nomi pauses, deciding how to phrase what the old man said.
BLAZE
What? What'd he say?
NOMI
He wants to know if you're a bad man.
If the Ghost Rider turned its penance
stare on you, would you burn?
34.
Windows RATTLE. The storm HOWLS. A portly rental agent, JIM
PETROWSKY, is closing up shop. He gathers his papers, turns
out the lights. A TV on the counter is on:
WEATHERMAN
-- experiencing extraordinary conditions.
Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas,
with reports of extensive damage and
gusts of up to seventy miles per hour --
As Pecrowsky turns off the TV, we hear the door CHIME.
Starke enters, bringing a strong gust of wind with him.
PETROWSKY
Sorry, guy, I'm just closing up.
Starke looks to a clock on the wall -- it's 4:55.
STARKE
According to the hours posted outside,
you're still open.
{_.:D, NT7NI,=D)
37.

PETROWSKY
(EXASPERATED)
Look, Mister, in case you hadn't noticed,
there's a storm coming -- tornadoes,
whatever. I'm trying to get out of here.
Starke fixes Petrowsky with a stern gaze.
STARKE
I would like to rent a car --
(reading Petrowsky's name tag)
-- "Jim" .
Something in Starke's tone gives Petrowsky pause. He glances
to the window and the growing storm beyond. We SEE the
coyote out there, watching from across the way.
PETROWSKY
(RELENTING)
Okay, alright, have a seat.
Starke sits. Petrowsky moves behind his desk.
PETROWSKY (CONT'D)
Now, Mr. --?
STARKE
Starke. First name, Ambrose.
PETROWSKY
(typing in the name)
Starke, okay. What kind of car were you
looking for?
Starke picks up a laminated placard featuring various cars.
STARKE
What about the Cadillac Deville? I
noticed you had one in your lot outside.
PETROWSKY
Sorry, already spoken for. How `bout a
full-size car? I can give you a Chevy
Malibu, Ford Taurus --
Starke deliberates. Outside, the storm seems to grow
stronger. Petrowsky shifts in his seat, trying to mask his
impatience. Were he observant enough, he might also notice
that the wall clock has stopped.
(C: VT=`7:,'-')
38.
CONTINUED: (2)
PETROWSKY (CONT' D)
You want the Taurus? Give you a good
deal, mid-size price. $37.99 a day,
can't beat that.
STARKE
I had my heart set on the Cadillac, Jim.
PETROWSKY
(ANNOYED NOW)
Caddy's taken. Now look, I'm trying to
be accommodating here, but I really am in
a hurry. So what's it going to be?
Another beat as Starke stares Petrowsky down. Gradually, the
lights in the office begin to dim.
STARKE
The Taurus, then.
PETROWSKY
Great. Can I see a driver's license?
Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license.
Petrowsky types in the required information, trying to ignore
the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him.
PETROWSKY (CONT' D )
How many days do you need it for?
STARKE
Two, three --
PETROWSKY
Any other drivers?
STARKE
No.
PETROWSKY
And you'll be paying by --?
STARKE
Cash.
PETROWSKY
I'll need a three hundred dollar deposit.
Starke nods, removing a money clip from his jacket, deftly
sliding out three crisp, brand-new hundred dollar bills.
( CO N TI N U E D /)
39.
CONTINUED: (3)
PETROWSKY (CONT' D )
What about refueling?
(off Starke' s look)
We've got three options. You can
purchase a full tank in advance, you can
fill it up yourself before you return it,
or you can have us do it, but then we
have to charge you four dollars a gallon.
Most people go for the tank in advance.
Less hassle.
STARKE
I'll do it myself.
PETROWSKY
Okey-dokey.
Petrowsky enters the final data, hits "PRINT". As the rental
agreement begins feeding out, we hear a HORN FiONK.
Starke turns. A mini-van has pulled up outside. A MOUSY
WOMAN sits behind the wheel. A BOY sits in the back seat.
The coyote is still there, but it pays no attention to them.
STARKE
Mrs. Petrowsky?
PETROWSKY
Yeah.
Petrowsky slides the agreement to Starke, takes out a pen:
PETROWSKY (CONT' D)
Here you go. Just your standard rental
agreement. You get up to 150 miles a day
for free, twenty cents a mile after that.
If you want additional personal accident
insurance it's five dollars a day,
another nine-ninety-nine if you want the
loss/damage waiver. Your basic rental
rate, plus applicable state and local
tax. You just need to initial here,
here, and here --
(indicating various items)
-- and give me your John Hancock on the
line right here.
Petrowsky offers Starke a pen. He doesn't take it. Instead,
he pulls out a pair of bifocals. With agonizing slowness,
Starke begins to peruse the rental agreement.
PETROWSKY (CONT' D)
Is there a o oblem --?
40.
CONTINUED : (4)
STARKE
The price you quoted was $37,99, the mid-
size rate. But you've listed the daily
rate here as $62.99.
PETROWSKY
I did?
Starke turns the agreement around for Petrowsky to see.
PETROWSKY (CONT'D)
Geez, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right.
That's the Caddy rate. Guess I entered
it in by mistake --
Starke looks up at Petrowsky over the rim of his bifocals,
the timbre of his voice taking on a decidedly frigid turn.
STARKE
Were you trying to cheat me, Jim?
PETROWSKY
No, no, not at all --
STARKE
Then I'd like a new contract specifying
the appropriate rate.
Petrowsky squirms, uncomfortable. For in that pregnant
moment, without either participant uttering at word, the
entire nature of the transaction seems to have changed.
PETROWSKY
Look, can't we just go with the contract
we've got here? I'll make a note of it
and knock a day's rental off the total
when you return it. What do you say?
STARKE
I say the Devil's in the details.
Carrigan drives. Landsdale rides shotgun, dozing. Odell is
in back with Rain, her hands tightly bound. She keeps to
herself, clutching her skeleton doll, stares out at the
passing landscape. Odell offers her a bag of chips.
ODELL
Want some food, kid?
Rain doesn't respond. Odell rustles the bag.
ODELL (CONT'D)
C'mon. Eat a chip or something.
CARRIGAN
She's not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up
and get some sleep.
ODELL
I can't sleep. Every time I close my
eyes, I see the face of that thing, Lloyd
BURNING --
(shaking his head)
-- Christ.
CARRIGAN
Just put it out of your head.
ODELL
If I could put it out of my head, I
wouldn't be awake now, would I?
Landsdale stirs. Carrigan gestures at the barren landscape.
CARRIGAN
Look out there, what do you see?
LANDSDALE
Dick.
CARRIGAN
That's right. Miles and miles of
nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit
running around in that nothing. How many
people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten?
Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn
paper at the supermarket. You believe
that shit, the whole country's being
overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers.

LANDSDALE
(nodding, eyes closed)
Probe you in the ass, they get the
chance.
ODELL
What's your point, Mr. Serling?
CARRIGAN
My point is; everybody's seen somethina.
Ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot, whatever --
ODELL
This wasn't no freaking Bigfoot! You see
what it did to Albright? Punched his
head clean off!
CARRIGAN
Look, I don't know what that thing was.
All I know is, Starke's paying us a butt-
load of money to deliver the kid to him.
We were told we'd see things and we were
told to look the other way. You want to
cut out? I'll pull over right here.
LANDSDALE
Keep your shirt on, B. We didn't come
this far just to limp home with nothing.
Right, Odell?
Odell settles back into his seat, uneasy.
ODELL
I guess. But I'd still like to know what
that thing was.
RAIN
He's the Ghost Rider.
Everybody looks at her. It's the first thing she's said.
CARRIGAN
(CHUCKLING)
"The Ghost Rider"? Get that off the back
of an Oakridge Boys album or something?
You think that shit scares me?
RAIN
It should. He's going to kill you all.
ODELL
(FREAKING OUT)
See? SiE? !

ODELL (CONT' D)
That's what I'm talking about! Fucking
Chatty Cathy sitting back here with me!
Carrigan glances in the rear-view mirror, makes eye-contact
with Rain, does his level-best not to be spooked.
CUT TO:
A chiming CACOPHONY. Acres of penny slots and video poker.
Roulette wheels CLATTERING. Blackjack tables spinning.
Blaze and Nomi weave their way through the maze.
BLAZE
Your husband used to work here?
NOMI
Billy-Ray dealt blackjack, poker. Worked
the casino circuit. We met in Vegas.
Things kind of went downhill after that.
RODENBURG (O.S.)
Got a lot of nerve showing your face here
again.
46.
CONTINUED:
They turn. Chief of Security, VINCE RODENBURG (30s, full--or-
himself), storms towards them, flanked by TWO SECURITY GOONS.
NOMI
Believe me, Vince, this is the last place
I want to be. But we need to find Billy-
Ray. He took Rain.
RODENBURG
Sorry' The Deal Man hasn't been back in
weeks.
(gesturing for them to leave)
You have a nice day now.
NOMI
But you must've talked to him. Do you
know where he's headed? Just tell me
that.
RODENBURG
What am I? His babysitter? I don't know
where he is, Nome, and if I did, I sure
as hell wouldn't be telling you.
(looking to the other guards)
Show these two ass-holes to the door.
BLAZE
Look, this is important. We're talking
about a kidnapping.
RODENBURG
(sizing Blaze up)
We are? And who is ?
BLAZE
I'm just a friend.
RODENBURG
Ri h t. Nomi tell you what a blue ribbon
slut she was? Do anything to support
that needle habit of hers. Truth, 'bout
the only person that hasn't had her
around here is me.
Blaze steps forward now, angry, threatening.
BLAZE
That's enough.
RO DENBURG
What, you gonna get all Steven Segal on
me, tough guy? Pull a fucking Glimmer
Man?
47.
CONTINUED: (2)
Blaze moves, twists Rodenburg's arm like rope, wrenches his
thumb backwards, SLAMS Rodenburg face-first into one of those
Plexiglas booths where people dive for dollars.
The goons pull their pieces. Blaze just ups the pain.
RODENBURG (CONT'D)
-w-w--wait!! !
(in agony, grimacing)
--oh, fuck, just wait a second --
The goons hesitate. CUSTOMERS stare. Blaze seethes.
BLAZE
I need you to understand something,
Vince. I am, by nature, an inherently
violent man and there's not much in the
way of bad that I haven't already
inflicted on this miserable world --
(applying even more pressure)
So unless the idea of learning to drive a
wheelchair with your mouth sounds
appealing, I suggest you apologize to my
friend and tell us WHERE THE FUCK BILLY-
RAY IS HEADED!
RODENBURG
I don't know! I don't know --
Blaze gives Rodenburg's thumb a savage twist.
RODENBURG (CONT'D)
Arrrghh! H-he was -- ngh -- up at their
old house, last night!
BLAZE
And?
RODENBURG
And I'm sorry -- I'm fucking sorry!
Blaze releases him. As the goons close in, Blaze deftly
relieving Goon #1 of his handgun and turns it back on him.
BLAZE
Think about it.
The goons relent. Blaze and Nomi exit, leaving Rodenburg
slumped on the floor, cradling his mangled hand.
CUT TO:
48.
Window panes RATTLE. The lights don't work. Blaze and Nomi
pick their way through food containers and discarded detritus.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Guess the boys camped out for a while.
THE LIVING ROOM
Dead leaves twirling. One whole side of the room is burned
open, blackened and charred, the remaining timbers sealed
with plastic sheeting. Nomi opens a drawer, rifles through
singed papers -- finds an old PHOTO of her and Carrigan.
NOMI
Listen, those things Vince said --
BLAZE
You don't have to explain yourself to me.
NOMI
Some of them are true.
BLAZE
Doesn't make you a bad person.
49.
CONTINUED:
Nomi nods, but she's clearly agitated. Blaze crouches,
traces his fingers over a stain on the wall. He can FEEL
something. He shuts his eyes, opens them --
BLAZE'S POV (THE PAST)
The room, many years earlier. Carrigan backhands Nomi across
the face. The silent moment is caught in motion so slow it's
virtually a tableau.
BACK TO THE PRESENT
BLAZE (CONT'D)
He used to hit you.
A statement, not a question. She nods.
Nomi is reluctant to enter. Blaze is inside, SEES her
hesitation -- she's staring at the bed.
NOMI
You can see the past?
BLAZE
Just echoes, sometimes.
(BEAT)
Tell me about Starke.
Nomi hesitates, not wanting to relive this.
NOMI
I was dying. I'd shot myself full of
Billy's best gear. Figured I'd teach him
a lesson and go out in style.
Blaze nods, but he doesn't see Nomi now. He SEES --
BLAZE'S POV (THE PAST)
-- Nomi as she waS. An inch away from eternity. She is
lying on the bed, staring upwards, shallow breaths- Above
her, a MOTH flutters by a light, casting distorted shadows.
BLAZE (V.O.)
But it felt like a mistake.
NOMI ON THE BED
(WHISPERS)
I don't want to die.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
The lights begin to dim. We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching,
muted and distorted, A SHADOW falls across Nomi --
STARKE
stands above her. There are OTHER SHADOWS drifting in behind
him. Things better left half-glimpsed. Coyotes. Beasts.
NOMI (V.O.)
He smiled and said --
As Starke starts to speak, we hear:
BLAZE'S VOICE
"You look like --
BACK TO THE PRESENT
Blaze finishing the phrase, knowing the punch-line too well.
BLAZE
-- you could use some help."
Nomi nods, hugs herself.
NOMI
And I took it. What else was I going to
do? I don't know what happened after
that. I'm not sure I ever want to --
(beat, struggling)
All I know is, nine months later, Rain
was born.
FLASHBACK IMAGES
Silent, disjointed. The moth. Nomi's face, terror-stricken.
Starke, eyes alight with malice and mischief.
BACK TO THE PRESENT
Nomi turns away, trying to banish the memory.
NOMI (CONT'D)
Billy-Ray hated her from the moment she
was born. He knew she wasn't his, knew
she was different --
(re: the charred timbers)
If I didn't leave he would've killed us
both.
(CCNTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED: (2)
FLASHBACK IMAGES
Nomi striking back at Billy-Ray with a broken bottle.
Setting the house ablaze.
BACK TO THE PRESENT
Nomi pulls out a cigarette, nervously lights it.
NOMI (CONT'D)
Been running ever since. In my heart, I
guess I knew Starke would be coming for
her one day.
BLAZE
Why send Billy-Ray after you?
NOMI
Sick irony, I guess. Billy certainly
knew all my haunts --
(shaking her head)
This was a mistake, Blaze. We're not
going to find anything here.
Blaze glances down -- a HEAT HAZE has engulfed his hand. He
clenches his fist, looks up --
BLAZE
Guess again.
-- as HEADLIGHTS shine through one of the windows.
Somebody's driving up to the house.
Blaze and Nomi creep towards the front door. A handful of
vehicles are pulling up out front. The men disembark. It's
Rodenburg, finger splinted, packing heat. He's returned with
reinforcements: OSWALT, DOYLE, WEINGROD and PENNEBAKER.
Blaze and Nomi make their way to the laundry room and the
rear entrance -- but Doyle and Oswalt have already circled
around back.
NOMI
(WHISPERING)
Shit, they've got us trapped here.
BLAZE
(FATALISTIC)
No. they're the one who are rang d.
Blaze reaches for the door handle, opens it --
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
NOMI
What're you --?
Nomi runs -- but Weingrod DIVES through the plastic sheeting
in the hall, cutting her off. He SLAMS her against the wall,
twisting her arm behind her back.
Rodenburg appears behind them. Together, he and Pennebaker
drag Nomi towards the bedroom. They shove Nomi onto the bed.
RODENBURG
Had to come back here, didn't you, Nomi?
Just couldn't leave well enough alone.
Nomi struggles to sit up. Rodenburg LAUGHS viciously, forces
her back, drags at her jeans.
Rodenburg stops mid-assault. Nomi breathes fearfully, held
down at gunpoint by Pennebaker. We hear SCREAMS, the
WHISTLING WIND, the CRACKLE OF FIRE.
Doyle rushes in from the porch, looks back --
Blaze keeps on coming, unstoppable. He steps/burns his way
through the screen door, leaves a trail of BURNING FOOTPRINTS
in his wake. As he walks down the hall, the heat streaming
off of him blisters and curls the wallpaper.
Doyle backs away, stumbles -- and Blaze is upon him, lifting
Doyle up, gripping him by the throat.
DOYLE
P-PLEASE --
BLAZE
I'm sorry.
soul, the fire expanding, engulfing Doyle.
Rodenburg buckles his pants, goes to the doorway, peers
cautiously into the passage beyond.
RODENBURG'S POV:
Flaming leaves burn and twirl at the far end. Firelight
flickers. The SCREAMS still come, sporadic and terrible.
Rodenburg's mind is racing. He motions to Pennebaker, who
drags Nomi off the bed and strong-arms her to the door.
54.
Rodenburg leads, gun ready.
RODENBURG
Doyle?
Smoke and CRACKLING NOISES are building rapidly. The SHRIEKS
persist, and those burning leaves are everywhere. Then --
--- movement in the living room! Rodenburg draws a bead
but it's Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting,
fearful, eyes darting. He speaks in a strained whisper.
WEINGROD
What's going on, man? Where's Oswalt?
GUNFIRE! Outside! CRASH! Something hits the house. Then
more SCREAMS, more GUNFIRE, and a RUMBLE so deep it's deadly.
Pennebaker panics, pushing past Rodenburg.
PENNEBAKER
I want out of here, I'm getting out!
RODENBURG
Keep your fucking voices down!
WEINGROD
He's burning the house, man! He's
BURNING THE--
RED-HOT CHAINS whip viciously around Weingrod's head and
torso. Then he's wrenched backwards, hauled straight through
the plastic sheeting --
THE GHOST RIDER
bursts through the melting plastic, hauls his red-hot monster
bike up on its back wheel --
Rodenburg and Pennebaker run for their lives, falling into
the fire-lit passage. The Ghost Rider screeches across the
living room, setting the place aflame as he passes through.
Nomi leaps aside as a sheet of fire burns where she was, SEES
the fiery monster crash straight through the wall --
Rodenburg and Pennebaker run through the flames, stumbling
over Doyle's charred body --
55.
Blaze sits in a chair, shirt off, Nomi at his side. She's
trying to help him patch up his wounds, but the enormity of
the damage and the sheer amount of blood is daunting.
NOMI
I don't -- I don't know what else to do
for you --
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
BLAZE
S'okay -- just need to rest now --
(GASPING)
-- wounds'11 be healed by morning.
Nomi stands, still shaken. She retrieves a cigarette from
her purse, lights it.
NOMI
I thought you were dead.
BLAZE
(considering his wounds)
I don't even know if it's that's an
option anymore. Every time I get close,
I feel myself being dragged back --
(breathing through the pain)
--it's like being born all over again.
Like every law in the universe is being
broken.
Blaze sits forward, gritting his teeth against the pain.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
See, the Ghost Rider -- it's drawn to
darkness like a bloodhound. If it thinks
you've sinned, it'll find you.
NOMI
What if you're innocent?
BLAZE
Nobody's innocent.
(beat, staring at her)
Think about it. Everyone's done
somethincr. You. Me --
Blaze lifts up the coyote coin, flipping it over his fingers.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Every night I spin this fucking coin --
and it always lands the same side up. I
keep thinking -- ona time, one time I'm
going to spin it and I'll see the other
face. Sleep through the night without
getting blood on my hands. But it never
happens.
(SHAKING)
There's always some sad motherfucker out
there that needs retribution, vengeance --
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED: (2)
Blaze flings the coin away in disgust. It spins, wobbles,
lands coyote side up. He laughs tiredly, then looks away,
lost, suddenly overcome with emotion.
BLAZE (CONT' D)
I'm just so fucking tired --
Nomi moves to his side, struggles to help him up.
NOMI
Here, why don't you lie down for a little
while?
Blaze nods, too tired to argue. Nomi half carries him to the
bed, lowers him down. Blaze settles back, exhausted. Nomi
watches him, holding vigil. His eyes grow heavy. He shuts
them a moment, opens them again --
THE PAST
-- and it's Roxanne who is laying beside him now. She rolls
over to face him, smiles sleepily. Blaze reaches for her,
touches her face -- and the moment shatters into violence.
A COLLISION OF IMAGES
-- the El Camino sliding, spinning over. Metal rending.
-- rain pattering on broken, bloody wreckage. Roxanne's torn
seat belt hanging loosely.
-- climbing out through the blown-out windshield. Crawling
in mud, Blaze's face reflected in broken glass.
-- cradling Roxanne's body in his arms, rocking her and --
THE PRESENT
WHAM! Blaze bolts up in bed, disoriented, shaken. Clearly,
some time has passed.
Nomi sits across the room now, holding Blaze's tattered
photographs in her hands, looking a little guilty. She's got
the paper wedding band which Blaze made for Roxanne too.'
BLAZE
What are you doing?
NOMI
I'm sorry, I just --
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED: ( 3)
As Blaze stands, we SEE that his wounds have healed.-He
shrugs on a shirt, approaches. Nomi nods to the paper
wedding band.
NOMI (CONT'D)
You must've loved her a lot.
Blaze doesn't answer. Just takes the photos and wedding band
from her, shoves them back in his pack. He pulls out one of
the postcards, scribbles an address on it.
BLAZE
What time is it?
NOMI
A little after three.
BLAZE
What time, exactly?
NOMI
3:27. Why?
Blaze ignores her, jots down the time. Licks a stamp and
puts it on the postcard. Leaves it on the dresser.
NOMI (CONT'D)
What is it with you and those postcards,
anyway?
BLAZE
They're just a kind of record.
(hauling up his pack)
Let's go.
Blaze and Nomi drive. Outside, the landscape passes, bugs
twirling and spattering against the windshield like
snowflakes.
MEMORY FLASHES
Roxanne in the hospital, serene and beautiful. Starke
handing Blaze the coin.
NOMI
You made a deal.
Blaze nods.
NOMI (CONT'D)
So what happened? Did she live?
(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:
BLAZE
Roxanne? Yeah, she's alive. She just
doesn't know it.
(off Nomi' s look)
Coma. Probably never wake up.
NOMI
So he tricked you.
BLAZE
(a tired laugh)
That's what he does, doesn't he?
She nods. That's what he does.
NOMI
(almost afraid to ask)
What about the baby?
Blaze just shakes his head.
BLAZE
It's funny. That kid was supposed to be
my second chance. Rox and I used to talk
about it -- how things'd be different
after she was born.
Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability.
NOMI
Maybe that's why we have them
BLAZE
What, kids?
NOMI
(NODDING)
So we can make amends for all the royal
fuck-ups we've perpetrated on the world.
God knows I've had my share.
(beat, pained)
I just don't want her to have to pay for
the things I've done. You know?
Blaze nods. He knows all too well. He and Nomi drive on in
silence for a beat, their thoughts turning inwards.
NOMI (CONT'D)
Can I ask you something? Honestly?
(off Blaze's nod)
What're you going to do when you find
Starke?
(CONTINUED)
61.
CONTINUED: (2)
BLAZE
Make him pay, somehow --
(UNCERTAIN)
I don't know. How do you beat the Devil?
Walk up and bitch-slap him? Pretend
you're Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka
up his hind ass? I'm basically making
this up as I go along.
Nomi smiles.
NOMI
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
CUT TO:
-- Rain looking out through the truck's moon roof, watching
stars passing overhead. As the sky above slowly brightens in
time-lapse, Rain's eyes grow lidded. She sleeps, clutching
her skeleton toy and --
-- waking sunlight floods the cabin. New shift. Odell
drives. Rain rides shotgun. Carrigan and Landsdale are
sacked out in back. The radio drones, laced with STATIC.
Tedium. No one slept well. Carrigan stares out at the
passing plains, expertly cutting a deck of cards one-handed.
He SEES a scarecrow go by, standing ragged in the middle of
nowhere. Then his cell phone RINGS. Carrigan flips it open --
CARRIGAN
Yeah?
Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good. He
sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an eyebrow.
CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
Rodenburg's dead. Oswalt, Weingrod, all
those other inbred losers too.
(off Landsdale's look)
Looks like my ex-bitch has hooked up with
the fire guy --
In the rear-view mirror, Odell's eyes grow wide.
ODELL
No fucking way --
Carrigan ponders, nods to Landsdale.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
CARRIGAN
We're going to need reinforcements, some
kind of escort to the meet.
LANDSDALE
I know a guy. Got some boys given over
to wickedness and such.
CARRIGAN
(tosses him the phone)
Make the call.
RAIN (0.5.)
He'll find me, you know.
Her voice makes Odell jump. He thought she was asleep
ODELL
(fretful, pleading)
BILLY-RAY --
CARRIGAN
(to Rain, leans forwards)
Hey, kiddo, you're worrying my boy here.
So shut your goddamn mouth --
RAIN
You can't tell me what to do. You're not
my father.
Wow. The truck collectively holds its breath. Carrigan
settles back, but he's pissed.
CARRIGAN
You better believe that, sweetheart. I'm
just the dumb-ass that financed your
whole fucking life. You and your mother
both. And what did I get for that
selfless act of stupidity? She burned
down the house and gave me something to
remember her by.
He's referring to the scar under his eye. Rain turns away.
Huddles against the door.
LANDSDALE
Believe me, I could care less what Starke
wants with you. Make you into a fucking
hood ornament if he wants to. It's not
like you came springing out of my loins.
Only thing I care about now is getting
what's mine, and that's --

LANDSDALE (CONT'D)
(counting on his fingers)
-- payment and retribution, got it?
She's not listening. Her bound hands are secretly pushed
down into the tight gap between the seat and the door.
ON RAIN'S FINGERS
extending towards A PEN, one inch out of reach, caught
between the seat mechanism and the door sill.
RAIN'S EYES
are fluttering. Extreme concentration.
THE PEN
levitates, tilts into her outstretched hands.
The RADIO squeals painfully, pure strident STATIC. Odell
punches a new station, but the STATIC continues, grows --
Rain ATTACKS, stabbing the pen into Odell's thigh. He
SCREAMS, slams the brakes, loses control of the truck --
Arlo enters, accompanied by the Pulsifer Brothers. Carrigan
and Landsdale are waiting to meet them.
ARLO
So you need some contract work?
CARRIGAN
An escort. We're making a delivery first
thing tomorrow morning.
ARLO
And will there be mayhem involved?
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
CARRIGAN
Yeah, I'd say a certain amount of hijinx
are likely to ensue.
Arlo takes out a nail clipper, starts trimming his fingernails.
ARLO
Well, I'll tell you, I got nineteen
brothers out there willing to go the
distance and enough firepower to give a
small Balkan nation a fucking titty-
twister. But we don't come cheap. So
how many men we going up against?
CARRIGAN
One.
Arlo looks at Carrigan, incredulous.
ARLO
One man?
CARRIGAN
One man.
ARLO
You trying to diddle my nutpurse, Mister?
CARRIGAN
Absolutely not. Lemme clarify things --
70.
Blaze sidles down the hallway, moving as quietly as he can.
We can HEAR the men talking in the office just next door.
CARRIGAN (O.S.)
See, this guy's not really a "guy". He's
more like a demon or something.
ARLO (0. S.)
A demon?
CARRIGAN (O.S.)
That's right.
ARLO (O.S.)
What, exactly, do you mean by demon?
Blaze winces, lifting a hand before his face -- BLUE FLAMES
dance over his fingertips. He leans against the wall for
support. When he removes his hand, he leaves a singed palm-
print on the drywall.
Arlo puts the clipper away, starts arranging the fingernails
on the desk before him into a neat little pile.
CARRIGAN
Like his head's on fire and shit.
Arlo LAUGHS, the Pulsifers follow suit. Then Arlo turns to
Landsdale, icy now.
ARLO
Brotherman, what in fuck's name is this
smooth faggot talking about?
Blaze exhales a wisp of BLUE FLAME, totally enveloped in a
bubble of heat. More than anything, he wants to step inside,
fully aflame. But he forces himself to simply take a peek --
BLAZE'S POV;
The room, the men -- but no Rain.
LANDS DALE
He's telling the truth, Arlo. The guy
ain't human. Saw him torch Albright and
Chudacoff with my own eyes.

71.
- CONTINUED:
BACK IN CORRIDOR
Blaze presses against the wall, desperately trying to rein
the Ghost Rider in -- but FOOTSTEPS are coming. A Gargoyle
is round; c the corner!
Gunt rips open his shirt, shows a chest covered in tattoos.
GUNT
Well, I say bring him on. You see this
ink? That's a hundred hours under the
needle. A motherfucking canvas of pain.
He and Chester here, we're not afraid of
fuck-diddly!
The Gargoyle passes the doorway, lights up a smoke. Or tries
to. The flame from his Zippo is bending sideways. He tries
a couple more times. Same thing. Weird.
ON BLAZE
hidden in a dark alcove, struggling to contain himself. If
the Gargoyle turns he will surely see him.
The Gargoyle studies the flame, then notices an OPEN WINDOW
nearby. He shuts it, lights his cigarette, turns back -- b=
Blaze has moved on.
Arlo settles back in his chair.
ARLO
If this guy's as lethal as you say he is,
I want fifty for me, another fifty for the
club. Only you can't let the boys know
we're takin' a 50K rake off the top, see?
CARRIGAN
How `bout sixty and I'll throw in a kilo
of coke?
ARLO
(INCREDULOUS)
Coke? That's like selling snow to
Eskimos. You think I'm some kind of
crack-smoking foolio or something?
(CONTINUED)
72.

CARRIGAN
(SIGHING)
Seventy, then.
Arlo reaches into his shoulder-holster, whipping out a mean
looking nickel-plated Colt 44 Anaconda.
ARLO
Ninety, and not a nickel less, you
fucking pillow-biter.
Blaze continues, agitated. Where the fuck is the kid? He
looks through a doorway, SEES --
TEN OR MORE
brutish gargoyles drinking beer and cleaning their weapons.
Blaze drops back. His snarling face contorts, starts to
assume that awful skullish quality. The Ghost Rider wants
out. mow. But Blaze fights, shoves it back down and deep.
SOMETHING moves to Blaze's right -- a TINY WHITE FIGURE,
lolling and flopping at the far end of the passage.
Carrigan grins, trying to calm the situation.
CARRIGAN
E a sy, gentlemen. No need to get all
truculent on me.
ARLO
Truculent? You get that out of a
Scrabble dictionary or something? What
the fuck does "truculent" mean?
(grabbing Carrigan by his shirt)
I'll tell you what it means. It means
FUCK YOU!
73.
Blaze stares, hypnotised, his face flickering from skull to
flesh and back again. The tiny figure is Rain's SKELETON
DOLL, held upright, unsteady, by some unseen force.
THAT MOMENT, ELSEWHERE - RAIN'S FACE
Extreme mental concentration. Temples pounding. Her eyes
are fluttering, rolled to white.
BACK TO BLAZE
as he starts towards the toy skeleton. He's in agony now,
each breath a cough of fire, each footstep igniting the
floorboards. He SEES a storage room up ahead --
Carrigan smiles, seemingly unruffled by the gun.
CARRIGAN
Okay, alright -- how about seventy-five
and we'll smoke the old peace pipe?
ARLO
(cocking the Anaconda)
How `bout eighty or you're gonna be
smoking my dick?
Blaze enters, SEES Rain. He extends a hand to her -- and
Odell steps out from behind the door where he'd been hiding,
shotgun in hand.
BLAZE
Shit.
-- and we hear a high-pitched BEEPING. Arlo turns.
ARLO
What is that?
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:
CHESTER
(LISTENING)
Sounds like a smoke alarm.
GLINT
(wrinkling his noise)
Smells like somethin's burning.
CARRIGAN
What-is this, fucking charades?! It's
h,jM, you- ass-holes !
Carrigan and the others race out into the corridor even as
Odell rushes from the storage room, a WAVE OF FIRE on his
heels.
THE GHOST RIDER
emerges seconds later, Rain cradled in the crook of his arm,
safe in a cool bubble of air. She looks to Carrigan. The
meaning in her gaze is implicit: "I told you so".
GARGOYLES
appear from every direction. Guns BLAZE. Bullets turn-to
slag, vaporizing as they enter the Ghost Rider's aura of
hellfire.
Rain drops from the Ghost Rider's arm, runs. The Ghost Rider
advances. The Gargoyle nearest him empties a machine pistol
into the Ghost Rider. The Ghost Rider reaches for the
weapon. At his touch, the pistol becomes RED HOT --
The Gargoyle CRIES OUT. The Ghost Rider takes the pistol, and
FIRES BACK. The Gargoyles stumble, clawing at their smoking
wounds. In seconds, the entire weapon turns WHITE HOT, melting
apart in the demon's hand, SIZZLING away into nothing --
The Ghost Rider keeps coming. Men are SMASHED aside,
incinerated. Bravado turns to terror, to chaotic scramble --
75.
A juggernaut trajectory crashing through wall after blazing
wall. The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, HURLS Gunt to the
floor. Senses SOMEONE behind him --
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER,
blasting the Ghost Rider's head. The Ghost Rider SQUEALS
and for a split-second, the demon's flames are actually
snuffed out. The cloud clears. The Ghost Rider glimpses
ODELL
rushing into another room, SLAMMING a steel door behind.
Odell pauses in the darkness, hyperventilating. Outside, we
hear the heavy FOOTFALLS of the Ghost Rider approaching.
The Ghost Rider places a skeletal hand against the steel
door. His hand GLOWS WHITE HOT, like an acetylene torch.
The steel door begins to bubble and melt.
77.
The door to the storage room liquefies, flowing apart like
molten lava. The Ghost Rider steps through and --
-- in the light cast by .he demon's owing hand. Odell
realizes that the room is stacked with high explosives.
CUT TO:
Rain clutches at Nomi, frantic, looking back.
RAIN
What about the Ghost Rider? We have to
go back for him!
NOMI
Are you crazy?! Sit down!
Then Nomi glances in the rearview mirror. Oh. My. God.
THE GHOST RIDER
is coming after them. HOWLING, plowing through the inferno
on his hellcycle.
Nomi floors the gas. But the pickup is already maxed out.
The Ghost Rider easily gains on the truck, leaving a wake of
burning asphalt. He lashes out with his chains, snags the
back bumper. The chain-links slice deep into the steel
bodywork. The Ghost Rider hauls up onto his back wheel --
Nomi slams on the brakes. The truck fishtails. The Ghost
Rider rear-ends the pickup. Bike and demon cartwheel crazily
into the cargo bed, SLAMMING explosively against the back
window of the cab. Hot glass showers Nomi and Rain --
The Ghost Rider is pinned, SQUEALING, entangled with his bike.
Nomi floors it again. The truck leaps ahead --
-- but the Ghost Rider hangs on as his bike slides backwards.
He reaches into the cab, clutching at Nomi. The pickup
thunders up a rise --
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
The Ghost Rider's skeletal fingers clamp Nomi's shoulder.
She HOWLS in pain, her clothing beginning to smoke. Rain
tries to help, imploring --
RAIN
No, no, no --
The truck makes the rise -- and there's THE SUN, dawning huge
and white. flaring mightily over the distant horizon.
THE GHOST RIDER
recoils, blinded by the dawn. He releases Nomi, collapses
backwards. His fire extinguishes, his skull-face fades --
-- and Blaze lies in the pickup bed, shaking. Nomi glances
back through the shattered cab window, her face a mask of
fear and sympathy. Blaze looks to Gunt's bike, which has
also reverted to its original state, then SEES --
BLAZE'S POV:
The bad guys coming on battered bikes -- Arlo, Chester, plus
FOUR OTHER GARGOYLES. And bringing up the rear, a seven ton
Mack dumper driven by Carrigan. Landsdale rides shotgun.
Blaze looks to Nomi, SHOUTS over the wind:
BLAZE
Give me your gun!
Nomi passes it back. The Gargoyles OPEN FIRE. Bullets zing
and whine. Blaze shoves Gunt's cycle off the pickup bed
The heavy wreck CRASHES and bounces, wasting the first
Gargoyle. The others swerve around the sliding debris
Nomi runs a stops sign, slews across a rural intersection,
pounds the HORN, swerving to avoid the crossing cars --
AN ONCOMING TANKER TRUCK
brakes, jack-knifes. Four gargoyles make it past, the fifth
is flattened. The Mack comes last, SMASHING a passing
minivan into a spin --
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
ANGLE ON A GAS STATION
A STATE TROOPER, hidden from view, hits his SIREN, gives
CHASE --
BACK TO ARLO AND THE OTHER GARGOYLES
Gaining, riddling the pickup with BULLETS. Blaze is pinned
in the bed, can't get off a shot --
ON CHESTER PULSIFER,
hanging back and riding one-handed. He hefts a 66mm LAWs
rocket on his shoulder, LAUNCHES it --
Near miss. But the impact lifts the pickup's rear axle into
the air. Nomi SCREAMS. Blaze hangs on for dear life.
ON CARRIGAN,
hauling the Mack alongside Chester --
CARRIGAN
(yelling from the cab)
The hell you doing? I need the kid
alive!!!
CHESTER
Fuck the kid and FUCK YOU!!!
Chester aims the launcher again. Carrigan swerves, CRUSHES
Chester under the Mack's mighty wheels.
THE TROOPER CAR
pulls alongside the Mack, SIREN wailing. Carrigan veers
hard, forcing it into the opposing lane. Up ahead:
ROADWORKS. The highway narrows to a single lane --
BACK TO ARLO AND THE GARGOYLES
Gaining on the pickup, trading shots with Blaze at ninety
miles and hour.
Blaze wings one Gargoyle, then plugs another who loses
control, cartwheels catastrophically, EXPLODES --
Arlo zigzags the debris, guns his hog, screams closer. Blaze
fires but -- CLICK, CLICK, CLICK -- he's out!
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED: (2)
ROADWORKS
The pickup mows down barricades like dominoes, clips a hot
tar cooker, spins spumes of molten tar in all directions.
HIGHWAY WORKERS run for their lives.
Nomi SMASHES through barricades, leaps a pile of rough
gravel. Blaze is nearly hurled out the bed, but hangs on,
shoulder screaming --
A FOREGROUND WORKER
operating a jackhammer fails to notice the careening pickup
racing by, which-is, in turn, followed by Arlo and --
THE MACK TRUCK AND THE STATE TROOPER,
ana necx at OOFJ2 Ann r i t s
over, end.
BACK TO SCENE
Arlo rides against Nomi's door, lets rip with his Uzi. Glass
SHATTERS. Rain and Nomi duck --
Arlo tries again, sticks his Uzi right into the cab. But
Nomi forces the gun upwards. Bullets puncture the roof,
shell casings ricochet-
In desperation, Nomi reaches for the door latch, kicks her
foot against the door. The door swings outward, taking Arlo
along with it.
UP AHEAD
is a concrete divider. Nomi abruptly veers right, clipping
Arlo against the divider, killing him instantly.
ON BLAZE
hauling himself back into the pickup bed even as --
THE MACK
bears down on them. Landsdale jumps from the cab, landing
alongside Blaze. The two men struggle in the cargo bed, hand
to hand, exchanging a volley of vicious blows.
Nomi is desperate, doesn't know what to do. Landsdalp is
getting the upper hand. He grips Blaze by the throat,
forcing him over the side of the pickup bed, shoving Blaze's
head towards the churning wheels of the Mack --
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED: (3)
NOMI
(to Rain, pleading)
Do something!!!
ON RAIN,
concentrating, focusing all her energy on Landsdale. She
CRIES OUT, makes a forceful hand gesture --
-- and Landsdale's glasses SHATTER. He SCREAMS, blood
pouring from his eyes. Blaze rolls, throws Landsdale over
his shoulder -- into the wheels of the Mack.
UP AHEAD, A MASSIVE ROADBLOCK
Barricades, bulldozers, dozens of state police cars.
The pickup and the Mack pass over a line of TIRE SPIKES. The
tires BLOW. The trucks drop. Metal rims SPARK and GRIND --
NOMI (CONT' D)
Hold on to something!
She brakes. The pickup fishtails. Carrigan also brakes,
struggling to keep the Mack under control. Then the Mack
catches a rim, flips, rolls --
SLOW MOTION
The rolling Mack plows into the roadblock, seven tons of iron
crushing cruisers and barricades alike.
The pickup careens off the road, plunges into a cornfield,
hits a rut, grinds to a halt --
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES
The aftermath. Trooper cars sliding to a halt.
Carrigan being dragged from the Mack at gun point, handcuffed.
Armed TROOPERS plunging into the cornfield, YELLING.
Nomi falling out of the cab, finding Rain, unhurt, alive.
She drags Rain into the sea of corn. Rain looks back, SEES --
BLAZE
being surrounded by Troopers, wrestled to the ground.
CUT TO:
82.
A cacophony of noise for the new meat. Hardened CRIMINALS
BANGING their bars, SHOUTING as loud as they can.
ON BLAZE
chained, cuffed, struggling with TWO DEPUTIES trying to drag
him to a cell. Further up, Carrigan is being similarly
escorted. Blaze looks to the faces of his fellow prisoners,
dread seizing his body.
BLAZE
I have to talk to the warden. You have
to put me someplace else --
DEPUTY #1
Should've thought of that before you
pulled that "Dukes of Hazzard" stunt.
BLAZE
Please, just listen to me. Put me in
solitary, anywhere but here.
DEPUTY #2
This isn't a fucking hotel, chief.
BLAZE
You don't understand, people will die --
WHACK! A baton blow to the knee. Blaze CRIES OUT, staggers --
DEPUTY
Easy on the threats, big guy --
(shouts to door control)
NUMBER TEN!
The cell door opens. Blaze struggles even more violently now.
BLAZE
Do not put me in here! Do not leave me
with these men! They'll die if you do
this!! !
The deputies force Blaze inside, using batons, boots. A stun
gun SPARKS. Blaze falls. The cell door SLAMS. The inmates
opposite are LAUGHING, waving, bashing their bars with every
metal implement they've got as we --
CUT TO:
83.
Simple and clean. Rain locks the door, goes to the window
and opens it wide -- a beautiful day outside, hills rolling
down to a busy town a mile distant.
Nomi drops her bag, sits wearily on the bed, peels her jacket
open -- revealing a nasty shoulder wound. Burned to the
bone, the impression of fingers clearly evident.
Rain hurries to help, rummages antiseptics and bandages from
Nomi's bag. Together, they clean the wound. Nomi's pain is
clear, but she keeps it quiet.
RAIN
Are we safe now?
Nomi regards her sadly. She's never been one to tell lies.
NOMI
Honey, I don't know if we'll ever be
safe.
Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively. Something about
her look -- far too fatalistic for a child her age.
RAIN
He talks to me sometimes.
NOMI
Who?
RAIN
My father --
(beat, hesitant)
-- when I'm dreaming.
NOMI
(FEARFUL)
What does he say?
Rain starts to cry now, suddenly overwhelmed. Despite her
eerily calm demeanor, she's still a child. And a frightened
one at that.
RAIN
I don't want to be like him, mom.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
NOMI
You won't.
RAIN
(SOBBING)
You don't know that.
NOMI
Yes, I do, baby --
Nomi hugs her, desperate, as if the world were ending.
Outside, across the land, the sun shines gloriously bright.
NOMI (CONT'D)
-- yes I do.
DISSOLVE TO:
On Blaze, immobile. Waiting for nightfall. Shadows lengthen
around him in TIME-LAPSE as the day begins to die. He starts
to shake. Tears streak from his eyes, burn his cheeks.
On Carrigan, in his cell at the end of the corridor. He's
nervous, cutting a deck of cards.
Rain sleeps. Storm fingers scratch at the window.
Nomi steps out of the shower. Towels off. Checks on Rain.
She contemplates her sleeping child a moment, then taps a
pack of Camels, realizes she's out.
Blaze waiting, internal. Carrigan manically cutting his deck
of cards. Over and over.
Blaze suddenly CRIES OUT, throwing himself onto the floor.
He begins to writhe as the other prisoners jeer at him.
WOMAN (V.O.)
was if you invited it.
Nomi bolts into the room, frantic. She shakes Rain awake.
The child looks up, SEES the terror in her mother's face.
RAIN
Mom --?!
NOMI
Sweety, you have to get out of here now.
FOLLOWING NOMI
as she drags Rain into the bathroom. She tears the shower
curtain back. There's a window just above the shower stall
barely big enough for someone like Rain to squeeze through.
WOMAN (V.0.)
I'm not sure about that. At least not
anymore. What I CQ know is this:
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
We hear FOOTSTEPS in the walkway outside. SOMEONE is coming-___"
Nomi tugs open the window, lifts Rain towards it --
NOMI
Honey, go, GO! ?
The other prisoners are SHOUTING, fed up with Blaze's
"antics". He-rolls about, clutching at sides. Fire streams
from his mouth, his-eyes --
WOMAN (V.O.)
We are born alone and we die alone.
ON CARRIGAN,
terrified, backing into the far corner of his cell.
THE OTHER PRISONERS
pause, watching the beginning of Blaze's transformation,
their CRIES taking on an entirely new kind of urgency.
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT ` D )
It's what happens in-between that matters.
INT_ MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Rain squirms through the window, drops to the ground outside.
WOMAN (V.0.)
-- the choices we make, the people whose
paths we cross --
She stands, casts a fearful look to at Nomi, then runs off
into the stormy night.
ON NOMI
backing out of the bathroom as the front door EXPLODES OPEN.
She turns around --
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
-- these are the things that determine
our fate.
STARKE
stands in the doorway, coyotes slouching in around his heels.
The beasts attack, growing and changing, their gnashing
mouths of razored teeth opening wide to consume Nomi as --
87.
-- FWOOOSHH!!! A mushrooming blast-wave of HELLFIRE erupts
from Blaze's body, expanding beyond his cell and across the-
CORRIDOR --
The Ghost Rider stands in the center of Blaze's cell, a
cyclone of hellfire swirling around him -- for there is a
direct, casual relationship between the amplitude of his rage
and the number of transgressors in its vicinity.
He moves forward, melting the cell bars, stepping into --
THE CORRIDOR BEYOND
The prisoners are frantic, leaping about like frightened lab
animals.
THOOM! THOOM! The Ghost Rider's heavy FOOTFALLS ring out as
it strides down the corridor, turning his awful gaze on the
first cell. The Ghost Rider extends a hand, sending a STREAM
OF HELLFIRE coursing over the prisoner within.
The Ghost Rider moves on, to the second and third cells,
swiveling his gaze back and forth, BURNING the occupants
within. Like shooting fish in a barrel.
THOOM! THOOM! The Ghost Rider continues its rampage.
Murderers, rapists, malefactors. Some curse, others plead,
others simply drop to their knees and pray. For they know,
instinctively, that the universe is not an arbitrary place,
that their Day of Judgement has come.
The entire jail is ablaze now, a roiling extension of the
Ghost Rider's fury, drowning out the VOICES OF THE DAMNED.
ON THE FINAL CELL
where Carrigan cowers within. The deck of cards in his hands
drops, scatters. Some of them catch fire, shrivel up --
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
The Ghost Rider waves his hand. The bars separating them
melt, flowing to the floor like liquid. He stares down at
Carrigan, his hollow eve sockets sparking to life.
AS THE PENANCE STARE
erupts from the Ghost Rider's eyes, Carrigan reaches for
something beneath the bed --
cell wall. He holds it up.
The effect is catastrophic, like the Medusa having her own
deadly gaze turned back upon her. The Ghost Rider stumbles
backwards, SHRIEKING, assaulted by an onslaught of subjective
images. Visions horrifying enough to drive even a demon mad.
FADE IN from white. Another aftermath. A circus of
PARAMEDICS, POLICE, FIREMEN and REPORTERS. Every corner is
blackened, every bar twisted and melted. Charred CORPSES are
scattered like matchsticks.
BOOTS
are coming. We've seen them before. These boots belong to --
STARKE
navigating his way through the bedlam. He passes between
rushing emergency personnel, steps over a writhing VICTIM --
-- but no one seems to notice his presence. And as he
progresses to the far end of the cell block, the cacophony
fades, leaving only his FOOTSTEPS as he turns into --
CARRIGAN'S CELL
Carrigan is terribly burned, but still clinging to life.
Frantic paramedics are running an IV, struggling to stabilize
him. His fear-filled eyes grow dim, then abruptly snap into
focus as he SEES --
STARKE (O.S.)
You look like you could use some help.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
-- Starke standing over him, his gaze stoic and pitiless.
STARKE (CONT' D)
You lost her, Carrigan. What happened?
CARRI GAN
(a choking sob)
-- you didn't tell us -- what he was
Carrigan starts to slip away. The SOUNDS of the outside
world begin to intrude once more.
Starke kneels, touching a hand to Carrigan's chest. The
world ebbs away again. The paramedics continue their work,
oblivious. Carrigan MOANS.
CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
-- please, I don't want to die --
Starke's arctic eyes gleam bright with mischief.
STARKE
If I could save you, would you be willing
to make a deal?
CUT TO:
Rhymer leads Blaze down the central aisle. The chapel is
dark, lit by candle-light, crowded with scaffolding and drop-
sheets. As Blaze walks, the flames of the candles bend in
his direction -- as if drawn by some unseen magnetic force.
BLAZE
Those men outside --
RHYMER
Most of them are on a work-release
program. We're a halfway house for ex-
offenders. We try to get people on their
feet, reintegrate them into society.
Blaze glances at Rain, apprehensive.
RHYMER (CONT'D)
(misreading Blaze's look)
Don't worry, you're perfectly safe here.
But of course, that's not what Blaze is thinking.
CUT TO:
Rain sits at the table, spooning her soup. Tolbein, Nunez
and a few others watch them. Blaze watches them back,
nonchalant in the face of their obvious hostility.
Blaze and Rhymer work by flashlight, tinkering with the old
generator. There are a number of vehicles stored around
them, including a pair of dusty motorcycles.
RHYMER
So how long have you been running?
BLAZE
What do you mean?
RHYMER
You know what I mean. You spend as much
time around lost souls as I have, you
learn how to read a man's face.
(NODDING)
You want to hand me that crescent wrench?
Blaze hands Rhymer the wrench, who then makes an adjustment.
RHYMER (CONT'D)
Take the girl, for instance. She's not
your daughter, is she?
BLAZE
No.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
RHYMER
So what happened to her mother?
BLAZE
She's dead.
RHYMER
Did you kill her?
BLAZE
No.
Rhymer studies Blaze, decides he believes him.
BLAZE (CONT' D)
(ELABORATING)
She doesn't have anyone else. I'm just
trying to protect her.
RHYMER
And who's protecting you?
MOMENTS LATER,
Blaze and Rhymer are cleaning up.
BLAZE
Listen, I appreciate what you're trying
to do, but I've never really been a come
to Jesus kind of guy.
RHYMER
I wasn't talking about Jesus, I was
talking about a little healthy
introspection. Working here, staying in
one place for a while, seeing what
surfaces. I've found that people tend to
arrive on our doorstep for a reason.
Blaze considers this formidable man, a yearning moment
then he shakes his head.
BLAZE
I can't stay. I'm sorry.
RHYMER
What about the girl, then? Whatever
you're involved in, I can't imagine it's
good for her well-being.
(beat, gentle)
We can find a home for her.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED: (2)
BLAZE
(UNSURE)
I'd have to leave tonight --
Rhymer nods, understanding, he motions towards a beautiful
motorcycle parked back in the shadows -- a `71 Norton
Commando 850. Black, with gold pin-striping.
RHYMER
You can take the Norton.
BLAZE
I don't have any money.
RHYMER
So send us some when you do.
Blaze is moved by this man's simple humanity -- but he's also
wrestling with the idea of abandoning Rain.
CUT TO:
Blaze gazes into a bathroom mirror. Been here so many times
before. SOUNDS intrude upon his solitude.
He bows his head, studies the coin, turning it over in his
shaking fingers. The malicious coyote, the soaring eagle.
Still the SOUNDS come, stronger, more insistent --
Cars CRASHING. Police SIRENS wailing. SCREAMS. GUNFIRE.
FLAMES.
Blaze looks up once more. His eyes are shadowed sockets.
This is the real PENANCE STARE, and Blaze is feeling its
awful, mournful ache.
NOMI'S VOICE
He wants to know if you're a bad man.
He wants to know -- if the Ghost Rider
turned its penance stare on you, would
you burn?
Blaze clenches his fist around the coin, spins on his heels.
98.
Blaze pauses in the doorway, looking in on Rain, who sleeps,
dead to the world. Blaze sets the coyote coin on the bed
table next to her, turns and leaves.
We HOLD ON Rain's sleeping face for a beat, then she stirs,
opening her eyes. She SEES the coin nearby, sits up.
The Norton Commando ROARS into life, blasting webs from the
exhaust. Blaze guides the bike up the coal ramp and out
through the open cellar doors.
Rhymer and leads his wards in prayer. We can hear the WIND
rising outside, gathering in strength.
RHYMER
That which was from the beginning, which
we have heard, which we have seen with
our eyes, which we have looked upon, and
our hands have handled, of the Word of
life."
MOVING WITH Rain down a moonlit corridor- She clutches the
coyote coin like a talisman, then ---
SEES SOMETHING
through a window which startles her -- only to realize that
it's just the scarecrow out in the field, flapping wildly.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
THE MEN (V.O.)
"For the life was manifested, and we have
seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto
you that eternal life, which was with the
Father, and was manifested unto us."
RHYMER CONTINUES:
RHYMER
"That which we have seen and heard
declare we unto you, that ye also may
have fellowship with us: and truly our
fellowship is with the Father, and with
his Son Jesus Christ. And these things
write we unto you, that your joy may be
full. This then is the message which we
have heard of him, and declare unto you,
that God is light -- "
CUT TO:
Rhymer and his men eat. Rain is there too. Nunez peers out
into the darkness. Wind and debris are scratching at the
window panes. We hear THUNDER now, too.
NUNEZ
Padre. You'd better take a look at this.
Rhymer joins him. SEES what he SEES: COYOTES gathering. Six
or more. They creep malevolently towards the mission.
NUNEZ (CONT'D)
You ever see anything like that before?
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
Rhymer shakes his head, looks to --
RAIN
She's acutely conscious of the men staring at her now, still
clutching the coin like a rabbit's foot.
TOLBEIN
It's her -- she's the one doing this.
RHYMER
That's enough, Richard.
TOLBEIN
I'm telling you, Father, there's
something wrong with --
CRASH! One of the windows SLAMS open, startling everyone.
Rhymer moves to it, latches it shut again.
LIGHTNING flashes. An eerie HOWLING arises. Tolbein and
Nunez lead some men to the front door. Tolbein unbars the
door, pulls it open, can't believe his eyes: THREE DOZEN
HOWLING COYOTES, approaching the entrance.
TOLBEIN
What is this?!
SCARE! A snarling coyote comes out of left field, just
misses his throat --
Tolbein leaps backward, SLAMS the door. The men start
SHOUTING. Rain backs away. She knows what's happening.
WHAM! An animal rams the door. Then another. And another --
Rhymer breaks out a shotgun, shells, hears the men SHOUTING.
Rhymer rushes in. The men are confused, afraid. WHAM!
WHAM! GROWLING coyotes are hurling themselves repeatedly
against the windows, cracking the panes.
RHYMER
Get away from the windows!
(TO WILSON)
Wilson, take Rain to the chapel.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
Wilson hesitates, eyeing Rain with distrust-
WILSON
I ain't going nowhere with her.
All the men are giving Rain a wide berth now. WHAM! Another
snarling coyote hits the glass.
RHYMER
One of you, please, just take the kid to
the chapel.
TOLBEIN
Father, that's the last place she should
be.
CRUNCH! Something strikes the room a massive blow.
Something MUCH BIGGER than a coyote. Viscott starts praying.
NUNEZ
Quiet, Viscott!
THUMP! CRUMP! More heavy blows. Like the Fist of God.
Making the floorboards beneath their feet vibrate. SOMETHING
shambles past the window. What in God's name was that?
TOLBEIN
(looking at Rain, accusing)
I knEw we should've sent them away!
THOOM! Another impact. THOOM!THOOM! Plaster cracks. Dust
falls. Viscott wails, praying even more stridently. Nunez
is losing it_
NUNEZ
SHUT THE FUCK UP, MAN!
TOLBEIN
She's the one they want, I'm telling you!
-- and the lights abruptly go ou The storm bellows and
blusters. The men huddle together, fear thick and sour.
CARRIGAN (O.S.)
Raainn -- Raaaaiinnn --
A gastly VOICE, monstrously corrupt, but still recognizable
as Billy-Ray Carrigan.
CARRIGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
-- where are you, Rainnnnnnn?
Rain shrinks away from the insidious mewling.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
TOLBEIN
(to Rhymer, hissing)
I told you --
Even Rhymer is shaken now. He moves to investigate, presses
up against a cracked window --
RHYMER'S POV (THROUGH WINDOW)
Carrigan stands outside, lurching between patterns of
moonlight and shadow. But the movement is all wrong. And in
our momentary glimpses of him, we get the sense that he's
been horribly changed -- as if his body had been torn apart,
then haphazardly reassembled into something else.
CRUNCH! The wall fractures. Rhymer staggers back. WHUMP!
CRUNCH! A row of impacts moves along the wall --
Tolbein and Nunez scramble to reach the dining room door.
They close it, turning the locks.
WHANG! Carrigan slams against the other side of the heavy,
steel door. WHANG!WHANG! Again and again and again. The
men are terrified, SHOUTING at each other. The door is
buckling inward, the hinges bending and GROANING --
Then the pummelling stops. Just the sound of BREATHING,
halting and phlegmatic. No one moves, not a whisper.
CORROSION starts to spread across the metal door.
NUNEZ
What the fuck --?!
Rhymer edges close to the decaying door, peering through a gap
in the frame --
Carrigan peers back, moonlight illuminating his face. There
are buttons where his eyes should 12P. He BELLOWS:
CARRIGAN
PRIEST! GIVE ME THE GIRL!
The POUNDING begins anew, harder now. The weakened door is
surely about to give way. Rain is terrified.
TOLBEIN
Do what he says! Put her out!
RHYMER
Get back with the others!

TOLBEIN
We don't do what it says, that thing
outside there's gonna kill us all.
Rhymer steps in front of Rain, levels his shotgun at
Tolbein's chest.
RHYMER
God as my witness, Richard, lay a hand on
that girl and I will pull this trigger.
Tolbein hesitates -- then grabs at the shotgun. He twists it
from Rhymer's hands, SMASHES the butt across Rhymer's jaw.
Rhymer sinks to the floor.
Tolbein grabs Rain, drags her SCREAMING to the door. He
waves the shotgun at the others --
TOLBEIN
Open the fucking door! DO IT!
Nunez fumbles with the lock. Rhymer recovers, throws himself
at Nunez, tries stop him from opening it. The pounding
ceases. All eyes sweep to the door --
TWO BUTTONS
roll through the gap between the bottom of the door and the
floor, coming to rest at Rhymer's feet -- immediately oottina
the floorboards beneath them.
CARRIGAN (O.S.)
(a skin-crawling whisper)
I can see you, Priest. I can see every
last one of you.
THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN,
knocking Tolbein, Rain, Rhymer and Nunez on their asses. All
eyes bug as Carrigan shoulders his way inside. Only he's n..t
Carrigan anymore. Now he's --
THE SCARECROW
A golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and
sodden burlap, pieces of insects, twine, and razor wire.
Button-socket eyes. Jagged bone teeth. Beetle-black chitin
for fingers and nails.
His very existence is an affront to nature. Everything the
Scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays. Floorboards
rot, metal rusts. Every movement, every spastic shudder and
twitch is a source of incalculable pain.

The Scarecrow thrusts his hand out and a STORM OF DEMONIC
CROWS explodes from his chest, whirling about like a cyclone
of knives.
Now the coyotes enter too. Dozens of them, SNARLING, DIVING
at the men, sinking their jaws into flesh.
The men are trapped. Some try to flee. Others fight back,
swinging chairs and planks --
THE SCARECROW
stalks into their midst, snaring victims left and right,
HURLING bodies or pulling them apart --
He snatches Viscott up by his throat. Bugs swarm over the
SCREAMING parolee's face as it rots and decays. In seconds,
Viscott's entire body decomposes, putrefies, falls apart --
RHYMER AND RAIN
back up towards the kitchen. SCREECH! A crow-thing comes
flapping. Rhymer FIRES. The creature SHRIEKS and flops --
Nunez claws another from his face, SEES it's not a crow at
all, but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a
deformed razor beak, matted feathers, bony talons --
Wilson, trapped under a bench, BEATS desperately at a
gnashing coyote. Lands a real blow. The beast falls back
then stands up like a man?
VARIOUS ANGLES
as the OTHER COYOTES do likewise. The coyotes are changing
shape, enlarging, canine skeletons CRACKING and re-arranging
themselves into --
JAW-BEASTS
The same half-glimpsed horrors we glimpsed accompanying
Starke. All muscle and gnashing fangs and bloody, ripping
claws.
CUT TO:
Claws and jaws and razor-beaks tearing frenziedly through
wood and plaster and lathe. Rhymer, Rain, Nunez and Tolbein
struggle to repel the monsters, beating them back with
whatever is at hand --
-- but the jaw-beasts and razor birds are winning, forcing
their way into the kitchen --
Nunz is snagged. Slashing claws swarm all over him. The
others try to pull him free --
Rhymer wastes two more precious SHOTS, but Nunez is lost.
Dragged SCREAMING into the storm of mouths and claws. The
survivors fall back as the door gives and --
THE SCARECROW
pitches through the opening, lurching forward. Jaw-beasts
fall in behind him. Razor birds whirl around his head.
The survivors scramble for the far exit. Rain opens every
gas burner on the grill as she passes by -- but the far exit
is locked. And Rhymer doesn't have the key!
BOOM! Rhymer shotguns the lock! The lock fractures, but the
exit still won't open. Tolbein starts kicking. Rhymer aims
AGAIN --
RAIN
(tugging at Rhymer)
Shoot the gas!
RHYMER
What?
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
THE SCARECROW
advances. Bugs swarm from beneath his tattered feet. Every
metal implement and surface rusts as he passes.
RAIN
(pointing at the grills)
SHOOT THE GAS!
Rhymer hears the ranges HISSING and FIRES. CHOOM! The gas
fireballs, catches Scarecrow full-on sideways. He squeals,
reels. Burning jaw-beasts writhe and howl.
Rain falls to the floor, dropping the coyote coin. It spins
furiously as we --
CUT TO:
-- the Scarecrow, savagely burnt by the blast, but
unstoppable. He rises, cocks his head, hears something --
VARIOUS ANGLES - DINING ROOM, KITCHEN, STAIRCASE
The jaw-beasts_ The razor birds. All pause. All listen.
They know something's coming. Something fast. Something bad.
We hear it now too -- the WHINE of an APPROACHING ENGINE.
ON THE COYOTE COIN
wobbling to a stop, coyote side up.
Realizing what's about to happen, the Scarecrow lets loose a
GHASTLY WAIL and --
THE GHOST RIDER
erupts through the wall in DEEP SLOW MOTION, sending forth a
majestic tsunami of fire and debris. The monster bike skids,
carves floorboards like matchwood --
JAW-BEASTS AND RAZOR BIRDS
hurl themselves out of its scorching path --
The Ghost Rider vaults from the saddle, sends the bike
spinning at the scurrying monsters. It ninepins a few, takes
out the rest as it impacts the wall like a nuke --
THE CROW-THINGS
are vanquished, squealing and flopping like living cinders.
BUT THE JAW-BEASTS RECOVER,
still aflame but very much alive. If anything, they seem
emboldened by the fire. They circle the Ghost Rider, more
and more of them joining the pack.
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
THE GHOST RIDER
readies his chains. The jaw-beasts attack. Three dozen
horrors pouncing and GNASHING. The Ghost Rider takes them.-
Chains, flames, sheer power and force --
Spines snap. Lupine skulls burn. The Ghost Rider tears the
monsters limb from limb. The room becomes the Seventh Circle
of Hell, and at the heart of the Inferno, the Ghost Rider
exults in the slaughter --
The whole mission is ablaze now, fire and churning smoke
consuming everything in its path. Rhymer, Rain, and Tolbein
run for their lives.
Rain, Rhymer and Tolbein are trapped. Fire has cut them off.
They back their way towards the rear of the building, peer
out the windows --
THEIR POV:
a hundred foot drop straight down to the highway.
TOLBEIN
There's no way down from here!
CRACK! The door behind them splinters. The Scarecrow's
found them once again.
The Ghost Rider is having difficulty with the jaw-beasts.
His fire burns them but they just keep coming -- blackened
skeletal demons, possessed of an unstoppable ferocity --
For every one he throws aside, two more seem to take its
place. He can wound them, sear the flesh from their bones,
but still they pile on, sinking their teeth into his skeletal
flesh, CRUNCHING through his hollow rib-cage --
The Ghost Rider SHRIEKS in pain, TEARS one from his back,
SNAPS another's spine, PUNCHES a fist through a third's
gnashing muzzle. He falls back through a doorway, onto --
A STAIRCASE
And still, they attack. And now the Ghost Rider is
weakening. He stumbles on the steps, falls to his knees.
The fiends pile atop his back --
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
Summoning all his power, the Ghost Rider emits a SHOCKWAVE OF
FLAME, a HEAT-BOMB that blasts the creatures clean off him.
The SHOCKWAVE shakes the room. FIRE belches through the
splintered doorway --
-- but the Scarecrow scarcely notices. He's flinging dorm
beds left and right, HOWLING and GROANING as he hunts for --
RAIN
huddled beneath a flimsy bed-frame.
SCARECROW
RAAAAINNN! RAAINN!
The Scarecrow hurls aside a bed and finds Tolbein. He
reaches for the man, sinking his spindly finger's into
Tolbein's chest. Tolbein SCREAMS, instantly shrivelling,
corroding into dust --
The Scarecrow hurls aside yet another bed and finds --
RHYMER
aiming his shotgun, point-blank range! BLAM! The BLAST
Takes a chunk out of the Scarecrow's face.
All Hell breaks loose. The Ghost Rider unleashes wave after
wave of HELLFIRE, incinerating the hounds as they leap
towards him, fighting his way up and up the steps --
BLAM! Another BLAST chews apart the Scarecrow's neck. The
monstrosity staggers, then lurches forward, grabbing the
barrel of the shotgun, instantly corroding it --
The wave of corrosion swarms up the stock while towards
Rhymer's hands and he drops the gun, rolling away, scooping
up Rain as he runs towards the bathroom --
BACK TO THE SCARECROW,
recovering, his makeshift flesh knitting itself back together.
Flames kiss his body, causing sodden particles on his frame to
SIZZLE and POP -- but because his decayed flesh is so wet, he
never ignites.
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
Enkindled BUZZING bug-ember things swirl around the
Scarecrow's head in a halo, impossibly alive- He stumbles
after Rhymer and Rain into
THE BATHROOM
A claustrophobic box of stalls and urinals. Rhymer and Rain
are nowhere to be seen. Enraged, the Scarecrow tears into
the stalls, ripping them aside one by one --
The Ghost Rider advances, hurling jaw-beasts left and right --
The Scarecrow rends the last stall asunder, finds Rain and
Rhymer cowering like bugs. He looms above Rain, beetle-
fingers clutching, flashing a rotted rictus-grin --
SCARECROW
-- GOT YOU'.
RED-HOT CHAINS
whip viciously around the Scarecrow's sodden head and torso.
He's wrenched backwards, hauled out of the bathroom and
SLAMMED across the dormitory into the opposite wall --
The Scarecrow recovers, SEES the room ablaze. SEES a swathe
of blackened, twitching jaw-beast skeletons leading from the
doorway to --
THE GHOST RIDER
At the other end of the chains. More accurately,
GHOST BLAZE,
battered and weakened, staggering. His flames are barely
flickering, his bony flesh has become chalky and brittle.
He's holding a jaw-beast skeleton, drops it to the floor --
The Scarecrow attacks. Hand-to-hand combat. Massive blows
and blocks. The burning room SHUDDERS with each impact --
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Ghost Blaze uses his chains, but he's weak, and Scarecrow
turns them back on him, SMASHES him against the walls. More
structural fractures, more dust --
The dormitory drops alarmingly, ten feet or more, the
flooring canting precariously. Ghost Blaze stumbles, falls --
WHAM! Scarecrow grabs Ghost Blaze's neck. Squeezes tight.
A WAVE OF DECAY AND CORROSION spreads over Ghost Blaze. He
SCREAMS, his flesh putrefying, but Scarecrow will not let go --
ON RAIN AND RHYMER
Desperate for escape, the flames closing in on them. There's
nowhere to go. Except a small HATCH, high up in the ceiling --
BACK TO SCENE
Ghost Blaze HOWLS, in agony as the Scarecrow's superior evil
dominates. He feebly extends a hand towards the flames
nearby, trying to compel the fire to him. The flames twist,
briefly bend in his direction. The Ghost Rider HOWLS with
frustration. He needs the flames. He will die without them.
He tries again, reaching, reaching --
THE FLAMES
surrounding the two foes are starting to bend in earnest now,
streaming towards Ghost Blaze's bony, begging fingertips
The Scarecrow is oblivious. Just keeps pouring more misery
into Ghost Blaze's body as --
-- raging flames bend and draw long --

-- clouds of embers are pulled into coursing streams-.--
-- roiling fireballs are dragged wildly from walls, floors
and ceilings --
-- flame and fury funneling thunderously into SCORCHING FIRE-
SPOUTS that cyclone up and up and up into --
-- Ghost Blaze from every direction.
Suddenly Scarecrow finds himself at the heart of a back-
drafting firestorm, a sustained implosion feeding straight
into Ghost Blaze. Then --
Nuclear silence.
An instant in which Rhymer shoves Rain through the hatch --
An instant in which Scarecrow senses his own doom --
Because the Ghost Rider is back- But now he's more than the
Ghost Rider. He's a white-hot nuclear bomb fairly vibrating
with volcanic heat.
And he DETONATES. An apocalyptic release that --
obliterates Scarecrow --
sends Rhymer ducking for cover --
bulges the dormitory's fractured walls and ceiling,
lifting the ATTIC FLOOR mightily. HURLING Rain into the air!
A FLAME TSUNAMI
steamrollers through every room and passage, destroying
everything in its path, consuming itself.
Ghost Blaze lies GROANING at blackened ground zero. He's
almost human now, spent. Charred timbers CREAK and GROAN
around him. The entire structure is on the verge of
collapse.
ON RAIN
emerging from the smouldering bathroom, ghostly white. She
picks her way cautiously across the teetering floor. Kneels
alongside Ghost Blaze --

CONTINUED:
Blaze's eyes are black pits, gaunt and skullish_ Rain casts --- -
about, finds a BURNING EMBER, cups it in her hands, holds the
flame close to his mouth --
Ghost Blaze senses the fire, breathes it in like a drowning
man. Draws the flame deep into his lungs, keeps drawing
until the ember is gone, internalized. Their eyes meet.
RAIN
Are you going to die?
GHOST BLAZE
(WEAKLY)
Not today.
He pushes up on his elbows, tiredly rises to his feet and --
THE MISSION
Topples. Ghost Blaze and Rain run -- but they're not going
to make it. The whole room is dropging away at their heels!
Ghost Blaze snatches up Rain, DIVES through a widening split
in the wall even as --
A NURSE brings a postcard to a sleeping patient's bedside.
The patient is ROXANNE, sleeping peacefully, bathed in
sunlight. The nurse tacks the card to a wall filled with
many -- dozens and dozens of postcards charting Blaze's
journey back and forth across the country.
And we realize now, that Roxanne is the woman who has been
narrating our tale.

Waiting. Listening to the whispers of
