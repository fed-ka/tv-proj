EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

An abandoned home ablaze, the fire untended. Things burn in 
Detroit, close to 500 arsons a month, and most are left to 
simply die out on their own as the city attempts to shed its 
past and rebuild its future. 

CHYRON: DETROIT, MI

We move through the urban landscape, as -- 

-- A row of 50s bungalows off 7 Mile East, most abandoned, 
pass by like falling dominoes.

-- The Ambassador Bridge lights the path out of the USA to 
Canada, over the Detroit River.

(CONT D) GEDDES
Folks talk like morality is black

they re smart or at some cocktail 
party, acting all pretentious, they 
say it s gray... You know what it s

And it s flashing back and forth 
all the time and all we can do is 
try to figure out how to see 
straight enough to keep from 
getting our heads bashed in.

He hits her. Geddes grabs his shoulder.

Frank drinks. Geddes watches him coming to grips with this. 
Geddes walks to a large tank, full of lobsters. 

FRANK
Not that. It s salt water. We can t 
have that showing up. 

Geddes nods. Frank walks to a huge sink. Stoppers it. Turns 
the water on. He watches it slowly rising. As he does --

Frank shakes off the image. Stares at the water rising. A 
beat. He takes a drink. Steels himself. 

FRANK
Thank you. 

Geddes puts a hand on his shoulder. Looks him in the eye.

GEDDES
The righteous shall rejoice when he 
seeth the vengeance; he shall wash 
his feet in the blood of the 
wicked. 

Frank drains the bottle. Offers his hand. They shake. 

FRANK
You and me. 6.


GEDDES
You re a good man, Frank. You are. 
Don t you forget that. 

A beat and they walk away, into --

INT. ROMA S ITALIAN RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

We see the restaurant clearly now. Classic 1940s. Candles, 
stuck into the tops of wine bottles, drip wax everywhere. 
Brendan McCann is slumped on a table, drunk. The OWNER (60s, 
a Detroit lifer, a face like the map of Italy) approaches 
Frank and Geddes. Geddes indicates Brendan. 

GEDDES
Worse than usual?

GEDDES

The owner hands over the keys. He looks toward Brendan. 

OWNER

Geddes smiles. The owner exits as Frank walks toward Brendan. 
A beat and Geddes follows. 

FRANK
Hey, big man. 

GEDDES
Brendan, wake up... Wake up. Time 
to go. 

They shake him. He s awake but out of it. 

FRANK
We re gonna drive you home. 

BRENDAN
I can drive. 7.


FRANK
Don t be stupid. Your car ll be

morning. 

Brendan stares at Frank. A beat. 

BRENDAN

mailbox. 

BRENDAN
Big day tomorrow. 

GEDDES
You just need some sleep. 

BRENDAN

GEDDES

A beat. Brendan stares at Geddes, drunk but also oddly 
unhinged. Frank and Geddes share a look, then --

Brendan stands. They steady him. Frank grabs his coat. 

FRANK
Put your coat on. It s freezing out 
there. 

But Brendan is suddenly flailing at the coat --

BRENDAN
Goddamn rats on me. 

FRANK
Brendan, hold still. 

BRENDAN
I can t stop em. Goddamn rats. 

Brendan thrashes. Frank grabs him, hard. 

FRANK

You need to get yourself together.

A beat. Westwood lightens, ever so slightly. 

WESTWOOD
I couldn t give you prior notice of 
an investigation, even if I wanted 
to, because prior notice would 
compromise your position. 

Torrance knows this is true. A beat. 

TORRANCE
So. Which one of them is it?

CUT TO:

EXT. RANDOLPH STREET

Frank walks from his car, up the block. He passes the old --

Wayne County Courthouse. Stunning. Classical-revival. On the 
National Register of Historic Places. The front is boarded. A  
 For Sale  sign hangs. As Frank walks on --

CUT TO:

INT. HOMICIDE - DAY

Frank enters. Immediately, he senses something is off. He 
sees Westwood in with Torrance. Sheena is at her desk.

FRANK
Who s that?24.


SHEENA
I.A. Straight into the lieutenant s 
office. 

FRANK
Legit investigation or the New PR?

SHEENA
Nobody knows. 

As Frank begins to move, Westwood steps out of the office, 
where Jackson waits. Frank gives them a polite nod. 

WESTWOOD

 FRANK ON continues. Frank office. Torrance s enters Jackson

As they speak, Torrance steps out of his office.

SHEENA
I already tried him. Home phone 
just rings. 

TORRANCE
What about his cell?

SHEENA
Straight to voice mail. 

TORRANCE
Try him again. 25.


Torrance steps back into his office, pissed. All eyes on 
Frank, who commands the room. The other cops seems to look to 
him as if he s their unspoken leader.

And Frank turns and exits --

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Geddes pisses at a urinal. Frank enters. Pees at the one next 
to him. Their voices are low but the tone has a hard edge.

GEDDES
Take a deep breath. 

FRANK
Did you know about this?

GEDDES
Of course not. 

FRANK
He said it, didn t he?

GEDDES
Who?

FRANK
Brendan. He said tomorrow was a big 
day. He needed you to have his 
back. Said the rats were on him. 27.


GEDDES
Brendan was shitface drunk. 

FRANK
He was talking about Internal 
Affairs. You know I m right. 

GEDDES
You need to calm yourself. 

FRANK
I need to know what s going on. 

GEDDES
What s going on is you wanted your 
revenge so you took it. Now, we 
need to have each others  backs. 

FRANK
Like you had Brendan s?

GEDDES
Deep breath, brother. We did what 
we did. Now we deal with it.

FRANK
Did you play me?

GEDDES
You need to get your mind right. 
This ain t a game. This is grownup 
shit. 

And with that, Geddes flushes. Walks away. Stay with --

Frank. He steps away from the urinal. Stares to where Geddes 
exited... Off Frank, trying to hold it together.

ACT TWO

FADE IN:

INT. TORRANCE S OFFICE - DAY

Westwood interviews Geddes. Torrance is here. 

GEDDES
What kind of trouble is Brendan in?

TORRANCE
Just talk us through last night, 
Joe.

GEDDES
All due respect, everybody knows 
Lieutenant Westwood here is IA. 

Outside the office, we see Frank watching. Geddes notices. 

WESTWOOD
Who all was at the meal?

GEDDES
Me, Frank Agnew, John Hernandez, 
Louise Cullen. Sheena Bailey was 
there for a while but she has kids. 
Dani -- Danya Khalil -- was still 
out sick. And Lieutenant Torrance 
would have been there but he s got 
more sense. Plus, he can say no. 

WESTWOOD
What shape was Detective McCann in 
by the end of the night?

GEDDES
He was vintage Brendan.  

WESTWOOD
You mean he was drunk?

GEDDES
You can start there if you want.   

WESTWOOD
I m serious. 

GEDDES
So am I. He was loaded, he was 
maudlin, he was self-pitying, he 
was totally abusive...29.


WESTWOOD
What about drug use?

GEDDES
I didn t see any. But my guess is 
yes. 

WESTWOOD
And you didn t say anything?

GEDDES
I m not a drug counselor. 

A beat. Geddes and Westwood hold a stare. Outside, Frank 
continues to watch the back and forth. As --

TORRANCE
Did he say anything at all about 
Internal Affairs?

GEDDES
No, sir. Nothing. 

WESTWOOD
Do you think Detective McCann is 
worried he s under investigation?

GEDDES
I think he s worried he s another 
year older and fatter and he can t 
get it up as much as he d like. 

A beat. Westwood zeroes in on Geddes. 

WESTWOOD
You re known around the Detroit PD 
as being a sharp dresser. 

GEDDES
If you say so. 

WESTWOOD
Would you say right now is the way 
you like to present yourself?

GEDDES
I d say its not easy to look your 
best after a night out with Brendan 
McCann. If you don t believe me, 
have a look around the precinct. 

WESTWOOD
You were in a Jesuit seminary when 
you were younger, is that right?30.


GEDDES
Is there a point to that question?

WESTWOOD
There seem to be a lot of vows you 
consider gray areas --

TORRANCE
-- This is completely irrelevant. 

WESTWOOD
-- But, then, you re a cop, not a 
priest. 

GEDDES
Last I checked. 

A beat. All three men stare. 

WESTWOOD
Again. Do you think Detective 
McCann is concerned about Internal 
Affairs?

GEDDES
I don t think he d have told me, 
even if he was. 

WESTWOOD
Why not?

GEDDES
Because we re partners, we re not 
friends. I don t socialize with 
Brendan. 

WESTWOOD
So, why were you with him last 
night?

GEDDES
Because he asked me. 

WESTWOOD
Even though you re not friends?

GEDDES
Sometimes with Brendan it s easier 
to just do what he asks. 

WESTWOOD
And does that apply on the job too? 
As his partner? Do you do whatever 
he asks without arguing?31.

Damon nods. Walks away. Elena watches him, as if computing 
all the angles. A beat and she looks back at Skelos, outside. 
Elena s eyes grow dark and focused. ANGLE ON --

A booth. Damon with Gus plus STEVEN and MICHAEL, his inner 
circle. Steven is white-boy hip-hop. Michael is a hard case --

Nick keeps ripping the coaster, when --

A hand reaches out and stops him. Elena. He freezes. Stares. 
She keeps her hand on his. A beat. Finally, she sweeps the

If the old man knows we stole 
Brendan McCann, his best play is to 
try and take us down. 

MICHAEL

not about some shit that went down

Damon glares, hard. Without taking his eyes off Michael --

is bullshit. Yes, they re  cracking 
down  on corruption to get enough 
juice to get us the hell out of

be a corrupt contract. But, come

police work?

Off the detectives, as Torrance walks back into his office. 

CUT TO:

INT. DODGE CHARGER - DAY

Damon drives, Elena shotgun. He pulls to the curb. Her eyes 
go wide. As she steps out to --

EXT. BRUSH PARK NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

The street. Brush Park. Midtown. 48.


ELENA
Oh, baby, it s perfect. 

And we come around to see, Elena s POV --

An enormous, decayed brick Victorian, boarded up. 

Damon pops the trunk. Grabs a tire iron. He walks to Elena. 
Kisses her. He glances at the rest of the neighborhood and --

A vast expanse of smashed brick and ash. They walk, each 
taking it in silently, until --

DAMON
Scrappers haven t gotten to the 
copper. We can pull electricity 
from the Liquor Store on the 
corner. 

ELENA
We can put a bar at each end. 

DAMON
There s seven rooms upstairs for 
whores but they re big enough, a 
little drywall, we can make twelve. 

She keeps moving, as if walking through the possibilities.

You get yourself two of these blind

DAMON
Twenty-four girls at a hundred a

week, double the weekly take on 
coke and dope, less McCann s eight 
percent, we re talking sixty-one-
five a week. 

ELENA
You ll have the money and juice to 
do whatever you want. 

He nods. Exactly. Elena walks the space, sizing it up. 

(CONT D) ELENA
What s McCann offering for the 
percentage?

DAMON
A heads-up on any heat coming our 
way, first run at any new talent on 
the street and a dip into the 
evidence room now and then. 

Elena stops. A beat. 

ELENA
One thing I know is dirty cops. 

DAMON
And?

ELENA
If a taker like McCann knows you re 
this close, he s gonna want more 
than just money. 

DAMON
Like what?

ELENA
You tell me. Was it extra perks? 
Some kind of insurance? 

Elena has a penetrating look. Damon takes a beat. Then --50.


DAMON
I told him I could give him the old 
man on a platter. Bodies. Dates... 
Everything airtight.  

ELENA
So, McCann looks like a hero for 
putting him away and you move in 
without firing a shot. 

DAMON
This morning was supposed to seal 
it.

A beat. Elena considers. Holds her tongue. Then --

ELENA
Do the boys know?

DAMON
(no)
They know what I need em to know. 

ELENA
If McCann double crossed you, the 
old man s got no choice but to try 
and take you out. 

DAMON
(true, but --)
Now s the time. The right 
combination of brains and balls, 
somebody can own this city for a 
buck and change... Though I shoulda 
put a bullet in that old man s head 
when I was a kid. 

ELENA
Hey. Shhh. Baby...

She walks to him. Slides her hand into his pants. 

(CONT D) ELENA
This is your time, however you 
gotta play it out. 

She begins to move her hand up and down as she says --

(CONT D) ELENA
You don t have to rush.... Just 
don t make me connect the dots. 

He nods, calming. Her hand keeps working. 51.

FRANK

WESTWOOD
Why s that?

FRANK
You ve obviously been watching 
Brendan awhile. Why do you think?

WESTWOOD

FRANK
How do you mean?

WESTWOOD

FRANK

A knock. Jackson, the other IA agent, pops his head in.

JACKSON
Not just scrubbed. Most good 
shredders overwrite one or two 
times... My best guess, he went 
back over the drive sectors five or 
six times. 

WESTWOOD
Is anything recoverable?

JACKSON
No. Basically, every part of the 
hard drive has been over-written 
with randomly generated garbage. 

Westwood looks ready to explode as --

Frank watches, a realization forming. 

ON SCREEN: Westwood and Jackson look at the computer.

WESTWOOD
There has to be a data restoration

JACKSON

Frank stares, transfixed, when the door suddenly opens. His 
boss Torrance is there. 53.

LC
What is it?

DANI
They found Brendan s car in the 
water, off the Riverside Park Boat 
Launch. There s a body inside. 

The reality travels from cop to cop as they share looks. LC 
walks to Hernandez. Puts a hand on his shoulder. 

Geddes sees Frank, not moving. As they meet eyes --

A huge tow truck backs up to the water. ANGLE ON --

The line of crime scene tape. Dani and Westwood approach from 
the other side as a UNIFORM COP walks to meet them. He 
indicates a BOAT CAPTAIN in the distance, by the water. 

UNIFORM COP

Divers have already been down

Geddes is struggling to breathe.

Frank and Torrance put on smocks and gloves. You sense Frank 
trying to hold it together as he dresses. 

TORRANCE
You think Brendan knew he was under 
investigation?

FRANK
I don t know. It fills in some 
blanks. Last couple weeks, 
Brendan s been a mess. Out of 
control, like he had a death wish 
or something... He s been tanking 
it on the job cuz he s either too 
strung out or hungover to even fake 
it. 

TORRANCE
What s your take on Westwood s 
determined suicide BS? You buy 
that?

FRANK
Brendan s been cracking. You 
shoulda seen him when we took him 
home last night. Full blown coke 
paranoia. 

TORRANCE
You think Joe Geddes knew?

FRANK

day. How the rats were on him.

WESTWOOD
He did?

GEDDES
Yeah. 

WESTWOOD

GEDDES
Last night in the restaurant. 

WESTWOOD
When?

GEDDES
At the end of the night. 

WESTWOOD

GEDDES
Yeah.  I can t keep the rats off

right before we took him home. You 
can check with Frank Agnew if you 
want, see if he remembers. 60.


As he says this, Frank walks to them, overhearing. A twinge. 
For a second, he could murder Geddes. But he stays calm. As --

WESTWOOD
You just remembered this?

GEDDES
I didn t know what he was talking 
about. I thought he was drunk and

to know he meant Internal Affairs?

MICHAEL
Too many cops. It s a cluster. 

They continue up the tracks -- downtown Detroit coming into 
focus. Michael hands Damon a detached rifle scope. They stop.

(CONT D) MICHAEL
Maybe we oughta take a step back. 
Hold off until we know the score. 61.


DAMON
No. We stay smart but we go hard 
and we take out anything in our

He raises the scope. We see, SCOPE POV --

Frank -- in the crosshairs -- standing over the body. 

Damon lowers the scope. An incredulous look. He knows Frank. 

MICHAEL

DAMON
Nothing. 

Damon raises the scope again. SCOPE POV --

Frank and Torrance inspect Brendan s body. 

Damon lowers the scope. The anger is bubbling now. 

(CONT D) DAMON

DAMON

don t kill a cop, you don t hit

many of those did he stick to?

FRANK
No wife. No kids. I know for a fact 
both his parents are dead. 63.


Torrance glances to see a MOTHER on the fringes with two BOYS 
picking through trash for cans. A beat. He seems reflective. 

TORRANCE
You know Brendan, he was Detroit 
born and bred, he was a cop... 
that s two different strains of 
cockroach. I didn t figure he could 
be killed. 

A beat. Frank indicates Westwood, nearby. 

FRANK
Well, with any luck, at least this 
shit dies with him. 

When the Uniform Cop behind them SHOUTS --

UNIFORM COP
Sir. There s somebody in the 
trunk... It looks like they were 
butchered. 

Frank and Torrance stop. Geddes, Dani and Westwood rush 
toward them. Westwood continues toward the car. Dani sees 
him, says to Frank --

DANI
It s sure as hell a legit 
investigation now. 

Frank stays quiet. Dani walks away. As Frank says to Geddes, 
quietly --

FRANK
I don t know if I can look at this. 

Dani notices but keeps moving. Frank stays rooted to the 
spot. As if the weight of everything has finally crushed him. 

Geddes joins the others as they reach --

The Lexus. Geddes leans into the trunk to examine the 
mutilated remains. He says, loud enough for Frank to hear --

GEDDES
Unidentified male. 

Which snaps Frank out of his trance. He shares a look with 
Geddes. What the fuck else is going on here? As Geddes says --

(CONT D) GEDDES
Head, hands and feet have all been 
removed. 64.

Torrance steps toward Frank. A private conversation.
