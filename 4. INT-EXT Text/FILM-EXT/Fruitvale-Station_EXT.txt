Oscar and Tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two
story house. A picture of an apple tree is painted next to
the door. Oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a
frizz in her hair. He looks back at the car.
We see that Sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down
mirror.
Oscar turns to Tatiana. He then takes her hand, and places
something inside of it.
Tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a
small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a
bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger
over his lips.
Tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile.
She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek. He stands up and
knocks on the front door.
MRS. STACY a motherly looking Black woman in her 50's opens
the door.
MRS. STACY
Good morning Tatiana!

A beautiful Black woman in her late 40's wears a UPS
manager's uniform, this is WANDA JOHNSON. She walks towards
the entrance of her store, when her cellphone rings in her
purse. She pulls it out, stressed. Answers it without
looking.
WANDA
Hello?
OSCAR
Last shot right here, you sure you
want to work on your birthday? You

WANDA
Yes, and can you pick some... are

OSCAR
Yeah Ma.
WANDA
You wearing your earpiece?
Oscar hesitates for a beat.

WANDA
Don't lie to me. That's all you

Oscar pumps his gas. He looks at a poster of Obama that reads
CHANGE, posted on the gas pump. He looks across the lot and
notices a Zales engagement ring poster.
He pulls out his phone. Starts to text.
TO SOPHINA:
WANT ME TO COME UP THERE FOR YOUR
LUNCH BREAK?
He sends it off. Closes, waits for a bit. It buzzes. He opens
it.
FROM SOPHINA:
ALREADY TOOK IT.
Oscar puts his phone back into his pocket. He turns and
begins to pump his gas. He sets the handle to automatically
pump, and looks up and notices something.

We see it is a gnarly- looking male PIT BULL sniffing around
a few feet from Oscar's tires. It looks to be maybe 3 or 4
years old. Oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over.
Oscar pets him on the head, we see its ears are a bit
scarred, but it has beautiful brown eyes. He feels around the
dog's neck- no collar. Oscar looks around for an owner for a
beat while the dog licks his hand.
CLICK- Oscar's gas tank is full. He turns away from the dog,
places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap
back in. He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see
him. He scans the block and panic strikes his face. He takes
off running towards the street.
OSCAR
Shit! No, No, No Stop!
SCHREECH... BAM! We hear it before we see it. A sickening
sound. An animal YELPS, a car SPEEDS OFF. Oscar runs into the
street chasing a car going too fast for us to see.
OSCAR (CONT'D)
(at the car)
Hey! Stop you bitch ass
Muthafucka!!
He stops, turns around, and runs over to something lying in
the street. It's the dog, and he's in bad shape. Oscar picks
the dog up out of the street, and places him on the sidewalk.
OSCAR (CONT'D)
(whispering)
Come'on boy. Come on.
The dog's breathing grows more struggled.

He bends down, closes the Dog's eyes, and heads for his car.

It is an empty parking lot next to a beautiful view of the
