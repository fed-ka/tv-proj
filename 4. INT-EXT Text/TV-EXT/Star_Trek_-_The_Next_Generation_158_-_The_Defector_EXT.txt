 (HOLODECK) 
 
 Two soldiers: JOHN BATES and MICHAEL WILLIAMS.. 
 
     WILLIAMS 
   Brother John Bates, is not that 
   the morning which breaks yonder? 
 
     BATES 
   I think it be. But we have no 
   great cause to desire the approach 
   of the day. 
 
     WILLIAMS 
   Who goes there? 
 
 King Henry ENTERS... his back to us... so we cannot 
 see who is playing him... 
 
     DATA (KING HENRY) 
   A friend. 
 
     WILLIAMS 
   Under what captain serve you? 
 
     DATA (KING HENRY) 
   Under Sir Thomas Erpingham. 
 
     WILLIAMS 
   I pray you, what thinks he of 
   our estate? 
 
 Reveal DATA... 
 
     DATA (KING HENRY) 
   Even as men wrecked upon a sand, 
   that look to be washed off the 
   next tide. 
 
     BATES 
   He hath not told his thought to 
   the king?

1    CONTINUED: 
 
     DATA (KING HENRY) 
   No, nor it is not meet he should. 
   For though I speak it to you, I 
   think the king is but a man, as 
   I am. The violet smells to him 
   as it doth to me, in his 
   nakedness he appears but a man. 
   Therefore, his fears, out of 
   doubt, be of the same relish as 
   ours are. Yet, no man should 
   possess him with any appearance 
   of fear, lest he, by showing it, 
   should dishearten his army.

 observing... delighted... 
 
     BATES 
   He may show what outward courage 
   he will, but I believe, as cold 
   a night as 'tis, he could wish 
   himself in Thames up to the neck. 
 
     DATA (KING HENRY) 
   Methinks I could not die anywhere 
   so contented as in the king's 
   company, his cause being just and 
   his quarrel honorable. 
 
     WILLIAMS 
   That's more than we know. 
 
     BATES 
   Aye, or more than we should seek 
   after. If his cause be wrong, 
   our obedience to the king wipes 
   the crime of it out of us.

     WILLIAMS 
   But if the cause be not good, the 
   king himself hath a heavy 
   reckoning to make when all those 
   legs and arms and heads chopped 
   off in a battle shall join 
   together at the latter day and 
   cry all "We died at such a place" 
   -- some swearing, some crying for 
   a surgeon, some upon their wives 
   left poor behind them. I am 
   afeared there are few die well 
   that die in a battle. 
 
     DATA (KING HENRY) 
   The king is not bound to answer 
   the particular endings of his 
   soldiers, the father of his son, 
   nor the master of his servant. 
 
     PICARD 
   Delightful... you're getting 
   better and better, Data... 
 
 Stepping out of character... 
 
     DATA 
   Freeze program. 
 
 The characters freeze. 
 
     DATA 
    (continuing) 
   Thank you, sir. I plan to study 
   the performances of Olivier, 
   Branagh, Shapiro, Kullnark... 
 
     PICARD 
    (frowns) 
   Data, you are here to learn about 
   the human condition... and there's 
   no better way than embracing 
   Shakespeare... but you must 
   discover it through your own 
   performance, not by imitating...

     RIKER'S COM VOICE 
   Riker to Picard... 
 
     PICARD 
   Yes, Number One. 
 
     RIKER'S COM VOICE 
   Sensors are picking up an 
   unidentified craft in the Neutral 
   Zone... It's heading toward 
   Federation space... 
 
     PICARD 
   On our way... Picard out. We'll 
   get to the next act later, Data... 
   computer, end program. 
 
 The other characters DISAPPEAR and shortly thereafter, 
 the set disappears, too... Data begins to take off his 
 costume. 
 
     DATA 
   It is interesting that a king 
   could pass as a commoner, but why 
   should he wish to? If he is 
   the leader... should he not be 
   leading... ? 
 
3    ANGLE 
 
 The door slides open and they EXIT... 
 
     PICARD 
   But listen to what Shakespeare 
   is telling you about the man, 
   Data... a king who has a true 
   feeling for his soldiers must 
   share their fears on the day of 
   battle. 
 
 
 The Romulan scout ship is overmatched... the warship is 
 relentless and it FIRES TORPEDOES at the smaller craft. 
 One of the torpedoes finds its mark. 
 
 
 The Enterprise is near the scout ship, which is 
 drifting. 
 
15   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 
 The Romulan warship slows as it approaches the 
 Enterprise and the scout ship, and then stops. The 
 ships face each other. 
 
 
 The two crafts in space. 
 
     PICARD (V.O.) 
   Captain's log, Stardate 43462.5. 
   We have beamed aboard an apparent 
   Romulan defector. He claims to 
   be a low ranking logistics officer 
   with extraordinary information 
   about a new secret offensive. 
 
 
 Holding position. 
 
     PICARD (V.O.) 
   Captain's log, Stardate 43463.7. 
   We are holding a position at the 
   Neutral Zone border proximate to 
   Nelvana Three. 
 
 
 Stock shot of probe being fired off. 
 
 
 Holding at the Neutral Zone border. 
 
     DATA (V.O.) 
   Second officer's log, 
   supplemental. We are prepared 
   to enter the Neutral Zone in 
   direct violation of the Treaty 
   of Algeron. 
 
 
 The ship at warp speed. 
 
 
 Entering the Nelvana system, the ship drops out of 
 warp... a stellar light revealed from a planet 
 crossing in front of the star suggests a dawning to 
 this day of battle... and the thoughtful viewer may 
 remember Shakespeare's words from the teaser. 
 
 
 The ship moves into orbit Nelvana Three. 
 
 
 Turning course... but as it turns suddenly three 
 Romulan warbirds UNCLOAK... 
 
 
 The Enterprise is struck by the torpedoes from all 
 three ships.... 
 
 
 Surrounded by the three Romulan ships... and suddenly 
 the Romulan ships are surrounded as three Klingon Birds 
 of Prey MATERIALIZE. 
 
 
 The Romulan warships DISAPPEAR. Klingon ships 
 remain.
