                                          TEASER


    EXT. STREET - MORNING

    A few live action shots of a simple fishing town gearing up 
    for the day before we come across a sign on a hill for 
    Franklin High School -- over the words,  The Fighting First 
    Mates -- Go Baiters!  andthe mascot, a sailor holding a worm.

    We first see our animation style (a mix of simplistic 
    illustration against a photographic live action background) as  
    A FEW STUDENTS ON BIKES in  Baiters  jackets laden with lumbar-
    breaking book bags struggle up the hill.

    EXT. HIGH SCHOOL TRACK -- CONTINUOUS

    Some STUDENT ATHLETES are running around the track, they pass 
    their coach who stands staring off waiting for the girl he 
    most loves.  This is LARRY (The  Nice Guy .  The smartest guy 
    at the school -- but unfortunately for all he teaches P.E.  A 
    voice of sanity despite being prone to bursts of frustrated 
    anger.)  Larry realizes too late that his students have 
    finished.

                                LARRY
                  Arg!Sorry, one more mile and this 
                  time I ll definitely use the stop 
                  watch!

    CAN GET TRANSFERRED OUT OF P.E? 

    Back to action as Larry fires a starter s pistol and the 
    exhausted kids take off for another lap.  Unfortunately a 
    moment later he realizes he s failed to start the watch again.  

    EXT. HELEN S CAR - CONTINUOUS

    ANDREW is rocking out to the radio. ( The Sissy. )  He 
    shimmies and sways and wiggles his shoulders.  HELEN ( the 
    Know It All ) is behind the wheel (tightly wound, highly 
    frustrated).  

    INT. HELEN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

    Andrew continues to undulate and we realize that the radio is 
    BLASTING AN A.M. station.We hear a familiar ad. 

                                ANNOUNCER ON RADIO
                  Head on, apply directly to the 
                  forehead, head on, apply directly to 
                  the forehead, head-on -- 

    Helen snaps off the radio.  

                                HELEN
                  Do you have to dance to everything?                                                                                        2


                                ANDREW
                  It s called Rap.  And I don t  have 
                  to.   I must.  I don t expect you to 
                  get it.  It s about feelings.  

                                HELEN
                  I have feelings.  And you re lucky 
                  I'm not a lady or I d show you what 
                  they are.

                                ANDREW
                  Yeah, right.  If you were half the 
                  man that I am woman I d make you try.

    They stare each other down, then realize.

              ANDREW (CONT D)HELEN
    Wait, who s what, now?We flipped it, I think...

                                ANDREW (CONT D)
                  Did we flip it again?

    Back to action.  Helen notices an oncoming Prius.

                      HELENANDREW
    (terrified)  Head on!(dancing) That s the spirit!

    EXT. STREET

    Helen s car narrowly misses a Prius (covered with bumper 
    stickers) coming right at them.  The cyclists from earlier 
    must also dive out of the way.

    INT. MIRACLE S PRIUS -- CONTINUOUS

    MIRACLE is driving. (Beautiful, spiritual, the  Airhead. )  
    Her field of view is crowded by all manner of spiritual totems 
    that hang from her rear view mirror and she struggles to put 
    on eye-liner.  

                                MIRACLE
                  Boy, I can t see anything because of 
                  this  God will protect me  
                    bumpersticker.But I guess that s 
                  the point, huh, Baby?  

    She turns to the baby.  Angle on a terrified baby next to 
    Miracle surreptitiously trying to steer. 

                                MIRACLE (CONT D)
                  Oh, look at you!  Steering just like 
                  grown up Mommy.  I m going to have to 
                  start buckling you in!

    She bends over completely to buckle in Baby.  The baby looks 
    deeply concerned.                                                                                      3

    EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

    WILLARD ( The Loser.  Dissolute, broken, the very essence of 
    failure) drives his car past a number of nice cars in the 
    parking lot until he reaches the faculty section, where the 
    cars are distinctly worse. 

    INT. WILLARD'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

    Willard is talking on his cell phone. 

                                WILLARD
                  And I m in trouble, you know?  If the 
                  principal finds out, I m ruined.  

                                VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.)
                  I think we should try to keep our 
                  personal lives out of this 
                  relationship.

                                WILLARD
                  But...you're my psychologist.

                  I feel ashamed.  Isn t there any
                  advice you can give me?    

                                VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.)
                  It's probably just in your head.

    EXT. TRACK -- CONTINUOUS

    The students are rounding the bend as Larry sees Miracle's car 
    pop over a curb and approach.

                                LARRY
                  Miracle!  Here we go...Today s the 
                  day you notice Larry Slimp!

    Larry joins the exhausted runners and sprints in a full-bore 
    out to the front of the pack.  He turns immediately to wave to 
    Miracle's fast approaching Prius.

                                LARRY (CONT D)
                  Okay, that s teamwork!  ( Noticing ) 
                  Oh, hey Miracle... just showing the 
                  kids how to run...Miracle?

    But Miracle s Prius is now driving straight at him.  Through 
    the sticker covered window we can barely make out the worried 
    looking eyes of Baby who tries to steer.  Larry dives out of 
    the way, causing the group of cyclists to once again go down.                                                                                      4


    EXT. PARKING LOT/INT. MIRACLE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

    Miracle s Prius rams up into her parking spot, just as she 
    gets the baby buckled in.

                                MIRACLE
                  That was a whole lot of nothing!  
                  (noticing)  Hey, do you have a fever?

    The sweat covered Baby rolls his eyes.  

    EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

    Reveal that Miracle s car is inches from Willard s.

                                WILLARD
                  Miracle, I m kind of trapped here. 

                                MIRACLE
                  Oh, that s how I felt about having a 
                  baby with no Daddy.  But the only 
                  protection any of us really need is 
                  prayer.  Right baby? 

    She crosses off as the baby shakes his head in a silent call 
    for help to Willard;  No it isn t. 

    Willard goes to put it in reverse when three black Mercedes
    Maybachspull up to a stop behind him. A driver opens the door 
    and HAPPY emerges (the "Weird one" -- We just might find out 
    that he's UdayHussein- but this is his secret... and in the 
    meantime the teachers just assume he's from Mexico.)

    Happy crosses to the trunk, tosses in his head wrap, throws on 
    a gardener s hat and nonchalantly rakes up leaves.

                                WILLARD
                  Happy... I m kind of stuck here...

    (We will hear the halting and dispassionate O.S. TRANSLATOR 
    over Happy when he speaks. Think  Saddamon trial. )

    INT. STUART'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

    The SOUNDS OF THE SPORTS CAR are now full blast as we see 
    STUART (feckless, clueless, upbeat, and disconnected;                                                                                        5


     The Nerd ) with a scarf around his neck and a pair of red and 
    blue 3-dsunglasses.  He shifts wildly, as we HEAR the engine 
    rev and race and the squealing of tires. 

    EXT. PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

    WE REVEAL that Stuart is driving incredibly slowly through the 
    lot in a small, late model Hondacivic.  

    INT. STUART'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

    THE ENGINE SOUNDS ARE NOW FULL VOLUME again as Stuart pulls 
    his car to a stop (next to and blocking Willard.)  Stuart pops 
    a tape out of the cassette deck and the ENGINE SOUNDS STOP.

    ANGLE ON the cassette, labeled "The Sounds of Nascar."  Stuart 
    looks up and notices something.  ANGLE ON a sign that reads; 
    IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO STUDENTS.  FLU SHOTS, MONDAY.  Stuart 
    approaches it and rearranges some letters. 

                                STUART
                  There.  Much funnier. 

    SUE approaches in her car. (The  Grown Up. )  

                                SUE
                  Excuse me.  That s not your spot.  
                  Perhaps you couldn t tell because of 
                  your... poor choice of eyewear.

                                STUART
                  Can you believe it?  They were just 
                  giving these away for free out of 
                  this dumpster behind the movie 
                  theater.  They really make people 
                  stick out and look kind of koo-koo, 
                  though.

                                SUE
                  Yes, I m noticing that.  I also see 
                  that you ve parked your car in the 
                  spot reserved for the principal.  And 
                  you re not the principal.  You re a 
                  man with garbage on your face. 

                                STUART
                  Oh, yes.  I thought that would be 
                  fine since the principal s still out 
                  because of the... (makes clawing air 
                  quotation mark signs) ... accident  
                  he had while wearing those... (makes 
                  clawing quotes again)... steel claws

                  ... quotation mark  signs.

                                SUE
                  Yes, well, what you perhaps don t 
                  know is that I m the acting principal 
                  in his absence.                                                                                       6


                                STUART
                  Oh, I know that, too, Sue.  Sue, may 
                  I call you Sue, Sue?

                                SUE
                  (smiles, then)  No.

                                STUART
                  Yeah, it is a little formal, Sue.  
                  Sue, is there a nickname for Sue?  
                  Something shorter than Sue, like Su--  
                  "Se", maybe.  Or (barely a sound now, 
                  yet it actually takes longer to say) 
                  "hs."  Just as a timesaver, hs?

                                SUE
                  Okay, well, why don't we start 
                    with..."Acting Principal Sezno" and 
                  once we're further into the semester 
                  we can replace you.  But right now 
                  let s move that car.

                                STUART
                  I'd love to, but once I've stopped 
                  her running she won't start again for 
                  six hours.  It's not much of a car, 
                  but you sure wouldn't know it when I 
                  have my Nascartape in.  Great!

    Stuart starts off.

                                SUE
                  Stuart, has anyone ever told you that 
                  you're completely oblivious?

                                STUART
                  Not that I'm aware of, hs.Not that 
                  I'm aware of.

    Stuart exits, right through the pile of leaves that Happy has 
    swept up, probably due to the sunglasses.  Happy seethes.

    EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

    Larry enters and in a friendly way waves to some young female 
    students. 

                                LARRY
                  Hi kids...

    They look away and quickly walk off.  Larry is confused as 
    Miracle approaches.  

                                LARRY (CONT D)
                  That was odd.

                                MIRACLE
                  It s probably because of the posters.  
                  But Sue says they re for our safety, 
                  too. 

    Miracle indicates poster that reads:   Don t tempt a teacher!  
    It could cost them their job.   Another shows a drawing of a 
    teacher, his pockets pulled out, with the words  I MIGHT SEEM 
    WORLDLY, BUT I M REALLY QUITE POOR!  (We will see several 
    others throughout the show)   

                                LARRY
                  Why do I have a feeling that this is 
                  because of Andrew.  (THEN) So... hi!

    INT. LUNCHROOM - FLASHBACK

    Miracle continues in V.O. whilewe see her approach students 
    with a STARVING ETHIOPIAN BOY (her own baby is on her back.)  
    As she refers to him passionately she makes a self-righteous 
    point of taking away her students lunches and throwing them in 
    the trash.

                  third world countries who are 
                  starving or just don't know about 
                  restaurants.

    The starving Ethiopegoes for the trash bin, but not before 
    Miracle has poured Pine Sol in after it. 

    INT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

                                LARRY
                  Wow... that s really noble of you, 
                  Miracle.  Yeah, anything.                                                                                      8


                                MIRACLE
                  Great... okay, so far that s eight 
                  students, you, me, the baby, and...

                                LARRY
                  Whoa, wait... You re not going to 
                  feed the baby?  

                                MIRACLE
                  I know, it s not going to be easy.  I 
                  was thinking of pouring pine sol on 
                  my chest. 

    The baby just puts his head in hand.

                                LARRY
                  That s idiotic.  You can t do that!  
                  Are you that stupid?!

    The baby shakes his head yes, as Miracle shakes hers  No.   

                                MIRACLE
                  Only to talk to you!  You re the 
                  worst... P.E. teacherin the world!

    She runs off. Sue approaches Larry, who feels bad. 

                                SUE
                  Larry.  I was hoping to find you.  I 
                  have some rather disturbing news 
                  about something Happy found in one of 
                  your student athlete s lockers. 

    Sue hands Larry a large pill bottle to a distracted Larry.

                                SUE (CONT D)
                  Drugs, Larry.

                                LARRY
                  Huh?  Okay, but just to help me deal 
                  with the disturbing news.

    Larry pops the top off and throws a couple in his mouth.  He 
    crosses to the water fountain.

                                LARRY (CONT'D)
                  Sho, what'dthe shtudentfind?

                                SUE
                  The drugs, Larry.  The ones in your 
                  mouth.

    Larry spits them out, aghast.

                                LARRY
                  Those were in a kid's locker?!

                                SUE
                  That's right.                                                                                      9


                                LARRY
                  I had those in my mouth!

                                SUE
                  I think you're missing some of the 
                  subtlety of my point.  There are 
                  children using drugs in this school. 

                                LARRY
                  (This hits Larry.)  Wow. (then)  And 
                  you don t think it s just a Ritalin 
                  or an Adderal... or some other 
                  approved form of child narcotic?

                                SUE
                  No, this isn t just some of run-of- 
                  the-mill pediatric anti-psychotic.  

                                LARRY
                  Well, let s not overreact.  It could 
                  just be a baby-Thorazine -- Of course 
                  it wasn t bubblegumflavored.  (then)  
                  Maybe a DarvosetJr? 

                                SUE
                  Well, look at the bottle.  See how 
                  there s no Bear with a cloud over 
                  him. 

                                LARRY
                  (agreeing) ...And no kitten with a 
                  look of confusion.

                                SUE
                  No, this isn t one of our  Drug Day  
                  give aways.

    INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - WEEKS EARLIER

    The place is decorated with banners that read  Franklin 
      High/Squibbpresents Drug Day.   The place is a zoo of vendors 
    and confused children being ushered to various areas with hand 
    made signs that read:  Anxiety disorders,   Flashbacks,   
     Digestion issues (non-Irritable Bowels),  etc.  And signs 
    advertising a host of pharmaceuticals.  Sue works a megaphone.

                                SUE
                  Again, children,  anxiety  is not the 
                  same as  depression.   If you can t 
                  choose one please head to the bi-
                  polarbooth, if you can t remember 
                  please register for an anti-attention 
                  deficit... and for the last time if 
                  you don t have a syndrome please form 
                  a line to the left and a drug rep 
                  will find one for you...

    The teachers hand out swag, balloons, etc. advertising
    heretofore undreamed of disorders and remedies.                                                                                    10


    EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

                                SUE
                  No, this isn t something we re 
                  helping sell, this is serious.  
                  Drugs.

                                LARRY
                  Wow.  They even find a way in here.

                                SUE
                  I m having Miracle in our science 
                  department take a look at it.  You 
                  obviously know her. 

    Larry is arrested by the name of the woman he loves.  

                                LARRY
                  Know her?  Please... if I were better 
                  with imagery I d call her an angel...

    As he waxes poetical WE SEE THE IMAGE he s trying to describe.  
    Miracle s face on a flying angel.

                                LARRY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  ...whose wings are...as soft as... 
                  breasts, that...grow out of 
                  her...back.  Perfectly balancing her 
                  two...front breasts... 

    The angel s breasts come into view, then her wings turn into 
    breasts, the weight of which flops her over, so she s flying 
    upside down.  She sticks her tongue out, which gestures  come 
    here  like a finger --

    INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

    Larry struggles to depict what we ve just seen -- sticking his 
    chest out, and folding his arms like chicken wings behind him 
    and inside his shirt, pointing his tongue.  Then.

                                SUE
                  And you realize she has a baby.  

                                LARRY
                  Yeah, I didn t know where to put that 
                  in there.  Maybe on one of the back 
                  breasts.  But it doesn t matter that 
                  she has a baby.  The problem is every 
                  time I try to talk to her I get so 
                  frustrated I end up lashing out.

                                SUE
                  Well, she suspects that these are 
                  performance enhancing steroids and 
                  thinks some of your athletes are 
                  taking them.

                                LARRY
                  (Lashing out) What?  What does that 
                  quad-jugged freak know about 
                  pharmacology?                                                                                      11

                                LARRY (CONT'D)
                  My kids aren't on steroids.  It's 
                  impossible.  They're crapat every 
                  sport they try.

    QUICK MONTAGE SHOWS 

    1.) A pole vaulter running to vault, but planting the pole 
    which jams him in the stomach into a stop.  Larry calmly pulls 
    it out after which the child falls over.  (a sign in the b.g.
    reads:  Start treating Weak Urinary Stream disorder beforeit 
    happens. Flospray!  500mgEr.)

    2.) Kids on the deck of a pool in water polo helmets.  Larry 
    blows a whistle and they leap into the pool not be seen again, 
    while their helmets float to the top.  Larry calmly gets out a 
    pool scooper.(sign reads: Itchy down there?  Invite in an 
    InvisiTickle! as welcome as a Doctor s index finger. )  

    3.) A boy with a rifle waits next to a skeet machine.  Larry 
    yells pull.  anda skeet flies out.  The boy shoots the 
    machine.  Larry motions calmly  give me the gun.   (sign
    reads:  Feeling left out there s no drug for you?   SIDE-
    EFFEXOR-- twice the side effects, none of the fix! Tapletor 
    Cabsule.) Back to action. 

                                LARRY (CONT D)
                  No, these are performances that have 
                  not been enhanced.  I mean we have 
                  two football players out with 
                  injuries from the last coin toss.  

                                SUE
                  That freshman with the equal-length 
                  legs is pretty good at football.  
                  That red haired kid.

                                LARRY
                    Who..."red-haired kid? 

                                SUE
                  I think that's his name.

                                LARRY
                  Well, sure he's good.  He's twenty-
                  three years old. (remembering) "Red 
                  haired Man."

                                SUE
                  That'swhat it is.

                                LARRY
                  Believe me, if I could get the other 
                  kids to play as well as he does we 
                  actually might have a shot at winning 
                  the big game on Thursday.  (then)  
                  Hey, let s give them the  roids. 
                  (off her look)  It s not exactly 
                  going to be a federal case.

    Cut to a US SENATE Yearbook.  We see a picture of George 
    Mitchell over the words.                                                                                      12

    action.  

                                SUE
                  Still, they can lead to thinning of  
                  the hair, shorten the temper, shrink 
                  the testicles... (then, realizing)  
                  Larry, do you take steroids?

                                LARRY
                  (Snapping) There s nothing wrong with 
                  my hair!  Look, Sue--you'rethe 
                  acting Principal, if our team does 
                  well this week it might generate some 
                  interest in our school.  You've been 
                  trying to raise funds for new 
                  books...

                                SUE
                  Teachers, but go on...

                                LARRY
                  If we won a game we might be able to 
                  raise some money.  Plus it might make 
                  me look like a winner to Miracle.

                                SUE
                  Well... we d have to test them on 
                  somebody first.  A faculty member -- 
                  But who s that going to be, it could 
                  make them horribly sick?

    Stuart crosses in.

                                STUART
                  Hey, Larry, hs.I thought you'd like 
                  to know.  (startsoff then) Oh, by 
                  the way, if it looks like there's a 
                  scratch on your fender, it's actually 
                  just a dent.  Great!

    Stuart exits.  

                                SUE
                  (to Larry) Well, come on.  Let's get 
                  those drugs in him.

    INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

    Willard is there with a large paper sack.  He looks guilty.  
    Stuart enters and goes to his locker.  

                                WILLARD
                  Hey, Stuart... can I grab you for a 
                  second.  Just privately.  You know, 
                  man to man.                                                                                    13


                                STUART
                  (scoffs)  Oh, sorry, I m not really 
                  into that kind of thing.  I ll watch 
                  youthough. 

                                WILLARD
                  Watch me--  No, I just meant... can 
                  we talk? 

                                STUART
                  Oh.  Sure.  I don t have any cash on 
                  me anyway.  You do that while I 
                  change.     

    Stuart starts taking off his scarf and glasses over the 
    following. 

                                WILLARD
                  Well...I was at the local newsstand 
                  this morning...

    EXT. NEWSSTAND - MORNING

    Willard, in a fake moustache guiltily and covertly grabs a 
    stack of dirty magazines. 

                                WILLARD (V.O.)
                  ...I was buying a stack of adult 
                  magazines when I ran into one of the 
                  students.  

    Willard pulls out a credit card, and license to pay.  He takes 
    off his moustache and only then finds himself staring face to 
    face with a frightened looking student. (It doesn t help that 
    Willard wears a faded shirt that reads  ConVIAGRAtulations
    Baiters! 2004. )

    INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

                                WILLARD
                  I grabbed a couple of cooking 
                  magazines but I think he noticed. 
                  God, I'm so ashamed.

                                STUART
                  Hey, there's no need to be ashamed.    
                  Everyone enjoys food.  Sure it's 
                  strange to read a magazine about it, 
                  but it's not like you were buying 
                  pornography. 

                                WILLARD
                  No...that iswhat happened.  One of 
                  the students caught me buying 
                  pornography.

                                STUART
                  Oh, I missed that.  Must have been 
                  while I was changing.  Do the story 
                  again and this time I'll really 
                  focus.                                                                                    14


    Stuart  focuses.   Willard is exasperated.

                                WILLARD
                  One of the students caught me buying 
                  pornography. 

                                STUART
                  Got it that time!  (highfive, then)  
                  No, you should definitely be ashamed 
                  of that.  You had it right. 

                                WILLARD
                  I'm a lonely man, okay?  And if this 
                  gets out, I m ruined.  And you know 
                  how kids spread lies.  Especially 
                  when they re true.  

                                STUART
                  (tch.) Kids.  (then)  All right, well 
                  this is an easy one.  You just avoid 
                  being in any place where Sue is that 
                  there are also students.

                                WILLARD
                  But... I m a teacher here.  

                                STUART
                  That show I know you!

                                WILLARD
                  Look, Sue s been looking for another 
                  reason to get rid of me -- I m one 
                  month away from tenure.  She s never 
                  been in favor of the German 
                  requirement at this school.

                                STUART
                  I didn t even know kid s learned 
                  German here.

                                WILLARD
                  No one ever actually has.  Which is 
                  probably something else she s going 
                  to try to use against me.  I don t 
                  know... maybe I am too old to still 
                  be connecting with the kids.  (then)  
                  Dammit, why didn t I sign up for the 
                  internet when I got that shiny free 
                  coaster thingy in the mail! (then)  
                  Can you just throw the magazines out 
                  for me?  No one knows you. You ll be 
                  fine. 

    Stuart puts out his hand.  A relieved Willard hands Stuart the 
    bag.  Stuart flips through and focuses on one picture in 
    particular.

                                WILLARD (CONT D)
                  Thanks, Stuart.  Just keep my name 
                  out of it.  If anyone asks...                                                                                    15


                                STUART
                  Hey, I don t know what the hell this 
                  is.

    Willard smiles and pats him on the back, then takes off.  
    Stuart continues to stare at the picture deeply confused.

                                STUART (CONT D)
                  (deeply confused)  I mean, what the 
                  hell is that thing?

    Stuart puts on the his 3-dglasses. 

                                STUART (CONT D)
                  (then, delighted)  Oh, it s a dog s 
                  nipple!

    Stuart looks up surprised to see Willard gone and some 
    students standing before him.

                                STUART (CONT D)
                  Oh, this is just Willard 
                    Deutschebog'sporn. 

    He smiles at the kids.  They look nervous.  He flips the 
    picture around to show them.  They look horrified.  A beat.  
    He turns the picture to us.  It s pretty awful.  (chyron

    EXT. FRANKLIN HIGH - LATER THAT DAY/INT. CLASSROOM - LATER 
    THAT DAY

    Students sit quietly in an empty class room.  They listen to 
    Sue over the P.A. system.

                                SUE (OVER P.A.)
                  ...sowhile faculty attend this 
                  mandatory meeting, students are 
                  encouraged to sit quietly in prayer.  

    INT. TEACHER S LOUNGE - DAY

    The teachers are there.  Sue speaks into a P.A. mic.

                                SUE 
                  For those of you who are  separation 
                  of Church and State  buffs, please 
                  feel free to engage in evolution.   

                                MIRACLE
                  Evolution.  There s a concept I wish 
                  I could believe in.

                                SUE
                  Well, the good news is you re just 
                  the science teacher.  Now if we can 
                  get this  law of gravity  repealed it 
                  can pretty much just be a free 
                  period.                                                                                     16


                                STUART
                  More time for us to float around.

                                SUE
                  Anyway, thank you for coming.  I know 
                  that Principal Kevin never made you 
                  go to meetings, but as you know, 
                  Kevin is still recuperating from his 
                  (air quotes)  lacerations.   

    The teachers grimace and recall the horror.

                                ANDREW
                  I should have never tried to adapt 
                  Edward Scissorhandsfor the stage.  
                  He completely ruined my show.

                                HELEN
                  Well, it was more like a tie.  
                  Anyway, I m on the job and I m trying 
                  to clean up some of his mess.  As you 
                  may know we didn t exactly  kick ass  
                  with regard to  No Child Left Behind  
                  standards.  

                                STUART
                    (Instinctively barking) Kick ass!  

    All cheer.

                                SUE
                  Okay, my fault, I should never have 
                  used such provocative language.  The 
                  point is they ve cut back our 
                  funding.  

    Larry enters.

                                SUE (CONT D)
                  To that end, we have the big game 
                  Thursday.  And we need to win, so I'm 
                  assigning Stuart Proszakianto work 
                  with Larry as the assistant coach.  
                  Larry, do you have those  vitamins  
                  for Stuart? 

                                LARRY
                  Right here. 

    Sue winks to Larry.  Larry winks back, then turns to look at 
    Stuart.  Stuart winks at Larry.  Larry looks confused.

                                SUE
                  I want everyone to show his or her 
                  support and be at that game.  
                  Teachers and students.  Any 
                  questions?

                                WILLARD
                  Does that include teachers?                                                                                    17


                                SUE
                  Yes, Willard, it does.  I should have 
                  mentioned that.

    Willard looks to Stuart, worried.  Stuart calms him with a 
    wink.  Sue notices the wink and looks at Stuart. Stuart winks 
    at her, then indicates Willard should do the same.  He 
    reluctantly does so. 

                                ANDREW
                  You know, Stuart's new here.  I 
                  should be Larry s assistant coach.  
                  I m the one who really knows him.  
                  His ups and downs.  His ins and outs.  
                  His chest, neck, hips, and pecks.

                                SUE
                  What s your point, Andrew.

                                ANDREW
                  I should be the assistant coach.  I 
                  mean, I know what the man looks like 
                  naked for God's sake.

                                LARRY
                  You do? 

                                ANDREW
                  Well, not yet--butthat just supports 
                  my point. 

                                SUE
                  No, I'd like Stuart to spend some 
                  time with Larry.

    Andrew fumes in jealousy, and shoots daggers at Stuart.  
    Stuart winks to Andrew in response.  Andrew, unable to resist, 
    winks back to Stuart, hating himself for the weakness.

                                SUE (CONT D)
                  But we still need money.  Now it s 
                  come to my attention that in 1991 
                  there was a time capsule planted on 
                  this campus.  

    EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - 1991

    Students are gathered around a principal at a podium 
    surrounded by an array of microphones.  Chyronreads: 1991, 
    but the scene is strangely 19th century.  Stove pipe hats, 
    handlebar moustaches, megaphone-y voices.

                                PRINCIPAL
                  It s been a tough year for all of us.   
                  We ve been at war in Iraq.  
                    Transitioningfrom Bush to Clinton.  
                  The beginning of a huge recession.  
                  And a baseball player at the center 
                  of a scandal that broke our hearts.                                                                                    18

                                STUART
                  God, what a crazy time.  What must 
                  that have been like?!

    EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - 1991

                                PRINCIPAL
                  To help us enshrine this capsule of a 
                  time we hope never to return to -- a 
                  pair of celebrities who will never 
                  let us down:  Mr. andMrs. Milli 
                  Vanilli.

    The crowd goes wild as Faband Morvantake the stage in period 
    dress, but with dreadlocks. 

                                MILLI

    The students narrow their eyes noticing the boys are out of 
    sync.

                                SUE (V.O.)
                  The capsule was packed with items 
                  thought soon to be rare.

    Cut to students with late eighties hair packing a time capsule 
    with a sandwich, some pennies, a kitten, and a bottle of wine.

                                SUE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  I m told that among them was a bottle 
                  of Dry Creek Chardonnay that today 
                  might well be worth thousands. 

    The capsule is lowered into a hole.

                                SUE
                  So I'll shortly be assigning someone 
                  to dig for the time capsule. (a 
                  moment, then) Helen, you'll be 
                  digging for the time capsule.

                                HELEN
                  No fair.

                                SUE
                  I m sorry, Helen.  But you re the 
                  librarian.  And should something 
                  happen to you God Forbid we could 
                  always start just using Google.

                                HELEN
                  That s not true.  I also have 
                  philosophy seminars.                                                                                      19

                                HELEN (CONT'D)
                  We had an amazing night discussing 
                  the meaning of reality.

    INT. LIBRARY - WEEKS EARLIER

    Helen is before the students.

                                HELEN
                  So what is reality?  Well, to help us 
                  answer that please welcome Fox 
                  programming executive, Mike Darnell.

    Mike takes the podium.

                                MICHAEL
                  Okay, you ve all filled out your 
                  releases, now who s ready to try out 
                  for  Who s Tougher than a Five Foot 
                  Millionaire? 

    The kids look confused.  Mike notices one has a sandwich and 
    dives for it, but Miracle has appeared and covered it with 
    pine sol.

                                SUE
                  Nonetheless, Helen, you ve been 
                  chosen.  Of course you will most 
                  likely be missing the game.  

                                HELEN
                  Great, first the Daytime Emmysparty 
                  gets cancelled and now this. 

                                MIRACLE
                  You know, for what it s worth, I ve 
                  heard that this school is built on an 
                  old Micmac Indian burial ground
                  so there s always the chance that 
                  you ll unlock the secrets of living 
                  your life over again.

                                HELEN
                  (more annoyed)  Great, so I ll have 
                  to dig for it twice. 

                                WILLARD
                  You know, I don t mind missing the 
                  game.  I can dig for it.

                                SUE
                  Oh, please, you wouldn t know which 
                  end of the shovel to hold.

                                WILLARD
                  Which end of the what, now?

                                SUE
                  So.  Anything else?                                                                                     20


                                STUART
                  Yeah, I just wanted to say that I'm 
                  really glad that we're winking in 
                  these meetings now because it makes 
                  it a lot of fun.  And I can't say I 
                  completely get whywe're winking, but 
                  let's just keep it up.  Great!  
                  (winks.No reaction.  A moment, 
                  then)  Okay, I see no one's winking 
                  anymore and I just wanted to say that 
                  I'm secretly glad we've stopped 
                  because I never quite  got  why we 
                  were doing it in the first place.

    Larry reenters with pill bottle as teachers file out. 

                                SUE
                  Larry, you better go easy on the 
                  steroids.  Stuart's starting to act a 
                  little unstable.

                                LARRY
                  I haven't given them to him yet.

                                SUE
                  Okay, well let's get moving on that.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    21


                                        ACT TWO

    EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - LATER

    Students practice in the extreme foreground while Larry and 
    Stuart watch from the sidelines.

                                LARRY
                  This is unbelievable.  These guys 
                  just keep getting worse. (calling
                  out)  Come on!  Stay on your man!  
                  He's only twenty-three for God's 
                  sake.

    Larry shares a look of disbelief with Stuart, who joins in.

                                STUART
                  Don't look at him!  Look at me!  
                  That's right, now look at him!  Now 
                  wave to him!  Okay, wave to that 
                  other guy!  Where are the smiles, 
                  gentleman?

    Stuart shares a look of disbelief with Larry.

                                LARRY
                  You've never coached before, have you 
                  Stuart?    

                                STUART
                  Not technically.  I've coated things.  
                  With VapoRubor what have you, but to 
                  me that s not exactly the same as 
                   coaching.   

                                LARRY
                  But, you feel okay?

                                STUART
                  Oh, I feel great.  I think it was 
                  those vitamins you gave me.

                                LARRY
                  Good, and how do your testicles feel?

    Stuart reflects.  We see a series of three quick cutaways. 

    1.) INT. CLASSROOM. Stuart walks into the corner of metal 
    desk, crotch first.  No reaction.  

    2.) EXT. COURTYARD. Stuart borrows a skateboard from a kid and 
    attempts to good-naturedly ride down a handrail, like the 
    others.  The board slips away and Stuart slams down crotch 
    first and slides the remainder rimming onto a trash can with 
    the words  Evapo-TAB!The System-Wide Sniffle Stopper!  ...if 
    you can blink or swallow, you re not taking Evapo-TAB.     

    3.) EXT. FIELD.  Stuart is coaching when a wild-eyed Mike 
    Darnellrushes up with a camera crew and kicks him in the 
    nuts.  Back to present.                                                                                    22


                                STUART
                  You know, they really don t.  I got a 
                  little bit of a tickle when that 
                  three-quarter scale programming 
                  genius launched a Ferragamointo my 
                  yam-sack... but no...  I guess the 
                  vapo-rub sdoing it s job. (then)  
                  Thanks for asking.

    Stuart hugs Larry.  Larry looks confused.  We rack focus to 
    find Andrew watching, seething.  

    INT. SUE'S OFFICE  - LATER

    Sue is talking into a Dictaphone, when Andrew enters.

                                SUE
                  ...also the staff needs to know that 
                  my door is always open...

                                ANDREW
                  Acting Principal Sezno?Can I talk 
                  to you for a second?

    Sue holds up a polite finger while she finishes her thoughts.

                                SUE
                  ...so have Happy install a locking 
                  latch so people don't just come in 
                  unannounced.

    Sue clicks off the Dictaphone, then answers Andrew s question.  

                                SUE (CONT'D)
                  No.

                                ANDREW
                  I'd like to work with the girls.

                                SUE
                  Well, that's a change.

                                ANDREW
                  The cheerleaders.  I told them I'll 
                  be taking over the squad.

                                SUE
                  Oh, Andrew.  Must you have?

                                ANDREW
                  I don't "must I have'd"  I have to'd. 
                  I want to contribute, not that I'm 
                  saying I'm a better rallierthan 
                  Stuart, but obviously he does 
                  something for Larry.  I've also 
                  offered to do things for Larry, but 
                  he's obviously not fluent in the 
                  language of double-entendre.Or 
                  "saying something that's secret or 
                  super-sexy, but that seems regular."                                                                                    23


                                SUE
                  I'm familiar with the term.

                                ANDREW
                  Oh, goody.  So, have I not your 
                  blessing?  

                                SUE
                  No.

                                ANDREW
                  I'll take that as a yes!  Isn't it 
                  funny how when you speak 
                  grammatically correct it sometimes 
                    wouldn t vehad hadn t a sound 
                  incorrect?

    Andrew shake his head at the wonderful puzzle of it and exits.  
    Sue returns to the Dictaphone.

                                SUE
                  Let's also get Andrew on steroids.

    INT. CLASSROOM - LATER THAT WEEK

    Willard is drilling his German class.

                                WILLARD
                  Again guys, come on.  It s been a 
                  whole semester and we re not even out 
                  of the A s.   Auf Wiedersehen.   One 
                  of the most basic German phrases 
                  there is.   Goodbye.   

                                STUDENTS
                  (barely) Goodbye.

                                WILLARD
                  No, that was the English.  And some 
                  of you got that wrong.  Just  Auf ... 
                  Say  Auf  

                                STUDENTS
                  (various, lifeless) Auf...

                                WILLARD
                  Auf!

                                STUDENTS
                  Auf.  Auf...

    Stuart is passing the class and looks in to see the students 
    say their  Auf s.  He bursts through the door, outraged.

                                STUART
                  How dare you laugh at this man!  Your 
                  laughter makes me sick!  It doesn't 
                  even sound like laughter!  Yes, Mr. 
                  Deutschebogbuys pornography!                                                                                      24

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                  Yes, he's chosen some obscure titles 
                  like "Nothing but Fuzz," "Wet and 
                  Jiggly" and "Giant Prawns."  But he s 
                  a homely little gripper and you have 
                  no right to judge him!

    Stuart storms out.  Willard is stunned.  Stuart bursts back in 
    looking through the sack of pornography.

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                  Sorry, "Giant Prawns" is one of his 
                  cooking magazines.  So, instead of 
                  that one let's say... (riffles 
                  through titles)   Squatting.  

    Stuart exits.  The students explode in laughter.

    ANGLE ON: Stuart outside the door. 

                                STUART (CONT D)
                  At least that sounds like laughter.

    EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS

    Helen is surrounded by several holes that she's dug.  Sue 
    approaches.  

                                SUE
                  Hello, Helen.  Any luck?

                                HELEN
                  Oh, please.  I know that you get off 
                  on making me look foolish.

                                SUE
                  There's nothing foolish about digging 
                  holes, Helen.  Lots of bugs and 
                  stupid people and small rodents do it 
                  every day and they're certainly not 
                  foolish except for the stupid people.

                                HELEN
                  You just don t want me at the game.

                                SUE
                  Of course I don t.  You re the reason 
                  we had to put up all these stupid 
                  signs.

    Sue gestures to a banner;  DON T LET A TEACHER GIVE YOU AN 
     F : It won t be a great time, When you end up on Dateline. 

                                HELEN
                  Okay!  I m sorry!  I flirted a little 
                  bit with a student!  I was going to 
                  surprise him.

                                SUE
                  You spent three days in his locker!                                                                                    25


                                HELEN
                  Well, obviously that wasn t my 
                  original plan.

    INT. LOCKER - DAY FLASHBACK

    A nervous Helen is crouched.  We hear footsteps approaching.

    INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

    Mamoudwith a fumigation tank on his bank sprays past a row of 
    lockers.  We hear a THUMP from within one of them.  

    EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

                                HELEN
                  Besides, he s in his twenties.  I 
                  think his son goes here!

                                SUE
                  Just find the capsule.  I thought you 
                  were going to ask Happy to help you.

                                HELEN
                  I did.  He started digging a hole 
                  with a backhoe and I haven't seen him 
                  since.  He's just making one giant 
                  hole.  God knows where he is now.

    INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

    Happy is digging horizontally now and comes to something hard.  
    He brushes the dirt off what appears to be a sign.

    ANGLE ON: Sign.  It reads "MICMAC INDIAN BURIAL TEMPLE (AND 
    KINO!)SECRETS OF IMMORTALITY CONTAINED WITHIN.  DO NOT 
    ENTER!"  

    Music swells as we fade out.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    26


                                      ACT THREE

    INT.  TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

    Happy reads the sign "MYSTICAL INDIAN BURIAL TEMPLE.  SECRETS 
    OF IMMORTALITY CONTAINED WITHIN.  DO NOT ENTER!"

    He doesn't.  Instead, unfazed, he begins digging in another 
    direction.

    EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS WITH BEFORE

    Helen is there with Sue.

                                HELEN
                  I have no idea where he is now.

                                SUE
                  Probably half way to that vulnerable 
                  chemical plant down the hill.

                                HELEN
                  Boy for a Mexican he sure can dig a 
                  bunker.

    INT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - LATER THAT DAY

    Stuart and Larry are returning from the field.

                                LARRY
                  Well, that was another disastrous 
                  practice.

                                STUART
                  Yes, but on the plus side I think 
                  I've got the defensive linemen being 
                  a lot more open and, frankly, a lot 
                  less defensive.

    Larry notices Miracle across the way.

                                LARRY
                  Oh, great.  There she is.  Miracle.  
                  An angel whose eyes are like...lips 
                  sucking on my...soul's neck.

                                STUART
                  Really?  I could never get my wife to 
                  do that.

                                LARRY
                  I wish I knew how to talk to her.  
                  But I always end up blowing it like 
                  the stupid PEteacher that I am.

                                STUART
                  Really?  I could never get my PE
                  teacher to do that.  Look, maybe it's 
                  just the vitamins talking, but you 
                  want to see this girl, you know?                                                                                      27

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                    And...(tearing up) she probably wants 
                  to see you... (more tears) and I want 
                  to see you see her and watchthe love 
                  happen!

    Stuart is overcome.

                                LARRY
                  You're really a good guy, you know 
                  that Stuart?

                                STUART
                  ...or I could maybe film it, so I ve 
                  got a copy, in case one of us is ever 
                  unavailable, but you need to tell her
                  how you feel! 

    Stuart sobs.  Then pops some vitamins.  Larry looks concerned.  
    And a little guilty.

                                LARRY
                  Listen, Stuart... I don t feel right 
                  about this.  There's something I 
                  didn't tell you about those vitamins 
                  before.  They're actually drugs.   
                  Happy found them in a kid's locker.

    Stuart spits them out.

                                STUART
                  A locker!  Did Sue put you up to 
                  this?

                                LARRY
                  Okay, now you're being paranoid.  But 
                  yes, she did.  

                                STUART
                  Well, they re probably just mega-
                  sedatives, or anti-sociopaths.  Was 
                  there a sleepy looking raccoon on the 
                  bottle? 

                                LARRY
                  No, we think they re steroids.  Look, 
                  I feel awful about it.  But she made 
                  me try them out on you before we 
                  could give them to the kids -- to 
                  help them win. 

                                STUART
                  Well, I guess if it's for the kids.  
                  But isn't it true they cause birth 
                  defects?

                                LARRY
                  Only in babies.

                                STUART
                  Well, as long as I'm out of the 
                  danger zone.  (then, all bravado) Now 
                  go.  Talk to that girl!                                                                                    28


    Stuart sends Larry off, who approaches Miracle. 

                                LARRY
                  Oh, hey Miracle.  

                                MIRACLE
                  Hi.  Here's a list of all the 
                  students that are involved in the 
                  four day famine.  Just in case some 
                  are in your class.

    Larry looks at the list.

                                LARRY
                  That's a familiar name.

                                MIRACLE
                  Oh, yeah.  He's been here for years.  
                  He's a freshman.

                                LARRY
                  With red hair?  (offnod)  You've got 
                  "Red Haired Man" on your famine?  
                  (readson) You've got half of my 
                  football team on this list.  No 
                  wonder they've been so lethargic.  
                  Why would you do this?

                                MIRACLE
                  Look, Larry.  I'm idealistic, okay?  
                  That means I believe in doing things 
                  that are unrealistic or have no 
                  effect.  That's whoIam!

                                LARRY
                  But this was our chance to shine.  
                  You've destroyed this with your 
                  stupid famine!  You idiot!  You're a 
                  total idiot!

    Miracle runs off, upset.  Stuart approaches.

                                STUART
                  So, did you tell her how you feel 
                  about her?

    Larry realizes that he forgot.

                                LARRY
                  Oh, shoot.

    Larry looks after her, but she's gone.  Stuart pops another 
    pill.  Then cries.  Larry looks concerned.

    EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - THAT NIGHT

    The game is underway and not going well.  Sue approaches 
    Helen, who is feverishly digging.                                                                                    29


                                SUE
                  Helen, you know that if you'd like to 
                  take a break and watch the game I'd 
                  be happy to let you stay late and get 
                  back to the digging.

    Helen looks up from her latest pit.  She's muddy and loving 
    it. 

                                HELEN
                  I've never felt more alive! 

                                SUE
                  Oh, great.  Well, then keep up the 
                  digging.

    ANGLE ON Stuart: who has arrived and spots Willard who is 
    keeping a low profile out of the view of the students.  Stuart 
    waves him over.  Willard nervously waves him off - pointing to 
    Sue nearby.  Stuart waves him over again.  Willard shakes his 
    head and indicates "no".  Stuart calls out.

                                STUART
                      Deutschebog!Willard!  Come over 
                  here!  Willard Deutschebog!Willard 
                    Deutschebogthe German teacher!

    We hear a murmur from the students.  Willard rushes out to 
    keep Stuart from drawing more attention.

                                WILLARD
                  What.

                                STUART
                  Mission accomplished.

                                WILLARD
                  Great.

    Willard starts off.

                                STUART
                  I got rid of that "package" we talked 
                  about.

                                WILLARD
                  Wonderful.

    Willard starts off again.

                                STUART
                  They'll never find it in a hundred 
                  years.

    Stuart raises his hands to high five, but Willard s gone. 

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                  (calling after)  Um...you're welcome 
                  for hiding your porno, Willard!

    Stuart storms off in a huff.  Willard looks up, concerned.                                                                                    30


    ANGLE ON: Students in the stands.  They begin chanting in 
    unison;

                                STUDENTS
                  Porno!  Porno!  Porno!  Porno!

    Amid the chanting, Willard notices Sue approaching.  Trying to 
    cover up the situation, Willard joins in the chanting, but 
    slowly changes the stress on the chant.

                                WILLARD
                  Porno! Porn-no! Porn! No Porn!  No 
                  Porn!  No Porn!  ( notices  Sue) Oh, 
                  hi, Sue.  Never too early to keep the 
                  kids away from the horrors of 
                  pornography.

                                SUE
                  I see.  Well, keep up the weird work.

    ANGLE ON Larry, watching his athletes play football in the 
    extreme foreground.  

                                LARRY
                  Come on guys, don't let the hunger 
                  get to you.   The score is tied.  We 
                  can win this thing.

    A HOT DOG VENDOR passes by.

                                HOT DOG VENDOR
                  Hot dogs!  Moist hot delicious hot 
                  Hot Dogs.

    ANGLE ON: Football field.  The RED HAIRED MAN is about to 
    release the football, but, famished, looks up to hot dog 
    vender instead.  He is immediately and brutally tackled.

    ANGLE ON: Stuart approaches Larry.  

                                LARRY
                  Oh, come on.  Don't look over here!

                                STUART
                  Yeah, look at the other guy!  Now 
                  look over here!  Now tell him how you 
                  feelabout him. 

    Stuart stifles a cry. 

                                LARRY
                  Maybe, I should have given them the 
                  steroids.  They just didn't seem to 
                  work for you.

                                STUART
                  Well, maybe they just need a little 
                    encouragement.  A little support.  
                  You shouldn't be afraid to show them 
                  your feminine side.                                                                                    31


    Stuart takes off his jacket and it becomes clear that he has 
    developed female breasts which are visible through his shirt.  
    Larry notices.  Stuart hasn't.

                                LARRY
                  Right.

                                STUART
                  We've all got a feminine side, you 
                  know.

                                LARRY
                  I've heard that said.

    ANGLE ON: Andrew coaching a few listless and lethargic 
    cheerleaders -- a few sneeze.

                                ANDREW
                  Come on, what's the matter with you?  
                  We're in the final moments of the 
                  game here. (offsneeze) And that s 
                  enough with the sneezing!  What, did 
                  no one get their flu shots?  

    A CHEERLEADER passes out.

                                ANDREW (CONT'D)
                  All right, I'm going to show these 
                  students what rallying really is.  
                  And I just might show "assistant 
                  coach" Stuart while I'm at it.

    Andrew struts out to the foot of the stands.  He stands stock 
    still for a moment, arms at his sides, then.

                                ANDREW (CONT'D)
                  Hit it!

    We hear a click and then the sounds of a radio Announcer.

                                RADIO ANNOUNCER
                  Head on, apply directly to the 
                  forehead!  Head on, apply directly to 
                  the forehead!  Head on...

    Andrew commences a funky dance.  

                                ANDREW
                  (to self) Come on, notice me. Notice 
                  me!

    The students stare off at something in the distance.

                                ANDREW (CONT'D)
                  What... What's everybody looking at.

    Andrew looks over to see Stuart, who has grabbed a megaphone 
    and is calling to the crowd.                                                                                    32


                                STUART
                  Come on, guys.  Let's show the boys 
                  what we think of them.  Jump up and 
                  down, everybody!

    Stuart jumps up and down, his new breasts freely swinging.

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                  Let's shake those shoulders people!

    The crowd is in shock.  Stuart shakes his shoulders now in 
    SLOW MOTION.

                                ANDREW
                  Well, I can t compete with that.  
                  (then)  But I can ask it out.

    Andrew crosses off to do so. 

    ANGLE ON: Football field.  An OPPOSING ATHLETE is distracted 
    by Stuart s energetic pendulousness.  He drops the ball and a 
    red haired Baiter scoops it up and runs the ball the other 
    way.

                                LARRY
                  It's working, Stuart.  We've got the 
                  ball.  We could win this!

    The Baiter tears down field with the ball.  The teachers cheer 
    and hoot.  They're going to win!

    Suddenly the Red Haired Man drops deep into a sinkhole, and 
    the football scatters.  The OPPOSING ATHLETE grabs the ball 
    and now takes it all the way to the other end of the field.

    Happy peers out from the hole.

                      HAPPYTRANSLATOR
    Melema bis  a-aba sho kar ma-(dispassionate) I still remain 
    he-ofa... Sha-vach!in the arena of thethe *
                                                  infidels.  Defecation.

    Happy crosses off, unhappy.

                                LARRY (CONT D)
                  We don't have a chance.  There's no 
                  one on the field to stop them.

    Suddenly, and seemingly from nowhere, an over-vitalized Helen 
    charges at the opposing athlete and tackles him on the five 
    yard line.  The whistle blows.  The game is over.

    All the teachers join in the celebration.  Stuart leaps as 
    Happy passes.  

                                HAPPY
                  (broken English)  Nice breast.

                                STUART
                  That s odd.  (then)  I guess  breast  
                  is Spanish for  ass.                                                                                     33


    Back to the celebration.  All are chanting  We won!  We won! 

                                LARRY
                  We won!  We won!

    INT. TEACHER S LOUNGE - THE NEXT DAY

    Sue is addressing the faculty.  Helen is absent.

                                SUE
                  No, it turns out we lost.  Apparently 
                  there's some sort of State athletic 
                  standard that disallows game winning 
                  tackles by school librarians.  

                                LARRY
                  I was actually surprised to see that 
                  had come up before. 

                                ANDREW
                  This was my fault.  I should have 
                  done more work with the cheerleaders.

                                LARRY
                  It wasn't your fault, Andrew.  If 
                  anything it was that moron Miracle's 
                  fault with her thick-headed famine.

    Miracle hangs her head ashamed.  Larry mouths "I love you."

                                STUART
                  Besides Andrew, you did a great job.  
                  You know how kids are.  They don't 
                  want quality dance.  At that age they 
                  just want to stare at my heaving 
                  breasts.  (then)  Well, these are 
                  new. 

                                SUE
                  Yes, I think I've gotten to the 
                  bottom of this.  It seems Miracle 
                  misidentified some pills that Stuart 
                  was taking as steroids, when, in 
                  fact, they were female hormone 
                  replacements.

                                MIRACLE
                  That's the word I was looking for.

                                SUE
                  Of course we still don't know who 
                  they belonged to.  And we certainly 
                  don't want to embarrass anyone.

    Helen enters covered in mud holding a bound package.

                                HELEN
                  I found the time capsule!

    The Teachers cheer as Helen starts cutting it open.                                                                                    34


                                SUE
                  Nice job, Helen.  Oh, by the way, 
                  when you were crouching in that boys 
                  locker you left your hormone 
                  replacement pills.

                                HELEN
                  Oh, yeah...I stopped taking those.  
                  (then)  I guess that explains my 
                  recent love of tackling and digging.

                                STUART
                  So, if I stop taking the pills these 
                  hideous breasts will go away?

                                SUE
                  I assume so.

    A moment as Stuart thinks about this.  Then proudly decides;

                                STUART
                  Then I'm going to stop taking them.

    Sue rolls her eyes.  Helen has unwrapped the package.

                                HELEN
                  I give you, the time capsule.

    Applause as Sue reaches in and pulls out some magazines.  She 
    reads the titles, appalled.

                                SUE
                  "Pacific Rim?"..."The Knob 
                      Hobbyist?"..."Spurts Illustrated?"

                                STUART
                  Wow.  I can't believe you found that 
                  so quickly.  I just had Happy bury 
                  all that pornography yesterday for 
                  Willard.

    All eyes turn to a feebly defensive Willard.

                                WILLARD
                  Actually, "Pacific Rim" is a cooking 
                  magazine.

                                SUE
                  Oh, Willard.  You poor lonely man.  
                  (then)  You're fired.

    Willard is devastated.  He looks to Stuart.  Stuart winks.

                                  END OF ACT THREE
