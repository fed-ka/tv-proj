      EXT.  FIRST YORK PLAZA - MORNING11

      Close on a MAN.  Agitated, WILD-EYED.  SHOUTING.

                                  GUNMAN
                    Ostavi me na miru!

      Pull back: he's pressing a GUN to a WOMAN'S neck.

                                  GUNMAN (CONT'D)
                    Ja cu je ubiti!  Ne priazite!

      Pull back further: 

      He's in a PUBLIC SQUARE.  Surrounded by COPS, ONLOOKERS, 
      REPORTERS.  It's Chaos.  Squad Cars, dozens of drawn GUNS.

      A Strategic Response Unit cop in TACTICAL UNIFORM, tense but 
      composed, tries to reason with the Gunman.

                                  SRU NEGOTIATOR
                    You know why we're all here? It's 
                    about helping you.  Do you 
                      understand?  Help.  But you.  You 
                    have to put... the gun... down.  

                                  GUNMAN
                    Ja cu je ubiti!  Ne priazite!  

                                  SRU NEGOTIATOR

                    'Gun down'.  Give me 'gun down.'
                          (to Gunman)
                    Ostavi pitolj.

                                  GUNMAN
                    Prvo njima reci!

                                  SRU NEGOTIATOR
                          (into radio)
                    Give me 'We want to help.'
                          (to Gunman)
                    Hocemo vam pomoci.  Hocemo vam 
                    pomoci.  

      The Gunman continues to scream.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                              Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  2.

      Sound of A HORN BLARING, LOUD.

      EXT.  SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING66

      A POWERFUL MALE HAND presses a car's horn.

      WORDSWORTH, 30s, waits in a suburban driveway, impatient.  
      He's an SRU cop in street clothes.  A boxer-nosed hoser, 
      built like a truck, with a surprisingly gentle soul.  

                                  WORDSWORTH
                    Eddiiiie!                                              Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  5.


      INT.  ED'S LIVING ROOM / KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING77

      Father and son finish breakfast.  The car HONKS outside. 

      ED LANE (30s), shovels in his food.  He's powerfully built, a 
      handsome man, outgoing, competitive.  A good guy who's worked 
      hard to get where he is.  An alpha male who's not afraid to 
      let the rest of the world know it.

                                  ED 
                    I gotta go.  That's my ride.

      He sneaks the last sausage off his son's plate. 

      CLARK (13) is fine-boned, shaggy-haired, and bespectacled, in 
      the Harry Potter vein.

      Clark retaliates.  Snatches his dad's last piece of toast.  
      Both enjoying the game.

                                  SOPHIE 
                    I don't understand.  You knew about 
                    this.  

      SOPHIE, 36, is fair-haired, Polish, petite, and fiery.  A 
      strong woman, but just a little worn down living the cop's 
      wife life of constant compromise.

                                  ED
                    Tell your folks I really wish I 
                    could.  But I don't have a choice 
                    here.  It's the thing for Barney.  
                    His retirement.

      Clark makes himself scarce.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Jakub and Dorota are flying in, Dad 
                    wants to show you off a little.  
                    Clark's quartet is going to play-- 

      In the LIVING ROOM:  Clark starts sawing out SCALES on his 
      CELLO. 

                                  ED
                      Anniversaries happen every year.  
                    That's what they're for.  This is a 
                      retirement.  Happens once.  It's 
                    not something I can miss.

                                  ED
                    Gotta go.   

      He strides through into the living room, grabbing a sports 
      bag.  

                                  ED (CONT'D)
                          (to Clark)

                          (not looking up)
                    Or not.

      Ed's halfway out the door--

                                  SOPHIE
                    Ed.  

      Ed turns.

                                  SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                    The world's not going to end if you 
                    and your buddies skip a few 
                    pushups.  

                                  ED 
                    Alright.  Hang on.

      Ed leans out the front door and makes a hand-signal at 
      Wordsworth: the universal 'yap-yap' sign for nagging wife.  

                                  SOPHIE

      INT.  SUBWAY.  SAME TIME.99

      A subway train, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, on an ordinary

      People read, doze, stare into space, dulled by early morning 
      routine.  All except one MIDDLE-AGED MAN, fair-haired, 50s.

      He's alert, edgy.  Shifts around a lot.  Like he's 
      uncomfortable.  Or in a hurry.

      It's the Gunman - GORAN TOMASIC.                                              Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  8.


      INT.  STATION CONCOURSE - MOMENTS LATER1010

      Commuters swarm off the train, folding their newspapers.  
      Office workers line up for coffees in a bustling plaza.  
      Check messages on their cell phones.  Order toasted bagels.  

      We pick out our Man, amongst them.  He's steps onto an 
      escalator and is swept upwards in the stream of people.

      INT.  OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING1111

      A MAINTENANCE WOMAN, 50s, stops at a maintenance closet.  
      This is Goran's wife, MARTA.  

      She unlocks the closet.  Pulls out a cleaning trolley.  Shuts 
      the door.  Turns around-- Goran stands in front of her.

      She freezes.

      INT.  AIRPORT - MORNING.1212

        A SHAGGY-HAIRED MAN strides down an airport hallway.  

      He's lean, blond, boyishly good-looking.  Carrying a worn 
      khaki duffel bag and a grim expression.

      They're joined by two more SRU members:

      ROLAND CRAY, 36, strong, hardworking, driven.  His emotions 
      are his business -- but once he knows you he'll do anything 
      for you.

      And SPIKE SCHARFE, late 20s, athletic, with an easygoing 
      charm.  Still the team rookie after two years.

      SLAM!  

      Pairs of BOOTS thud down the side the building.

      EXT.  NEAR FIRST YORK PLAZA - MORNING - SAME TIME1717

      Goran hurries out the glass doors of the office building and 
      onto a BUSTLING PASSAGE, north of FIRST YORK PLAZA.  Thick 
      cross-currents of office people, intent on their 
      destinations.  He passes through the crowd, unnoticed, his 
      hand still holding the hidden weapon.   




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  16.

      CONTINUED:1717

      Then - OFFICER NEVILLE, a YOUNG COP, sees Goran.  His arm in 
      that suspicious position.  

      He follows, hand on his holster, a few feet behind.  Goran is 
      edgy, heading for the street.  Suddenly, the cop s radio 
      dispatch goes off:  

                                  DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    Suspect is male white, 40s, heavy-
                    set and armed...

      Goran whirls around and sees the cop.  In a split second, the 
      two have their guns trained on each other.  

                                    OFFICER NEVILLE
                    Drop your weapon!

      People scream, scatter, find cover behind newspaper boxes, 
      benches, parked cars.

                                  GORAN
                    Odmakni se!  [Back off!]

                                    OFFICER NEVILLE
                    I said drop your weapon!

                                  GORAN
                    Ne prilazite!  [Don't come any 
                    closer!]

                                    OFFICER NEVILLE
                    Do you understand me?  Drop your 
                    weapon NOW!

      Goran backs away from the cop.

                                  GORAN
                    Odmakni!  [Back off!]

                                    OFFICER NEVILLE 
                    Don't move!

      Goran bumps against a telephone pole.  

        A SECRETARY, 36, cowers on the other side of it.

      Goran GRABS HER and points his gun at her head.  

                                  GORAN
                    Ja cu je ubiti!  [I'll kill her!]

2323EXT.  FIRST YORK PLAZA - MORNING 

      The Plaza is in CHAOS.

      In the eye of the storm:

      The Gunman holds his gun to the head of his hostage.  He's 
      nervous, shifting his weight back and forth.  He yells at a 
      DETECTIVE who's been trying to negotiate through a bullhorn. 

                                  GORAN
                    Go vori im da otidje!

      The detective lowers the bullhorn.  

                                  DETECTIVE
                    This is going nowhere.

      INSPECTOR STAINTON, 40s, conservative, greying, watches as 
      the SRU team approaches.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON 
                          (flat)
                    Here comes the cavalry.

2424EXT.  FIRST YORK PLAZA CORDON - MORNING 

      The team vaults over the cordon and jogs toward the scene.

                          (unimpressed)
                    They've even got the marine unit 
                    here.  

      Ed winks at Jules.*

                    OK, let's see if we can remove this

                    Carl, Shakes take the south.  
                    Spike, Wordy, you're with me.

      Roland, Carl and Shakes split off.

      Ed and Jules head in different directions.  Jules towards the *

      Sgt. Parker heads towards Inspector Stainton.

                    Our guy got a name?

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON
                    No.  I don't think he speaks 
                    English.

                                  SGT. PARKER
                    What does he speak?

                    How long you been here?

      Stainton glares at him.  

      EXT.  NORTH BUILDING ENTRANCE - MORNING2525

      Ed jogs past a couple of Uniforms, revolvers drawn, watching 
      the action from behind a mailbox.

      The Uniform looks at Ed blankly.  Ed points across the 
      square.

      The Uniform looks.  Another cop, behind Goran, has got his 
      revolver pointed at the Uniform.

2626EXT.  FIRST YORK PLAZA CORDON - MORNING 

      Parker tries to make sense out of Stainton and the Detective.  
      Wordy and Spike stand by.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    I think it's Yugoslavian.  
                    Croatian.

                                  SGT. PARKER

                    want my boys getting shot in the 
                    back by sympathetic fire.

      Inspector Stainton strides off, visualizing witty retorts.   

      Parker edges closer to Goran, palms open.  Wordy and Spike 
      cover him with STEEL SHIELDS and ASSAULT WEAPONS.

      INT.  OFFICE BUILDING.  ELEVATOR - MORNING2727

      A crowded elevator, filled with Latte-clutching office 
      workers.

      The doors slide open to reveal an UNHOLY APPARITION. 

      Ed.  Towering above them.  In full battle gear.  Helmet, 
        bullet-proof vest and high-powered rifle.

      He steps into the elevator.  The workers nervously make room.

                                  ED
                    Hit eight for me?  Thanks.

      Ed winks at a young woman.  She blushes.

      The doors close.

      Ed pushes open the rooftop door.

      He creeps low along the graveled rooftop and peers over the 
      edge of the building.  

      Ed's POV:  Up high, Goran and Hostage are small -- a pinwheel 
      in the middle of chaos.

      Ed STRAPS HIMSELF to the ledge.                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  27.

      The Shaggy-Haired Man works his way to the front of the 
      police cordon.

      He takes in the scene.  Immediately spots the SRU team 
      members: the negotiator, closest by; two more with shields, 
      and machine guns.  

      The Shaggy-Haired Man's eyes travel skyward, knowing where to 
      look.  On top of the east building: gloved hands, LASER 
        RANGEFINDER.  The Observer Sniper.

      Everyone's eyes are glued to Goran.

      Wordsworth FLIPS HIM OVER, like a broken doll.  HANDCUFFS the 
      limp arms.

      Spike feels for a pulse, knowing the answer.  He stands and 
      WIPES HIS HAND.

      The other men, silent, take that in.

      A MEDIC throws an orange blanket over the body.*

      Parker leads the hostage away.*

      The Shaggy-Haired Man takes it all in.  Then looks back at 
      the rooftops.

      EXT.  EAST BUILDING ROOFTOP - MORNING4949

      Jules searches the opposite building.*

      Jules'S SCOPE POV: Ed throwing up.*

      Jules pulls her eye away from the scope.  Shocked.  *
      Concerned.

      EXT.  FIRST YORK PLAZA - MORNING.5050

      Parker leads the hostage toward a waiting medic.

      He looks up at Ed's rooftop.

      EXT.  ROOFTOP ABOVE OPEN SQUARE - MORNING.5151

      Ed sits in the rooftop gravel, clutching his rifle.

      Ed's POV throughout, everything slow, distorted:

      The rooftop door opens.  Inspector Stainton, pleased to be 
      back in charge, walks out with a couple of UNIFORMS.

      Their voices are muffled, far-away.  

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON
                    Tape it up.  This is a crime scene.  
                    Don't speak to the Subject Officer.

      The uniforms start taping.  Stainton stands over Ed.  

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON (CONT'D)
                    Give me your weapons.  Rifle and 
                    Glock.

      Stainton snaps on rubber gloves.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  39.

                    Let's go, constable.

      Ed, without looking, hands the rifle to Stainton.  Stainton 
      empties the ammunition.  A uniform holds out a plastic 
      evidence bag: Stainton places everything inside.  The bag is 
      sealed.  Same process with the Glock.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON (CONT'D)
                    Gloves too.  Residue.

      Ed's gloves go in another bag.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON (CONT'D)
                    You're under investigation.  This 
                    is the drill.  

      Ed looks up at him.  Numb.

      INT.  OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING5252

      Ed's POV, still distorted:

      The Inspector escorts Ed through the foyer.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON 
                    You're sequestered.  No talking.  
                    Alright?  

      Through a crowd of staring office workers.  

      EXT.  FIRST YORK PLAZA - MORNING5353

      Inspector Stainton leads Ed towards Sgt. Parker.

      Ed's POV, SLOW-MO tunnel vision:  Goran's feet.  Orange 
      blanket, blood seeping.  

      Reporters, Cops, Medics milling around.

      The hostage, in shock.  Seated on the back of an ambulance, a 
      medic wiping her face.  

      Ed stares as the medic wipes BLOOD from her face and hair.

      Jules exits her building, eyes hunting for Ed.  Her eyes land *
      on him, concerned.

      Ed's POV: He sees Dr Luria and another MEDIC holding up the 
      devastated SON.  

                                  SON
                          (sobbing)
                    Tata... my Tata... What am I going *
                    to do?  What am I going to do?*

      Ed walks on, shaken, led by Stainton...  

      ...and briefly LOCKS EYES with the Shaggy-Haired Man.  The 
      Man watches as Ed's escorted off like a criminal.

      EXT.  FIRST YORK PLAZA POLICE CORDON - MORNING5454

      Nearby, a SRU CAR pulls up next to Sgt. Parker.  SRU 
      Commander Holleran, late 40's, fit, steps out.  Seeing him, 
      Dr Luria approaches, as well as the female SRU SCRIBE.

                                  SGT. PARKER 
                    Yeah.

      She puts the INCIDENT NOTES into an ENVELOPE.  SEALS it.  
      Hands them over.

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN
                    Fine.  Thanks.

                      Technically, that'll be for SIU to 
                    decide.

      Commander Holleran recognizes the voice.  He turns to face 
      Inspector Stainton, arriving with Ed.

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN
                    Thank you, Stainton.

                    Good job, constable.

      Ed is silent.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON
                    Let's go.  Parker, you too.

      The three of them turn and head towards the vehicles.

                    Eddy.  How you doing?

      Stainton slides open the door of a police van for them.

                                  STAINTON
                    Come on.  You're both--

                    --Fine... I'm fine.

      They settle into the van.  Sgt. Parker looks hard at Ed.

                                  SGT. PARKER
                    Ed.  Good job.

      Ed looks out the window.  The van pulls away.  

      EXT.  FIRST YORK PLAZA CORDON - MORNING5555

      Jules, Wordsworth, Spike, and Roland watch the van disappear.  *

      They pack up in silence.  Jules turns and begins breaking *
      down her sniper rifle, covering her concern.  Then senses 
      someone behind her.

                                    SHAGGY-HAIRED MAN (O.S.)
                    Hey.  Saw the whole thing. 

      She looks up and sees the Shaggy-Haired Man.

                    I'm Sam.

      INT.  SRU CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE MORNING5656

      Ed sits alone in the SRU station's empty conference room.  

      Slumped in a chair.  Surrounded by duty rosters, tactical 
      diagrams drawn on whiteboards. 

      His phone rings.  He doesn't hear it.

      INT.  BAKERY - AFTERNOON5757

      Sophie, in a pastry chef's apron, makes a phone call.  She 
      twists the curly wire, concerned.  

      High on a shelf, a SMALL TV plays the news: RUSH HOUR HOSTAGE 
      DRAMA. 

      No reply.  She hangs up.  Exhales.  At a loss.

      INT.  SRU CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON57A57A

      The door opens.  Ed starts.

      BLAIR KOWALSKI, 40s, enters with a UNIFORM COP.

      Kowalski's serious - bordering on dour, wears a sweater.  

      The cop throws large, CLEAR PLASTIC BAGS on the table.

      Ed does.  The cop takes off Ed's utility vest and puts it

                    Boots and socks.

                    Pants.

      The cop bags them.

      Ed stands there, stripped to his underwear.  His impressive 
      physique exposed.

      Kowalski tosses Ed his civilian clothes and cell phone.  He 
      pulls on a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt.  Kowalski bags 
      his uniform.  

      There's a KNOCK on the door.  FRANK MCANDREW, a lawyer in a

                          (routinely, as he packs)
                    So you know, this is the process: 
                    we investigate alongside the

      Kowalski leaves, accompanied by the Uniform carrying the 
      BAGGED EVIDENCE.

      Ed goes to stand.  He wants out of there.

                    Hang on.  Someone else you gotta *

      Ed sits.  Drained.

        A HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL MELODY begins on a violin, echoing his 
      mood...

                          (quietly)

      He listens.

      Still listening, he rises, leans his cello on the chair, and 
      walks slowly to the window.

      Keeps listening.  Troubled.

      INT.  CQB MONITOR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER6262

      Jules slams ammunition into a GLOCK.  *

      Sam wears the goggles flipped up.  Surveys a mocked-up 
      apartment.  Open doors lead to a warren of rooms.

      Jules watches Sam on various MONITORS.  There s a set of *

      As she presses buttons, TARGETS pop from the FLOOR and WALLS.

      Sam fires instinctively at CUTOUT BAD GUYS.  Rolling and 
      spinning.  Clearing rooms.

      She taps more buttons.  Several targets pop at once.

      BLAM-BLAM!

      Then -- 

      An OLD-LADY CUTOUT.

      Sam swings the Glock at her.  Holds his fire.  Keeps moving.

      Jules purses her lips.  Hits a switch.*

      The LIGHTS GO OUT on Sam.

                                  JULES (CONT D)*
                    Good night.

      Sam flicks the night-goggles on.  EVERYTHING GOES GREEN.  
      Jules s hand hovers over the controls.  She watches him move *
      through the room...

      Then unleashes FIVE TARGETS on all sides.

      BLAM! BLAM!

      He avoids a WOMAN & BABY.

        BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!

      The lights flick on.  Sam flips up the goggles, breathing 
      hard.  Wipes sweat.  Silence.

      Then--

      A target drops from the CEILING.

      Sam, lightning-fast, shoots straight up.  Nails it.

      Jules scowls.  Shit.*

      SPENT SHELLS litter the floor.  

      Ed lets off shot after shot.  

      Every bullet hits dead centre, punching a perfect ragged 
      hole.  

      SMOKE fills the air.

      He goes to reload and then STARTS.  There's a hand on his 
      shoulder.  It's Wordsworth:  time to go.

      INT.  BAR - EVENING.6464

      It's the retirement party.  The bar's packed with Police 
      Force types, out of uniform.  A few wear COP BALL-CAPS.

      Jules, Shakes, Wordy, Carl and Spike are digging into some *
      beer and wings. 

      Near the bar, RETIRING COMMANDER BARNEY FLETCHER (60s) holds 
      court.  He's tall, white-haired, barrel-chested, wrapping up 
      a story. 

                                  RETIRING COMMANDER 
                    Anyway.  Now the wife's got me 
                    where she wants me.  Let's just 
                    hope the Stockholm Syndrome kicks 
                    in fast.

      Laughs.

      The bar door swings open.  Ed steps in.  He tries to sneak 
      around the side but The Retiring Commander spots him.

                      outstanding reason for being late.

      Ed takes in the joke, and makes his way through the bar.  

      A cop picks up his beer and thumps it on the table.  Another 
      joins in.  Then another, until there's a barful of cops 
      thudding bottles and glasses on tables.

      Ed makes an awkward victory gesture.

      The Retiring Commander holds his glass up to Ed.  The 
      thumping stops.  All the cops lift their glasses.

                                  RETIRING COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                          (quiet)
                    Good job, son. 

      They drink to Ed.

      Ed sits with his teammates, embarrassed.

      The Retiring Commander tips his glass to Commander Holleran, 
      who stands nearby with Sam.

                                  RETIRING COMMANDER (CONT'D)

                    hands.  I'm done.  As you were.

      APPLAUSE.  Music and TV's blare as the noise level rises.   

      Commander Holleran approaches the table with Sam.

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN
                    Ed Lane, this is Sam Braddock.

      Ed nods, hard, appraising.

      Awkward pause.  Ed keeps his eyes steady on Sam.  Then Shakes

                                  SAM
                    I'd tell you.  But then I'd have to 
                    kill you.

                                  SHAKES 
                    Oh right.  Yeah.  Awesome.

      Meanwhile:

      Wordsworth tips his CHICKEN BONES into a TUPPERWARE

      It's this thing.  Shel said.  Like, seven.
      We're not allowed to make any

      They crack up.

      Meanwhile Ed catches an image on TV: a recap of the incident. 

      Grainy footage of the GUNMAN holding the HOSTAGE.  

      A PHOTO of Goran's family in happier times: his wife, their 
      boy...  

      Camera pushes in on the SON.  Up close.

      Ed watches.  Expressionless.

      Jules sneaks a look at him, still touching his knee.  No *
      response.

      She pulls her hand away. 

      ED'S POV is distorted.  He's hearing only snatches of 
        conversation...

                                  WORDSWORTH
                    ...guy was so loaded, taking seven

                    I could take seven.

                    Shut up you could not.

                                  ROLAND
                    I'll give you seven.

      Ed leaves the table.  Sam's eyes follow him.

      INT.  BAR WASHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER6565

      Ed splashes cold water on his face.  

      His hands are shaking.  He steadies them on the edge of the 
      sink.

      Ed hunches there, face dripping.  Then--

                                  SAM (O.S)
                    'S messed up, eh?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  63.

      CONTINUED:6565

      Ed starts.  Looks at Sam in the mirror.

      Sam's hands are in his pockets.  This isn't easy but he keeps 
      it light.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                    Day starts out normal and then the *
                    shit hits and somehow you're *
                    supposed to get back to the normal 
                    again.  

      Ed blinks.  That lands in him.

      Sam sees that.

      Then --

                                  ED
                    Do I know you?

      Sam smiles.  Turns to go.  Then--

                                  SAM
                    You'd think it'd be easier.  From 
                    500 yards away.

      They look at each other.

      Beat.

      Ed breaks away.  Turns the taps back on.

      Sam leaves.

      INT.  MONTAGE -  VARIOUS PLACES - LATER THAT NIGHT6666

      THE CITY MORGUE.

      Goran's SON identifies his father's body.

      He's shattered.

6767INT.  CASINO.   

      JULES sits at a POKER TABLE.  Relaxes.  Like a nomad at an *
      oasis.   

                                  JULES*
                    Deal, Denis.                                              Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  64.


6868INT. SAM'S MOTEL. 

      Sam's settled into his motel.  On a bureau:

      The PHOTO of Sam's father with his pearl grips, in army 
      uniform.

      The COLT beside it...

      Balls of YARN...

      Pan down to Sam.

      He's sitting in an armchair.  Thoughtful.  Busy doing 
      something.  

      Reveal: he's KNITTING.

6969INT. ED'S HOME.  

      Ed enters his darkened home.

      The house is absolutely still.  A clock ticks quietly.  The 
      fridge hums.  Nothing moves.

      He drops his duffel bag on the floor.  Goes to the living 
      room.

      The TV flickers silent images.

      Ed, bathed in blue light, raises his hand to his face.

      It's SHAKING.

      His breath comes faster.

      The shakes take over his body.  A single, ragged gasp twists 
      itself free.  

                                  CLARK (O.S.)
                    Dad.

      Clark is at the bottom of the stairs.  He walks cautiously 
      toward Ed.  Ed struggles to control himself.

      Next thing, he's got his ARMS WRAPPED TIGHTLY around his son.  

      Clark's at a loss: they don't do hugs much.  In fact, this is 
      a first.  This is a father he's never met.

                          (quietly)
                    Dad?

      Sophie has come quietly down the stairs, unseen.  

      She looks at Ed with concern.  Hesitates, about to 
      approach... Then decides to give them their space.  

      She walks quietly back up.

      Clark returns his father's hug.  

      They stand in the middle of the shadowy room.

                                                              FADE OUT.
