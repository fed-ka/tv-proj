                    I thought that was great.

                      Scorcese s overrated.

                                  DANNY
                    You re wrong. He s a genius.

                    I m wrong?

      She gives him an amused look and starts to walk away. He runs 
      after her.

                                  DANNY

                    Great. Where do you want to go?

      She laughs at this cheekiness.

                                  CATHERINE
                    That doesn t mean yes.

      She hesitates, glances at her watch.

      We see CATHERINE walking down the street and from a distance 
      of about a hundred yards HARRY following her.

      catches a tiny glimpse of him reflected in the glass door. 
      She whips round but there s nobody there. Shakes her head and 
      goes into

                      I promise.

      From the POV of an unknown watcher we see DANNY walking 
      quickly away buttoning his jacket. And then we see a copy of 
      the Daily Herald. In almost an echo of ADAM s routine in 
      SWIFT s car, the paper is lowered. But it isn t ADAM, it s 
      the CHAUFFEUR who kidnapped PATRICIA NORTON.

                    down. Take deep breaths. What s 
                    happened?

      He listens, his face darkens.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    I ll be right there.

      Starts to walk fast opening mobile again.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Control, this is Kestrel...

      DANNY is standing outside looking at CATHERINE who s inside 
      by the bar. He looks utterly miserable. This is the last time 
      things will ever be the same between them. She looks up at 
      him, waves and smiles. He holds up his hand hesitantly but it 
      is more as if he is bidding her farewell. Then he walks into 
      the bar.

                                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

      CATHERINE sitting on a bench. She is at the end of the bench 
      as far away from him as possible. ADAM and DANNY stand guard 
      at the park gates.

                    Seen Graham recently? You remember

                    I just wanted him to do well.

                    What do you want from me? You want 
                      absolution? I forgive you. I m a

                    It s trampling all over the bloody 
                    crocuses as well.

      Father and daughter scowl at the dog owner who remains 
      impervious.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Can t you drag him to the Tower in 
                      a handcart?

      He laughs.

                                  HARRY
                    Who did you tell that your father 
                    worked for British Intelligence.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Only Nicholas Ashworth. 

      HARRY frowns. That just doesn t make sense.

                                  CATHERINE (CONT D)
                    We d better go. It s too windy.

      HARRY and Catherine get up and walk across the park towards 
      DANNY and ADAM. DANNY almost shaking, about to issue a 
      disclaimer. HARRY pats his shoulder.


                                  HARRY
                    Thanks, Danny. I ll walk my 
                    daughter home.

      They pass by. DANNY watches as if longing for her to turn 
      round. She doesn t.

                    There s somebody you fancy called 
                    Isobel at Thames House. I bet you a

                                  ADAM
                    Excuse me! I ve just had to watch 
                    my wife kissing a man who had the 
                    audacity to describe me as a

                    Because I m such a predictable,

                    If you were predictable or typical 
                      I wouldn t always come back to you.

      And they kiss with such energy and passion that we see 
      exactly what impulse lies behind all their banter.
