KARL BECKER, Storm's partner, a nice guy in shirtsleeves
with a huge nautical-type wristwatch. He's wide awake
all right -- eager for this call.
KARL

I'm here, Mase. Where are you
He switches OFF the RADIO, twists a telephoto night lens
onto a specially silenced 8mm surveillance film camera;
he primes a portable sound deck in the case he's been
carrying. A quick check of the .45 in his shoulder
holster, then he exits the car.
ON STORM
Moving carefully onto the wharf, keeping to shadow, using
cover.
A burly plainclothesman, MAX DUNNE, waves his phone
receiver at Karl, Storm's partner, who's still at the
desk where we last saw him. A TV across the room tuned
to the ACADEMY AWARDS.
DUNNE

STORM
Him and his gorilla Vitale. I got
film and audio on both of them,

couldn't make out, but I'm sure
they'll come up on the film. This
is a big one, Carlito. Our own

KARL

Shoot.
STORM
I want you to track down Morgensteen

maid from Pico, crank her legs apart
and pry him out of there.
KARL
He ain't gonna be happy.
STORM
Screw his happiness. Tell him I

Got any champagne?
The grizzled MAN behind the counter checks out Storm's
Versace threads.
COUNTER MAN
Right next to the caviar.

There's some in the big cooler.
Storm likes the guy.
He notes the man's MINI-TV tuned to
WRESTLING.
STORM
You're not watching the Oscars?
COUNTER MAN
The Oscars?
I hate the Oscars.
Storm crosses to the cooler.
COUNTER MAN
Who needs the goddam movies? I get
it all in here every night.
(indicates his
view from behind
counter)
Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence.
And I ain't gotta pay no four bucks.
Storm pulls a bottle from the cooler. He notices, on a
high shelf, a big stuffed toy. Something for Sonny.
Storm stretches up, grabs it. Suddenly:
He notices something in the big convex shoplifting mirror.
Something approaching from outside.

The Man hesitates, letting a few precious seconds pass.
Three Latino PUNKS enter the store. One of them carries
a long-barreled shotgun.
COUNTER MAN
Sonsofbitches! You creeps ripped
me off two weeks ago!
SHOTGUN PUNK
Shut up.
He gestures to the register.
COUNTER MAN
Take it, man.
Take my life's
savings.
He scoops bills from the cash drawer (about twenty bucks)
shoves them to the Shotgun Punk. The Punk scowls --
COUNTER MAN
Where is a cop when you goddam need
one?
(to Punks,
threatening)
I got half a mind to come out there
and teach you sonofabitch --
Shotgun Punk FIRES without warning -- point blank into
the counter display and the Man! The Counter Man is BLOWN
backwards -- cabinets crash; he crumples, groaning and
bloody onto the floor!
SHOTGUN PUNK
Now you got half a mind, old man.
Punk #2 scoops up the money.
The three Punks saunter up
and surround Storm.
Storm looks down at their feet, then to their faces and
smiles. Shotgun Punk points the gun at Storm's face.
SHOTGUN PUNK

The Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him,
but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly
spins between the Punks and behind the gun.
The SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL --
BOTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into
the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's
arm.
The others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun
and is using it as a sword or staff. He looks like a
true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation.
These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in
his spontaneous orchestra.
Punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife.
Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot-
sweep the Punk. The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head
slams against the floor. As soon as he hits, the shotgun
is slammed through his teeth.
The last Punk has produced an icepick and is staring at
his compadres in disbelief. He and Storm square off.
STORM
(to Punk, calmly)
I know what you're thinking.
I
have this big shotgun and all
you
have is that little icepick.
Mine's
bigger than yours. It's not
fair.
Storm sets the gun down.
Punk #3 is still frozen.
STORM
Still not fair?
Storm gets down on his knees.
STORM
Don't wait for the blindfold,
maricon.
PUNK #3
(clutching the
ice pick tightly)
Chinga tu madre!
The Punk lungs, thrusting the ice pick with lightning
speed at Storm's face.
Storm makes a slight movement, parries the thrust and
slides his body behind the Punk, simultaneously slamming
his forearm into the rear knee joint.
The Punk buckles and Storm now has one of his legs in
both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee.

We see the leg held in Storm's arms begin to twist ...
and with a blood-curdling scream we hear a LOUD SNAP.
SIRENS are heard approaching outside.
Chuck Mangione's "Feels So Good" PLAYS in the TAPE DECK.
Storm listens for a few beats, as if letting the horn
cool him out after the liquor store action. Then he ejects
the tape decisively -- reaches into his camera case, pulls
out the surveillance tape from tonight. He punches this
tape into the deck.
Storm listens. The part where the Shadow Man with the
hat (Trent) says, "You'll be well compensated. Money now --
and more when I get into that office. You can take that
to the bank." Storm CRANKS UP the VOLUME.
STORM
I know that voice.
Who the hell is it?
He rewinds the tape --
Still listening. Can't place the voice. Punches " eject,"
the tape pops half-out. Into the driveway, Storm activates
the garage door remote.
Storm's car stops, headlights go out. The garage door
closes. Storm gets out, carrying his camera case,
champagne and the big stuffed toy. He takes a couple of
steps toward the door to the house, then stops, remembering -
He leans back into the car, yanks the surveillance tape
from the deck. Hands full, he tucks the tape into a inside
pocket of his Versace vest.
It's late; just a courtesy lamp left on for Storm. He
pulls the tapes and recorder from his case, stashes the
case out of sight. He grabs a couple of champagne glasses --
tiptoes toward the bedroom. Felicia appears at the top
of the stairs, wearing panties and a teddy top. She smiles
seeing the big toy, shooshes Storm --
ANGLE FROM SONNY'S ROOM
Storm stops outside his boy's room, looking in. Felicia
tiptoes up beside him. Sonny sprawls loose-limbed on the
bed in his Woody Woodpecker pajamas.
STORM
Wish I could sleep like that.

he's a real person.
STORM

SONNY

Mahatma Candy. He was a great man.
Storm moves closer to his son. He sees how much E.T.'s
loss has hurt his son, and wants to make it better.
STORM

You know why E.T. lost?
SONNY

Storm and Felicia forms obscure part of the screen --
standing close to each other, beside the bed. Felicia
helps him off with his jacket.
FELICIA
There's blood on your jacket.
STORM
It's okay.
It's not mine.
Storm's hands dump his stuff onto the bedside table --
camera, tapes from case, gun. He gathers the glasses,
pours champagne.
Felicia watches her husband. She plainly loves him deeply --
and is held and excited by his contradictions. They come
closer together, clinking their glasses, sipping.
FELICIA
If people knew how sweet you are,
they'd never be scared of you.
She kisses him seductively, unbuttoning his shirt at the

STORM
A couple of things crossed my mind,
in the car coming home.
Another kiss. They get their glasses out of the way,
Storm lowers his wife languidly onto the bed. They begin
kissing more deeply. Storm helps Felicia slide out of
her teddy top; her beautiful breasts rise into the light.
Storm begins to kiss them, she moans with pleasure. The
lovemaking increases in intensity, Felicia's hand groping
to open Storm's pants. He begins to help her, guiding
her legs apart --
FELICIA

Door's open.
Not missing a beat, Storm grabs a heavy pillow, heaves it --
without looking -- at the door.
ANGLE FROM HALLWAY - BEDROOM DOOR
The pillow strikes it, starting it swinging closed. Storm
and Felicia's forms, on the bed, are eclipsed. Sound
from the "CARSON SHOW" DROPS DOWN -
TWO MEN -- carrying shotguns, faces hidden by masks --
move soundlessly down a hall. A terrible alien presence
within this normal American household. The men turn a
corner into a different hallway --

FELICIA
(frightened)
What?
Storm lunges for his .45 on the nightstand. Suddenly
LOUD and VIOLENT CRASH and the bedroom door is kicked in.
Two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door.
There is an eruption of GUNFIRE and blinding muzzle blast
and smoke. In the dim light for a moment we do not know
what has happened, then:
STORM'S POV
We see one of the assassins thrown backward, jacket blown
open at the shoulder.
SWITCH TO:
ASSASSIN'S PARTNER'S POV
We see Storm hit badly at close range. He takes it in
the right center mass. It looks like his right arm is
torn off as his .45 is literally blown across the room.
Felicia is now hysterically screaming -- but not for long --
as she is mortally wounded. We are sure Storm will
collapse and this horror will be over, but Storm rushes
the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as
he enters, he avoids one more ferocious BLAST.
The momentum of Storm's quick spin catches the assailant
perfectly, and like a fast spinning top slammed against
another, Storm has the puppet by the strings. He clamps
down with his left and only good hand on the assailant's
right hand, and uses it against the gun as a tool for
more torque. Spinning him around until he is at the peak
of his circle, Storm with all his might spins his whole
body in the opposite direction quickly, using the whipping
effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailant's
wrist and flip him violently.
There is a LOUD CRACK and
scream as he lands on his head
and neck, and then -- from
the side, point-blank --another
ferocious SHOTGUN BLAST --
Storm is blown into the air
and back onto the bed from
which he came.
QUICK CUTAWAY TO:
BOOMING! Karl (Storm's partner) being BLASTED. No chance

opposite way. The reporter picks up her V.O.:

In the general hubbub, Holland doesn't hear -- conferring
with some other officers.

crush along the way. O'Malley comes up beside Holland.

O'Malley tugs out a letter on official stationery.
O'MALLEY
We got two cops down, with money
and drugs all over the place. This
is straight from the commissioner.
Holland is clearly upset by this, but knows he can't argue
with a letter from the commissioner. Reluctantly he yields.
He turns his gaze back to the stretcher in the ER.
Now he and O'Malley are just two officers, sharing a loss.
HOLLAND
You and Storm were tight, O'Malley.
I'm sorry.
O'MALLEY
He was the most unstoppable
sonofabitch I ever knew.
HOLLAND
Well.
He got stopped tonight.
Holland breaks his stare at Storm's body and drags away,
signaling his own cops to vacate. They exit. No farewells
between Holland and O'Malley. O'Malley waits silently,
watching Holland and his men clear the corridor and
disappear.

glances up; a light flashes on one screen. She studies
the screen a moment, gives a perplexed look toward the
ward --
Andy enters, scanning the area, listening. She moves
down the row of patients, visually checking each. She
stops at Storm and checks him, too.
Storm's eyes are closed; he's motionless.
Andy turns, starts to exit.
STORM
(in b.g., weakly,
directly behind)
-- Nurse ...
Andy whips around, sucking air and falling back, knocking
over an IV UNIT -- which SHATTERS on the floor!
She turns and sprints from the room.
As we crash through
doors WITH it. MOVING FAST. Knotted
around Storm is an
emergency team of doctors and nurses.
A controlled chaos
of AD LIB status reports and queries
from them overlaps
as the doors swing shut behind them.
Andy is left alone on the coma ward.
Andy unlocks a drawer, pulls out a laminated card from
the record notice section. She picks up a phone, punches
in a long series of numbers.
INTERCUT:
The PHONE on someone's desk begins RINGING.
JONES, a
plainclothesman, picks it up.

JONES
Internal affairs. Detective Sergeant
Jones.
ANDY
My name is Andrea Simpson. I'm
calling from U.C.I. Medical Center.
I'd like to speak with
(reads from
card)
Captain O'Malley.
Wheels start to turn in Jones' head.
JONES
What is this in regard to, please?
ANDY
I have a John Doe coma patient,
code access 461 zebra, with
instructions to notify upon any
change in condition.
JONES
What is the change?
ANDY
(with enthusiasm)
The patient has regained
consciousness.
Jones reacts -- puts his hand over the receiver, turns to
a leather-faced plainclothesman (NOLAN) at the next desk.
JONES
(urgent)
Nolan. Get Holland at home ...
right now.
(back to Andy
on phone)
I'm sorry, Ms. Simpson. Captain
O'Malley is no longer with this
division. Let me take your
information. Please ... contact no
one else on this matter.
Storm back in bed. A knot of doctors finishes returning
him from their emergency resuscitation work. "We'll leave
him here for tonight, where they've got the full support
setup." The team wraps up and begins to move off.
The TEAM LEADER instructs Andy in Storm's immediate
condition and care.

DOCTOR (TEAM LEADER)
-- Clip him with 50 cc of Thorazine
if he gives you any trouble. I'm
afraid he's very disoriented and
quite paranoid. He thinks people
are trying to kill him.
The team exits. Andy is alone in the ward with the
immobile patients -- and Storm. Storm groans and tries
to lift himself onto an elbow.
STORM
Miss ... please ... they won't tell
me ... think I'm too disorient --
ANDY
This is U.C.I. Medical Center.
You've been in a coma. Your charts
go back for seven years.
STORM
(staggered)
Seven... years?
He can't absorb this.
It's too much.
His mind reels.
STORM
Who ... who knows I'm awake?
ANDY
(innocent
enthusiasm)
It's all over the hospital. You're
the first one that's come out of a
coma of this duration. You'll
probably be on the news!
(beat)
You'll be famous!
STORM
(struggles to
sit up; fails)
Listen to me carefully --
(reads her name
tag)
-- Andy. I don't have the strength
to talk much. I'm a cop. My wife
... family ... murdered. That's
how I got here. If you don't get
me out ... you and I ... good chance
... both be dead.
ANDY
Please -- you're in no danger here.

She touches him kindly -- but Storm sees that she doesn't
believe him, thinks he's paranoid.
STORM
Goddamit --
(urgent but
weak)
can't stay here. Listen to me -
ANDY
I'll have one of the aides take you
down the hall for hydrotherapy.
It'll help you relax.
STORM
No --
ANDY
Listen... I've got work to do.
You're my cutest patient, but you're
not my only one.
She leaves. Storm blows a sigh of frustration. His body
won't do what his brain tells it! In half-paralyzed rage
he struggles to move his limbs, open and close his hands --
An accident case being hurried in from an ambulance.
Paramedics, E.R. personnel and patients fill the scene.
A bespectacled doctor in a white coat casually emerges
from the crush and continues on into a hallway.
ANGLE - DOCTOR
This is no doctor; it's Jack Ford, one of the killers who
shotgunned Storm seven years ago!
DANNY, an aide, has Storm harnessed in a frothing
whirlpool.
Several nurses chat and drink coffee at a clerical station.
Ford comes up - nameplate, stethoscope, looking the part
perfectly. We see him exchange a greeting, ask a question.
One of the nurses hands him a clipboard with some papers
on it. As the killer scans the clipboard -RUSS, the
security man, approaches.

Ford averts his face subtly, continuing to study the list.
Russ passes, with a greeting for the nurses -- and a
(slightly unsure) nod for the killer. The killer nods
back.
SECOND FLOOR SUPPLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Andy arrives and goes about business.
A set of DOORS DINGS open.
Ford steps out.
Eerie ultraviolet; motionless forms; steady HUM of
monitoring EQUIPMENT -- and the shuffle of the killer's
shoes ... moving purposefully from bed to bed checking
each chart for the right name.
Danny helps Storm out of the tub.
Checking the chart in the dim blue when -- a flashlight
ray suddenly hits his face ...
RUSS
Excuse me, Doctor. I have to check
everyone on the upper floors.
(comes forward,
no suspicion)
Can I just get your I.D. --
PHHT!
Russ takes the SILENCED SHOT right between the
eyes.
His body collapses in a heap there in the entry.
Danny wheels Storm through the big swinging doors.
Suddenly -- he freezes.
DANNY'S POV
He sees Russ's partial body in the doorway up the hall
recognizable because of its security uniform trousers.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org

DANNY
reacts as if fearing Russ has had a heart attack. He
leaves Storm, rushes forward to investigate. Storm strains
to see.
DANNY
(dashes up)
Russ!
Russ, are you --
PHHT!
PHHT!
Danny sprawls onto the floor, dead.
Doesn't need to see to recognize that sound. He gropes
at once for the wall corner, trying to propel his litter
back through the swinging doors and out of sight.
Storm strains for it, his limbs maddeningly uncooperative
... stretching, pawing ... until -- he claws far enough
to reach where the janitor's mop rests against the wall.
COMA WARD - HALLWAY - FORD
steps into the hallway, peering up and down -- just as
Storm slides out of view. The killer grabs Danny's body
by the ankles, to drag it back out of sight. Just then:
ANDY
backs
through the double doors at the other end of the
hall,
trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies
she's
carrying. She and Ford are momentarily in full
view
of each other ... but backs turned. Suddenly --
Ford
hears Andy! He spins ... gun ready.
Andy carefully
heads
that way -- the two corpses visible
ahead and the
killer
poised to waste her. But she's
concentrating
on the
overloaded tray, traveling closer
... closer ...
until
-- she turns off into the medicine
room.
Ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight.
AT ELEVATORS
Storm weakly, awkwardly "rows" himself toward the elevators
with the mop handle. Then using his hands, trying to
grasp the wall and push himself along.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org
37.
He makes it within reach of the call button and stabs at
it with the mop handle. Misses. Again. Then: bull's-
eye! The light comes on!
Ford has found the last (Storm's) medical chart -- and
the empty bed. He's heading back -- frustrated, angry
out toward the hall when... the elevator BELL DINGS.
AT ELEVATORS
Storm struggles to push himself inside. Everything an
excruciating effort. The doors slap into his litter,
trying to close. Reopen. Close. Reopen. Hindering him
as he throws a look toward --
stalks this way, ears tuned to the SLAPPING DOORS ahead
around the corner. He breaks into a trot --
ELEVATORS - STORM
makes it all the way in with a final heave.
FOOTSTEPS
nearing. The doors not yet closed and --
rounds the corner just as they shut.
Races forward --
Storm jabs at the panel for the lobby button -- but the
shaky mop handle hits 7TH FLOOR instead.
STORM
Sonofabitch!
THIRD-FLOOR CORRIDOR - AT ELEVATORS
The killer hears this -- hears the ELEVATOR START UP. He
punches the call button. The other elevator opens. He
plunges in just as:
SOUTH CORRIDOR - ANDY
comes out of the medicine room and spots blood on the
floor, hurries forward -- sees Russ and Danny's bodies!

She backs off in horror.
Andy rushes to the ward station, lunges for the phone --
finds it's been cut. Her view into the coma room suddenly
brings the realization that Storm's bed is still gone.
STORM'S ELEVATOR
The doors open -- revealing
a dark, deserted seventh floor
still under construction.
He registers the opposing
elevator rising his way --
jabbing again at the control
panel ... exposed there ...
doors wide open.
Wild stabs.
Any button will do -- just
close the goddam door!
DING! Ford's ELEVATOR arrives. Doors open. We make out
the killer's form -- just as Storm's doors close.
Storm blows huge relief. Looks to see what he finally
pushed ... Shit! -- the 3RD FLOOR button. He puts the
mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all he's
got.
The gurney wheels around and places him right next
to the control panel. Storm twists onto his side and
slams a hand over the EMERGENCY STOP button. But the
button jams! And Storm's thrusting hand has pushed his
gurney even farther away! He can't reach it!
He feels the elevator about to stop at a floor ... claws
at the mop, as a weapon ... raises it with all his feeble
strength. The doors open and --
Andy crashes into him!
ANDY
My God!
STORM
(hoarse, weak)
-- Help me ...
Pounding down the steps three at a time.
Gun in hand.
Andy hauls Storm's litter full tilt out
of the elevator.
A night janitor is waxing the floor, his
long power cord
snaking down the corridor. He stares in
astonishment at
this nurse racing down the corridor with
a gurney --

As its wheels hit the buffing machine cord.
The gurney
bucks, almost capsizes.
ANDY
I'm sorry!
Sorry --
She heaves the gurney, despite all its weight, past the
power cord, just as:
FORD
hurtles from the stairwell. In one beat, he takes in the
janitor; in the next, Andy and Storm -- down the hall.
Ford takes off after them. He's going to catch them!
JANITOR
jerks up on the power cord! It whipsnakes down the hall,
flaring up, tripping Ford! He sprawls face-first as:
Storm sprawled, asleep, exhausted, in the passenger seat.
Andy windblown at the wheel. A pair of fugitives, on the
run. The car pulls off the highway, past a sign for
"OJAI."
OPENING ON a
big table, covered with weapons confiscated
from gangs --
pistols, knives, assault rifles. Reporters
crowd around
Senator Trent at the table. A large sign
reads: "GANG
WEAPONS SEIZED IN ONE WEEK!"
TRENT
(to group,
finishing up)
Six gang-related murders in one
week. We're going to put a stop to
it -- and we're going to start right

Trent picks an AK-47 off the table and stuffs it
theatrically into a huge TRASH CAN. News cameras record
this juicy nugget for the nightly news.
TRENT
I'll be talking with the mayor.
We'll have a statement shortly --
He raises a fist in a "power salute," moves off --
SIDE OF ROOM - TRENT
Waving and beaming, edges away to the "wings," where Ford
and Dunne wait, along with Holland -- proper and official

then ducking back, aside, to his thugs.
TRENT

The assassins nod grimly. Trent turns, hands raised
triumphantly, to the crowd.
TRENT

We're going to end violence in this
state -- and you can take that to

DAY
Storm blinks his eyes
-- groggy, disoriented. He is in
bed, just waking up.
Outside his window: this postcard-
perfect ranch scene.
Has he died and gone to heaven? He
can barely absorb it:
nature, sunshine, life.
Storm peers around. He is alone in a pretty room, with
Western and Oriental furnishings. He's safe; someone has
apparently put him to bed, seen that he's comfortable.
He remembers: the nurse ... Andy.
A TV is on at the foot of the bed.
Storm squints at the
digital clock beside him: 4:17 PM.
Storm closes his eyes.

STORM
Seven years.
He struggles to sit. It takes all his strength simply to
get half-propped on pillows. Something jabs him. It's a
TV remote, on the sheet beside him. Storm picks it up.
After a beat, he manages to focus on the TV --
TV SCREEN - "GERALDO SHOW" (FILE TAPE)
Heated argument in progress. Suddenly Roy Innis leaps
from his chair, starts strangling a white supremacist
across from him. Melee. The stage flooded with shooting,
fist-fighting men. Geraldo's nose is broken!

-- Stay tuned for more of: Best of

Dumbstruck.
STORM
Geraldo?
Outside the HORSE WHINNIES loudly and rears up on its
hind legs. Storm turns toward the horse --
When Storm is turned away from the TV, a 10-second ad
comes on. Senator Trent waving and smiling to a crowd.
AD (V.O.)

Senator Vernon Trent promises:
No

CLICK. Andy turns to see Storm standing there, glowering
--
his hand on the PHONE hang-up bar.
For half a beat, Andy is frightened: unsure what this man
will do. Then Storm starts to collapse.
Andy rushes to him, supports him.
ANDY
It's okay -- I'm here, I'm with

Storm on the couch, phone in hand -- Andy across from

Storm cups the receiver -- steaming -- waiting to be put

STORM

I can't stay here. They'll trace
you from the hospital in two --
ANDY
(cuts him off)
I told you -- no one knows I'm here!
I'm house-sitting...

frustrated and
frightened)
This place belongs to a doctor friend

six months. The medical center
only has my apartment address.
Even my friends don't have this

He grabs for a cane resting against the sofa.
ANDY

no chance)
I'll buy tickets to that.
STORM
I just need some food -- and a few
days to get my strength.
ANDY
Days?
Try a few weeks.
Storm braces against the cane, ready to try to stand.
Andy gets up, to catch him. This infuriates Storm's pride.
STORM
You helped me, okay? I'm grateful.
But every day you keep helping puts
you in more danger.
ANDY
(deadpan)
Danger is my middle name.
This is no joke to Storm.
STORM
I've been dead, Andy.
You wouldn't

He tries to get up.
Andy stops him.

Hey, hey -- I don't think you get

He makes it upright, shaking, with a "See, I told you"
look.
He starts toward the kitchen. Andy looks very worried
but doesn't try to stop him. First step -- okay. Second --
okay. Third -- blam! The cane slips and he falls flat on
his face. Too weak to break the fall.
LOW ANGLE - STORM
We see his face on the carpet and a mean desperate
conviction in these eyes not to fail and not to give up.
He struggles to rise -- it is pitiful. He's on his knees
growling with effort. Cane propped up, he manages to
somehow stand again. One step ... two steps ... three,
four ... he's absolutely exhausted. Boom! Falls flat
again.
ANOTHER LOW ANGLE
Storm's face on the floor.
EXTREME CLOSEUP
Fury, frustration, despair --
ANDY
grabs his arm and helps him back onto the couch. She
exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of
rice and begins to try to feed him. Of course he takes
the fork away and tries it himself, but by now his arms
are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake,
his hand trembles and he misses his mouth -- getting the
rice all down his beard. Spilling a little too much to
ignore and at first it looks like he's going to explode.
He looks up at Andy, who looks so sad.
Storm breaks out laughing and so does Andy. They howl
together for a while and then settle down. Now Andy begins
to "help" feed Storm.
Storm is in bed -- writing something on a note pad.

Storm writes from top to bottom, straight up and down.
STORM
Just some herbs I need for my
recovery.
She takes the list, studies it.
ANDY
No problem. This is on my list for
Safeway every day.
Andy enters, carrying a folder, and stares in surprise.
Storm has shaved and cut his hair. She obviously approves.
She watches for several moments as Storm, weak but on his
feet, holds on to the kitchen counter. He steps out, in
wobbly balance. Not too good at first, he tries again.
This time he does better, but not by much. He turns to
look at Andy, conscious of her look of sympathy.
STORM
(re: himself)
That bad ... huh?
She silently hands him a set of newspaper photocopies.
He glances at them... at her ... and understands.

Martha backs away -- toward a telephone.

The two cops stare at her penetratingly.
Martha knows this is it -- life or death.
She hurls the cat into Ford's face; the CAT claws him,
SHRIEKING. Martha knees Dunne in the balls, bolts --
Storm has found a zabutone meditation pillow and is sitting
on his knees in formal Japanese posture with black Dugi
pants and no shirt. He unravels a package with Oriental
characters handwritten on the outside.
In one section: what looks like an old wax Baggie full
of Chinese herbs. In the other, Storm unfolds a pouch
containing an assortment of needles: long, short, skinny,
fat.
Storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder
with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks
it in deep. He then twirls and adjusts it.
It is apparent that he knows what he's doing. We STAY
CLOSE ON the needles, noting the amount in the package
has greatly diminished.

friend, Captain O'Malley. If you
have any idea how to contact Captain
O'Malley, please help me.
MRS. WADE (OLD LADY)
As I've said, Miss Simpson, I've
already asked everybody in the home.
There is no O'Malley here. But
it's possible O'Malley could be a
relative of somebody living here.
Sunday is family day. Why don't
you leave your phone number and
I'll contact you if I learn anything.
ANDY
I can't do that.
Crestfallen.
Andy gets up.
ANDY
Can I phone you?
MRS. WADE
(pleasant;
innocuous)
Of course, my dear.
CLOSET
Andy opens the door, reaches in for her jacket.
Suddenly
she pauses.
She sees on the closet shelf, amid other clothing:
policeman's cap with a gold shield.
Andy makes a decision -- finds a pad on a table, scrawls
a phone number. She holds out the paper.
ANDY
(pointedly)
This is my number, Mrs. O'Malley.
The Old Lady never bats an eye.
MRS. WADE
(correcting her)
You mean Mrs. Wade. O'Malley is
the person you're looking for.

Andy meets her gaze.
ANDY
Yes ... you're right.
I'm sorry.
Storm has just finished a major aerobic workout and is
now doing some strange martial aerobic-type movements.
He is sweating profusely and is dressed in a tiny black
tank top and black sweat pants.
CAMERA PANS OVER TO a corner mirror and we see Andy peeking
through a crack in the door. She is enjoying this
immensely. She seems to be fighting her feelings, and
finally she puffs up her courage. Having made some
decision, she enters.
ANDY
Oh, I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to
interrupt. I, ah, well, I was just
passing by and ...
They stare at each other in
quite a different way. This
time it's obvious what Andy
wants, and Storm probably
wants the same thing. But
he tries very hard to maintain
his "one objective" in life
-- to get very strong and win
the upcoming battle.
He looks at this woman who now 'Looks more beautiful than
anyone he has ever seen. Storm throws down the light
weights in his hands and walks up to her.
He gently grabs the back of her head and pulls her hair
back and kisses her on the mouth. She seems to explode
with passion as she falls to the floor, pulling him on
top of her.

They roll in passion growing stronger and stronger. The
CAMERA PANS TO the mirror and we see Andy's feet moving
in delight.
DISSOLVE TO:
Alone, sitting up -- bare-chested, glistening with sweat
from the lovemaking. He glances across at his reflection
in the floor-to-ceiling mirror.
MIRROR - STORM
Seeing himself, just after making love.
His wedding ring.
ANDY
appears in the doorway, returning from the kitchen with a
tray and glasses. She wears a robe and has that mussed,
after-lovemaking glow.
She takes one look at Storm and her heart sinks.
She crosses to him -- lowers herself gracefully to kneel
beside him, setting down the tray and glasses.
STORM
(dead)
Thanks.
She looks at him. She has a good idea what's tormenting
his mind. She reaches her hand, gently touches his
shoulder ...
Storm pulls back.
STORM
Please.
He gets up, backing slowly away from her -- seeing the
pain in her eyes, feeling his own pain. In frustration,
he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment --
furiously venting rage! Andy flinches at the sound, the
violence.
STORM
I'm sorry --

emotion)
Sorry. I --

punch)
Why am I still in this fucking cage?!
What's wrong with my body? Why
won't it heal faster?!!
He slams another furious punch.
Andy gets up, tries to
approach Storm.
ANDY
Mason, please
(wants to ease
his pain)
I love you.
STORM
Don't say that!
ANDY
Why not?!
STORM
Because I can't love you! Don't
you see? It's seven years to anyone
else. But it's only days for me.
Andy draws a sharp, pained breath.
STORM
How can I be with you ... how can
I want you and take you, when --
He can't finish, torn by guilt. He stares at Andy.
Suddenly his tone becomes harsh, accusatory.
STORM
You seduced me. You came in here,
looking that way, knowing just what
the hell you were doing --
ANDY
(defiant)
Yeah, I knew. What of it? I wanted
you --
STORM
You have no right to want me!
ANDY
Then who does?!
I've risked my
life for you --

ANDY
You haven't stopped me!
STORM
Then don't risk it! Don't do shit
for me! I don't need you!
For a second it look's like he's going to strike her.
Instead he kicks the tray and GLASSES -- which smashes
into the floor-to-ceiling MIRROR, SHATTERING like a bomb?
Andy glares at him, stalks for the door --
Storm stalks in, slamming the door behind him -- crosses
in fury and despair to the desk. On the desktop: the
news photo of Felicia, Sonny and himself.
Storm stares at the photo in agony for a moment, then
rips the desk drawer open, rummages fiercely. He finds:
keys!
Storm strides in, punches the garage door button; the
door starts to open. He grabs the corner of a dusty canvas
cover -- jerks it off an Army-style Jeep.
The emotion of the parting with Mason catches up with
her.
ANDY
Get a hold of yourself, Andy.
She wipes her eyes, cranks the mirror around, tries to
fix her face. She looks like hell.
ANDY
(into mirror,
sarcastic)
You're really beautiful.
She puts on shades, pulls up the hood of her sweatshirt.

athletic fields, etc. O'Malley is with Sonny in some of
the shots, beaming, arm around the boy.
O'MALLEY (O.S.)
-- It's Sonny, all right. Believe
how big he got? He can throw a
football forty yards --
PULL BACK to reveal -- Storm looks up at his friend, too
moved to speak.
O'MALLEY
He made it to my house, the night
you got shot. I hid him, played it
out like he was dead -- even staged
a funeral, along with Felicia's and
yours. They bought it. Everyone
believed he was dead.
STORM
Where is he now? Is he safe?
O'MALLEY

my mother's maiden name, Wade. No
one has any idea he's your son.

Your nurse friend? Yeah. She left
your number, I traced you to here.
Storm gazes with great tenderness at the snapshots of
Sonny.
STORM
O'Mal ... I can never thank you.
O'MALLEY
Just seeing your ugly ass alive,
that's enough for me.

You wouldn't happen to have a beer
around this joint --
Storm indicates the fridge.
O'Malley helps himself brings
one for Storm.
STORM
I'd give my left arm to see Sonny,
just for two minutes. But we can't
risk it -- not yet. Not till I get
Calabrese.
O'MALLEY
Calabrese? Calabrese's dead.
Storm reacts.
O'MALLEY
Someone blew the shit out of his
Cadillac -- six months after you
'died.'

Coffee table piled with the news clippings Storm has been
studying these past days.
O'MALLEY
-- That night in the hospital, I
found the audiotape ... in your
vest. I must've listened to it a
thousand times -- looking for little
quirks in the voices, phrases they
repeat ...
His look shows he came up with nothing.
STORM
Where is the tape?
O'MALLEY
I turned it in for evidence.
Storm scowls.
0'MALLEY
Don't worry, I made a duve. I'll
get it for you. Meanwhile maybe
this'll cheer you up.
From O'Malley's briefcase comes .45 automatic, three empty
clips and a box of Glazer ammo.
Storm takes the weapon with pleasure. Checks the action,
hefts it for weight. He glances at O'Malley -- two old
comrades, ready to get back in action. Suddenly a bit of
sadness crosses Storm's face.
STORM
What happened, O'Mal?
To you?

O'Malley begins loading the clips: grim, almost
heartbroken.

I was on the case, trying to find
who pulled the trigger on you. But
it was like swimming through shit.
People kept telling me to back off.
Then one morning, the phone rings.
Immaculate Heart Emergency: someone
ran my mother off the road, her
back's broken, she's paralyzed.
STORM
(painful, emotion)
I'm sorry, O'Mal.
O'MALLEY
That night there's a note in my
locker -- letting me know it's not
an accident.
He looks at Storm, tormented.
O'MALLEY
You know me, Storm. I never would've
backed off. But there was Sonny to
worry about too. What if they found
him? What if they found you?
STORM
You did the right thing, O'Mal.
Storm takes a loaded clip from his friend, slams it into
the butt of the .45. He jacks the slide back and lets it
slam home -- chambering a round.
STORM
We'll get 'em, buddy. Every fucking
one of them.
Storm enters, still deep in thought.
Racking his brain --
Storm poised inside the front door -- .45 in hand.
In
walks ... Andy!
She nearly faints at the sight of the pistol leveled
between her eyes. Storm instantly jerks the weapon back.
They stand there staring at each other.
ANDY
Martha's dead.
Storm takes Andy in his arms. She weeps, sobbing. Feeling
all the tension and terror of the past days -- yet somehow
knowing she's safe in the arms of this man she loves.
ANDY
I won't leave you. Not ever again.
STORM
I won't let you.
Storm holds her, knowing he loves her.
STORM
O'Malley was here.
ANDY
Here?
How did you find him?
STORM
You found him. The old lady was his
mother.

Andy raises her face to Storm's, her eyes welling with

Storm hurls Andy so hard and fast it looks like she will
land in pieces. He somehow ends up in front of her on

them -- on the first floor.
Joe Bear waits concealed at
the top of the stairs, on an
interior balcony overlooking
the living room, atrium-style.
Through the mouth opening of
his ski mask, we see he is
smiling a sick smile -- and
sensually stroking his Bowie
knife.
ANGLE - TRACKING - STORM
Storm and Andy scramble up the staircase onto the atrium
balcony and out steps Joe Bear with his knife and his
smile.
Joe Bear, for the first time in his life, is surprised
when Storm smiles too. Joe Bear screams like an animal
and lunges with his knife.
Storm stabs out his left arm like a spear and tilts his
body ever so slightly, then clamps Joe Bear's wrist with
his right hand.

Ford and Jones, masked, hurtle into the living room, just
below the atrium balcony. They raise their automatic
weapons, but before they can fire --
STORM
hurls Joe Bear's massive body down upon the attackers!
Jones takes the tonnage head-on and is crushed beneath
it! Ford dodges, unleashes a burst of AUTOMATIC FIRE
straight up at the balcony. Storm shoves Andy to safety
onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just
as the whole interior balcony is RIDDLED by Ford's BULLETS!
Ford bolts for the staircase, coming after Storm. Storm,
crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits
till Ford hurtles INTO VIEW at the top of the staircase.
Storm FIRES his .45 furiously ... Ford springs back,
Storm's BULLETS BLAST the staircase WALL to ribbons. His
.45 CLICKS empty!
The unmistakable sound of a TIRE BLOWING OUT.
O'MALLEY
Shit!
Storm yanks up the brake, full of urgency -- pulls out
his gun.

We just made the top of the chart,
Andy. Every cop in the city thinks
we shot our way out of a legitimate
bust --

There are no cops here!

Only 'cause they're too stupid.

ready to go)
We need that film and we don't need

A pleasant, chatty (and very pregnant) HOUSEWIFE speaks
through the open door to Storm and Andy. Sounds of

market your home more effectively.
Two plasterers troop past, a carpenter with them.
HOUSEWIFE
Hell, come on in. Everyone else
does.
Storm and Andy enter. Andy immediately begins to steer
the Housewife away from the kitchen, into the living room.
"Oh what a cute place!
I'd love to see what you're doing with the nursery..."
Storm casually lingers behind, drifting into the kitchen.
He crosses immediately to the alcove where, seven years
earlier, he stashed the camera case.
But the spot has been remodeled!
There's a new wall there!
STORM
New wall ... fucking yuppies!
Without hesitation, he slams his fist through --
WALL
Bang! Gypsum wallboard splinters, revealing a fake panel
of brick adjacent to a real brick wall, six inches behind
the new wallboard. Storm reaches into the hole, yanks
out the camera case. He shakes his sore knuckles from
the blow as:
HOUSEWIFE AND ANDY
arrive from the living room. The Housewife stares in
shock at this strange man -- with his hand halfway through
her new wall.

from his ear. Thinking fast, troubled. Andy beside him...
both of them keeping their faces obscured as moviegoers
and business people pass.
STORM

O'Malley left his mother's place
three hours ago -- with the tape.
He should be at the school by now,
but she hasn't heard back from him.

staring)

Nolan and Turner clump down and away, laughing and making
wisecracks.
He waits till they're out of sight, then swiftly mounts a
tall equipment box that reaches almost to the ceiling.
He shoves a few boxes out of his way, revealing --
WIRE MESH HATCH

back atop the tall equipment box, kicks up hard -- the
hatch pops open!

climbs out onto the "roof" of the room. He sees a short
catwalk leading to the huge, high wall of the dynamo room.
Against the wall are big windows.
Sonny scoots to the windows, which are cracked open awning

office and out into the street in front of the hotel!
Andy follows through the newly formed exit. People scream.
Chaos. The other cops react in pursuit of Storm and Andy.
0'Malley scans the monitor above the ticket seller's
window. The 11:10 to Albuquerque leaves on track 12.
The waiting area is quiet at this time of night except
for a few travelers and stragglers.
Sonny Storm, quiet and apprehensive, focuses on tearing
open the packet of mustard for his hot dog. He sits on
top of a battered suitcase.
O'Malley returns with the tickets and sits next to Sonny
on a bench.
O'MALLEY

What time is he getting here anyway?
O'MALLEY

Just then, O'Malley becomes aware of a bad vibe in the
air. A foreign presence. Nolan, and Turner have followed
him and Sonny from Mrs. O'Malley's house. Now they
approach --
NOLAN

Hey, O'Malley! Long time no see.

NOLAN

We

CLUNK! O.S. we hear a CLATTERING ECHO.
Sonny has picked up his jacket.
The tape has fallen onto
the marble floor!
O'MALLEY
Sonny -- run!
Sonny snatches up the tape and leaps over the bench, racing
toward the rear doorway heading for the street.
Nolan and Turner start to run after him. O'Malley throws
a fierce body block on both men, sending all three crashing
into a big, loaded luggage cart. O'Malley finds his feet
first as all three struggle to get up. Nolan starts to
pull his gun. O'Malley grabs a heavy metallic suitcase
and smashes Nolan in the face with all his strength.
Nolan crashes backward against Turner, toppling them both
into a huge 25-foot lighting installer's ladder -- which
now starts -- to cave over, pulling a string of dozens of
big industrial GLOBES plummeting to the floor and EXPLODING
into thousands of tiny shards! People scream. O'Malley
shoves the luggage cart at the men and races for the door --
Andy and Sonny topple into the back seat.
The DRIVER
picks up on all the frenzy.
DRIVER
Where to?

That's a good question.

Holland grabs his shoulder holster off the back of a chair,
stalks angrily toward a rear door.
The others glower as Holland pounds off into the rear of
the house. Dunne slings a cue ball the length of the
table, breaking the rack with a crack like a pistol shot.
The balls ricochet into each other and the cushions in a
futile expression of rage and frustration. Suddenly:
STORM
Out of nowhere appears at the door opposite the one Holland
just left by.
He is dripping from the rain and has a .45
pointed at them with one hand, while with the other he
holds a finger to his lips as if to say, "Shhh, don't

DUNNE, FORD AND JONES
don't know whether to shit or go blind.

hand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseball
and the cue is a bat. This doesn't work very well, as
Storm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, using
his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the
pool table. We hear Ford's SKULL CRACK and he goes down.
Almost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashes
toward Storm's head. This time Storm has his own tool --
and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect
with his head.
He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as
soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back
of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP
at the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is
left with the jagged tip of the skinny end.
Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch
at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher
knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table.
Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's
midsection. With the other hand he
raises the sharpened
end of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throat
via the windpipe!
STORM
That's for my wife. Fuck you and
die.
Dunne falls to his knees and just stares. Storm does a
flying kick to his chin, breaking his neck. The room now
finished, he turns and exits.
INDOOR POOL
Holland pours himself a nervous drink. He paces, tracking
Trent who's doing a gentle breaststroke.
TRENT
I want Dunne and the others here.
That goddamn Storm is nuts enough
to come after me --
HOLLAND
He's nuts -- but not that nuts.
Holland watches Trent swim a few more strokes, then turns
and heads away down a short hallway.

as he lifts the toilet seat to pee, he finds a handwritten
note on the seat. Shocked, he nervously looks around.
Seeing nothing, he picks up the note and reads it.
INSERT - NOTE
Anticipation of death is worse than death itself.
HOLLAND
A faint smile comes to his face with great confidence.
As he backs out of the toilet, he pulls his pistol from
his shoulder holster, cocking it. He cautiously exits.
TRACKING
Holland as he
moves toward the sporting room
and his
support team.
He enters the area of carnage
and the smug
confidence on
his face starts to change to a
slight worry.
He then starts
carefully making his way back
to the indoor
pool to inform
Trent.
INDOOR POOL
Holland enters the area and finds no one.
Now the look
on his face is one of fear and confusion.
HOLLAND
Sonofabitch.
But he has a plan. His plan is to try to make it out of
the house in one piece. What was once careful stalking
has turned into panicked blundering.
CONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things, knocking
them over, retreating wildly. He passes a raging fireplace
and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice:
STORM (O.S.)
How does it feel to know you're
about to die?
Holland FIRES in the direction of the voice, and Storm
comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his
.45 pointed at Holland.
STORM
I'll give you more time than you
and Trent gave my wife.

Holland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again.
As
he fires, Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland.
WALL BEHIND HOLLAND
A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group
of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's
head. They are both out of ammo.
STORM'S POV
Holland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like
maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the
AIR.
But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker
away from him.
They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland
gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING.
Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casually
strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide
and seek with a childhood friend.
STORM
Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are
you?
Storm opens closets, looks in drawers, under the toilet
seat, and then proceeds into --
STORM
(loud enough
for Trent to
hear)
Let's see ... where could that bad
boy be?
From the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a
kiddie game, we are not sure if: Storm has gone mad or
what. He approaches the master closet as he continues
the taunting melody.
MASTER CLOSET
Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks
aside -- looking for something that's probably not there.
Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a
jet to the Bahamas by now.

One more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section.
Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and
deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank
... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely
missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm
gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen
eye to eye.
STORM AND TRENT
Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then
violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his
chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off
shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight
into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the
teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his
mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head.
Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through
the house, shotgun still in his mouth.
STORM
You know, Trent, I want to kill you
so bad I can barely contain myself.
But I keep thinking that death is
far too merciful a fate for you,
and that a nice petite white-bread
boy like you in a federal
penitentiary ...
(pause)
-- let me put it this way -- I doubt
whether you could remain anal
retentive for very long. Yeah... I
think that's best for you --
Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about
to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey
through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's
mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared
before, you should see him now.
Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to
pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last
chance.
Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth
impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes
flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps
inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent
and flips him backwards head-first into the fire.
Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron
arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to
free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ...
a fate somewhat worse than prison.

Storm turns away --
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
