  Buck reaches behind her, under the seat, and pulls out a 
  SAWED-OFF PUMP SHOTGUN...

  ... and the two of them are out of the car and into the mart.

  A SHOTGUN BLAST explodes inside, the sudden burst of light 
  flashing through the MINI-MART WINDOW

  I/E CAFE44

  through which we see violent shadows, and toppling display 
  cases -- hear muffled gasps and --

                You!  That your Beemer?  Gimme the

  Movement and GUNSHOTS -- screams -- more gunshots...

  ... one of the blasts SHATTERING the front window.  Neon 
  ruptures, spewing sparks.

  A beat of horrible silence, then --

  David peels off --

  CRIME TECHS.

                              MEGAN
                It wasn't about the money.  Not 
                  exclusively, anyhow.

  She points at THE FREEZER, where, in the condensation, a POEM 
  has been scrawled.  BLOOD streaks the letters...

                              DON
                      (reads)
                "Our love is like a flower, it

                              EDGERTON
                Least he got it to rhyme this time.

  The agents turn to see IAN EDGERTON approach, studying the 
  crime scene.  He points past the poem, inside the FREEZER, at 
  STACKS OF FROZEN BURRITOS.

                Buck likes burritos; eats 'em

                ahead of them yet; there s no rhyme 
                or reason to their move. They seem 
                to go for whatever s in front of 
                them.

                morals since Homecoming Game.

                Only thing a teacher ever gave me 
                was detention.

                However the conversation went, Dad 
                ended up with a full clip of 9mm

                Pretty extreme reaction.

                              DON
                She was looking at a statutory rape

                They tucked Dad in Buck s garage 
                and hit the road, started robbing

                  Crystal's the alpha.  Notice how 
                all of the spoils go to her -- she

                great news for Calsci, of course, 
                and personally I think we have the

                  Relocation is considered a high-

                it's been nothing less than

                adaptive skills, Alan.  The last

                              LARRY
                Without an address -- and 
                  intentionally so.  I've come to 
                realize that committing oneself to 
                  a permanent living space constricts 
                your intellectual vistas; devoting 
                time and energy to maintenance, the 
                  acquisition of goods...
                      (beat)
                ... just last week I spent two 
                nights up in the mountains, 
                  contemplating the heavens from a 
                  non-cosmological perspective for 
                the first time in years.

                              ALAN
                How does Megan feel about this 
                vagabond lifestyle of yours?

                              LARRY
                While our relationship has advanced 
                  noticeably these past few weeks, I 
                have explained to her that there 
                must be a -- firewall, if you will, 
                between romantic pursuits and my 
                larger life s quests.

  Alan considers this, then --

                              ALAN
                Larry, I'm going to give you the 
                same advice I give all the geniuses 
                I know.

                              LARRY
                Which is?

                              ALAN
                Don't be an idiot.

                              DAVID
                Twenty minutes before Crystal Hoyle 
                and Buck Winters robbed that bar in 
                Wyoming, someone made a call from 
                the bar s pay phone; a call  to 
                Venice, California.

  He hands over a RAP SHEET...

  LYDIA CAMPOS, 30's, skeletal and worn out.

                              DAVID (CONT D)
                Number came back to a Lydia Campos.

                              MEGAN
                      (scanning the sheet)
                  Possession, intent to sell --

                              DAVID
                Look at May 13, 1992.

                              MEGAN
                Picked up on a drug sweep...
                      (huh)
                ... with Crystal Hoyle. Now there's 
                  a coincidence.

                              DAVID
                  Fortunately a judge didn't think 
                so... he gave us a Title 3 wiretap.
                      (beat)
                Figured we d give it some time 
                before we brought her in -- see if 
                Crystal contacts her again --
                      (then)
                Hold on.  Got a call coming in.

  David puts it on a SPEAKER...


  A dank basement.  TWO CHEMISTS cook meth at a long table --

  -- while OSCAR and FELIX, two dealers, sit at a table, 
  counting cash and bundling decks of glassine envelopes.

  A DOOR ALARM goes off.  They glance at a

  CLOSED CIRCUIT MONITOR --

  on which we see BUCK and CRYSTAL standing outside.  Oscar 
  nods, and Felix gets up, jamming a 9mm pistol into his belt 
  as he walks to a heavy metal door --

  -- opening the eye slot.

                              FELIX
                Come back in an hour.

  He slams the peephole shut, starts to walk back; the DOOR 
  ALARM goes off again.

  Annoyed, he opens the slot again --

                              FELIX (CONT'D)
                Do you know who you're playing 
                with?

                              CRYSTAL
                Do you know what you're standing 
                in?

  Felix looks down -- he is standing in a POOL OF YELLOW 
  LIQUID, growing by the second.

                              CRYSTAL (CONT'D)
                91 octane.

  Crystal holds up a LIGHTER -- flicks it on --

                              CRYSTAL (CONT'D)
                Knew a guy who lit a cigarette in a 
                lab -- he's still in the burn ward.
                      (darkly)
                Open the door.

  Felix hesitates, then unlatches the door with one hand, 
  reaching into his belt for his gun with the other --

  -- but Buck kicks the door the rest of the way -- and BLASTS 
  FELIX with his shotgun.  NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         28.



  OSCAR -- reaches for his gun -- but Buck is faster, turning 
  and shooting him as well -- money and meth exploding across 
  the table.

  Then he turns to cover the CHEMISTS who have stepped back 
  from the table -- hands in the air --

                              BUCK
                Up against the wall!

  As they comply, and Crystal covers them --

  -- Buck moves to the table.  Scooping up the cash and drugs, 
  dumping them in a backpack and tossing it over his 
  shoulder...

                              CHEMIST #1
                No trouble, lady.  

                              CRYSTAL
                Sure there is -- people like you, 
                screwing up kids -- someone s 
                children --

  ... Buck moving into the corner, to a DROP CEILING --

  which he pushes up...

  ... looking inside, at something we can't see -- and smiling.

                              BUCK
                It's here -- just like she said.

  He loads some things out of the ceiling, into his bag, as 
  Crystal backs toward the door.


  Now a charred mess.  FIREMEN exiting, CRIME SCENE working --

  -- as EDGERTON and MEGAN study the -- FOUR BODIES -- covered 
  with sheets, lined up across the floor.

                              MEGAN
                  Witnesses saw male/white and  
                  female/white flee the scene in a 
                Camaro.

  Edgerton looks at the floor, crouches over BOOTPRINTS -- 
  smeared through blood.

                              EDGERTON
                Size 9 workboots.  See the star-
                shaped scuff on the insole?  Buck 
                picked that up between Kansas and 
                  Missouri.

  They walk to the corner of the room... where DON is checking 
  the DROP CEILING.

                              MEGAN
                Meth labs like to use users as

                              DON
                There had to be at least fifty, a 
                hundred thousand in cash, double

                  before...

                              MEGAN
                Drugs got Crystal arrested and sent 
                back home.  This could have been 
                  symbolic, retributive --

                              DON
                -- or maybe it's about firepower.

  ALAN and CHARLIE eat breakfast.  Actually, Charlie eats 
  breakfast, and Alan stares at him.

  Charlie lets this go on for a few beats, then finally:

                What I mean is, it's a good time to

                with you, I like living with you.  
                But I'd like to try living alone.

  Charlie pauses, absorbs this...

                              CHARLIE
                It's a lot of responsibility, you

                We ve only been on a few dates 
                  really... What if she's given up

                Oh my god... what if she wants to 
                move into my house now that my

                It sounds a little like the old saw 
                -- you chased her until she caught 
                you.

  of a BIPLANE, spinning and banking through the sky, doing 
  barrel rolls --

                -- airplane, flying across the sky.  
                Banking and spinning.  From the 
                flight path, we try to discern a

                What the map doesn't show us, what 
                we're not seeing --

  -- reveal a SECOND PLANE -- maybe a "Red Baron" Fokker 
  triplane -- in pursuit -- firing on it --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                -- is that there's a second 
                airplane, chasing after the first 
                one. Affecting the plane s 
                movement, weighing on each of the 
                pilots decisions.

                  movements against those of your

  Charlie enters a SECOND SET of DOTS on THE PLASMA -- which 
  follow the first set, but not exactly.

                -- the pattern makes itself known.

                              EDGERTON
                Some pattern -- they hit, I chase.

                              CHARLIE
                Not exactly... for instance, you 
                arrived in Los Angeles before you 
                knew they were here.

                And when we plotted your path 
                against Hoyle and Winters  --

  ON THE PLASMA -- the U.S. map fades and the dots resolve into 
  TWO SWIRLING LINES.

                              LARRY (CONT D)
                -- we came up with this.

  Charlie points to a DOT along the curve --

                              CHARLIE
                This is the Red Desert robbery.  
                The missing point on a curve I 
                didn't realize I was looking at.
                      (beat)
                It's a variation of something

                see...

  BACK TO AUDIENCE VISION --

  of our WWI dogfight --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                -- if a fighter pilot flies 
                straight at the point where he sees 
                an enemy plane --

  -- the biplane turns, but the Red Baron flies straight -- 
  seeing nothing but empty air --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                -- by the time he gets there, the 
                plane will be gone.

  -- turning and finding the biplane again -- this time 
  matching its maneuvers, banking when the biplane banks, 
  dipping when the biplane dips --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                Just to maintain his following 
                distance, the chasing pilot has to 
                constantly adjust his direction -- 
                matching the movements of his 
                quarry.

  -- then, when the biplane turns -- the Red Baron turns deeper 
  -- cutting into its path --  NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         37.



                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                If he wants to catch the plane, he 
                has to anticipate its movement -- 
                aim his nose ahead of the lead 
                plane --

  -- and firing its machine gun, which hits the biplane 
  broadside; it goes down in a plume of smoke...

  MEGAN interviews a shaky, jonesing LYDIA.  In front of them 
  on the table: the brown bag, with packets of METH and CASH.

                You ve got the drugs back.  What 
                else do you want?

                Billy was the reason we got busted.

                              MEGAN 
                So why call you ten years later?

                Someone who could help her make 
                things right... When I told her 
                about the meth lab, and all those  
                guns, she got real interested.

                              MEGAN
                And what about Billy? Where do I

                I've been running expressions that 
                assume a dog chasing a cat --

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION --

  as a DOG chases a CAT across a yard --

                              CHARLIE
                But it's a dog chasing a cat...  
                chasing a mouse.

  -- reveal that the cat is pursuing a MOUSE.

                              EDGERTON
                Thought I was an airplane --

                              CHARLIE
                Dogs and cats work better now.

  BACK TO AUDIENCE VISION --

  as the mouse scrambles across the yard, darting this way and 
  that, the cat adjusts its path as the dog adjusts its path 
  after the cat --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                The cat has two sets of points 
                affecting it now... the way she has 
                to adjust her angle of pursuit to 
                overtake mouse, and the strategy 
                she employs to evade the dog.  NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         46.



  The dog breaks away from its pursuit -- heading toward the 
  mouse --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                Obviously, the dog's optimal 
                strategy is to head for the 
                mouse...

  -- intercepting the cat.

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                ... and let the cat come to him.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              EDGERTON
                Problem is, the cat has a big head

                              DON
                But we don't actually need Rivers' 
                location -- we only need to know 
                where Hoyle is going to look for 
                him.

  Charlie starts writing again --

                              CHARLIE
                  Exactly... if we adjust and weight 
                values for Rivers' previous known 
                  locations, old addresses, sites of 
                arrest, and such, eliminating those 
                places we know that Hoyle has 
                already searched -- while using 
                them to infer her decision 
                  patterns...

  Charlie's pen flies across the board.  Edgerton looks at Don 
  and smiles.

                              EDGERTON
                Voodoo.

  Edgerton and Don leave Charlie writing on the dryboard, we 
  PUSH IN on his equations -- then --


  Charlie still working, alone, as AMITA enters --

                Hey Charlie, are you ready --  NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         47.



  Charlie stops, checks his watch --

                              CHARLIE
                -- we're supposed to go to dinner.

                              AMITA
                If you're in the middle of 
                  something...

                              CHARLIE
                Pursuit curves... trying to reduce 
                Don's search options on those spree 
                  killers...

                              AMITA
                Oh... okay.

  Charlie tries to read Amita's reaction, can't really --

                              CHARLIE
                I guess I could take a break... we 
                could go someplace close...

                              AMITA
                      (a little awkwardly as 
                        well)
                No... this is clearly more 
                  important than dinner.

                              CHARLIE
                      (weakly)
                It is important... but you're 
                  important too...

                              AMITA
                Charlie, we'll both need to eat 
                again.

                Anyway, I've got a seminar on the 
                Adaptive enumeration of implicit 
                surfaces on Thursday, and I should 
                probably go over my notes...

                You sure?

                              AMITA
                Sure.

  board and studies his work --  NUMB3RS  #301/38  "Spree, Pt. 1" BUFF REV  7-25-06         48.



  -- circling ONE EXPRESSION.  Off of it -- we DISSOLVE TO:


  As COLBY and DAVID jimmy the lock and enter -- quietly --

  FOLLOWING THEM -- through the darkened hallway, checking each 
  door, still stealthy, until they come to


  Where RIVERS' COUSIN, 20's, is in bed with his GIRLFRIEND.  
  COLBY puts his finger to his lips.

  Where DAVID and COLBY crouch behind cover as HEADLIGHTS wash 
  through the curtains...


  As DAVID and COLBY move into place -- guns trained on the 
  kitchen door they entered through -- as a SHADOW appears at 
  the window --

                gonna  have to go --

  A GUN BUTT smashes through the window pane -- a HAND reaches 
  through the glass --


  MEGAN and DON grill BUCK, bandaged hand.

                I'm not going to tell you where she

                      (off Buck)
                She sent you out as bait, Buck.   
                Almost got you killed..

                              BUCK
                You guys don t understand her. Not

                Crystal loves me so much, she never 
                lets me out of her sight. I had to 
                wait for her to fall asleep just to 
                leave.

                              DON
                She loves you so much, she shot 
                your father fourteen times.

                              BUCK
                My mom drank herself to death over 
                that old bastard s abuse.  Crys was 
                the only one who was there for me -- 
                and he was going to get her fired 
                for that.

                              MEGAN
                She killed him to protect your 
                secret?

                              BUCK
                You're not listening; I killed him.  
                I'd kill anyone who tried to hurt 
                her. The things she s been already 
                through in her life... 

  Megan's eyes gleam with understanding.

                              MEGAN
                You didn t tell her where you were 
                going, did you. You wanted to get

                her arrested --

  He cuts himself off.

                You saw what she did to Brenner... 
                what almost happened to you...

                If you love her Buck, help us take 
                her safely.

                              BUCK
                Take her? You can t lock up a force 
                of nature.

                Then what s the problem?

                              CHARLIE
                Don't get me wrong -- Amita s an 
                amazing woman.  But now every date, 
                hell, every conversation has 
                this... weight on it.  I m always 
                  wondering if she's thinking: "this 
                is what I gave up Harvard for?"

                              DON
                Come on... if she stayed, it's 
                because she wants the same things 
                you do.

                              CHARLIE
                What if I don't want all those 
                things -- at least not in one big

                they're never going to be exactly 
                what you want them to be.  Look at 
                me and Robin -- she s trying to

                Why? I thought you really liked 
                her.

  Don stumped by that -- changing the subject back --

                              DON
                Look, you wanted a second chance 
                and you got it. The only thing 
                that'll screw it up now is...

                I m not sure why, but no -- in 
                fact, I find it oddly attractive.

                its designated course, and I vowed 
                to make some correction at the 
                earliest opportunity.
