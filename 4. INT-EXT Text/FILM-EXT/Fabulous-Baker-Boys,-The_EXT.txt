STREET - JACK
Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing
a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with
the milieu.
Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an
all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before
he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he
goes.
Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.
Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at
the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.
DOORMAN
Hey, Jackie!
JACK
How goes it, Tommy?
TOMMY (DOORMAN)
(shrugging)
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
JACK
Losing his teeth.
TOMMY
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox.
I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust
the taps.
JACK
Yeah.
(standing back)
Jesus, you look like fucking
royalty, Tommy.
Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat.
TOMMY
Yeah.
The big boys sent it down
yesterday.
JACK
Another five years, huh?
TOMMY
Like clockwork.
You got a good
memory, Jackie.
JACK
It ain't always a blessing.
My
brother here?
TOMMY
(nodding)
He's got blood in his eye.
Jack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and
moves into the hotel.
STREET - JACK AND FRANK
Jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped
soup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard
stand-up under his arm.
FRANK
You mind telling me what that was about in there?
Was that planned?
Or were you just bored and decided
to get creative?
JACK
Fuck him.
FRANK
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on
Route 81, Jack.
JACK
Fuck him.
FRANK
(to himself)
Fuck him.
Great.
Terrific.
Fuck him.
The fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to
Frank's car. Frank opens the trunk and starts to put
the stand-up away.
JACK
So we on tomorrow night?
FRANK
(shaking his head)
Maybe Thursday.
I hear the harpist at the
Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Jack nods and starts to walk away.
FRANK
(continuing)
Hey.
Jack stops.
FRANK
(continuing)
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house
this weekend.
Say hello to the kids.
They've grown.
JACK
I hate your kids, Frank.
FRANK
You're their uncle.
JACK
Only by relation.
Besides, they hate me, too.
FRANK
They don't.
They're always asking about you.
JACK
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
FRANK
It was an accident.
JACK
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little
one ...
FRANK
Cindy.
JACK
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.
How do you explain that?
FRANK
She didn't know what she was doing.
You're too sensitive.
JACK
You got weird kids, Frank.
FRANK
Look, I just thought if you came out you might
see what you're missing.
Jack just stares at Frank.
FRANK
(continuing)
Just think about it, all right?
Consider it a standing offer.
Frank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side.
FRANK
(continuing;like a litany)
You want a ride, Jack?
No, Frank,
I'll walk.
Okay, Jack, good night.
Good night, Frank.
Frank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb.
Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance,
then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads
for home.
ANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING
Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment
building, where a black labrador is studying him from
a second story window.
STREET
Jack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand,
gets out of Frank's car and surveys the street
on which he grew up.
FRANK
Make sure you lock.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses
three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth
of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity.
But it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point.
BACK TO SCENE
FRANK
Place looks good, huh?
I got a neighbor boy to
mow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.
Times've changed, huh?
(pointing)
See the tree?
Remember the job Cecil did on it the day
Dad planted it?
You can still see the scars on the trunk.
Really.
I was looking at it just the other day.
Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.
Frank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise,
then raps on the front door.
Jack studies the tree a moment,
then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand.
JACK
So what'd we get her?
FRANK
You'll see.
ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
At that moment, the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER
is there, a vibrant woman in her sixties.
MRS. BAKER
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
FRANK
How's the birthday girl?
MRS. BAKER
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Mrs. Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly,
embraces Jack.
MRS. BAKER
(continuing)
John.
It's good to see you.
JACK
(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)
Good to see you, Ma.
Jack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and
mimics "John" with a knowing nod.
FRANK
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore.
Jack. He goes by Jack.
MRS. BAKER
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
FRANK
Twenty years, Ma ...
MRS. BAKER
Yes, yes.
It's just that John is so much nicer.
Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,
we had a pig on the farm named Jack.
I guess I just can't help making the association.
Jack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he
holds his brother personally responsible for this.
FRANK
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma,
John Kennedy went by Jack.
MRS. BAKER
Catholics.
What do you expect?
Oh, well, what's in a name, right?
Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
As Mrs. Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack.
FRANK
Keep her busy, will ya?
I have to set a few things up.
Frank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch
with the bakery box.
Jack shakes his head,
wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon,
then enters the house.
STREET - DAWN
The next morning.
Early.
The sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and
beginning to drip out onto the street.
Suddenly,
RINGING OUT over the rooftops, is "JINGLE BELLS"
-- not the entire song, just the first two bars,
over and over.
IHT.
JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
Jack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering
Eddie, opens his eyes.
Across the room,
seated at the piano, is NINA, the little girl.
She stops playing and turns.
NINA
Morning.
You want coffee?
I made coffee.
Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up.
He nods to the coffee.
Nina goes to the kitchen.
NINA
(continuing)
I did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.
Jack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window.
NINA
(continuing)
Did you break a cup, Jack?
JACK
Eddie did.
Nina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch,
then brings Jack his coffee with both hands.
NINA
I practiced the piano last night.
Two hours.
I think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'
Jack nods.
Suddenly, the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard.
Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.
NINA
(continuing)
Guess they're up.
JACK
Sounds big.
What's he do?
NINA
Process server.
Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours
are more regular.
All I know's he came to take
the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for
dinner.
And breakfast.
JACK
What happened to the donut king?
NINA
Married.
Upstairs, a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the
stairwell. Nina peers out the window.
NINA
No breakfast.
Maybe they had a fight.
TWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling.
NINA
(continuing)
Well, gotta go.
Teach me later?
Jack nods.
Nina kisses him on the cheek and exits.
Jack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge.
JACK
Hey.
STREET
A taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses.
In his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap
gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers.
He walks up to the door of a small white house and
presses the doorbell.
When there is no response, he goes around to the back.
The backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence
surrounding it.
Two kids, a girl and a boy,
are splashing around in a build-it-yourself
above-ground pool.
When they see Jack, they stop splashing.
Only their heads are visible above the water.
JACK
Hey, kids.
Dad home?
The two heads say nothing.
JACK
(continuing)
What d'ya say?
Wanna run and get
him for me?
Still nothing.
Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette,
and pats his pocket for a match.
JACK
(continuing)
Shit.
The kids' eyes widen at his profanity.
Jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip,
ponders things for a moment,
then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence.
At which point,
the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.
JACK
(continuing)
Hey, kid.
Take it easy.
No use.
The kid's a world-class screamer.
Frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed,
comes racing out of the house.
FRANK
Cindy!
What is it?
Cindy points.
At Jack.
FRANK
(continuing)
Jack.
JACK
Your doorbell doesn't work.
FRANK
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.
You
remember Uncle Jack.
DONNA, Frank's wife, appears.
DONNA
What's the matter?
Jack?
Jack waves.
FRANK
(lifting Cindy out of the pool)
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
DONNA
I'll take her inside.
You too,
little Frank.
Out of the pool.
Donna shepherds the kids toward the house.
FRANK
Feet!
The kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat
and disappear into the house.
Frank turns to Jack.
FRANK
(continuing)
It's probably the excitement of
seeing you again.
BACKYARD (LATER)
Donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade.
The men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed
aluminum chairs.
FRANK
Well, look at this.
DONNA
You bring trunks, Jack?
JACK
Trunks?
DONNA
Swimming trunks.
JACK
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
DONNA
Too bad.
You could use some sun.
Really.
JACK
Maybe next time.
DONNA
We have some lotion.
JACK
Just the same.
DONNA
Suit yourself.
Donna returns to the house.
Frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his
surroundings complacently.
FRANK
Nice, huh?
JACK
What?
FRANK
The trees.
The flowers.
Nice.
JACK
Terrific.
FRANK
(expansively)
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring.
After the rains.
Look good as new.
JACK
You ask me out here to sell me
your house, Frank?
Frank shakes the ice in his glass.
JACK
(continuing)
Charlie paid you off last night,
didn't he?
FRANK
I don't know what you mean.
JACK
The hell you don't.
FRANK
I told you.
Something came up.
Some political dinner or something.
JACK
Bullshit.
Fifteen years, Frank.
No one paid us off.
FRANK
It wasn't like that.
JACK
No?
FRANK
No.
JACK
What was it like?
FRANK
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right?
I got two kids. I got a wife.
Besides, he made the deal.
There's no shame in it.
JACK
That how you see it?
FRANK
Yeah, that's how I see it.
Jack shakes his head in disgust.
FRANK
(continuing)
And don't go shaking your head, little brother.
I'm not the one who walks in every night smelling
like he's got a day job in a piss factory.
(pause)
It killed him, you know.
Jack glances up.
Dangerous territory.
JACK
A gust of wind killed him.
FRANK
Yeah, and what put him up there?
JACK
Hey, you weren't there.
Right?
Jack's look ends this.
Frank sighs.
FRANK
Look, can we forget last night?
We gotta talk.
JACK
Talk.
FRANK
I been thinking maybe we should
make some changes.
(pause)
I been thinking maybe we should
take on a singer.
Silence.
JACK
Sure, why not.
FRANK
It's just an idea.
I want your opinion.
I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
JACK
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't
you say?
FRANK
We agreed that if I took care of the business;
I'd be entitled to the extra.
Isn't that what we agreed?
JACK
That's what we agreed.
FRANK
If you're unhappy with the
arrangement --
JACK
I'm not unhappy.
FRANK
If you'd like to assume more of the financial
responsibilities, I'd be glad --
JACK
Frank.
Fuck it.
Okay?
FRANK
I've tried to do well by you, Jack.
By both of us.
JACK
I'm grateful, Frank.
How much?
For the singer.
FRANK
I thought maybe twenty percent.
Look, with the additional bookings we'll
come out ahead.
The big hotels,
they want a pretty girl with a big voice.
We have to stay competitive, Jack.
Jack laughs coldly.
FRANK
What's that?
JACK
You, Frank.
All these years you been telling me
we're different.
We got novelty, Jack.
No one can touch us.
FRANK
Two pianos isn't enough anymore,
Jack.
JACK
It never was.
YOUNG WOMAN
in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the
center of a tiny room in the back of Willie's piano
showroom, holding some sheet music.
Sammy Davis Jr.'s
face is on the sheet music.
Frank is sitting against
the opposite wall, a notepad in his hand.
Jack is at the piano.
FRANK
Good morning, Miss...?
YOUNG WOMAN
Moran.
Monica Moran.
FRANK
All right, Miss Moran
MONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)
Actually, that's my stage name.
FRANK
I'm sorry?
MONICA
Moran.
Monica.
The whole thing.
It's my stage name.
My real name's Blanche.
FRANK
Blanche.
MONICA
No romance, right?
That's why I came up with
Monica. It's what I prefer.
FRANK
Well, that's fine --
MONICA
But if you call my house and my mother answers,
ask for Blanche.
If you ask for Monica, she'll
think you have the wrong number and hang up.
FRANK
Right.
MONICA
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her.
She's opposed to my career.
FRANK
Uh-huh.
Well, Miss Moran, what
is it you'd like to do for us?
MONICA
Candy Man.'
(worried)
Is that all right?
FRANK
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Monica turns and, seeing Jack at the piano,
gives a little start.
MONICA
Oops.
I almost forgot you were
there.
Here's the music.
Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.
FRANK
Uh... he knows it.
MONICA
Really?
Isn't that a coincidence.
JACK
Small world.
Monica smiles.
She likes Jack.
FRANK
Well, shall we?
Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway,
laconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica
swings her arms and taps her foot. Despite all this,
Monica still manages to come in between beats and Jack
has to scramble over a chord to catch her,
sort of like a fireman with a net.
MONICA
Who can take a sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew
Toss it in the air and
Make a groovy lemon pie
The Candy Man can
The Candy Man can...,
There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the
mother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her
daughter's career.
FRANK
Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.
Monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up.
Frank looks over at Jack.
Jack shrugs and continues to play.
FRANK
(continuing)
Miss Moran ... Miss Moran ...
Blanche!
Monica's eyes pop open.
MONICA
Oh, sorry.
I get so caught up in
it sometimes.
It's scary.
FRANK
Yes, it is.
MONICA
Well ... thanks.
(to Jack)
Bye.
JACK
Drive carefully.
As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another
and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring
singers who can't sing.
As Frank sinks lower in his
chair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded
cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes,
and colors, come forth to offer their own unique
interpretations of "Feelings," "I Gotta Be Me,"
"This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately,
"What Kind of Fool Am I."
Finally, when it is all over,
Jack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room,
looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.
TALL YOUNG WOMAN
As the sequence ends, a TALL YOUNG WOMAN in high heels
walks into Willie's.
She glances around,
then spots Willie across the room,
eating a corn beef on rye.
WOMAN
Hey.
You one of the fabulous
Baker Boys?
JACK AND FRANK
are putting on their coats, preparing to leave.
Frank is staring at his notepad.
FRANK
Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven.
JACK
What?
FRANK
Thirty-seven girls.
And not one who can carry a tune.
That must be statistically impossible.
JACK
It was a somewhat extraordinary
day.
FRANK
I just don't understand.
You
would think someone ... anyone ...
WOMAN (O.S.)
Damn!
The Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway,
holding a shoe in her hand.
It's broken.
WOMAN
(continuing)
Brand new Thursday.
You believe
it?
After today, Jack and Frank are prepared
to believe anything.
WOMAN
(continuing)
This where the auditions are?
FRANK
This is where the auditions were.
WOMAN
What do you mean?
FRANK
We're finished.
WOMAN
What about me?
Frank looks at his watch.
FRANK
You're an hour and a half late.
WOMAN
My watch is broken, too.
FRANK
Punctuality.
First rule of show
business.
The Woman looks around her.
WOMAN
This is show business?
FRANK
(in no mood)
Look, miss.
We're tired,
you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
WOMAN
(touching her lip)
Just like that, huh?
You're not
even gonna give me a chance?
FRANK
Don't take it personally.
WOMAN
How should I take it?
FRANK
Impersonally.
Frank begins to leave.
WOMAN
I don't believe it.
I come all the way down down
here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me
a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a
few minutes late.
FRANK
You're an hour and a half late.
WOMAN
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
FRANK
We ran long.
WOMAN
So run a little longer.
FRANK
Miss --
WOMAN
You find a girl?
Jack and Frank glance at each other.
JACK
No.
WOMAN
So. I'm here, you're here, the
piano's here.
What d'ya say?
Before Frank can answer, Jack walks over to the piano.
FRANK
Terrific.
Thirty-eight.
WOMAN
What's that mean?
Thirty-eight.
JACK
Don't worry about it.
WOMAN
(to Frank)
You know, I'm feeling a lot of
hostility from you.
FRANK
(appealing)
Jack.
JACK
Let's get it over with.
FRANK
All right.
What's your name?
WOMAN
Susie.
Susie Diamond.
FRANK
Catchy.
You have any previous entertainment
experience, Miss Diamond?
SUSIE (WOMAN)
Well ... for the last four years
I've been on call to Triple A
Escort service.
Jack and Frank exchange a glance.
SUSIE
(continuing)
Hey, it's legit.
Strictly dinner
and dance.
FRANK
Okay.
I think that's all we
need to know.
SUSIE
I sing now?
FRANK
That's the premise.
Susie gives Frank a dark look, then turns to Jack.
SUSIE
I Get Along Without You.' Slowly,
okay?
Jack nods and begins to play.
Frank slouches down in his chair,
preparing to be tortured again.
SUSIE
(continuing; singing)
I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being
Sheltered in your arms
Of course I do
But I get along without you very well.'
Susie stops.
Frank just sits there.
Jack just sits there.
She can sing.
SUSIE
(continuing)
So?
FRANK
(blinking)
Uh ... we'll let you know.
Jack looks over at Frank like he's insane.
SUSIE
When?
FRANK
When we know.
SUSIE
(smiling)
Don't leave a girl hanging.
Second rule of show business.
Frank's not amused.
SUSIE
(continuing)
Yeah, well, okay.
'Bye, Bakers.
Susie walks out barefoot.
JACK
What are you, crazy?
FRANK
I just thought we should talk
about it.
Between ourselves.
JACK
What's there to talk about?
She can sing.
That puts her at the head of the class.
That makes her the only one in the class.
FRANK
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip,
for Christ sake.
I don't think she's right for the act.
JACK
(studying him)
You're getting cold feet about
this.
FRANK
I was just thinking what Ma would
think.
JACK
Ma? Ma?
Was Ma there the last time we played the
Ambassador?
Oh, that's right, she was on bass.
How could I forget.
Frank frowns and looks down at his hands.
JACK
(continuing)
How many other silent partners are there, Frank?
Donna?
Little Cindy?
Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
FRANK
Okay, okay.
I'll call the girl.
Frank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad.
JACK
What's the matter?
FRANK
I didn't get her number.
STREET
Jack and Frank dash out of Willie's and glance up
and down the street.
Nothing.
FRANK
We can always look her up in the
book.
JACK.
Right.
Susie Diamond.
She's probably listed right
next to Monica Moran.
Jack shakes his head in disgust.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Does this mean I get the job?
ANOTHER ANGLE
Jack and Frank whirl around.
There, standing in the doorway, is Susie.
SUSIE
Intuition.
CITY SKYLINE
Gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day.
Once again, "JINGLE BELLS" is heard,
only this time carried a little further:
"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..."
JACK, FRANK AND SUSIE
Ensconsed in the back room of Willie's, preparing
for their first rehearsal ...
FRANK
Ready?
Jack nods.
FRANK
(continuing)
Ready?
Susie nods.
Frank poises his hands over the piano,
hesitates, then looks at Jack again.
FRANK
(continuing)
Ready?
Jack squints at Frank, then nods.
Frank turns to Susie.
FRANK
(continuing)
Ready?
SUSIE
(looking around)
What are we, an orchestra all of
a sudden?
Frank g1ares at her.
SUSIE
(continuing)
Sorry.
Frank poises his hands over the piano again and
begins to play the opening passage of
"Just the Way You Are." A moment later, Jack joins in,
and a moment after that, Susie.
Unfortunately,
Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone,
are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a
fifth grade recital.
After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand.
SUSIE
Fellas, fellas ...
Jack and Frank stop.
FRANK
What's the problem?
SUSIE
The problem is I can't hear myself
sing with all this...
(searching)
... music.
You know what I'm saying?
Jack and Frank look at one another.
SUSIE
(continuing)
I mean, back there it may be hard to notice,
but up here I'm having a little trouble
getting a word in.
Jack and Frank just stare.
SUSIE
(continuing)
I mean, you're supposed to be
backing me up, right?
FRANK
(icily)
No. We are not supposed to be
backing you up.
SUSIE
What I mean is --
FRANK
We're a team.
We work together.
SUSIE
So work with me, not against me.
Okay?
Frank stares at Susie for a long moment.
FRANK
I suppose we can bring it down a
little.
JACK
I'll drop the eighths.
FRANK
Okay?
Susie looks at the two brothers.
SUSIE
Okay.
WILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER
Frank is on Willie's telephone.
In the front of the store, just out of earshot,
Jack sits at a beat-up grand,
while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another.
FRANK
I'm telling you, Ray.
She's got
a voice like an angel ... What?
Frank glances furtively across the room to where Susie,
making a very sexy silhouette against the front window,
is running her hand over a pearl-white piano.
FRANK
(continuing)
No, I wouldn't say she's got a
body like an angel.
As Frank continues to talk in the background,
Susie looks over at Jack.
SUSIE
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
JACK
He'll come around.
Susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano.
JACK
(continuing)
You never sang before?
SUSIE
Not for money. With my mother.
Jack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand.
SUSIE
(continuing)
She used to waitress downtown, nights,
when I was a kid.
On the way home, we'd sing.
You know how people whistle when they're nervous?
My mother sang.
She always said you're never alone
with a song 'cause thousands of people know the
same song and even though you can't hear 'em,
they're singing with you.
I don't know.
If they were, they were all singing safe inside
their apartments.
(shrugging)
But it worked.
We always got home.
Ever since,
I always wanted to sing.
I never took lessons or anything, though.
I guess you guys took a lot of lessons.
Jack looks down at the piano in front of him.
JACK
Yeah.
We took a lot of lessons.
JACK AND NINA
Jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets
ready for the night's gig.
Nina, standing next to him
at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar
of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds.
NINA
You shave like an old movie, Jack.
As Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins
to soap her face in the mirror.
JACK
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that
he kept at the barber shop.
Then, whenever he
wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop
and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
NINA
Is that what you used to do?
JACK
My days are not the old days,
genius.
NINA
What are they?
JACK
The recent past.
NINA
Oh.
(nodding to the ceiling)
Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
JACK
How do you know?
NINA
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
JACK
Oh?
NINA
I guess it's getting serious.
JACK
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry
him.
NINA
I hope not.
He's already busted the springs
in two chairs.
Hey, what's this?
Nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.
JACK
Ivory.
NINA
Looks old.
JACK
Older than me.
NINA
Wow.
Jack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face.
Nina picks up the razor.
JACK
Hey, what do you want to do?
Grow
a beard?
NINA
Why not?
JACK
Well, let's get your first prom
under the belt, okay?
NINA
What's a prom?
JACK
Ever go to church?
Nina nods.
JACK
It's like that.
Only you gotta
dance.
HOTEL
The new trio, fresh off their first gig,
come out of the service entrance into the night.
FRANK
Fucking.
She says fucking in
front of an entire room of people.
SUSIE
I said I was sorry.
FRANK
(to Jack)
Did you hear it?
JACK
Fucking.
SUSIE
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais
by the time I got out there anyway.
FRANK
(directly to her)
Fucking.
SUSIE
For Christ sake, I said it, I
didn't do it.
(pulling out some bills)
Besides, I don't think they were
too offended, do you?
FRANK
(grabbing the bills)
Give me that.
SUSIE
Hey!
FRANK
We are not a saloon act.
We do
not take tips from dirty old men.
SUSIE
(innocent)
I was gonna split it with you guys.
FRANK
We do not take tips.
I'll apply
this to the cost of the dress.
Frank puts the money in his pocket.
Susie stares at
him, steaming.
SUSIE
Then I want my name on the poster.
And my picture!
(taking off her shoes)
And these shoes are too goddamn tight!
Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot.
Jack is leaning against the wall,
watching it all with amusement.
JACK
Nice girl.
ON Frank's expression we hear the OPENING NOTES of
"New York, New York" and we see:
SERIES OF SHOTS
Susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after
another, playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences,
no empty tables now.
As the SONG ends, we CLOSE ON the cardboard stand-up,
newly done over with a picture of Susie and an
accompanying exclamation: "See the Sensational Susie
Diamond!" As the FINAL CHORD sounds we --
CUT TO:
CITY
Gray and cold.
The streets swept with rain.
And once again the tentative piano:
"JINGLE BELLS, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride ...
Oh what fun it is to ride ... Oh what fun..."
STREET
Jack steps out onto the rainy street alone.
He glances back at the vet's with second thought,
then moves slowly off.
DINER
Jack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their
collars up against the chill.
Frank pulls on a pair of gloves.
FRANK
Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year.
Where're your gloves?
Jack shrugs.
FRANK
(continuing)
Better take care of your fingers, little brother.
Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't
be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
JACK
I'll take my chances.
Frank pats his hands together and glances into the street.
FRANK
Something, huh?
All those bids.
JACK
Yeah.
Something.
FRANK
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
JACK
You wanna get a drink?
Frank stops, surprised.
FRANK
No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been
up two nights making sure the rest of us
don't get it.
Jack nods.
FRANK
(continuing)
You all right?
JACK
Yeah, fine.
FRANK
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
JACK
Right.
As Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother,
then disappears around the corner.
A second later,
Susie comes out of the diner.
SUSIE
Where's egghead?
JACK
His kid's sick.
SUSIE
(searching her purse)
I don't know.
It's hard figuring you two
as brothers.
Seems like the hospital might've
scrambled the babies somewhere.
JACK
He takes after our mother.
SUSIE
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be
one crazy dame.
Shit.
Jack offers his pack of cigarettes.
SUSIE
Uh-uh.
I never touch American
cigarettes.
(still searching)
What's tomorrow again?
JACK
The Stratford.
SUSIE
Nice place.
Fulla velvet.
Even
the bedspreads.
(shaking the purse)
Damn!
Two-fifty a pack and I go
through 'em like toothpicks.
Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece,
you believe that?
JACK
Huh?
SUSIE
Paris Opals.
Twelve-and-a-half cents.
I sat
down with a pencil and added it one day.
But
I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something
in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.
(finding one)
Ah, here's a lost soul.
Jack lights it.
She takes a draw.
SUSIE
(continuing)
Mmm.
Like kissing a rose.
Well,
au revoir.
JACK
Hey.
(as she stops)
You feel like a cup of coffee?
SUSIE
You kidding?
We must've killed three pots in
there.
Anyway, I gotta get home.
Rest the pipes.
JACK
You want me to walk you?
Susie looks at Jack a little funny.
SUSIE
No. Thanks.
She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
SUSIE
(continuing)
Hey, listen.
You're not going soft on me, are
you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me
and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like
I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
JACK
Forget it.
SUSIE
I mean, that'd be too creepy.
With us working together and all.
JACK
Forget it.
SUSIE
Nothing personal --
Jack holds up his hand.
Susie just stands there.
JACK
Better hurry.
You're a nickel
down on your cigarette.
VETERINARY CLINIC
Jack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his
arms against the night's chill.
He glances up at the
flickering sign over the building: "Twenty-Four Hour
Emergency Care." Inside, a KID with deep-set eyes is
bent over a magazine.
Jack hesitates then enters.
VETERINARY CLINIC
Outside, he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle.
(sporting his new sweater)
make their way across an empty cemetery.
Nina is swinging a bottle of whiskey.
NINA
(looking around)
There were more flowers last year.
Mr. Rinaldi
down at the drugstore says it's going to snow
by New Year's.
Says he can feel it in his elbows.
I hope it snows.
I want to make a snowman.
You ever make a snowman, Jack?
JACK
Sure.
NINA
That's what I want to do.
I want to make a snowman.
As they come to a plot of ground, they stop.
There are two matching headstones, one for Jack's father,
fully engraved, and another for Jack's mother, bearing
only her name.
Jack studies the plot a moment, then
crouches before his father's marker: "ANDREW S. BAKER.
Adoring Husband of Eleanor, Loving Father of Franklin
and John." Jack brushes some dirt from the face of the
stone, then stands.
NINA
(continuing)
Now?
Jack nods.
Nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours
it onto the dead man's grave.
NINA
(continuing)
Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker.
They stand another moment, just looking, then turn away.
As they begin to walk, Jack sees Eddie in his new
sweater sniffing at a gravestone.
JACK
Hey, Eddie.
Have some respect,
will ya?
BUILDING
Jack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building.
A moment later, Frank pulls the car up to the curb and
Jack gets in.
Susie is sitting up front.
HOTEL
The hotel, done in a sort of King Arthur motif,is
built right on the ocean.
Frank guides the car down
a simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out.
FRANK
Will you listen to that ocean?
It's LOUD.
Frank takes a deep breath.
FRANK
(continuing)
And how about this air? I'm telling you,
a few days in this place'll put five years
on your life.
SUSIE
Smells like fish.
FRANK
Of course it smells like fish.
We're on the ocean.
What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
SUSIE
(to herself)
Smells like tuna number two to me.
FRANK
It's paradise.
That's what it is.
Paradise.
As Susie and Jack follow Frank up the drive, Jack
notices the beat-up Eldorado in the parking lot,
its toilet paper streamers blowing
gently in the ocean breeze.
HOTEL - DAY
Jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the
hotel, watching the waves tumble into one another.
As he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices
Florence Simmons standing a few yards away
with a camera.
FLORENCE SIMMONS
I just know my sister won't believe
me. Do you mind?
Jack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the
camera.
FLORENCE SIMMONS
I really hate to impose.
It's just that the
resemblance is so extraordinary.
(focusing)
I wonder if you could turn this way so your face
isn't in the shadows.
As Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying
shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other
end of the walkway.
They are leaning into the wind,
her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.
FLORENCE SIMMONS
Say cheese.
The camera clicks.
FLORENCE SIMMONS
(continuing)
Gotcha.
Would you like a copy for
yourself?
The hotel develops.
Jack glances away from Susie and the man.
JACK
No.
ON Jack's expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment
later we --
CUT TO:
HOTEL - DAY
The next morning.
Jack is sitting outside the hotel,
watching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado.
The streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal
to the car's exterior.
After a moment, Frank exits with
a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a
tiny souvenir shot glass.
FRANK
Want one?
Jack shakes his head.
FRANK
(continuing)
Ah well, the kids'll break a
couple anyway.
Suddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the
newlyweds are heard.
BUD
Give me the keys.
HELEN
You're not going to drive.
BUD
Give me the keys!
HELEN
You're not going to drive!
BUD
It's my goddamn car!
HELEN
It's our goddamn car!
BUD
Give me the keys.
HELEN
No.
Bud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but
she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car.
Frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a
madman, trying to catch her.
Finally, when he gets
close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot.
FRANK
I think I'll warm up the car.
OVERVIEW - CITY
Cold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite
appealing after a week in paradise.
HOTEL
A few minutes later.
Jack comes out of the hotel and
sees Susie pacing.
He sits down and watches her for a moment.
JACK
You're gonna wear down those
heels if you don't give it a rest.
She stops.
JACK
(continuing)
Relax.
We'll drop the song.
SUSIE
Guess I got a little scattered.
JACK
It's a shitty
song.
Susie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel.
SUSIE
How do you do it? Every night?
JACK
Practice.
(pause)
There are worse songs, you know.
Not many, but a few.
Susie nods.
Jack studies her.
Something's on her
mind.
SUSIE
Listen...
(looks into his eyes)
Nothing.
BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Susie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally
glancing up at Jack's apartment, where the MUSIC can be
heard FAINTLY.
After a moment, she drops her cigarette
on the sidewalk.
There are half a dozen others
already there.
BUILDING
As Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing,
surprised.
Jack, wearing the same look of concentration
he had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the
other end of the street.
Susie starts to call after
him, but stops.
JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
The sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky.
We see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club.
CLUB - NIGHT
Later.
Jack comes out of the club and into the night,
lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street.
SUSIE (O.S.)
You were good.
Jack stops.
Susie.
JACK
I can keep the beat.
SUSIE
Better than that.
Jack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing,
beginning to walk again.
SUSIE
What's the matter?
JACK
Nothing.
SUSIE
What'd I say?
JACK
Nothing.
SUSIE
You're upset.
JACK
I'm not upset.
SUSIE
All I said was you were good.
JACK
(stops)
Look. You don't know good. All right?
SUSIE
What's that supposed to mean?
JACK
It means you wouldn't know good
if it came up and fucked you.
SUSIE
You were good.
JACK
Let's make a deal.
You shut up.
SUSIE
You were good.
JACK
(exasperated)
How do you know?
SUSIE
(yelling)
Because I saw the other people!
And they knew you were good!
You were good, goddamnit!
Jack studies Susie, then glances off.
For a moment,
they just stand on the corner, not talking.
SUSIE
(continuing)
So you wanna get a drink?
JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
We see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater,
sleeping on the fire escape.
WILLIE'S - LATER
Frank is looking at a list.
FRANK
We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a
couple of weeks.
Larry Shelton said he'd let me
know by Friday on the Ambassador.
That's it.
Frank folds the paper carefully.
FRANK
(continuing)
I got some calls out.
Things
that might be good for us.
Frank looks over at Jack for the first time.
He's
leaning against the building, staring at his shoes.
FRANK
(continuing)
We'll try for a girl again next
week.
Jack nods.
FRANK
(continuing)
Okay.
Well, the Roosevelt then.
STREET
Jack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops.
Across the street, talking to a man, is Susie.
She says
a few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the
arm and begins to walk away.
Jack watches her retreat,
then follows, moving quicker as he draws close.
As he
reaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns.
Not Susie.
The woman stares at Jack, startled.
For a moment, he doesn't move.
Finally, he lets go of
her elbow.
JACK
Sorry.
STREET
Jack walks down the street, mindless of the rain.
Frank follows a few yards behind.
FRANK
Jack.
We just,passed the car. Jack.
This is a
tuxedo.
Three hundred dollars.
(pause)
You gonna talk to me?
Or is this Jack's famous
silent act?
Look, it was for publicity.
Do you understand?
Publicity.
Jack stops and stares at Frank incredulously.
JACK
What-are you?
A fucking moron?
It's three o'clock in the morning,
Frank.
Who's watching?
Your wife?
Maybe you can get us a gig playing
Little Frank's birthday party.
What do you think?
FRANK
Look.
I didn't know when we were going to be on
until yesterday.
What was I supposed to do?
I had the pianos anyway.
JACK
Basketballs, Frank.
You had us
playing for basketballs.
FRANK
I'm sorry.
I should've checked it out.
I screwed
up.
But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle
of a gig.
JACK
(incredulous)
What?
FRANK
It wasn't professional, Jack.
It was a stunt.
A stupid-ass stunt.
Jack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.
JACK
What's happening to you, Frank?
You been kissing
ass so long you're starting to like it?
You let
that guy turn us into clowns tonight.
We were
always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.
What's happened to your dignity?
FRANK
Dignity?
Who the hell are you to
talk about dignity?
Frank suddenly steps forward and reaches into Jack's
jacket, coming away with a bottle.
FRANK
(continuing)
This where you get your dignity, Jack?
This is where you get your courage?
Jack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away.
FRANK
(continuing)
No, let's do it straight for
once, shall we?
Frank tosses the BOTTLE into the street, where it
SHATTERS.
FRANK
(continuing)
Let me explain something to you, little brother.
See, I've got people who depend on me.
I've got
a wife and two children who expect to wake up every
morning with food on the table and heat in the house.
I got a mortgage.
I got car payments.
I got Ma's
medical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.
Yeah, you.
Jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so
fucking sure he's better than everyone else.
Don't
you think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes
and blow smoke in his face?
Goddamn right I would.
But I can't.
Because I have to be responsible, little
brother.
I have to make sure the numbers balance out
in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go
on living their lives.
You don't win medals for it,
but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I
folded up shop.
So don't talk to me about dignity,
little brother.
You're drawing on a weak hand.
Jack stares at Frank through the rain,
then turns and begins to walk away.
FRANK
(continuing)
Great.
Terrific.
Walk away.
You're good at that,
Jack.
Just don't forget to stop off for another
bottle of courage on your way home.
(pause)
That's what he'd do.
Jack stops, his back to Frank.
FRANK
(continuing)
You've found the perfect solution to all the
pain in the world, haven't you, little brother?
Eight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or
night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.
You're weak, Jack.
Just like he was.
Jack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.
JACK
Stay off it.
FRANK
No, let's stay on it.
I'm sick and tired of
watching you make him up into some kinda god.
For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid
bullshit jig.
He left a wife and two sons.
He
wasn't a hero.
He was a fool.
JACK
(eerily cold)
You weren't there.
FRANK
That's right.
I wasn't there.
I don't have the
luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
JACK
(coiled)
Fuck you.
FRANK
No, fuck you.
And fuck him too.
Fuck the both-of you.
Jack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs Frank by the
lapels.
FRANK
(continuing)
Hey, what're you doing?
Hey!
Jack flings Frank against the wall, pounding, pulling
and slamming him in a fitful rage.
FRANK
(continuing; scared)
Jack! ... Jack! ...
Frank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect
himself.
Jack hovers over him.
JACK
How's it feel to have your little brother beat
the shit out of you?
Huh?
Huh!
Jack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face.
Frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself,
and catches a blow on his fingers.
FRANK
My hands!
My hands!
Jack grabs one of Frank's hands.
JACK
(mocking)
Your hands.
Your hands couldn't take the blue
ribbon on amateur night.
Jack bends back Frank's fingers.
FRANK
(terrified)
Jack!
JACK
Who's weak now, big brother?
Jack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.
FRANK
Jack!
JACK!
Frank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain.
Suddenly Jack stops.
Looking at Frank's hand, still
clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior
as Frank.
Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks
at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped
and dirty.
He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split
and bleeding.
He no longer looks dangerous.
He looks
hollow, frightened.
JACK
I'm through with it.
I can't do
it anymore.
Frank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack
just turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and
disappears into the rain.
MUSIC begins.
A sad, plaintive
solo piano.
And we see:
SERIES OF SHOTS
Jack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain
over now.
Frank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the
dim glow of the streetlights.
Jack, letting himself into his apartment and standing
there.
Alone.
Frank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off
the engine.
Jack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly.
Frank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as
the sun begins to come up.
Jack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.
STREET
Jack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner
where Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed.
MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:
STREET
Jack moves aimlessly down the street, slipping in
and out of shadows.
Finally he stops inside a closed
storefront, his back up against the window, and looks
down at his hands.
They're shaking.
STREET
Jack is standing across the street from his mother's
house, just looking.
After a moment, he crosses the
street.
As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of
the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it,
kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --
cat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the
damage smoothed and widened by time.
He runs his
fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks
toward the house.
HOUSE
Through the screen door, Jack can hear a CLICKING
sound and see partially into the front door.
Half
the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light.
He opens the door and enters.
