    A small town American HOME on a small town American street.  

  We DRIFT UP towards a warm, lighted yellow WINDOW, on the 
    second floor.  As we float closer, we spy inside... a WOMAN.  
    Standing beside a crib.  She holds a TODDLER.  

    When, suddenly... the window GLASS SHIMMERS.  RIPPLES, as if 
  it were liquid.  Just for a moment.  Blink and you miss it.


  An angry BLAZE.  Firetrucks.  In a few hours, when they 
    finally extinguish the flames, there won t be much left.

    Jack.  Across the street.  Holding, comforting his two sons.

    TIGHTER.  Jack.  Watching the house burn.  Fire illuminating 
  his expression, reflecting in his eyes. 

  His jaw sets in pain and FURY--

                                                                        BLACKOUT.

                                      ACT ONE

    OVER BLACK--

    STANFORD UNIVERSITY.  PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA.  PRESENT DAY.


    A BLOODY CORPSE walks, casual, across the quad.  

  It takes a drag off a Marlboro.  And shakes its head at-- SAM 
    HARRISON, 23, clad in a gray T-shirt and jeans.  Sam walks 
    beside his girlfriend JESSICA, dressed as a sexy nurse.    

                                LUIS
                        (the zombie)
                  ...I gotta tell you, Sam, if your 
                  sorry ass was trick or treating my 
                  house, there d be no popcorn balls 
                  for you.

                                SAM
                        (gross)
                  You gave out popcorn balls?  

                                LUIS
                  Don t change the subject.  You 
                  could ve at least gone as the 
                  slutty version of something.  
                  Slutty Dorothy, slutty Alice, 
                  slutty nurse--

                                JESSICA
                  Hey!

                                LUIS
                  I didn t mean you.  

                                SAM
                  Sorry, man, what can I say?  Just 
                  never been a big fan of the whole 
                  thing.

                                LUIS
                  What are you, a communist?  Who 
                  doesn t like Halloween?        

  Sam doesn t respond... but something flits across his 
    expression, that the others don t notice.


  In Sam s lighted, ground floor BEDROOM WINDOW.  Jessica peeks 
  out from behind curtains.  Curious and concerned.  But then 
  she recedes back-- she doesn t want to pry...

  Sam and Dean walk to Dean s curb-parked car.  A 1965 CHEVY 
    IMPALA.  Black, dented, a Rottweiler of a muscle car.                                                                                    12.


    Kansas plates.  Dean pops the trunk, and we catch a glimpse 
    inside-- like Sam s suitcase, only much more so.  Shotguns.  
    Crucifixes.  Chainsaws.  God knows what else.  

    Dean roots around, before coming up with a faded LEATHER 
    JOURNAL.  Sam s both surprised and displeased to see it.

                                SAM
                  He left the book behind?

    Dean nods, grim.  We can tell-- this is a bad sign.  

                                SAM
                  So tell me everything. 


    CLOSE ON THE JOURNAL.  The book is jammed with dense writing, 
    yellowed obituaries.  We see the FINAL entry-- a taped 
    newspaper article, from the SANGER HERALD: 

    CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY: 4th DRIVER DISAPPEARANCE

                                DEAN
                  ...it s this stretch of two-lane 
                  blacktop, just outside Sanger, 
                  California... few hours from here, 
                  actually.  Anyway, these drivers.  
                  They just vanish.  No bodies, no 
                  cars, nothing.  It s like 
                  Interstate Bermuda Triangle.  

  Sam reads from the journal.  As the two brothers walk through 
    Stanford s main quad.  Dark.  Empty.  Atmospheric stone 
    arches, ornate libraries.  

                                DEAN
                  Dad went to check it out last 
                  Monday, haven t heard from him 
                  since. 

                                SAM
                  Why didn t you go with him?  

                                DEAN
                  I was working my own trip.  This 
                  voodoo thing, in New Orleans.

                                SAM
                  Dad let you go on a hunting trip by 
                  yourself?

                                DEAN
                  I am 26, dude.                                                                                  13.



                                SAM
                  Not emotionally.  
                        (anyway--)
                  It s only been a week.  Maybe he s 
                  on radio silence.  

                                DEAN
                  You know him.  Not for this long. 

                                SAM
                  So.  What s your plan?

                                DEAN
                        (taken aback)
                  Our plan is that we shag ass to 
                  Sanger, California and find Dad.

    Sam s emotions bubble and roil beneath the surface.  But for 
    now, he keeps them to himself.

                                SAM
                  Look, whatever s going on here, Dad 
                  can handle it.  He eats this kind 
                  of thing with his Wheaties.  

                                DEAN
                  Um.  What don t you understand?  We 
                  have to find him. You have to help. 

                                SAM
                  ...why do you need my help?   

                                DEAN
                  He s your father.  You re his son.  
                  What more do you need?  We re 
                  supposed to be family here-- 

                                SAM
                  News to me--

                                DEAN
                  No way you re bringing that up now.

                                SAM
                  He tossed me out on my ass.  And 
                  you practically locked the door 
                  behind me--

                                DEAN
                  I seem to remember a few choice 
                  phrases coming out of your mouth 
                  that night--                                                                                  14.



                                SAM
                  --and I haven t heard word one from 
                  you guys in, what, a year?  That 
                  sound like family to you?   

    Dean lays his cards out.  

                                DEAN
                  You know.  You re even more of a 
                  selfish, stuck-up, hair-gelled punk 
                  than I remember. 

                                SAM
                  Oh.  Am I?  

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.  I mean, I know things have 
                  been rocky lately, but still... 
                  he s Dad.  And after everything 
                  he s done for you...

                                SAM
                  Everything he s done for me?!

                                DEAN
                  Yes--

                                SAM
                  All he s done for me, us, is set 
                  the land speed record for f d up 
                  childhoods!  

                                DEAN
                  Don t be overdramatic--

                                SAM
                  Dean.  When I told him I was scared 
                  of the thing in my closet, he gave 
                  me a .45!

                                DEAN
                  Well, what was he supposed to do?

                                SAM
                  He was supposed to say-- ghost 
                  stories are just stories!  He was 
                  supposed to say-- don t be afraid 
                  of the dark!

                                DEAN
                  But... you should be.  You know 
                  what s out there in the dark.  You 
                  should be friggin  terrified.                                                                                  15.



                                SAM
                  I know.  But still...

                                DEAN
                  Sammy, should I be prepping for a 
                  point here anytime soon?  

                                SAM
                  The point is... I never asked for 
                  it.  The occult homework.  And 
                  melting the silver into bullets.  
                  And the family roadtrips-- hunting 
                  down all those freaky-ass things.  
                  I never wanted any of it...   

                                DEAN
                  You can t pick your family. 

                                SAM
                  No, but I can live my own life.  
                  And all our gory dysfunction-- I 
                  buried it, man, I swore I was done 
                  with it.  For good. 

                                DEAN
                  You know as well as I do.  Nothing 
                  stays buried.  

    Beat.  Sam wills himself to believe--

                                SAM 
                  Look.  Dad ll be okay.  He ll be 
                  home in a few days.  You ll see.

                                DEAN
                  He s in real trouble, if he s not 
                  dead already.  I can feel it, and I 
                  know you can too.  
                        (then)
                  So the only question is: you coming 
                  with me or not?  

  OFF Sam, torn and conflicted--


  An isolated farm house.  A solitary beacon of light in a sea 
  of darkness.                                                                                   17.



    SUPER:  SANGER, CALIFORNIA.  

    Someone is having an illicit, parents-out-of-town, Halloween 
    kegger.  Various cars parked at every angle, various costumed 
    HIGH SCHOOL KIDS loitering outside.

    TROY SQUIRE, 18, shy, bespectacled, dressed as Harry Potter.  
  He waves goodbye to his friends, climbs into his hand-me-down 
    Toyota.  Rumbles off into the night.


  The Toyota WHIZZES past a road sign.  CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY.


  The girl s thin, white cotton dress FLUTTERS in the gusting 
    breeze.  She waits beside a MILE MARKER POST-- MILE 33.  

    Troy stops.  Opens the passenger door.  We TRAIL the girl as 
  she approaches.

                                TROY
                  Car trouble or something?


    Troy s Toyota pulls off the road, onto a dirt driveway.


                                TROY
                  That was good.  But joke s over, 
                  okay?  

    Then Troy squints.  Noticing something.  Through the front 
    doorway (lacking a door), Troy glimpses-- a corner of 
    Constance s fluttering dress.  Then it s gone.                                                                                  19.



                                TROY
                  Come on.  I can see you in there.

  No response.  Troy SIGHS, frustrated.  Steps toward the 
    house.  Moving closer.  Closer.  

                                TROY
                  You want me to leave you?

  He steps onto the porch.  No sound but the groaning wood, the 
    whispering wind.  Finally, he enters the house, revealing...


    Troy punches the gas.  The car tears onto the road.  


    BLUR of RUSHING ASPHALT, as we ROCKET down the Interstate.

  CUE MUSIC.  And you can take your anemic alternative pop and 
    shove it up your ass.  We re playing Dean s music-- 
    adrenaline pumping METAL-- and we re playing it loud.

  The Impala.  Pouncing down the I-5 like a panther.  The 
    engine THUNDERS.  The exhaust belches oily, black smoke.  
    Defiantly un-P.C.  


  The muscle car accelerates, ROARING off into the rising sun.


    A SIGN:  Welcome to Sanger, California, U.S.A.  America s 
    Christmas Tree City.   But below, taped to the SIGNPOST-- 
    MISSING POSTERS.  Four different faces stare out from 
    oblivion.  Haunting.  

  The Impala motors down Main Street.  Past red-brick 
    storefronts (many of them closed, or boarded up).  A white 
    church.  And everywhere-- MISSING POSTERS.  There s a vaguely 
    ominous, almost otherworldly feeling here.  A pall has fallen 
    over this small town like a shroud.  


    A small, modest brick structure.  Currently, the lot is 
    OVERWHELMED with news trucks, REPORTERS, FBI Sedans, etc.  
  The Impala parks beside the circus.


    Home of the Fighting Cougars.  On the detachable-letter SIGN: 
  WE MISS YOU, TROY.  


    Dean stands before AMY and BILL, both 17.  They lean against 
    Bill s car, smoking.  Few FRIENDS loiter around, too.  

                                DEAN
                  Troy told us all about you.  We re 
                  his uncles. I m Dean, that s Sammy.

  Sam does a slow burn.  He hates being called Sammy.

                                AMY
                  We re so sorry.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.  Thanks.

                                SAM
                  So... we re kinda asking around, as 
                  a favor to Troy s Mom.  Was he 
                  acting... weird to you at all?

                                AMY
                  What do you mean?

                                SAM
                  I mean... at the party, before he 
                  left?  Did he say anything strange?  
                  Maybe he was nervous... scared 
                  about something?  

                                BILL
                        (irritated)
                  What, you think he was driving 
                  high?                                                                                    27.



                                DEAN
                        (stepping in)
                  No, we think the cops got their 
                  heads up their ass.  I mean, a 
                  carjacking?  Gimme a break.  But 
                  something happened out there.  So 
                  if you guys know anything at all... 

  Amy and RACHEL, 17, exchange looks.  Dean catches this--

                                DEAN
                  What?

                                BILL
                        (also spots their looks)
                  Guys.  Please.  It s just a story. 

                                DEAN
                  What story?
                        (the girls are hesitant)
                  It s okay.  We wanna know.  

                                RACHEL
                  ...there was this girl, she got 
                  murdered, hitchhiking on 
                  Centennial.  Supposedly, she s 
                  still out there, still hitchhiking.  
                  And whoever picks her up... well, 
                  they just... disappear...

    Teasing, ghostly OOHS from Bill.

                                RACHEL
                  Hey, my Aunt saw her once, okay?

                                BILL
                  Then why didn t she disappear...?  

  The students CHATTER-- some teasing, others defending the 
    story.  As Sam and Dean exchange silent looks.


    Heading back to the Impala--

                                SAM
                  I don t know.  Hitchhiking girl, 
                  pretty classic urban legend.  Gotta 
                  be a hundred different versions of 
                  that same story.                                                                                    28.



                                DEAN
                        (shrugs)
                  Stories have to spring from 
                  somewhere... sometimes they spring 
                  from the truth.  God, remember that 
                  whole Bloody Mary, mirror thing?  
                  That was supposed to be an urban 
                  legend, too...

                                SAM
                  Yeah.  I guess you re right.

                                DEAN
                  We ll at least scope out the girls  
                  story, see what shakes loose.
                        (they reach the car)
                  Hey.  So those girls-- how old do 
                  you think they were?

                                SAM
                  Not old enough.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.  You re right.

  Sam climbs into the car--

                                SAM
                  Get in the car, Dean.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.

    Dean climbs in after.


  The wind rattles the dead leaves.  


    MILE MARKER 33.  The post quivers in the stiff wind.

  The two-lane cuts between an ocean of DARK, ENDLESS CORN 
    FIELDS.  The road is abandoned-- except for the Impala.  
    Parked on the shoulder, across from the mile marker.


  We INTERCUT between the brothers.  As Dean SPRINTS, hard and 
    fast, deep into the cornfield, stalks WHIZZING past.  As Sam 
    chases, trying (and failing) to catch up.


    Until Dean slows.  Panting.  Catching his breath.  He looks 
  up, realizing-- he s alone.  Lost in the middle of a mangled, 
    foreboding maze of corn.  The stalks obscure everything; he 
    can t see more than a foot or so in front of him.

                                SAM (O.S.)
                  Dean?!

                                DEAN
                  Over here!

                                                                INTERCUT WITH:


    Sam.  Alone.  Panting.  Also realizing he s totally screwed.

                                DEAN
                  This wasn t such a hot idea.

                                SAM
                  You think?  

                                DEAN
                  Well, maybe if you could keep up--

                                SAM
                  Just keep calling out, okay?  I ll 
                  come to you.  

                                DEAN (O.S.)
                  Marco!

  Sam rolls his eyes.  Begins hacking his way through the corn.                                                                                  35.




    When... over Dean s shoulder... a white FIGURE BOLTS between 
  the corn.  Dean SPINS.  Nobody there.


                                SAM
                  Dean...?

  No answer.  Only the wind WHISTLING through the field.


    Dean.  Vigilant.  Eyes everywhere at once.  She s close; he 
  can feel it.  Where is she?  When is she going to lunge out?    


                                SAM
                  Dean?!

    When, out of the corner of Sam s eye-- Constance DARTS 
    between the stalks!  He pivots.  Nothing. 


    Dean moves, slow and cautious.  Long, languid, suspense-beat.  
    Then he turns... and suddenly spots something O.S.  Something 
    horrifying, judging by his expression.


                                DEAN (O.S.)
                        (with great alarm)
                  Sam!  Sam!

  Sam takes off like a shot.  Scrambling to his brother, with 
    urgency.  Stalks scratching his face and arms.  Sprinting.

    Until he slows... because he spots... 

    Materializing from the corn stalks... a CAR GRILL.  In fact, 
  an ENTIRE TOYOTA, sitting incongruously in the middle of the 
    field.  Troy Squire s Toyota.

  Sam steps closer.  Flinches, as he notices--

    ANGLE INSIDE TOYOTA.  We re looking out at Sam, through the 
    windshield.  There s a FIGURE slumped behind the wheel, out 
  of focus in the foreground.  But we can tell the figure is 
    mutilated.  Wet with crimson.                                                                                    36.



    SAM.  Upset.  Disturbed.  When a HAND CLUTCHES his shoulder!  
  Sam shouts, whirls-- it s Dean.  Wearing a grim visage.

                                DEAN
                  They re all here.  All the victims.  
                        (beat)
                  But not Dad.


  In a wide OVERHEAD SHOT, we see-- Sam and Dean.  

  And FIVE CARS, sitting in the cornfield.  Perfectly arranged, 
    like the spokes of a wheel--

                                                                        BLACKOUT.


                                END OF ACT TWO                                                                                  37.


                                    ACT THREE


    A garish, 50 s style NEON SIGN-- THE STAGECOACH INN.  A 
    single-story, cinderblock motel.  


    MARJORIE BRUNSON, 50 s, is a hardscrabble woman; her life 
    hasn t been easy.  She stands with Sam and Dean, as she hangs 
    BEDSHEETS on a clothesline, billowing in the stiff breeze. 

                                MARJORIE
                  ...Constance, she was shy.  Kind.  
                  But sad-- I think that s what I 
                  remember most.  Ever since the day 
                  she moved in.

                                SAM
                  I m sorry.  Moved in?

                                MARJORIE
                  Well, yes.  I adopted her.
                        (disapproving)
                                (MORE)                                                                                  40.

                                MARJORIE (CONT'D)
                  Young man, I ve had reporters 
                  around before.  Most of  em get 
                  their facts straight.  

                                DEAN
                  I apologize, ma am.  He s just a 
                  cub reporter, pretty green. 
                        (Sam shoots a dirty look)
                  So Constance was an orphan?

                                MARJORIE
                  Not at first.  Her parents, good 
                  people, they died in a car 
                  accident.  Constance was 11 at the 
                  time, poor thing. 
                        (beat)
                  ...I use her room for storage now.  
                  But I can show you boys a few 
                  things.  Come on. 

  Sam and Dean follow Marjorie into the house.  We HOLD ON the 
    backyard, on the clothesline-- as the BEDSHEET seems to take 
  on a WHIRLING FORM.  A silhouette.  Of a WOMAN.  Then, just 
  as quickly, it s gone.


  Sam and Dean walk down the sidewalk... a parade of small 
    town, all-American homes.  Moving to the Impala--

                                SAM
                  ...if all they found were blood and 
                  skull fragments, that means her 
                  corpse might still be out there--

                                DEAN
                  And if her body s not at rest,  
                  then neither is she--                                                                                    42.



                                SAM
                  So that s it.  We find the remains.  
                  Give  em a proper burial.

                                DEAN
                  Actually, I was thinking more  burn 
                   em into dust,  but yeah, we had a 
                  good groove going up until then.

                                SAM
                  So how do we find them?  

                                DEAN
                  From the one guy who knows.

                                SAM
                  Joseph Burroughs?  You want us to 
                  stroll into prison and have a 
                  little chat?   

                                DEAN
                  No.  I want you to.
                        (Sam stops)
                  What?  You re the lawyer... geek.  

                                SAM
                  Dean.  It s impossible.  

                                DEAN
                  Folsom s over 200 miles away.  We d 
                  never make it there and back before 
                  nightfall.  You gotta go, make him 
                  tell you where she s planted.  Then 
                  call me, I ll be here waiting.
                        (beat)
                  You re not scared of a tiny wittle 
                  serial killer, are you?  

                                SAM
                  No, I mean, it s impossible.  You 
                  can t walk into a prison without 72 
                  hour notice and visit anyone, much 
                  less a serial killer.  

                                DEAN
                  Fine.  I ll go.  And you can dig up 
                  the corpse.  

                                SAM
                        (stops; looks at Dean)
                  ...I ll figure something out...                                                                                  43.



                                DEAN
                  Quid pro quo, Clarice.

                                SAM
                  Shut up.  

                                DEAN
                  Come on.  You re gonna need wheels.  
                  Let s go hot-wire you some.

                                SAM
                  No.  You re not stealing me a car.  

                                DEAN
                  What do you wanna do?  Rent one?


  Sam putters up to Folsom, in a rented GEO.  Not nearly as bad-
  ass as the Impala.  


    Sam s GEO pulls up to Folsom s main gate-- a single gap 
    between formidable stone walls.  

    Sam.  Staring up at the prison.  The place is a fortress, a 
    medieval castle.  OVER the next few shots, we HEAR--

                                FOLSOM OFFICER (V.O.)
                  ...I just spoke to your Judge 
                  Carlton.  This is a hell of an 
                  exception we re making.

                                SAM (V.O.)
                  I appreciate that.                                                                                   44.




  The storm has begun.  Lightning cleaves the night sky.  And 
  the Impala s engine sounds like the THUNDER.  It charges 
    through the pouring rain.

                                BURROUGHS (V.O.)
                  ...an oak tree... she s beneath an 
                  oak tree... off Breckenridge Road.

    Dean, driving.  Focused, determined.  Passing Constance s 
    ancient HOUSE, on his way to--


    Black.  Then lightning-- which illuminates a COLOSSAL OAK 
    TREE.  The Impala, off-roading, parks beside it.  Dean leaps 
    out.  Pops the TRUNK.  From the stockpile of weaponry, Dean 
    finds a shovel and a crowbar.

    Then, using the Impala s hi-beams as worklights... Dean 
    begins to dig.


    Three holes already shoveled.  No luck, not yet.  

    INSIDE THE FOURTH PIT.  Dean digs.  Muddy.  Soaking.  

  The wind RISES-- the oak s branches begin to shudder.  

    INSIDE THE IMPALA.  The RADIO CLICKS ON.  Hissing static.

    Still, Dean digs.  One man against the howling storm.  THUNK.  
  His shovel hits dull wood.  He clears mud away, revealing... 
    a glimpse of a decomposing PINE BOX.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

    OUTSIDE THE PIT.  The SHOVEL is tossed out, onto the grass.  
    Dean s arm emerges, snagging the CROWBAR.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

    INSIDE THE PIT.  Dean s excavated the entire top half of the 
    make-shift coffin.  He begins to PRY the lid.                                                                                      49.



  The wind.  The rain.  The radio static.  They re all building 
  to a crescendo--

    Dean STRAINS.  Finally, nails SNAP.  He grips the lid.  
    Steels himself.  And opens it.  Looking inside.  HORRIFIED.

                                DEAN
                  ...no...

  The box is EMPTY.  No corpse, no bones, NOTHING--


    Sam.  Driving back to Sanger.

    CONSTANCE appears in the headlights!  Sam drives right 
    THROUGH her--  

  He GASPS, brakes hard!  Spinning, wild, on the slick roads.  
  He barely manages to control the swerving car.  Thankfully, 
  it comes to a stop.   

    Sam.  Panting.  Catching his breath.  But he doesn t notice--

    Constance.  Now sitting in Sam s back seat. 

                                CONSTANCE
                  Take me home.  

  Sam looks up, icy with fear-- 

                                                                        BLACKOUT.


                                END OF ACT THREE                                                                                  50.


                                    ACT FOUR


  And the car begins to drive, of its own accord.  Without 
    headlights.  Through the storming darkness.


    Sam s rental pulls up the muddy dirt driveway.  Stops before 
  the decrepit house.  As if on cue, the ENGINE CUTS OUT.


  And the rental car BURSTS forward.  SMASHING through the 
    termite-ridden wall of the old house.  ENTERING the house.


    A SIGN.   You Are Leaving Sanger, California, U.S.A.  
    America s Christmas Tree City.  Come Again Soon! 

  The Impala BLOWS past it.                                                                                   54.




  The I-5 FREEWAY on-ramp.  North.  Dean cruises right past.


  The Impala heads back to Stanford.


  The Impala motors past libraries.  Classrooms.  The various 
    signs and landmarks of the august university.  Sam watches 
  the familiar scenery pass.  Clouded with doubt.  Is he doing 
  the right thing?


  The Impala parks before Sam s apartment, engine idling.  Sam 
    climbs out.  Snags his bags from the back.  Then--

                                SAM
                  You ll call me if there s any news? 
                        (Dean nods, yes)
                  ...I ll see you soon, okay?

                                DEAN
                  Sure.  Okay.

  Sam heads for the apartment.  Dean, behind the wheel, watches 
  him go.  They won t see each other anytime soon, and they 
    know it.  Both want to say something.  But neither do.

  At the front door (a security entrance, which leads to the 
      college-apartment lobby).  Sam turns.  Gives one final, 
    awkward wave.  And disappears from sight.

    Dean.  Thinking.  A swirl of emotions.  But then... he shifts 
  the car into drive... begins to motor away.  He throws one 
    last look back at the apartment... and that s when he sees--

  IN SAM S DARKENED BEDROOM WINDOW.  The glass SHIMMERS.  
    RIPPLES, as if it were liquid.  Just for a moment.  Blink and 
  you miss it.

                                DEAN
                  ...Sam...


    Dean POUNDS on the lobby entrance, alarmed--

                                DEAN
                  SAM!

  He THROWS his shoulder into the door, CRACKING it open--


    Firetrucks.  Firemen extinguish the blaze.  Across the 
    street... pajama-clad APARTMENT OCCUPANTS.  Various other 
    BYSTANDERS.  And--

  Sam and Dean.  Leaning against the Impala.  Watching the 
    structure burn.  

  Sam can t return to a simple, happy life, and he knows it.  
    It s time to face up to who he is.  To assume his place in 
  the family.  No more running.  

  The brothers.  Standing together.  Fire illuminating their 
    expressions, reflecting in their eyes--

                                                                        BLACKOUT.
