questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward. BOURNE turns and
in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the
POLICEMAN.
BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN #2 with his gun and a look.

Give me your gun and radio.

Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.
BOURNE (V.O.)
So we got in the way?
Is that
why Neski died? Is that why you
killed Marie?
Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.
ABBOTT (V.O.)
You killed Marie the minute you
climbed into her car.
The
minute you entered her life she
was dead!
Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.
BOURNE (V.O.)
I told you people to leave me
alone! I fell off the grid. I
was half way around the world.
ABBOTT (V.O.)
There's no place it won't catch
up to you. It's how every story
ends. It's what you are, Jason.
A killer! You always will be.
THUMP!
CRONIN
We think that's Bourne hitting
him on the head and then--
He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun
to Abbott's head.
ABBOTT (V.O.)
Go ahead!
Go on! Do it!
BOURNE (V.O.)
She wouldn't want me to. That's
the only reason your alive.
The tape clicks off.

Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole

KRAMER
Bourne's last confirmed location
is Moscow, three days ago?
LANDY
Right.
KRAMER
So what does he do now?
LANDY
I think he's looking for
something he hasn't found.
KRAMER
Like what?
What's he after?
LANDY
I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't
gotten his memory back yet.
Not
all of it.
A look from Kramer...
KRAMER
Pam, what I need to know is, what
kind of a threat is he to us?
LANDY
If he just wanted to hurt us he
could have sent this tape to CNN.
KRAMER
Maybe he still will. Maybe he
gave it to you because he wants
to throw you in the opposite
direction of his real plan. I
don't know. I just know my
number one rule is "the only way
to stay safe is to assume the
worst."
As far as I'm concerned
Bourne is a serious threat until
proven otherwise.

Well, who talked to him? How did

We don't know, we pulled his

of him. He pages through it, finding names, places, "HOW
DID THIS ALL START?" -- and Blackbriar.
He Googles
"Sewell and Marbury"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid. BOURNE
continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid.

Vosen's sitting.
VOSEN
(to waiter)
Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy"
omelet with goat cheese and
peppers.
Landy arrives.
34
VOSEN
You're late. Traffic?
WAITER
(handing her the menu)
Ma'am?
LANDY
Nothing for me.
Vosen looks at her, surprised.
VOSEN
I'm buying.
She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat
off. She's not staying long.
VOSEN
When the Director called, it was
suggested we bring you on--
LANDY
Suggested?
(beat)
Are you sure it was just a
suggestion?
VOSEN
Funny how different things look
depending on where you sit. I
look at this as doing a favor for
you. Giving you an opportunity
to complete some unfinished
business.
LANDY
Meaning?
VOSEN
Jason Bourne.
LANDY
Bourne's finished.
VOSEN
Really?
LANDY
It was finished the moment I
realized I was chasing him for
something he didn't do.
The
case is closed.
35
VOSEN
So what do you make of this?
(handing her
surveillance photos of
Bourne in Paris)
French intel picked up Bourne
meeting Pierre Elattrache on
Tuesday. He threatened to burn
our house down if you didn't tell
him who started Treadstone.
That's a big problem, wouldn't
you agree?
LANDY
This doesn't feel like Bourne to
me.
VOSEN
Why's it so hard for you to
believe?
LANDY
Probably because it's coming from
you, Noah.
VOSEN
Lets try and be adults okay? We
all thought he was done, off the
grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe
he's a threat. We both want the
same thing here.
LANDY
So what happened at Waterloo?
VOSEN
We have a leak. Bourne showed up
in our surveillance. We had very
little time to react.
LANDY
And the reporter ended up dead?
VOSEN
Bourne saw us coming.
Landy looks at him, suspicious.
LANDY
So what was he doing?
VOSEN?
We don't know. But just the fact
that he was there means he's up
to something, don't you think?
Maybe he's the source?
36
LANDY
The real question is how you
managed to get in a fire fight in
the middle of a public train
station.
VOSEN
Don't second guess an operation
from an armchair, Pam. It's not
fair.
LANDY
I'm going to the office now.
I'll make my own introductions.
Off VOSEN...

TWO NEW TECHS plus the three we met before.
All watching
VOSEN lead LANDY and CRONIN into the room.
WILLS
This is Pamela Landy. She's
gonna be quarterbacking our
search effort. I think what we
oughta do, just to get started,
let's go around the room, say who
you are and what your spec is.
LANDY stepping in before this gets going --
LANDY
Let's do names later.

LANDY
For what?
(no takers)
You're nine hours behind the
toughest target you've ever
tracked. I want everyone to sit
down, strap in, and turn on all
you've got.

That would mean now.
That lights it.
They're moving.

TECH#1
Sir, we just hacked Ross's email
account at the Guardian and found
a round trip ticket to Turin,
yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05
departure.
LANDY
I think we can be pretty certain
that Bourne's not your source
then?
VOSEN
How?
LANDY
Ross's call to his editor, where
he said he just met the source on
Blackbriar, took place just after
his flight landed. His met his
source in Turin.
VOSEN
So?
LANDY
So, what, Bourne met Ross for
breakfast and then, at noon the
same day Bourne calls Ross to
demand a meet at Waterloo?
CRONIN
(Needling Wills)
Maybe they were even on the same
flight?
VOSEN
Cross check the secure cell phone
usage of everyone with Blackbriar
SCI clearance against all calls
in and out of Turin during the
morning Ross was there
TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards.
LANDY
The guy you're after is a CIA
operative with clearance above
Top Secret.
He was committing
treason by talking to Ross.
Do
you really think, while doing
that, he used a cell phone he
knows we can track?
TECH 3 (JIMMY)
Zero results on the cross check.
39
VOSEN stares daggers at her.
WILLS
Do you have a better idea?
LANDY
Yeah, I'd look at all the people
whose cell phones were switched
off the entire period Ross was in
Turin.
WILLS
Do it Jimmy.
TECHNICIANS start tapping.
LANDY
(looks at Cronin)
I mean if your people use their
cell phones as much as mine do,
the list should be pretty small
TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY
Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack
Boulin, Neal Daniels.
The names display on the screen:
Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin
Neal Daniels.
The HUB employees can't help but be impressed by LANDY.
WILLS and VOSEN notice their response.
LANDY
Now check everything in Ross's
apartment against those names.
Look for common patterns, look
for -
CRONIN
Initials .....Bring that up on
main.
LANDY turns.
CRONIN is leaning down in front of a
computer screen.
Point to something for the tech --- who
puts it on the big screen, blown up.
In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says "per
N.D."next to several scrawls.
LANDY
Neal Daniels.
He's Station
Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?
WILLS
Jesus Christ.
40
VOSEN
Call the RSO at the Embassy and
have them take Daniels into
custody if he's there.
If he's
not, get a grab team to the
Calle Norte safe house. Send
them in heavy and tell them we'll
assist with entry.
LANDY
"Heavy?" Daniels isn't--
VOSEN
I'm worried about Bourne. If he's
not Ross's source, then he must
be after Ross's source -- just
like us.
Off LANDY...

NICKY (V.O.)
Hello.
VOSEN
Who is this?
NICKY (V.O.)
This is Nicky Parsons. Who's
this?
Landy reacts to her voice...
Both Vosen and Landy strongly suspect Bourne is there and
listening...
Vosen reads her "Duress Challenge" identity check off the

Challenge:
"Sparrow"
Response if Under Duress:
"Ruby"
Response if Normal:
"Everest"

VOSEN
Nicky, I need to do an ID
challenge first. Code in:
"Sparrow."
Vosen looks at the screen to check her response...
NICKY
Response: "Everest".
VOSEN
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How
long have you been on site?
NICKY (V.O.)
I just walked in.
VOSEN
We have two officers on site.
Are you in contact with them?
NICKY (V.O.)
They're down. Unconscious, but
alive.
VOSEN
Is there any sign of Daniels?
NICKY (V.O.)
No.
LANDY
Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We
have reason to believe there is a
connection between Neal Daniels
and Jason Bourne.
NICKY (V.O.)
Bourne, are you still looking for
Bourne? I thought the case was
closed.
LANDY
No, some people are convinced
he's still a threat. I disagree
but to find out I need to talk to
him.
VOSEN seething because LANDY has interrupted him...
VOSEN
Hold on Nicky.
Vosen hits the mute button.
VOSEN
What are you doing? You know
Bourne's probably listening.

BOURNE pushes the phone off the desk -- fires four shots
into the ceiling -- calmly moves Nicky towards the back
door...

127H
VOSEN
You "disagree" he's a threat? He
just took out two more of my men.
Not to mention his ultimatum to
Ellatrache?
LANDY
The only way this has a happy
ending, Noah, is if we find a way
to bring Bourne in voluntarily.
VOSEN
He wants revenge, Pam. The only
realistic way to deal with this
is to eliminate the threat.
139
BACKSTAIRS

BOURNE and NICKY rapidly descend.
BOURNE
Okay, where is Daniels headed?
NICKY
8 o'clock this morning, he wired
$100,000. to a numbered bank

She looks at the photo, points.

LANDY
So grab him--

I don't have the people on the
ground to do that and I'm not
going to risk that file falling
into the wrong hands.
LANDY
What's going on?
What's Daniels
got?
53
VOSEN
What's he got? He ran all of
Blackbriar's operations in
Southern Europe and North Africa.
LANDY
I think the world's well aware we
have a rendition and lethal
action capability at this point,
Noah.
VOSEN
For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got
our entire playbook. Names,
dates, ghost sites, how we train
our assets.....
LANDY
You still don't have the
authority to kill him.
VOSEN
Oh, yes I do, Pam.
Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe.
It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."
VOSEN
That's what makes us special. No
red tape. No more getting
badguys in our sights and then
watching them escape while we
wait for some bureaucrat to issue
the order.
Landy opens up the file. Sees the words "instantaneous
lethal action is authorized when..."
LANDY
You just decide? No oversight.
No checks and balances.

RIAD/ROOFTOPS -- CONTINUOUS

BOURNE into a riad. Through a courtyard - up more stairs -

up a ladder. Out onto the rooftops. Scanning the skyline.

A beat. Has he misjudged?
*
No, there in the distance at the top of a narrow street-
*
NICKY walking slowly and behind DESH. Moving quickly.
*
BOURNE tailing him - trying to close the gap. Dipping down
*
through another riad - through an alley. Up more stairs.
*
Back up onto another roof. He's gained a few metres on

DESH.

Desh goes up to the rooftops now. Bourne has him in sight -

DESH is prepping his gun with a silencer.
*
DESH speeding up. BOURNE sees NICKY down below amongst the

crowds. In Desh's sights.
*
BOURNE knows he has to gain more ground.
*
CABLE CAM shot - Two trained assassins leaping across the

narrow streets - silently effortlessly -- the cops down

below searching the alleyways, oblivious to the chase
*
unfolding above them.
*
BOURNE nearly on terms with him - then --

DESH dipping down again into the street below.
Avoiding

the police -- he melts into the crowds.
*
STEADYCAM SHOT - following BOURNE as he heads downstairs.
*
More stairs. Through a corridor then a courtyard -

bursting out of a door into the street -

A police checkpoint. Right in his path.
Bourne forced to

dog leg and take another route.

BOURNE'S lost him- for the moment.

BOURNE hearing the POLICE too as he moves up onto a

BOURNE into a main room - something stirring on a couch - a

girl and her little sister having a siesta.

In another room two small boys fast asleep.
TV playing.

One wakes.

A noise on the stairs above. Quickly arranging a mirror -

getting line of sight - Bourne dipping into a corner.

It's NICKY.

She gives him a look -- DESH is in here somewhere.

The door goes below them.
The noise of Police entering the

Riad.

NICKY signalling to BOURNE - this way.

They climb narrow stairs to the next floor.

Down below Police begin searching rooms. Waking the

sleeping family. Shouting, crying. Commotion.

BOURNE and NICKY creeping up the steps.

Then - suddenly NICKY spinning round as two silenced

bullets speed past her - And DESH bursting out of a landing

toilet.

On to Bourne.

Full on Treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell.

Crashing into a tiny disused lift cage- silent constrained-

Downstairs a young POLICEMAN hears the noise- heading for

NICKY seeing the handle turn. Thinking quickly.
She sends

Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
roof lands hard behind him.
Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
a head on charge.
The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
the floor as he dives out of the car.
The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
glass shatters, and airbags explode.
Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
car implodes against the oncoming agents.
87
Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.
The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.
The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.
The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.
An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.
With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.
Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.
The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.
The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.
BOURNE
10-13. Shots fired. Officer
down. Port Authority parking
lot. Level four.
Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer.
Then he hands the cop his
radio back.
BOURNE (CONT'D)
Stay out of sight until one of
your own arrive.
Bourne disappears.
We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits.
CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--

Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that
indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US
95." Bourne turns right--
Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
top of Bourne's leg.
REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As
Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
it into the side of Bourne's car.
Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging
forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his
front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's
car by sliding into his path.

287
On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
(call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
ahead.
Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:
The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.
Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
oncoming traffic.
Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
street ahead.
The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked
cars.
Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the
road.

VOSEN'S SUV -- LATE AFTERNOON
306A
VOSEN at the other end of the line --
VOSEN (INTO PHONE)
Bourne knows everything. I think
he's heading for you right now.
Dead pause.
306
306
HIRSCH (INTO PHONE)
He's coming home, Noah.
There's a wistfulness in the way he says it. But also the
sense that this was absolutely inevitable. And he's calm
about it, doesn't show any fear, doesn't reach for a gun.
HIRSCH (INTO PHONE)
How long do I have?
VOSEN
Not long.
Get out of there.
HIRSCH
No.
I'm going to stay.
VOSEN
Are you crazy, he'll--
HIRSCH
He'll come to the training wing.
That's what he knows. I'll keep
him in play until you arrive.
309R
310
Bourne uses the card reader he took from Vosen's safe to
enter a "restricted access elevator."
A guard comes.
Bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes.
309R
323
A block south of the hospital, stuck in traffic, Vosen
points.
VOSEN
Landy! Right there!
She's got
Bourne's backpack!
310R
310R
Bourne flips up the elevator stop button and uses the
access card to enter a secure corridor--
323
323
Landy runs across the lobby.
323
322
Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor--
325
325
Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby.
96
VOSEN
(to a group of six
agents)
I'll find Landy. You get to the
training wing and get Bourne!
A security guard comes over.
VOSEN
Do you know who I am?
(the guard nods)
Where's your security room?
324
324
Landy looks around. Finds an open office. She pushes open
the door and runs to the fax machine. She starts faxing
the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe.
324A
324A
Vosen enters.
VOSEN
I want to see all your footage
for the last three minutes.
322
AFTERNOON
Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the
corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback.
We see Bourne go into--

That first day, Bourne's POV being led down this corridor
by Daniels.

BACK TO SCENE
322
Bourne moves down the corridor.
322
AFTERNOON
Bourne reaches the end of the hall.
He looks around
"flashback style" --

FLASHBACK

Bourne was standing at this door....

Vosen enters the room.
The last pages have been faxed...
LANDY
You better get a good lawyer.
She exits...
322
BACK TO SCENE
322
Then spins, gun up--
Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him.
HIRSCH
Put the gun down. I wouldn't be
here if I didn't want to talk.
BOURNE
I've spent three years running.
Three years trying to find out
who I was.
Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.
HIRSCH
You still don't have it all back,
do you? You haven't filled in
all the pieces?
BOURNE
Let's start with the moment you
found out I wouldn't execute
Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the
issue, it was the fact that I
didn't pull the trigger....
HIRSCH
One lapse meant your conditioning
had failed.
Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall
BOURNE
It was always you, behind
Conklin, behind Abbott.... They
were just following orders.
Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.
Searches
him for weapons.
98
HIRSCH
(completely calm)
I'm unarmed, Jason.
BOURNE
(shoving Hirsch hard
against the wall)
"David." I'm David Webb.
CLOSE ON Bourne's face--
HIRSCH
You were David Webb, but not
anymore.
322
322
Bourne stands with Hirsch.
BOURNE
Why me?
Why did you pick me?
A beat...
HIRSCH
You really don't remember, do
you?
(beat)
You picked us, Jason.
BOURNE
What does that mean?
HIRSCH
You volunteered.
Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall.
The "room in use" sign lights up.
Bourne looks up "flashback style"--
FBA1
FLASHBACK
FBA1
Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from
the first day...
322
322
Bourne and Hirsch enter...
HIRSCH
You volunteered right here....
You didn't even blink, Jason.
You just handed me these...
99
Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket.
Holds them out to Bourne.
Bourne takes the dog tags.
Stares at them.

Bourne hands over his dog tags....
HIRSCH (CONT'D)
Has everything been explained to
you.
BOURNE
Yes, sir.
322
PRESENT DAY
322
HIRSCH
You were a soldier ready to serve
his country. Just like thousands
of others, except you were a
prodigy with languages...and a
perfect shot.

HIRSCH (CONT'D)
Your missions will save American
lives.

PRESENT DAY
322
BOURNE
You said I'd be saving American
lives. Instead you just turned me
into a killer.
Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch.
HIRSCH
You could have left at any time.
And you knew exactly what it
meant for you if you chose to
stay.

HIRSCH
When we're finished with you,
you'll no longer be David Webb.
BOURNE
I'll be whoever you need me to
be, sir.
322
PRESENT DAY
322
HIRSCH
Stop running from the truth,
Jason. You chose to come here!
You chose to stay! And no matter
how much you want to forget
it...eventually you're going to
have to face how you chose, right
there, to become Jason Bourne!
FB10
FLASHBACK:
FB10
Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.
Hirsch looks
at him from behind the desk...
HIRSCH (CONT'D)
You haven't slept for a long time
have you David? Have you made a
decision? This can't go on, you
know. You have to decide.
BOURNE
Who is he?
HIRSCH
We've been through that.
BOURNE
What did he do?
HIRSCH
It doesn't matter.
(beat)
You came to us. You volunteered.
You said you'd do anything it
takes to save American lives.
You're not a liar are you? Or too
weak to see this through? This is
it. Let go of David Webb. Will
you give yourself to this
program?
101
Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand. He gets to his feet
swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded
figure. The man slumps over.
Bourne stares at what he's done.
HIRSCH (CONT'D)
You're no longer David Webb.
From now on you'll be known as
Jason Bourne. Welcome to the
program.
Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is
dead.
Just then Kramer walks through the door.
KRAMER
He's ready. Send him to
Operations.
322
PRESENT
322
And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback.
He stares back at Hirsch....
HIRSCH
Do you remember now?
Bourne lowers the gun.
BOURNE
I remember. I remember
everything.
HIRSCH
You can't outrun what you did,
Jason. You made yourself into
who you are.
BOURNE
I'm done running.
That's why
I'm here. To end you, to shut
this down. I'm no longer Jason
Bourne.
HIRSCH
So now you're going to kill me?
BOURNE
No. You don't deserve the star
they give you on the wall at
Langley.
Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.
It's
locked.
102
322
322
The agents fire at the door handle to get it open.
322
322
Bourne looks out a window.
Sees the layout of a roof
several stories below. Then he turns and shoots out the
room's mirrored observation window. Bourne dives through
it just as agents rush in and open fire at him.
SERIES OF SHOTS
Bourne races through corridors, loosing the CRI agents.

356
Nicky goes to the bar of at a low end tourist bar with
several other customers.
She stands there, eyes fixed on
a TV behind the bar:
ANCHOR 5 (V.O., CONT'D)
Webb, who was known inside the
intelligence community, as "Jason
Bourne" jumped from the
fourteenth floor of the CIA
facility where he was trained in
New York into the East River
below.
While experts say it
would be nearly impossible to
survive the fall, despite two
weeks of efforts, his body has
still not been recovered.
PUSH in on the smile that develops on Nicky's face.
As we
CUE the Moby "Extreme Ways" sting---

UNDERWATER

Bourne's body sinking toward the bottom...when all of a
sudden it comes to life -- arms together, legs kick
powerfully--
And Bourne swims away...
