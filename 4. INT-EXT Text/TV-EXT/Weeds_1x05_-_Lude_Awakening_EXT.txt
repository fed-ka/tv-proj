    Nancy pulls up in her car.  You can tell on her face that she 
    is still reeling from what happened.  She exits the car.  
    Suddenly, we hear a truck backfire.  Nancy, still skittish, 
    hits the ground and comes face to face with the new spinning 
    rims Conrad put on.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Andy is driving and smoking a little dope, blasting his 
    radio.  As he s toking, he pulls up to a stop sign, and 
    doesn t make a complete stop.  A BICYCLE COP on an adjacent 
    street gives chase.  Andy is oblivious to the cop chasing him 
    uphill.  The cop peddles behind the car blasting his air-
    horn.  This gets Andy s attention.  

                                ANDY
                  You got to be kidding me.

                                COP
                  (THROUGH BULLHORN) Pull over!

    Andy stuffs the bag of weed between the seat and the console 
    and puts the joint in the ashtray.  The cop walks up to the 
    van.  

                                COP (cont d)

                  When you arrest people, do you ride

                  they just sit on the back with their

                                COP
                  Okay sir, step out of the car.

                                ANDY
                  Oh, come on.  Seriously?  I m just 
                  having some fun.  I mean, you re a cop

                                ANDY
                  Cool.  I m cool.  

    Andy opens the door.  As he gets out of the car, the cop 
    notices the smell.  

                                COP 
                  What s that smell?

                  You know, I don t think you re

    The officer cuffs Andy.

    The cop leans into the car and notices the joint in the 
    ashtray.  He sniffs it.  

                                COP (cont d)
                  Do you have any other drugs in the

                  Uh, no.

    The cop looks at Andy and then goes back in to search the 
    car.  Andy, in anticipation of being caught, begins to sweat.  
    The cop digs in the car and finds the bag of weed.  The cop 
    pulls it out.

                                COP

    Silas is sitting on the front steps.  Megan walks up to the 
    house, ignores him and puts her key in the lock.  Silas turns 
    her around so she can see his lips.

    She shakes her head, enters her house and shuts the door.

    Shane, wearing goggles and earphones, is sitting on the curb 
    in front of his house, popping whole rolls of caps on a brick 
    with a hammer.

    ANGLE ON CELIA

    Celia is walking down the street.  She crosses to Shane.

                  out of jail.

                                CELIA

    Celia laughs.

                  Well, thank you, Shane.  Everyone

                  there s no way around it, so we can

                  pretend everything s normal, or we can 
                  just be our strange selves and let the 
                  rest of the world go fuck itself.
