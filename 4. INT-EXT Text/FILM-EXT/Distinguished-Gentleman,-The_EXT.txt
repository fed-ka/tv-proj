Johnson and Andersen approach, arm in arm, and sit on a
bench by the pillar.
JOHNSON
Olaf, there's something I wanted to
sound you out on. As a special
friend.
ANDERSEN
Shoot.
Tommy moves away from the pillar, sees Bruno roaming the
terrace, and retreats.
JOHNSON
I'm thinking of retiring from
Congress.
Andersen's eyes widen in astonishment.
ANDERSEN
You're what?
JOHNSON
I'm thinking maybe I won't run.
Maybe I should listen more
(indicating his heart)
to this. Really appreciate these
years. Sail around the world.
Climb mountains. Enjoy the finer
things of life.
ANDERSEN
Jeff. Listen to me. You can't
retire. Florida needs you. I need
you. I need you on rates. I need
you on regulations. I need you on
those environmental nutcases --
JOHNSON
Olaf, if I retire this year, I get to keep
all the money left over in my campaign
treasury. Comes to a very tidy nest-egg.
ANDERSEN
How tidy?

Come on, Jeff. Look at what you'd be
giving up. Going to the best resorts
in the world and calling it "official
business." Golfing and skiing and
fishing, and never picking up a tab.
And, Jeff -- there's no aphrodisiac
like power. You can have some of the
most intelligent, attractive women
in the country. You've got it made!
JOHNSON
Oh, I suppose that one-point-three
may seem like spare change to the
head of Gulf Coast Power, but to a
country boy like me --
ANDERSEN
Okay, Jeff. I get it. Look. There's
a little software company that's
about to go through the roof.
Johnson smiles at the direction the conversation is
taking.
ON Tommy also smiling, in admiration at the transaction
going down.
ANDERSEN
A few thousand worth of stock options
would stand to make you quite a pile.
As long as your blind trust buys them,
you're clean -- the SEC can't shake a
stick at you. Half a million, easy --
and that's just a start.
JOHNSON
Well, if you put it like that... I
now see I have a duty to continue
my career in public service.

Let a few days pass to show proper
respect. But next week, I want to
stand next to you at a press
conference where you declare for
Jeff's seat in the House.
VERA JOHNSON
No, Dick -- no.
DODGE
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Vera. With your name, you can't
lose. People around these parts
are so used to voting for Jeff
Johnson -- why, Mrs. Jeff Johnson
would win in a walk.
VERA JOHNSON

he'll get to say his piece on the
floor. Just get him off my back.
Can you do that for me?
TOMMY
That's not a question, is it?
DODGE
That's right.
Is there a problem?
TOMMY
No, no -- I've still got my right
nut, I can work with that.
122
123
Reinhardt and Loretta about to go in.
LORETTA
You sure they don't want to be
alone, Reinhardt?
REINHARDT
No, no -- I bet they've been talking
about the ethics bill all night.
Come on, Loretta, you'll know how to
get Marshall's mind off business.
124
126
Tommy is on foot. Marshall's car, with its Maryland
congressional plates, pulls over.
LORETTA
Come on, honey, no use you getting
mugged.

With a SCREECH of brakes and a CRUNCH of metal, a TAXI
rear-ends them, SLAMMING Marshall's car into a lamppost.
131
132
On the back floor, Tommy stirs. Seems to be okay.
Lifts himself to see up front. The windshield is
smashed. Loretta and Marshall are both unconscious.
Tommy climbs into the front but can't get the door open.
He kicks out a broken window and climbs through.
He runs to a phone on the corner and dials 911.
TOMMY
I need an ambulance right away.
IN THE CAR no motion from Loretta or Marshall.
AT THE PHONE he dials another number.
TOMMY
Evening, Mrs. Dodge, Tommy Johnson
here, sorry to call at this hour,
is Dick back from the Gridiron
dinner yet? Could I speak with him
for just a moment?
133
136
A CORRESPONDENT doing a stand-up.
CORRESPONDENT
That's right, Tom. Marshall
reportedly had alcohol in his blood.
Also slightly injured was an
unidentified woman whom police say
has a record in several states for
prostitution.
Tommy looks sick.
TOMMY
Oh sweet Jesus.
WASHINGTON ANCHOR
Linda, Congressman Marshall --
that's Reverend Marshall, isn't it?
CORRESPONDENT
Right you are, Tom. How this plays
into his longstanding campaign to
reform congressinoal ethics is now
anyone's guess.
WASHINGTON ANCHOR
Thank you.
In other news...
Tommy leaps for his clothes.

MICKEY JUBA
sitting on the ground, backs to us, beneath the power
lines. A quiet moment.
REVERSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT.
Mickey is shuffling a deck of
cards.
MICKEY
Is it thumb over, or thumb under?
TOMMY
Under.
She tries her hand at a false shuffle.
TOMMY
Not bad, kid.
You've got potential.
MICKEY
So what's happening? I thought you
were going to kick some ass on --
She indicates the derricks.
Tommy looks at her, comes to
a decision.
TOMMY
I am.
He takes the deck from her, fans it face up, pulls all the
kings and aces, stacks them on top, and squares the deck.
TOMMY
This is one's called the double
duke. How many players?
MICKEY
Six.
TOMMY
Who's the mark?

She points to an imaginary poker player.
MICKEY
Number two -- over there.
Tommy, smiling, calculates something for a moment, then
gives the deck four shuffles. He hands Mickey the cards.
TOMMY
Your deal.
She deals out six hands in a circle on the ground.
TOMMY
Look at the sucker's hand.
She turns over the hand at number two.
It has the four
kings. Mickey WHISTLES at the hand.
TOMMY
Look at your hand.
She turns over her own hand. It has the four aces.
Mickey looks at the power lines, at the hands, at TJ.
Then, understanding:
MICKEY
That's what you're going to do?
Tommy nods.
Her face opens into a big smile.
MICKEY
Let's kick some ass.
What do I do?
TOMMY
Something very important.
139
141
A man waits, alone, in the shadow of a large statue.
It's Homer. In a jacket and tie, his stubble shaved off,
he looks like a plausible government worker. Tommy and
Reinhardt approach.
TOMMY
Mr. Yancey?
HOMER
(cold)
I thought you'd be alone.
TOMMY
He's my AA. He goes where I go. If
you can trust me, you can trust him.
Homer eyes Reinhardt a moment, then continues.
HOMER
Congressman, I have information I
think you may want. It's about
something going on at the EPA.
TOMMY
What have you got?
HOMER
I got a wife and three kids, and a
note on my house, that's what I got.

TOMMY
(laughs)
Nothin' comes for nothin' in this
town, do it?
(to Reinhardt)
You got any cash on you? I'm kind
of light.
REINHARDT
(whispering)
You can't do that!
TOMMY
(to Homer)
This stuff's pretty good?
HOMER
In the right hands, it could mean a
great deal.
TOMMY
Okay. Sunday. Fifth race at Del
Mar. Blueboy is running twenty to
one. I'd take a major position.
HOMER
You have to be shitting me.
TOMMY
No, not at all -- my Cousin Henry
spends his days pumping water into
horses' stomachs and stuffing
Percodan up their butts. Trust me.
Reinhardt is interested in this.
And he admires Tommy's
m.o.
HOMER
(after a moment)
Alright. The White House is putting
heat on the EPA. They want us to
announce a major investigation of
the relation between power lines and
cancer clusters.
REINHARDT
But didn't the EPA already do a study?
HOMER
Yeah, but when the draft got to the
White House, they didn't like it. So
they brought their own scientists in
to kill it.

TOMMY
Why did the White House change its
mind?
HOMER
Who knows?
TOMMY
Is there new evidence?
HOMER
Yeah -- their polls have dropped
like a rock. They need an issue.
This one makes them look good on
the environment, and they don't have
to spend a penny.
TOMMY
And what good is this to me?
HOMER
Come on, congressman, in this town,
information is currency. And
advance information is gold.
Reinhardt nods in agreement.
HOMER
But you've
got to move fast. Once
the White
House goes public with
this, they
can't turn back. If your
friends at
the power company want to
kill this
investigation, they'd better
do it now.
Evening, gentlemen.
After Homer leaves:
REINHARDT
Blueboy. Twenty to one. Is your
Cousin Henry always right?
TOMMY
I ain't got no Cousin Henry.
142

Reinhardt dials.
MRS. DODGE'S VOICE (V.O.)
Hello?

Mrs. Dodge, it's Arthur Reinhardt.
May I speak to the Chairman, please?
DODGE (V.O.)
Hello?
REINHARDT
Are you sitting down?

165
Tommy and Celia walk down the steps, arm in arm.
CELIA
I can't wait to see that tape you
made.
Tommy pulls it from his pocket, glances at it, and tosses
it away.
TOMMY
Why? I bought it this morning.
It's blank.
As they continue down the steps, CAMERA CRANES UP to WIDE
SHOT of the Capitol and the town beyond.
FADE OUT.
