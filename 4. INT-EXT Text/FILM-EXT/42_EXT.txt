The big Birmingham Black Barons CATCHER behind the plate as
Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's
attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot,
feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights.
CATCHER
Where'd you learn to move like
that, runner?! At dime a dance
night?! Stay quiet!
INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945.
On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to
second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in SAFE!
A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher:
RUNNER
Is that the best you got?! Huh?!
I'm going to steal nine, ten bases
today! You better start counting!
The catcher frowns. Standing, we see he is a big, big man.
CATCHER
(ALABAMAN)
Where's your shortstop from?
JOHN SCOTT
(LOUISIANAN)
California.
CATCHER
He's got a mouth on him.
Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch,
signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off
again. The catcher fires to THIRD: Safe!
RUNNER
You got a rag arm, catcher!
CATCHER
Steal home! You'll find out what
kind of arm I got!
DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 3.
RUNNER
Okay, I'm coming!
The Catcher looks over at Scott who chuckles.
CATCHER
California, huh?
(SCOTT NODS)
Well California here he goes, if he
comes down here.
The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the
pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing
off third. Here comes the wind-up...
The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The
Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides --
The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both
hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as
we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner.
ON HIM now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt. A
close look at JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON. A born battler, he
shakes out the cobwebs, finally lurches to his feet, looks to
the UMPIRE. He never heard the call.
JACK
What was I?
The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks
over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes --
The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back.
As the two men wrestles each other to the ground --
CUT TO:
A BLOODHOUND watches as a BUS pulls into a SERVICE STATION,
the tires RING the bell hose. A million miles easy on this

Insert: Interstate 24, Missouri - August 24, 1945.
The DRIVER steps off. The fellas follow, getting off to
stretch their legs. Hot and tired. A WHITE ATTENDANT
saunters out. The driver steps over to meet him.
ATTENDANT
Fill her up?
DRIVER
Yes, sir.
The attendant starts unscrewing caps on two 50-GALLON TANKS.
ATTENDANT
Where you all headed?
DRIVER
Chicago.
As the attendant shoves down a pump, starts filling, Jack
steps off. He spots and heads for a restroom. White Men
Only lettered on the door. The attendant roused as he sees.
ATTENDANT
Hey! Where you going, boy!?
BLUE REV 4-07-12 6.
Everyone looking over as Jack stops.
JACK
I'm going to the toilet.
ATTENDANT
Shit, boy, c'mon. You know you
can't go in there.
Jack does a slow burn, then suddenly strides toward the
attendant. The air rife with tension.
JACK
Take that hose out of the tank.
ATTENDANT
Huh?
DRIVER
ROBINSON --
JACK
Take it out. We'll get our ninety-
nine gallons of gas someplace else.
The attendant blinks. He takes a look from Jack to up and
down the deserted highway. No business in sight.
ATTENDANT
Okay, use it. But don't stay in
there too long.
Jack heads back. The Driver, the players, a bit stunned.

He pulls out a DRUMSTICK, considers it, then takes a bite.

DUROCHER
That's what spring training's for,

He hits another. This time to the outfield where veteran
DIXIE WALKER gives chase, finally gives up on it.
DUROCHER
C'mon, Dixie, get after it!

DUROCHER
Rusty, Mr. Rickey. But we'll get

You find your lost sheep yet?
Troubled, Rickey shakes his head no'. As he does, Harold

Jackie Robinson's on a bus leaving
Pensacola.
RICKEY
A bus? Harold, how in blazes did
he end up on a bus?!
BOB BRAGAN, in his catching gear, passing by with pitchers

SMITH
You ever been down South before,

Mr. Rickey says we follow the law.

Jack and Rachel exchange a look, the place seems nice.
SMITH
Brooklyn plays downtown; Montreal a

with the Harrises except for a few
days at the end of the week. The
whole Dodger organization is going

You'll stay here though, Rachel.

As PLAYERS (Brooklyn, St. Paul & Montreal) warm up, practice,
Rickey sits on the bench, angry as he reads a NEWSPAPER.
Harold Parrott hurries over, something urgent on his mind.
Rickey on a rant; Parrott can't get a word in.
RICKEY
Listen to this, Harold. Whenever I
hear a white man - yours truly -
broadcasting what a Moses he is to
the Negro race, then I know the
latter needs a bodyguard.
(Parrott tries to
INTERJECT)
It is those of the carpetbagger
stripe of the white race - me again
- who under the guise of helping,
in truth are using the Negro for
their own selfish interest, thereby
retarding the race!
Parrott tries to interrupt again, but Rickey is furious.
RICKEY
The minor league commissioner of
baseball said that! I pay part of
his salary! You wouldn't stab me
in the back like this, would you?

He's surrounded by REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. It's the cue

Dodgers, Royals and Saints to come to a stop.
Higbe forgets Bragan is throwing him a ball. It clocks him
in the chest.
Reese and Stanky passing a medicine ball.

Flash bulbs go off in Jack's face. Questions like punches.
Shouts of Jackie' and then...

Jackie, do you think you can make

Jack looks off to where Smith watches, back to the reporter.
See the questions slow. He answers with measure.
JACK
Sure, I had no problem with white
men in the service or at UCLA.
REPORTER TWO
What'll you do if one of these
pitchers throws at your head?
JACK

He stands with Dixie Walker the Dodger right fielder.
HOPPER

Well, when Mr. Rickey picks one, he
sure picks a black one.
WALKER
He's fine with me, so long as you
keep him up in Montreal.
HOPPER
Here comes the old man to save him.
They watch as Rickey pulls Jack from the press. He leads
Jack directly toward Hopper. As Walker excuses himself...
WALKER
Good luck, Hop...
RICKEY
Clay, I'd like you to meet Jackie
Robinson. Jackie, Clay Hopper,
manager of the Montreal Royals.
Hopper shakes his hand as they exchange greetings.

Higbe and Bragan call out from the door of the Dodger bus.
HIGBE
Hey, Rook! Did you hear about the
redneck shortstop?
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 29.
BRAGAN
He thought the last two words of
the National Anthem were Play Ball!
Jack forces a smile, but the joke comes off a bit harsh. And
they seem like they're laughing at him as...
HIGBE
How about the shortstop making all
the errors, tried to kill himself
by jumping out on the highway?
BRAGAN
A bus just missed him. Drove right
between his legs!
As the bus passes by, Jack sees the impassive faces of Dixie
Walker, Reiser, Stanky, Pee Wee Reese and finally 20-year-old
Branca. Branca smiles, offers an awkward little wave.
SMITH
Between his legs, good one. He
must've read a joke book. If he
can read.
Jack just gets in the car. Smith sighs, drum rolls the hood
of the Buick.
SMITH
Hi, Wendell, how are you...? Well,
looks like I got a long drive to
Sanford.

MR. BROCK comes out the screen door carrying a tray of tall
drinks. He sets them on a table, watches and waits as Smith

Sanford Florida! The day belongs
to decent minded people.
They shake hands. Brock looks to Smith, obviously knows him.
MR. BROCK
Wendell, good to see you.

My wife's inside cooking. You know
what she asked me this morning?
She asked me, what do you serve
when a hero's coming for dinner?
WHITE 3-14-12 30.
Jack's humble, embarrassed, doesn't know what to say.
JACK
I'm just a ballplayer, Mr. Brock.
MR. BROCK
Tell that to all the little colored
boys playing baseball in Florida
today. You're a hero to them.
The look on Jack's face says that's a heavy burden.
MR. BROCK (CONT'D)
Sit down, have something to drink.
My special rum and coke.
JACK
No thank you, sir, I don't drink.
MR. BROCK
A ballplayer who doesn't drink?
That's a new one on me.
SMITH
I'll have one. I'm a stereotypical

Mr. Brock, do you have a desk? I'd
like to get a letter to my wife.
MR. BROCK
Of course, this way.
As Mr. Brock leads Jack ahead, Smith sips his drink.

Rickey and Montreal manager Hopper stand by the dugout
watching a spring game versus St Paul. Jack's playing
second. They watch him closely as they talk.
HOPPER
He's getting by on a quick release,
but his arm's too weak for short.
Second base is his spot.
RICKEY
I agree. And I'll state another
obvious, Clay, I need the players
to act like gentlemen around him.
HOPPER
Uh huh.
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 31.
The MAN on first takes a lead.
RICKEY
To treat him as they would any
other teammate.
HOPPER
Uh huh.
RICKEY
To be natural, to impose no
restrictions on themselves. To all
work together in harmony.
WHACK! The hit & run is on. The man on first runs on the
pitch as a LOW LINE DRIVE shoots for the gap between 1st and
2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly
and catch it before it hits the ground.
He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner
out before he can get back to first. 
Rickey is astounded.
RICKEY
That was superhuman.
HOPPER
(CHUCKLING)
Superhuman? Don't get carried
away, Mr. Rickey, that's still a
Nigger out there.
Rickey takes a moment to process. It's Hopper's light
admonishing tone that really halts him. Finally...
RICKEY
Clay, I realize that attitude is
part of your heritage; that you
practically nursed race prejudice
at your mother's breast, so I will
let it pass. But I will add this:
you can manage Robinson fairly and
correctly or you can be unemployed.
They both look over as Jack comes off the field toward them.

Who is it you're looking for?
LUTHER

LUTHER
I ain't comin' back. Other fellas

CUT TO:
The street deserted, sidewalks rolled up. Jack angry and
silent in the passenger seat. Smith jumpy behind the wheel.
They stop as a PICK-UP stops ahead outside a BAR where:
A DOZEN WHITE MEN in shirtsleeves exchange words with the

town bull session. To Smith it looks like something else.
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 34.
The white men look over at the two black men. One steps

JACK
I wonder what he wants?
SMITH
To run us out of town.

What are you talking about?
The man close now. As Jack cranks down the window, Smith
floors it. The Buick SCREECHES away, SWERVING around a CAR
coming the other way.
JACK
What the hell, Wendell?!
SMITH
Man came by while you were asleep.
(CHECKS MIRROR)
Told us more men were coming. Maybe
those boys. Mr. Rickey said to get
you to Daytona Beach a-s-a-p.
JACK
Why didn't you say so?
SMITH
Mr. Rickey was afraid you wouldn't
leave, that you would fight.
As it becomes clear, Jack starts to LAUGH.
SMITH
What the hell are you laughing at?
JACK
I thought you woke me because I was
cut from the team.
Jack LAUGHS harder. Wendell LAUGHS as well. As it fades,
Jack looks back over his shoulder. Jesus...

his mouth, confides to someone alongside him we don't see.
RICKEY
I've spoken to the mayor. I've
explained how much money we'll
spend in Daytona. But still, when
this fine young Negro man steps on
that field today, he and the
Dodgers will technically be
breaking the law. A law which says
white and black players cannot
enjoy the same field at the same
time. Does that make sense to you?
Does Jim Crow make any sense when
placed against the words of the
United States Constitution? When
placed against the word of God?
POP OUT to reveal he sits beside the DODGER BATBOY, so short
his feet don't touch the ground. Rickey offers his peanut

Higbe fires to LAVAGETTO at first. Jack dives back in time.

Higbe gets the ball back, settles. Jack takes a lead, but a

You knew he was fast; but not this fast. Bragan's throw to
Pee Wee is late and high. Pee Wee throws back to Higbe.
Higbe sets. Bragan gives him a sign. Jack takes a lead. On
the wind-up, Jack goes. Bragan stands -- it's a PITCH OUT.
Bragan fires to third and Jack is caught in a RUN DOWN. It
seems like half the team gets involved with Higbe finally
getting the ball by third and Jack ducking under the tag.

Higbe steps off the rubber. Jack stays where he is.
HIGBE
Hell! You're supposed to go back

He throws over. Jack back to the bag. Higbe gets the ball
back, looks in. Jack bouncing, pounding off third. His
movements carry violence within them. Like a piston
exploding in an engine.
Higbe into his motion, stops his delivery, accidentally drops
the ball to the ground. The umpire signals BALK, points Jack
home. Higbe is furious.
ED CHARLES - IN THE COLORED SECTION

Spider Jorgensen settles in the batter's box. The pitch.
Crack, Jorgensen laces a single to left.
Jack motors to third where Sukeforth is WAVING him home.
We're with him at hip level as he tears down the basepath.

A white man bee-lines them from across the street, looks like
a real CRACKER. Jack on guard, gets in front of Rachel.
JACK
Get back, Rae. Go back.
Cracker stops square across from him. Jack's fists balled.
CRACKER
I want you to know something.
JACK
Yeah, what's that?
CRACKER
I want you to know I'm pulling for
you to make good. And a lot of

Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey?
RICKEY
I'm an opportunist. With you and
the Negro players I hope to bring
up next year I'll put together a
team that can win the World Series.
And the World Series means money.
Jack studies him a beat, not quite buying it.

Don't you believe that?

Agreed. Therefore, run the bases

Jack is one of the last to board. He's almost through the

A beat. Ed slowly raises his hand and waves. Jack smiles,
does the same, then disappears inside. The WHISTLE blows and
the train starts out of the station. On impulse Ed starts to
trot out after it. Staying close. His friends follow.

The train picks up speed. The boys start to run. Arms
pumping, feet flying. One boy drops off. Then the other.
But Ed still runs. Chasing after that train carrying Jackie
Robinson. Finally, he stops, heaving for breath, watching
the train disappear around the bend. A lonely beat. Then --
Ed gets down on his hands and knees. He sets his ear on the
rail, closes his eyes. A thrum comes off the rail. A huge
smile spreads. He straightens, shouts back to his friends:

He's sees she's raw, takes her in his arms with the baby.

She sighs, rests her head on his shoulder.

You're getting close now. The

I will not. God built me to last.
He kisses her. She kisses him back.

See you in Brooklyn in eight weeks.

It might be Montreal.
A certainty grips her. She passes it on to him.
RACHEL
It's going to be Brooklyn. I know
it is.
Power in her words. He nods, looks off toward the taxi.
JACK
I've got to go, Rae.
She nods. They kiss, embrace a last time. He starts away
down the walk. She watches. Something not quite right.
A tug as Jack stops, looks back at her. Fighting back her
emotion and then impelled forward, she runs to him. They
come together. She practically disappears in his arms. They
do not want to be apart.

I've never played first base in my

inside. Jack hits the deck to keep from getting beaned.

Bojangles! You sure can dance,

STANKY
On first, mouth hanging open. Almost forgets to take a lead.

catches it and Jack can mercifully return to the dugout.

watches his catcher Seminick settle under it. Waiting.

Hey, is that a home run!?

Jack veers off the first baseline. Heads for the dugout.

Jack stalks down past the team. No one looks at him. Bragan
is ashamed. Dixie tries to look disinterested. Stanky and
Reese exchange a helpless glance as Jack continues into:

Like a bull on his way to slaughter, he revolts. WHAM-WHAM!
He proceeds to turn his bat into SPLINTERS. Concrete chips,
wood flies. Jack drops the handle of the bat, pounds his
fists. Heaving for breath, framed by the empty tunnel. Raw,
electric, ungovernable. All the anger on display, the fury.
FEET SCRAPE. Jack looks up to see Rickey standing there,
watching, afraid to get too much closer.
JACK
To hell with this. The next white
son of a bitch who opens his mouth,
I'll smash his goddamn teeth in.
Rickey stands there until finally, opening his mouth...

Jack is at the end of his rope. All Rickey has are words.

You don't matter right now, Jack.
You're in this thing. You don't
have the right to pull out from the
backing of people who believe in
you, respect you and who need you.

pokes a soft hit past second. A nothing hit, but he's
standing on first. And he looks, well, ferocious in fact.
As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box...
Jack stares at Dutch Leonard. Assassin's eyes as he takes an
insolent, in-your-face lead off first.
Dutch fires to first. Jack dives back safe!
Back on his feet, he spits out a piece of grit he picked up
sliding back on his belly. Not bothering to dust himself
off, he's turning into something elemental before our eyes.

BARBER
Takes a fastball in on the hands.
Robinson, who is pitched to a great
deal that way, uses a thicker
handle bat than most hitters, just
because he hits a lot of balls out
on his hands.
152B BATTER'S BOX 152B
Jack edges up closer to the plate.
JACK
What's your average, Joe?
GARAGIOLA
It'd be a lot higher than yours, if
I could run as fast as you can.
JACK
No matter how fast you run, you'll
never hit as much as you weigh.
Garagiola signals for another fastball.
GARAGIOLA
C'mon, Munger! Boy's got a hole in
his bat!
Munger throws inside.
Jack falls back, strokes a double into the gap.
BARBER'S VOICE
That one wasn't quite in' enough.
Robinson punishing the Redbirds
with a smart piece of hitting.
RETURN TO:
The Brooklyn fans cheer; the Racist fan sulks. The double is
little comfort to Rachel who stares ahead, sitting as
straight up as she can. Willing herself not to cry.
CUT TO:
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 91.
153 OMITTED 153
WHACK! Rachel and Rickey watch Jack taking batting practice.
RICKEY
You look lovely, Mrs. Robinson.
RACHEL
Thank you.
RICKEY
I don't know how you do it. Every
day, from the 1st to the 9th.
Myself? I could pay $100 for a
suit and in twenty minutes I'd look
like I fell out of bed. Even my
shoes look rumpled.
They watch Jack crack one high off the Schaefer Beer sign.
RACHEL
I used to think Jack was conceited.
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 93.
RICKEY
Is that so?
RACHEL
It was the very first thing I
noticed about him.
RICKEY
How did you two meet?
RACHEL
I saw him at a UCLA football game.
Even in uniform with a helmet on,
his vanity was awful. It was the
way he held his hands on his hips.
I hated him!
(RICKEY LAUGHS)
And on campus he always wore crisp
white shirts and I'd think his skin
is so dark, why would he do that?
Then I got to know him, his pride
and confidence, and I realized he
was showing off his color. I was
wrong. He wasn't conceited; he was
proud. Always, of who and what he
is. I'd never met another man like
that. What about you? How did you
meet your wife?
RICKEY
Trying to catch her in a race. She
was the fastest girl in town.
Beautiful legs. I finally caught
up; we've been together ever since.
They sit a moment. Below: Jack nails another one.
RICKEY
I wanted to apologize to you.
RACHEL
For what?
RICKEY
Everything. I can't apologize to
him. He and I both knew what we
were getting into. But you. A
newlywed, trying to blossom a
marriage under all this pressure.
RACHEL
Don't worry about me. Or us. We
know who we are.
Crack. Jack hits another.
WHITE 3-14-12 94.
RICKEY
Your husband has humbled me. When
this all began I thought I was
changing the world and that Jackie
was my instrument. Can you
imagine? I wish I could help him,
but I'm just a spectator.
RACHEL
You help him plenty. Believe me.
They watch him rip into another pitch.
RICKEY
Is he able to get things off his
chest? So he doesn't burn up?
RACHEL
Yes. I have to let him have that
silence at first, let him come to
me. But he opens up eventually.
RICKEY
Good. It's too much to carry
inside. Does he have any friends
on the team?
(she gives him a look)
They're spectators, too. They do
admire him though.
Rachel looks out to where Reese and Stanky play catch.
RACHEL
Do you think so?
RICKEY
Even the worst of us recognizes
courage. Moral courage especially.
I have to think they see it.
Jackie's a man on trial. He's
responding with glory and grace.
No one can take their eyes off him.
RACHEL
He's had himself on trial since the
day I met him. No man is harder on
himself or gets to himself worse
than Jack. But I hope his team-
mates know, they're on trial too.
RICKEY
I suppose we all are. You're an
astute woman, Mrs. Robinson.
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 95.
RACHEL
(LAUGHS)
I have to be, Mr. Rickey, I'm
married to a man of destiny. I
can't let him down.
RICKEY
If I'd met you first, I wouldn't
have looked so long for Jackie.
RACHEL
How do you mean?
RICKEY
I mean if he was good enough for
you, he's certainly good enough for
the rest of us.
CUT TO:
The Dodger TEAM BUS pulls up. The doors whoosh open; Parrott
steps off looking official. As the players start to follow:
INSERT: May 9, 1947. Benjamin Franklin Hotel, Philadelphia.
PARROTT
Come on, fellas! We have twenty
minutes to check in and then get to
Shibe! Chop chop.
No one is listening as the TEAM DRIVER opens the lower
compartment and the players (including Jack) grab their bags.
HOTEL MANAGER
Out! Get that bus out of here!
The HOTEL MANAGER stalks over, flanked by HOTEL SECURITY.
PARROTT
We're the Dodgers. We have a
reservation.
HOTEL MANAGER
Your team's not welcome, not while
you have ballclub Negroes with you.
PARROTT
You mean Robinson can't stay here?
HOTEL MANAGER
I mean the entire team is refused!
PARROTT
We've been staying here ten years.
HOTEL MANAGER
And you can stay away that long!
SHOTTEN
(last off the bus)
Hold on now, let's talk about this.
The Hotel Manager jerks his thumb like an umpire.
HOTEL MANAGER
Get out! Now, grandpa!
SHOTTEN
Grandpa? Hey hold on, you!
Security getting between as Shotten and the Manager go at it.
BLUE REV 4-07-12 96A.
Jack is embarrassed, but what can he do? Walker says to no
one in particular, but loud enough for Jack to hear:
WALKER
Maybe 42's got enough friends in
town, we can bunk up.
JACK
What's that supposed to mean?
WALKER
Nothing. It's just, I know when
you can't get into a hotel, you got
people's houses you can stay at.
JACK
What do you want from me, Walker?
WALKER
An apology.
JACK
(STEPS FORWARD)
For what? Places like this?
Parrott alarmed at this turn of events.
WALKER
For turning this season into a
sideshow! I'm a ballplayer; I want
to play ball!
JACK
So am I! I'm here to win!
WALKER
How the hell are we gonna win
sleeping on the bus?!
PARROTT
FELLAS --
JACK
It might do you some good the way
you're swinging the bat lately.
DIXIE
Watch your mouth!
PINK REV 4-19-12 97.
Walker jabs his chest with a finger; Jack bats his hand away.
JACK
Watch your damn hand!
And they're lunging at each other. Separated by Reese,
Stanky, Branca and Bragan while other players hold off
Shotton. Two fights about to break out at the same time.
SHOTTEN
Grandpa?! I'll show you grandpa!
Parrott summons something deep, lets loose a shrill WHISTLE.
PARROTT
Fellas! Burt! Please! Take the
bus to the field! Worry about the
game. I'll find another hotel.
CUT TO:
Chapman and Jack stand side-by-side facing the PRESS.
Chapman makes a little speech. Hypocrisy at its best.
CHAPMAN
Jackie's been accepted in baseball
and the Philadelphia organization
wish him all the luck we can. I
only hope in some small way our
trial of fire... helped him along.
Jack looks at him: Did he just say that?
GREEN REV 4-27-12 99.
PHOTOGRAPHER
How about a picture? Shake hands.
Bury the hatchet?
JACK
You want a picture? Sure.
Jack steps to the on-deck circle, grabs a BASEBALL BAT.
Chapman's eyes widen as he starts toward him with it.
JACK
(low to Chapman)
We'll hold the bat. That way we
don't have to touch skin.
Chapman nods, looks relieved. A photographer hands over a
bat. Chapman has two hands on the handle. Jack puts one
hand on the barrel, the other stays on his hip.
JACK
Ben, I hope all your friends back
home like the picture.
Jack smiles as the flashbulbs go off. Chapman looks dumb.
DIXIE WALKER
By the dugout with Stanky, watches in disbelief.
WALKER
Carl, I swear, I never thought I'd
see ol' Ben eat shit like that.
CUT TO:
FRITZ OSTERMUELLER on the mound. He takes a long look in at
Jack, at his catcher KLUTTZ who flicks his thumb: Hit him.'
INSERT: May 17, 1947. Pittsburgh.
Here it comes. All Jack has time to do is cover his face to
lessen the blow. Beaned in the head, he goes down in a heap.
Branca leads the Dodger players out onto the field. The
UMPIRES move to head them off. Pirates as well. Kirby
Higbe, now in a Pirate uniform, claps his hands pleased.
BRANCA
(in his face)
Ostermeuller, you kraut! You gotta
bat, too! Don't you forget!
OSTERMUELLER
I'm ready, you Wop bastard!
PINK REV 4-19-12 99A.
BRANCA
It's gonna come right between your
eyes! Like a Kamikaze!
OSTERMUELLER
(RE: JACK)
For him!? He doesn't belong here!
BRANCA
You don't belong here! Go home to
Goering and Shmelling!
OSTERMUELLER
Make me, you goddamn dago!
WHITE 3-14-12 100.
As an UMPIRE gets between them, Jack sits up. He's okay.
CUT TO:
Jack reaches first, throws the ball around the infield. Many
in the crowd beyond rise to jeer and heap abuse. COON!
SHINE! Jack tries to let it wash over him.
At short, Reese receives the ball, moves to throw to first
when he pauses. Deciding, he suddenly moves to trot across
the diamond until he's alongside Jack.
JACK
What's up?
Now cries of CARPETBAGGER! cut through. PEE WEE, HOW CAN YOU
PLAY WITH THIS BLACK BASTARD!? Reese stares up at the worst
hecklers along the first base line. He looks a little sad.
REESE
They can say what they want; we're
here to play baseball.
JACK
Just a bunch of crackpots still
fighting the Civil War.
REESE
Hell, we'd a won that son of a gun
if the cornstalks had held out. We
just ran out of ammunition.
Jack laughs. Reese has a funny way of saying it.
JACK
Better luck next time, Pee Wee.
Reese impulsively puts his arm around Jack's shoulder, stares
into the Cincy dugout.
REESE
Ain't gonna be a next time. All we
got is right now. This right here.
Know what I mean?
Walker reacting out in right. The crowd shuts down, some in
shock at the gesture. Jack surprised also.
REESE (CONT'D)
Thank you, Jackie.
JACK
What're you thanking me for?
REESE
I've got family here from
Louisville. Up there somewhere. I
need em to know who I am.
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 104.
Jack moved by Pee Wee's gesture, can't find the words.
RED BARBER'S VOICE
Robinson and Reese conferring at
first. Maybe discussing an infield
shift on Baumholtz.
UMPIRE
Hey! Number one! You playing ball
or socializing?
REESE
Playing ball, ump! Playing ball!
(TO JACK)
Maybe tomorrow we'll all wear 42.
That way they won't be able to tell
us apart.
Reese heads for short. Jack pounds his fist in his glove.

ENOS SLAUGHTER steps in for St. Louis. Hugh Casey on the
mound for Brooklyn. Slaughter looks fiercely determined.
RED BARBER'S VOICE
It wasn't enough as the Cardinals
tied it with two of their own in
the top of the ninth. This game is
crucial to the Red Birds. They're
five games out, the Dodgers having
not relinquished first place sine
June 30th.
Casey throws a pitch. Inside, a ball.
INSERT: August 20, 1947. Brooklyn.
RED BARBER'S VOICE
Slaughter takes ball one low.
Casey in his second inning of
relief. This game is tighter than
a new pair of shoes on a rainy day.
Slaughter hitless in four trips as
Casey goes into his wind-up.
Slaughter swings, hits a hard ground ball right at Reese who
fires over to Jack at first. Slaughter is out by fifteen
feet, but he never slows down. And his foot comes down --
-- High on Jack's right calf. Slaughter's spiked him
something wicked. Jack goes down in a heap clutching his
leg, blood already seeping through his high socks.
Slaughter, head down, on his way to the visitor's dugout as
Dodger players pour out of their own to protest. As the UMP
raises his hands, motions them all back... Jack pulls up his
sock, a bloody mess. Stanky looks to Casey.
WHITE 3-14-12 106.
STANKY
Next batter, throw right at his
head. Clean his clock --
JACK
(FIERCE)
Just get him out. Understand?
Game's too important.
As Casey nods, Jack reaches up to Stanky and Reese.
They pull him to his feet. Jack looks, finds Rachel in the
stands. As he gives her a little wave: I'm okay.'
CUT TO:
173 WHITEY KUROWSKI 173
A big Cardinal slugger at bat. Casey pitching.
BARBER'S VOICE
The top of the 12th and Kurowski at
the plate. He hit his 20th home
run on Monday so Casey's going to
want to be careful with him.
The pitch grooves in and Kurowski nails it.
BARBER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Oh dear. There goes number 21.
CUT TO:
174 SCOREBOARD - EBBETS FIELD 174
The Cardinals leading 3-2 going into the bottom of the 12th.
175 JACK 175
The stadium electric as Jack steps in, his left leg bloody.
He takes an inside pitch at the knees. Bastards!
Here comes the next one. WHACK - He singles hard up the
middle, nearly takes the pitcher's head off.
FIRST BASE
He rounds hard, returns to the bag. Reiser stepping up to
the plate as Musial holds Jack on at first. Jack in a fury.
JACK
I don't care what happens, I don't
care what kind of play it is, when
I get to second I'm gonna knock
someone into centerfield.
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 107.
MUSIAL
(glances at blood)
I don't blame you, man, you got
every right.
Jack running on the pitch. Reiser bunts. The play is to
first. Reiser is out and Jack slides safe into second.
SCHOENDIENST has the sense to vacate before he gets there.
JACK
Bouncing up and down, wearing that badge of potential
violence and action. The crowd buzzing, the electricity
practically hits you in the face. Jack's going to score.
RICKEY
Coming up out of his seat along with the fans around him.
JACK
Walker at bat. Jack steps out, checks on MARION the
shortstop. He takes another step out, looks to Schoendienst.
RED BARBER
(over it all)
Munger sets. Robbie back and forth
off second. The third bag clearly
in his sights. Oh, and Munger
deals a pick off throw to Marion at
second and Robinson is out!
Marion breaks for the bag and Munger turns and fires a
strike. Marion brings down the tag -- Out!
He is and he knows it. The crowd stunned into silence. Jack
frozen a moment, head down, furious with himself. Low.
BARBER'S VOICE
The Cardinals pick up a game. It
was one of those plays where you do
or you don't and Jackie didn't.

Jack exits MacDonough Street apartment building and makes his

BARBER'S VOICE
2 on 2 out for the Cardinals in the
eighth. Anxious moments now as
they've cut the Dodger lead to 2.
Nippy Jones up. Musial taking his
place on deck. Jones likes to
punch that ball when he swings.
Insert: September 13, 1947.
Casey on the mound receives the ball. Pounds his glove.
JACK
Come on, Casey, get him out! Pitch
that ball!
BARBER'S VOICE
The outfield is deep, shaded toward
left. Robinson holding the runner
on first. Here comes Casey with
the pitch --
Jones swings, pops it up.
BARBER
It's popped up foul toward first.
Should be out of play. But here
comes Robinson, he's coming hard --

Rachel walks pushing Jackie Junior in his stroller. As she
moves, the RADIO BROADCAST of the Dodgers' game can be heard
from one house to the next. In a gap, a passing car picks it
up and we hear it from the window. Then another house.
BARBER'S VOICE
A very big game today here in
Pittsburgh. A win and the Dodgers
will have clinched the National
League Pennant.
CUT TO:
Branch Rickey alone in the stadium. The field empty as he

Ostermueller on the rubber. Staring in at Jack.

takes outside. Ball one.

Ostermueller winds and throws, low

be pitching around Jackie. Or
trying to get him to chase.
RACHEL
Come on. Throw him a strike.
CUT TO:
Shakes off one sign, then nods at the next. Throws the ball
well outside. Another pitch outside. Ball Three!
BARBER'S VOICE
3 and 0 now. Robinson waiting on
something he can swing on.
As catcher Kluttz throws it back...
JACK
Give me something I can hit!
(TO HIMSELF)
What are you afraid of?
OSTERMUELLER
You want it?!
(TO HIMSELF)
Careful what you wish for boy...
Ostermueller nods at the sign. Jack about to slay the dragon
as the pitch comes in - WHACK! The ball is going for a ride.
BARBER'S VOICE
That is a deep fly ball to left.
Kiner on his horse, but I don't
think he'll get there.

Rachel all alone on the sidewalk looking up and down the

two cars, hurrying to her. And they're in each others arms.
JACK
I'm home.
RACHEL
Safe.
(RE: HOUSE)
The baby's sleeping so don't you
make a sound.
He makes to button his lips.
RACHEL
Stay just like that.
She kisses him. And kisses him. And he kisses her back. As
they finally head inside, we let them go. And as we're left
looking down the street, a crawl begins:
