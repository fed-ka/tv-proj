      KATE awakens from the nightmare.  She has dozed-off at a 
      table in her empty diner.  She's 45, has suffered desperate 
      times; a world shattered, her own loneliness and fear.  Dark 
      secrets.

      Her lovely 16 year old daughter, PEGGY, is beside her.  Smart 
      eyes, wounded soul.  She takes her mother's trembling hand 
      with quiet concern.

                                  PEGGY
                    ...hey?  You okay?

                                  KATE
                    Must've dozed off.
                          (beat)
                    No ones come in?

                                  PEGGY
                    Been quiet.  I don't know how we 
                    make it.

                                  KATE
                    ...you know Daddy left us some 
                    money.
                          (remembering)
                    Oh, god, I...





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    2.



                                  PEGGY
                    ...I already took the pies out.  
                    They were going to burn.

      Kate stands.  Straightens tablecloths on the few booths and 
      tables.  Peggy watches her.

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    Were you dreaming about Daddy?

                                  KATE
                          (beat)
                    ...I don't remember my dreams.

      Peggy nods.  Notices her mother glancing at a wedding photo 
      on the wall, amid framed family photos.  The largest is on 
      the day of Kate's wedding to Michael; Peggy's father.  Kate 
      and Michael dance. HOLD.

                                                              CUT TO:


      An illicit nightspot, in MUSKEET.  This is a smoky, carnal 
      place of blatant joys.  A sordid crowd fills the nightclub's 
      chairs, booths.  Laughing maniacally.  Arguing.  Groping.  
      Drugs and sadism seep from the crowd's pin-prick stares.

      Live music peels the place alive.  Dancers are shoehorned 
      into the tiny square of open floor, bodies grinding.

      THE BAND

      An impatient beast.  The trumpet hornets ugly; angry.  The 
      lead singer wails like he's been knifed.

                                  LEAD SINGER
                    "Hurt me!  Bruise me!  Squeeze me 
                    tight.  Scorch my blood with hot 
                    DELIGHT.  Please abuse me every 
                    NIGHT!  Lover, sister, mother, be a 
                    beast to me!"

      The band is a frenzy.  Sax snorting, drums athrob: Bangity 
      Boom Crash Smash POW.

      THE CROWD

      Out of control; a sweating, gyrating thing.  The song builds 
      to a nervous breakdown climax.  Finally ends.  The crowd 
      explodes; dissipated hyenas.  Many look diseased; survivors 
      of bad things, despite hip threads.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    3.



      STAGE

      The curtains suddenly whip shut.  A lurid M.C. appears.  
      Wordy, decayed.

                                  M.C.
                    Put your insincere hands together 
                    for the house band, folks.  Nice 
                    job, guys.  Incoherent and 
                    pointless as always.

      He sips a drink, grins vulgar effusion.  The mood in the 
      place festers.

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                    For those of you who just came-to, 
                    welcome to the DOOM ROOM, boys and 
                      girls...and whatever else is 
                    sitting out there lying to itself. 
                    Our next show is top notch, Kabuki *
                      skin-crawl...but I hasten to add: 
                    what you'll see here, though  *
                    shocking, is not just some jaded 
                      exhibition.  It is based in...
                          (grandly)
                      ...science.

      OVER we HEAR loud motorcycles...

                                                              CUT TO:

      TWO BATTERED MOTORCYCLES-DAY44

      Roaring up a mostly deserted city street.  Toward a couple in 
      their 70's who walk: STEVEN and QUINN.  The motorcycles cut 
      them off, block their paths.  The riders wear filthy 
      leathers, dark goggles.  They are: BOXX and JAK.  20.  23.  
      They lift goggles.  BOXX holds a gun on them.  The couple is 
      scared.

                                  STEVE
                    What do you want?

                                  BOXX
                    Whattya got?

                                  STEVE
                    Leave us alone.






                                                                              (CONTINUED)                "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    4.



                                  BOXX
                    Can't do that.  We're the Youth of 
                    America endeavoring, against 
                      insurmountable odds, to eke out a 
                    living.
                          (pokes Steve sadistically)
                    Eke, eke, eke!

      Boxx laughs.  Jak hates it when he gets like this.

                                  JAK
                    Lets get on with it, man.
                          (to them)
                    Which one of you is the oldest?

      Jak reaches into his leather jacket, withdrawing something.  
      They don't want to answer, fearing what comes next.

                                  BOXX
                          (to her)
                    He asked you a fuckin question, 
                      "Wrinkles".

      Now she knows what they want.

                                  QUINN
                    I'm older.

                                  BOXX
                    Really?  Nasty.
                          (stares at her)
                    You re lying.

      He s right: her lying eyes betray her. She was trying to 
      protect Steve. Boxx grabs her.  Holds a gun on Steve.  Jak 
      holds up the syringe withdrawn from his own leather jacket.  
      Quinn dreads what comes next.  Struggles.  Boxx holds her 
      tighter.

                                  JAK
                    Stay.  Still.

                                  STEVE
                    What are you giving her?!

      Jak sticks Quinn with the needle.  She screams.  Boxx sighs, 
      annoyed by her.

                                  BOXX
                    Hey, "Wrinks" we're working here, 
                    okay?  These are our fuckin office 
                    hours.  Wanna hold it down?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    5.



      Steve tries to get Boxx's gun.  Boxx hits him with the butt.  
      Steve collapses to the ground.  Quinn watches; helpless.  
      Jak's look stops Boxx from hurting Steve.

                                  JAK
                    Just red.  That's all we want

      He's almost done withdrawing a syringeful of it.  Pulls the 
      needle.  Places Quinn's finger over the punctured vein.

                                  JAK (CONT'D)
                    It'll heal.

      She moves to help her husband.

                                  QUINN
                    I hope you animals die.

      Jak thinks that over.  A serious answer:

                                  JAK
                    ...that'd be nice.

      Quinn just looks at him. They get on their bikes, ROAR off.  
      Steve embraces his shaken wife.  HOLD.  OVER we HEAR a radio 
      broadcast

                                  RADIO BROADCAST (V.O.)

                    Should burn it to the ground.

                                  PEGGY
                    People live there, Mother.

                                  KATE
                    Not people.  Monsters. Anyone 
                    stupid enough to go there is asking 
                    for it.

      Peggy changes subject.

                                  PEGGY
                    Tell me, again, how it was with 
                    Daddy.

      Kate shoots her a look.  Plays along; their ritual.

                                  KATE
                    Again?  You must be tired of it by 
                    now.
                          (off Peggy's look)
                    He was handsome.  He adored you

                    I wasn't born yet when he went off 
                    to fight.  Only Anna was.

                    He knew your soul.  The sweet girl 
                    you'd be.

                                  PEGGY
                    He sang to me when I was inside

      Peggy always loves that.  She and Kate exchange small, 
      melancholic smiles.  



      OMIT66




      DINER FRONT DOOR77

      Someone is about to enter: a 40-ish woman, GERRI, face 
      covered by a black shroud.  Kate notices and moves toward 
      her.

      KATE AND GERRI

      Kate blocks her entry.

                                  GERRI
                    ...Kate.  It's Gerri.  Please.  I'm 
                    hungry.

      Kate considers for a moment.  Directs her out.  Whispers 
      harshly so diners who have entered don't notice.

                                  KATE
                    Customers don't want to see you.  
                    Stay away.

      Gerri looks at Kate, devastated.

      PEGGY

      Sees this.


      Kate looks up as Peggy re-joins her at the grill.

                                  KATE
                    Where'd you go?

                                  PEGGY
                    Get some air.

      Kate doesn't question it.  In b.g., Boxx and Jak enter with 
      two streetwise girls, CELIA and MIA.  19.  20.  All are 
      hungry, loud, edgy.  The slide into a booth.  Celia grabs at 
      Boxx sexually.  Mia hangs all over Jak.

      PEGGY

      Approaches them, warily, menus in hand.

      ALL

      Boxx eyes her lustfully.  She distributes menus.

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    Bring you anything while you 
                    decide?

                                  BOXX
                      Yeeessss....how are 
                      your...lubricants prepared?

      The girls hiss lewdly.  Jak glances up at her.  Noticing her 
      for the first time.  He realizes how attractive and 
      vulnerably sweet she is.  How attracted he is to her.

      Peggy can't escape his stare, instantly drawn to him.  She 
      tries to hide it.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    9.



                                  JAK
                    Coffee.  Black.  Four.  We'll try 
                    and hold it down.

      Celia grabs Boxx's crotch.

                                  CELIA
                    You can try and hold it down.  But 
                    it'll win.

      She bursts into loud, obnoxious, lascivious laughter.  Boxx 
      cracks up.  Jak still takes-in Peggy.  She tries to not be 
      distracted by him.  Mia is sensing Jak's growing disinterest 
      in her.

                                  PEGGY
                    Special today is burgers.  And the 
                    pie is fresh.

                                  BOXX
                    Pie?  Does it come with a kitty and 
                    a grandma we can tor-ture?

                                  MIA
                          (quickly)
                    We don't eat pie.  We fucking 
                    despise pie.  We want meat.  Big, 
                    nasty pieces of meat.  Right Celia?

                                  CELIA
                          (nasty)
                    Bigger the better.

                                  PEGGY
                    Like I said the burgers...

                                  JAK
                          (ordering for all)
                    ...all around.  The works.

                                  PEGGY
                    I'll get your coffees, put in the 
                    order.

      Boxx stops her, grabbing her wrist.  It scares her.

      KATE

      In the back, sees this.

      RESUME ALL

      Boxx grins up at her; lethal charm.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    10.



                                  BOXX
                    And we're gonna need a coupla 
                    pounds of ice, angel.
                          (dead eyes)
                    Crushed.

                                  PEGGY
                          (beat)
                    Sure.

      She moves off.  Celia and Boxx grope each other.  Mia leans 
      head on Jak who is losing more interest in her.  He's 
      watching Peggy.

                                  BOXX
                    We gotta get there, Jak.  They're 
                    gonna be waiting.  They'll buy from 
                    someone else.

                                  JAK
                    It'll hold.  We get ice...it'll 
                    hold.
                          (beat)
                    Gotta take a piss.

      He gets out of the booth.  Goes into the bathroom.

                                                              CUT TO:


      The two men pour gasoline on the bodies.  Light them.  Shut 
      the dumpster top; a huge, steel casket.

      CORPSES - CLOSE

      Writhe in the heat.  Hair shrivelling, eyes cooked, facial 
      skin melted to reveal ghoulish death grins.  Their fingers 
      curl.  Their bodies bend, pushing up against the closed lid, 
      pressing it open a little.


      Peggy inconspicuously tracks where Jak is.  Afraid he might 
      have left.  She grabs coffee cups, coffee pot.

      JAK

      Exits the bathroom.  Instead of going back to the booth, he 
      moves to the pie display case.  Looks inside.  ADJUST to 
      Peggy who pours the coffees.  His intense, handsome presence 
      slightly overwhelms her.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    12.



                                  JAK
                    Make these?
                          (off her look)
                    The pies.

                                  PEGGY
                    My Mother made them.  Pie isn't 
                    very popular at your table.

                                  JAK
                    My friends are malcontents.

                                  PEGGY
                    Pain transforms the sensitive into 
                    cynics.
                            (self-conscious)
                    I...read that somewhere.

                                  JAK
                    What's your name?

      She's afraid.  Attracted.

                                  PEGGY
                    Peggy.

                                  JAK
                    You ever get outta here?  You know, 
                    you ever go anywhere?  Is this 
                    your... existential moat?  Your 
                    Ark?

                                  PEGGY
                    No.

                                  JAK
                    How old are you?

                                  PEGGY
                    Almost sixteen.

                                  JAK
                    Got a boyfriend?
                          (off no answer)
                    Don't you wanna see the world.

                                  PEGGY
                    My mother says there isn't much 
                    left of the world.

                                  JAK
                    Plenty left if you know where to 
                    go.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    13.



      Peggy can see Kate glaring.

                                  JAK (CONT'D)
                    That her?

                                  PEGGY
                    I don't think my mother likes you 
                    and your friends in here.

                                  JAK
                          (beat)
                    You're pretty.  Everybody tell you 
                    that?

      She doesn't answer.  Face reddening.  He likes her reaction 
      to him.

                                  JAK (CONT'D)
                    Y'know, I might be in the 
                      neighborhood tonight.  I don't 
                    sleep a lot.  My mind kinda has a 
                    mind of it's own.

                                  PEGGY
                    Yeah?

                                  JAK
                    Yeah.  I go out around midnight, 
                    take-in the devastation.
                          (a look)
                    Maybe I'll run into you, Peggy.

      She looks into his eyes.  He seems for real; his half-smile  
      irresistible.

                                  PEGGY
                    You have a girlfriend.

                                  JAK
                    Her?  She's just...something to 
                    scribble on.
                          (touches her cheek)
                    You're something I haven't seen in 
                    a long time.

      He takes the tray of four coffees from her.  Walks to the 
      booth.  Peggy is floored.  Jak is the most exciting thing 
      she's ever laid eyes on.

      Kate is immediately beside her.

                                  KATE
                    What did he want?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    14.



                                  PEGGY
                    Just wanted to talk.

                                  KATE
                    About what?

                                  PEGGY
                    Pie.

      Kate sees Boxx and Celia groping.  Her contempt for this 
      group is obvious.

                                  KATE
                    Look at them.  No respect for 
                    anything.

                                  PEGGY
                    They just want something to eat.  
                    Like everybody else.
                          (beat)
                    He was nice.

      Kate reacts to that.  Goes into immediate protection of her 
      daughter; walks to their booth.

      KATE

      Standing over them.  Icy:

                                  KATE
                    We're closing early.  No charge for 
                    the coffee.

                                  BOXX
                    We didn't get our burgers.

                                  CELIA
                    We want our food.

                                  KATE
                    Sorry.

                                  BOXX
                    You're not sorry.

                                  KATE
                    I want you all out of here.

                                  BOXX
                    What's eating you?

                                  MIA
                    She's a bitch.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    15.



                                  CELIA
                    Cunt.

                                  JAK
                    Shut-up, Celia.  We don't eat where 
                    we aren't welcome.

                                  BOXX
                    Hey "Bitch-Cunt", that your 
                    daughter?

                                  JAK
                    Shut-up, man.

                                  BOXX
                          (off Kate's silence)
                    I feel sorry for her.
                          (gets in her face)
                    There's something ugly inside of 
                    you and it wants out.  I wouldn't 
                    want to be in the way when it 
                    starts hissing.

      He makes a fast, threatening HISS sound and Kate reacts.  
      Boxx laughs malefic glee.  The group leaves.  Boxx and the 
      girls kick chairs, slam the door.  Jak leaves with a last 
      glance to Peggy.

      PEGGY

      Approaches her mother.

                                  KATE
                    They were from MUSKEET.  I could 
                    smell it on them.

                                  PEGGY
                    They weren't hurting anyone, 
                    Mother.

                                  KATE
                    Don't defend them.  They came to 
                    exploit us.  To exploit you.

                                  PEGGY
                    He was being friendly.

                                  KATE
                    It's a trick.  Everything people in 
                    MUSKEET do is a goddamned trick!
                          (beat)
                    I'm not going to lose another 
                    daughter.

      Peggy cleans-up their table; cups, ashtrays.  Finally:

                                  PEGGY
                    I have to grow-up sometime.

                                  KATE
                    You have to make your father and 
                    sister proud... be what they 
                    couldn't since the world murdered 
                    them.

                                  PEGGY
                    I can't be them, Mother.  I'm just 
                    me.

                                  KATE
                    No.  You aren't.  You're the future 
                    of our family.  All we have left.

      Peggy nods.  But the burdens her mother has placed on her are 
      heavy.  She hears motorcycles kick-start outside the diner.  
      Moves to the window of the diner and sees


      JAK AND BOXX1414

      Ready to go.  Mia and Celia on the back of each bike.  Jak 
      takes a last look back at Peggy.


      PEGGY1515

      Reacts to him.  Craving relief from the world that traps her.

                      sensation, but a bona-fide 
                      scientific demon-stration.  Not for 
                    the faint of heart...nor the weak 
                    of will.  Let me caution those of 
                    you whose nerves are not what they 
                    used to be...

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      In b.g. we notice Boxx and Jak enter the seedy club.  Waved 
      in by TWO LARGE DOORMEN: the same men we saw dump the girl's 
      corpses from the van.  Boxx and Jak make eye-contact with the  
      M.C. He manages a slight nod.

                                  M.C.
                          (checks watch)
                    Tick, tick, tick. Buckle in, 
                      buckaroos.  The show is so close 
                    it's crawling-up your you-know-
                    what.

      The M.C. leaves the stage. Gestures Boxx and Jak to follow 
      him into the back room of the DOOM ROOM.  OVER we HEAR a 
      clock ticking...

                                                              CUT TO:

        INSERT-CLOCK

      11:45 P.M.


      In her sad little room in the house she and Kate share.  She 
      sits at her desk.  Doing homework.  Watching the clock.  She 
      sighs.  Trying to concentrate.  In the other room, she can 
      HEAR her Mother snoring.

      Peggy finally closes the book.  Tormented by the decision.  
      Walks to her closet.  Opens it.  Stares unhappily at the few 
      clothes she has; all dull.  She glances, again, at the clock.  
      There is not much time left.  She sits at her desk, begins to 
      write a note.  Glances up at

      WALL  PHOTOS

      Of her sister Anna and father Michael; both long gone.  Her 
      finger traces a frame.

      PEGGY

      Guilt crosses her features.

                                                              CUT TO:



      She scans the shadows, mouth dry.

                                  JAK (V.O.)
                    ...pie this good, you're just 
                    asking for trouble, angel.

      A light goes on.  Jak stands there, smoking.  Gesturing to 
      the refrigerator case of pies.  She's a bit shocked.

                                  PEGGY
                    ...what are you doing in here?

                                  JAK
                      ...short-circuiting tragedy.  World 
                    has big teeth, eats girls like you 
                    for kicks if somebody doesn't look 
                    out for em.

      She doesn't understand.

                                  PEGGY
                          (sarcastic)
                    And you came to fix it?

                                  JAK
                    I came for the pie.

      He makes her feel self-conscious and at ease, all at once.

                                  PEGGY
                    You can't be in here.  We're 
                    closed.

      He looks at her in the dim light from the street.

                                  JAK
                    Maybe you just look that way.

      She's dressed a way she hopes he'll like.  A little more 
      grown-up.  But her awkwardness and insecurity shine through.  
      She's obviously never done anything like this; virginal in 
      all ways.

                                  PEGGY
                    You never told me your name.

                                  JAK
                    Jak.  No "C".

      She tries to be light; covering her nerves.  He moves closer 
      to her.  She backs away, fighting her attraction.

                                  PEGGY
                      Well...where did it go?  You have 
                    to have a "C".  What'll you do if 
                    you have to say "CAT" or 
                      "CALIFORNIA"?

                                  JAK
                    There is no more California.  
                    Didn't you hear?

                                  PEGGY
                    I heard.

      There's chemistry to burn between them.

                                  JAK
                    Come here.

      She isn't sure.  He's soft; hypnotic.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    20.



                                  JAK (CONT'D)
                    I'm not gonna hurt you.  Come here.

      She finally, slowly moves closer to him.  Stands right in 
      front of him.  She has never been this close to a man in her 
      life.  Tries not to show it.

      Jak looks into her sweet eyes.  Slowly reaches a hand toward 
      her face.

      Her lipstick is a tiny bit off on lower lip.  He makes it 
      right with a gentle fingertip.  Peggy can't believe he 
      touched her; it felt deeply intimate.

                                  PEGGY
                    It's my sister, Anna's.  I don't 
                    usually wear lipstick.

      He smiles a little.  She tries to act comfortable.

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    So...do you always come out after 
                    dark?

                                  JAK
                    You gotta come after it.  Or it'll 
                    come after you.

                                  PEGGY
                    I like that.
                          (beat)
                    So...what do you do?  There's 
                    nothing to do.

                                  JAK
                    Your mother tell you that?

                                  PEGGY
                    I've heard it around.

      He studies her.

                                  JAK
                    You don't even know what around is, 
                    do you?

      He's scaring her a little.

                                  PEGGY
                    Not exactly.

      It's hard to read what he's thinking.  She's afraid it's the 
      worst.

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    Did you tell me you'd be around 
                    tonight so I'd come and you could 
                    hurt me?

                                  JAK
                    Maybe I hoped you'd come to take 
                    away my hurt.

      She likes that.

                                  PEGGY
                    They say everybody gets what they 
                    deserve.

                                  JAK
                    Let's hope they're right.

      Suddenly, from outside, a car's headlights swerve wildly 
      toward the diner; toward them.  LOUD MUSIC pouring from 
      speakers.  Jak doesn't move; calmly lights a cigarette.  
      Peggy is scared.


      THE HEADLIGHTS2020

      Bore closer, headed right for the diner.


      PEGGY AND JAK2121

      She's ready to jump away.  Jak grabs her hand.  Holds it 
      tightly.

      ADJUST as the headlights and attached MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE do 
      a brody, stop dead perfect in front of the diner, tires 
      smoking.  Jak takes her hand.  Leads her outside.


      Boxx drives, snapping around tilted curves.  Pounding hands 
      on steering wheel to the beat.  Celia squeals, excitedly.  
      Boxx grows instantly serious; talks like a stiff, 
        informative, baritone academic:

                                  BOXX
                      "STRUGGLE."  Verb.  Act of 
                      promiscuous loveplay; usage evolved 
                    during W.W. III."
                          (his voice)
                      Personally recommended.

      He drives even faster.  Headlights spread frantic, buttery 
      yellow over highway.  He shares a bottle of oddly-colored 
      liquid with Celia.  He swigs.  She swigs.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    24.



      He turns up the percussive music; a pervasive throb.

                                  BOXX (CONT'D)
                    You can have your walking under 
                    MOONLIGHT BEAMS!  At a hundred 
                    miles an hour, let me DREAM my 
                    fuckin DREAMS!

      Celia SCREAMS giddily.  The wind buffets their hair, whipping 
      it into crazed, Medusa-mode.

      Jak and Peggy are in the back seat.  Boxx suddenly speeds 
      around a tight corner.  The turn makes Peggy slide closer to 
      Jak.  He drapes an arm around her.  She is scared, thrilled 
      to be with him.

                                                              CUT TO:


      The M.C. is in his office, shirt open, shiny jacket draped 
      over a chair.  He leans in close to a naked young woman who 
      lays on his couch.  Her eyes are shut, her body  beautiful.

      He scans it with empty eyes; a sociopath's feast.  Runs his 
      hand over her breasts and nipples.  Gently drifts fingers 
      over her perfect belly.  Feels between her legs.  Almost 
      smiles.

      He grabs a syringe with needle.  It's filled with something 
      amber.  He injects her and she stirs a bit.  He talks softly, 
        seductively.

                                  M.C.
                      ...yeahhh.  Feels good, doesn't it?

      He stokes her face as she trembles.  She begins to make the 
      HUMMING noise and he gently places his hand over her mouth.

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                      ...shhhhh.

      He watches her as she writhes a bit.  Touches her.

                                                              CUT TO:

      HEADLIGHTS2727

      Spurt ahead, yellow glowing, as the Mustang snarls through 
      night; a bullet skimming earth.              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    25.




      They suddenly hit a dip.  Their young bodies are jolted and 
      all four laugh crazily.  Boxx and Celia seem to be getting 
      high.  Boxx holds up a drug-intake device; like an asthma 
      puffer.

                                  BOXX
                    Snacks, anyone?

      Box passes Jak and Peggy  the drug device.  Jak takes it.  
      Peggy is unsure.

                                  PEGGY
                    ...what is it?

                                  BOXX
                    It's what's inside your head, 
                    angel.  Lets it come out and play.

      Jak takes a hit into his mouth.  Leans in to kiss Peggy.  
      Gently blows it into her soft mouth as their lips touch.

      PEGGY

      Breathes in the drug mist.  Reacts to the kiss.  And the 
      mist.  Slowly falls into a spell.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

      PEGGY'S POV2929

      Drugged; dizzied.  The car careens insanely, Celia and Boxx 
      are crazed distortions, cartoon-like; distended, crayon-
      colored.  Peggy's hand seems to meld into Jak's.  City lights 
      splinter and prism; form words, shapes.

      The highway, itself, seems half-alive, its charscape rising-
      up like a snarling boa.


      PEGGY3030

      Her eyes close, her heads leans.  She's out.  The drums of 
      the car's music pound like headhunter be-bop.  Gradually, 
      improbably, the sounds are replaced by the innocent laughter 
      of little children.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    26.




      Kate runs inside with her two daughters. Locks the door and 
      watches Gerri and Mariel through the window.

                    It'll kill us if we get near it!


      Peggy is scared.  Realizes where they're headed.

                    I want to go home, Jak.

                    There isn't one anymore.

      JAK

      Leans over to her as the drug hits him.  Kisses her hard, his 
      hands going up under her top.  She doesn't want that right 
      now.  But his kisses take her away.  She's quickly lost in 
      him.  ADJUST to see Boxx watching them in the rearview.  He

      Speeds toward MUSKEET; dark, sordid country.  OVER we HEAR a 
      woman's erratic breathing.

      Kate sits upright from a nightmare.  She looks at the photo 
      of Michael on the wall.  Tries to recover from what the 
      nightmare must have been.

      Looks at the bedside clock.

        INSERT-CLOCK

      12:38 A.M.

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                    ...Peggy?

      KATE

      Searches Peggy's room.  Then, their small apartment.  Finally 
      finds a note on the front door.

      NOTE

        Handwritten.  It reads.  "Couldn't sleep.  Went for a walk.  
      I'm fine.  Don't worry."


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    32.



      KATE

      Betrayal tightens her features.

                          (SCREAMS)
                    They got to you!!

      She quickly puts on clothing, coat, boots.  Grabs car keys  
      and a knife.  Heads out the front door, slamming it shut 
      behind herself.



      Kate is worried sick.  She's nervous, flips on the radio.  
      Watching the road. The dash clock reads: 12:47

                                  RADIO BROADCAST

                      phenomenon which has horrified and

      She turns it off.  Oncoming headlights bleach her face.

        CLOSE-CIGARETTE LIGHTER

      Glowing orange and round.  It lights a cigarette.

      As the convertible guzzles highway at 100 MPH, Boxx and Celia  
      laugh, smoke, play with the windshield wipers.  She tries to 
      burn him with the cigarette lighter.  He writhes around to 
      avoid her and they both laugh uncontrollably.

      Within seconds they pass a road sign


      SIGN4242

      It reads: ENTERING "MUSKEET"


      They all realize they are somewhere awful; dangerous.

      resist him.

      She drives fast, a broken world awash in her headlights.  
      Other headlights shine in her face.  Her fears for Peggy fill 
      her scared eyes.  She grips the wheel tightly.

                                                              CUT TO:


      Bedlam.  The house band in full tantrum; trumpets, drums and 
      guitars electrocuting the room.  The dancers jump and flip, 
      expressions crazed, wasted on everything nasty.  In the 
      corner of the bar, the M.C. hits on a needle-whore.

      The house band suddenly finishes their frenetic tune.  The 
      crowd SHRIEKS; in adrenal madness

      ON STAGE

      The red curtains close.  Sliding out is the gloom-glitz M.C.

                                  M.C.
                    That was our house band, folks.  
                    Let 'em know you care by putting 
                    your hands together...like you're 
                    swatting something small and 
                    helpless.

                    and almost ready to be eaten kids.  
                    Hungry?

      The place erupts.  He chuckles, laughs loudly; an ugly sight.  
      Then, berates them; yelling accusatively:

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                    SHUT UP!

                          (talks incredibly fast)
                    In 2008 a clause in the postwar law 
                    allowed the L.U.P. performance if 
                    it was orally prefaced as an 
                      exposition of science.  Hence my 
                    "oral preface"..
                          (suggestively)
                    ...wanna see it, again?

      BOXX, JAK, CELIA, PEGGY

      Take a seat at a table near the stage.  Boxx carries a 
      package that drips.  The M.C. notices them; acts like he 
      doesn t know them:

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)

                    Your ass.

      The M.C. looks like he could kill Boxx beneath the slash of 
      smile.

                                  M.C.
                    You're funny.

                    It'll destroy your life, trust me.
                    Enjoy the show.

      The M.C. leaves the stage. He nods Jak and Boxx toward his 
      back room.

                    for a minute.  Be right back.

      She notices Boxx carries a package that drips.  Something 
      inside is on ice.

      Looks away.  Doesn't like it here.



      The M.C. dabs at his make-up in a lighted mirror, looking at 
      their reflections. Now that we can see him in actual two-way 
      conversation, he's a meth-lizard with tics.  And a verbose 
      bully.

                    I would differ.  It was one step up

      TABLE6060

      They return to where the girls are.  Two POMADE CREEPS are 
      hitting on the girls, cheap smoke curling over pocked faces.  
      Scanning the girl's curves with unblinking, bloodshot eyes.

      One creep touches Peggy, through she tries to push him away.  
      His grimy fingers snake into her clothes; grabbing her 
      breasts, jamming into her pants.  His black teeth grin.

                                  POMADE CREEP
                    You like that, don't you?

      Suddenly, he's pulled from her, turned.  His fingers are bent 
      back, broken.  ADJUST to see Jak.

                    So leave, fuckhead.

      Jak snaps his fingers.  The guy yelps, whimpers away.  His 
      friend gets vindictive, throws a punch at Jak.  Jak dodges 
      it, breaks the guy's nose like a bony tomato.  The Creep 
      grabs it, covers it with a napkin.  Pulls it away, looks at 
      the blood.

      The Creep knows better than to mess with Jak.  Slinks away 
      into the crowd at the bar.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    42.



      Jak sits with the girls.  So does Boxx.

      JAK AND PEGGY

      She looks at his hand.

                                  PEGGY
                    You okay?

                                  JAK
                    Fine.

                                  PEGGY
                    I don't like it here.  It scares 
                    me.

                                  JAK
                    You re with me.  Just watch.  We 
                    gotta stay through the show.

      CROWD

      Is apprehensive.

      A GAUNT WAITRESS

      Moves with speedy annoyance to Jak, Boxx and the girls.



                                  BOXX
                    Orange Swamps.  Straight up.  All 
                    around.

      The waitress nods, vanishes into the smoky, swirling mania of 
      the club.

      CELIA

      Watches with blase aplomb.  Suddenly erupts with impatience:

                                  CELIA
                    Been waiting long enough!  When 
                    does this goddamned wound OPEN?!!

      No one even notices.


      The crowd is beyond restless.  Suddenly

      THE M.C.

      Is back on stage, slipping through the slash in the closed 
      curtains.  Sucking on a smoke.  His shiny blue jacket does a 
      trout shimmer.  His eyes move over the crowd like flicks of 
      doom.

                                  M.C.
                    Well, well, well...all ghastly 
                    things come to those who wait.  The 
                    time has come.  Who's ready for the 
                    show?

      The place explodes with SCREAMS, HOOTS, APPLAUSE.

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                    Who wants to behold the miraculous 
                    and obscene phenomenon of our 
                    times?  Hands?

      The crowd goes nuts.

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                    Who wants to see the L.U.P.?

      The crowd is nearly out of control.

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                    Say it with me!  "We wanna see the 
                    L.U.P"!!!

      The crowd says it back.  A lunatic CHANT builds louder and 
      louder, faster and faster.

      CROWD

      Chanting.  Fingers stabbing with emphasis.

                                  CROWD
                    "WE WANNA SEE THE L.U.P."

      ALL

      Riveted.  The drinks have arrived at the table, via the 
      waitresses arm: a disembodied THUD.  Boxx gurgles his green 
      drink thirstily.  Jak takes a drink.  Celia downs hers.  
      Peggy sips.  Boxx nudges her, excitedly.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    44.



                                  BOXX
                      CHUGGALUG!

      PEGGY

      Looks down at her drink.

      ORANGE SWAMP

      A murky, orange stew.  Chipped ice bobs.



      PEGGY

      Forces herself to take a sip and chokes on the drink, 
      spraying her top with orange swamp droplets.  Flaming liquid 
      trickles into her stomach.  She blinks, dizzily.  Heart 
      racing.

                                  M.C.
                    Ladies and gentlemen!  Brace your-
                    selves!  The L.U.P. Phenomenon is 
                    here tonight, riggghhht now!

      He gestures to the curtains.  Yells it out:

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                    The Loopys are in the HOUSE!

      Suddenly, the lights come down.  The band's music begins, 
      raping the air with saxophone, a menace of trombone; a 
      moaning brassiness.  The club is sweat, smoke, darkness.

      PEGGY

      Grabs her drink.  Swallows more.  Numbing herself.

                                  PEGGY
                      Please...can we leave?  Jak?

                                  JAK
                    After.  Just watch.

      She dare not lift her gaze to the purpled silence of the 
      stage, three feet away.

      ALL

      Wait.  A restless murmur fills the room; the nightclub a 
      wordless crypt.  Cobwebs of smoke drift in the purple light 
      across the stage.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    45.



      SUDDENLY the red curtains open with such a rush, the crowd 
      gasps.  The band explodes shrapnel music.  The stagelights 
      blind.  The CROWD react in shock to what they see.

      PEGGY

      Looks up in horror to where it stands.

      THE LOOPY

      It had been a woman.  Her hair is black, a framing of snarled 
      ebony for the tallow mask that was her face.  Her shadow-
      rimmed eyes are closed behind lids as smooth and white as 
      ivory.

      Her mouth, a lipless and unmoving line, is like a clotted 
      sword wound beneath her nose.

      Her throat, shoulders and arms are white.  Motionless.  At 
      her sides, protruding from sleeve ends of the green 
        transparency she wears, hang alabaster hands.

      ALL

      React.  Wordless.

      PEGGY

      Almost paralyzed with horror.  The DRUMBEATS, in the air, 
      seem to fill her body; alter her heartbeat.

                                  M.C. (V.O.)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen this freak of 
                      physiological abnormality was 
                      discovered during the war when, 
                    following certain chemical attacks, 
                    many of the dead troops were found 
                      erect...performing the spasmodic 
                    gyrations which later became 
                      affection-ately known as the 
                    "Loopy's" dance.  Some of them even 
                    continued fighting.  That, my 
                    friends, is fuckin patriot-ism.

      THE LOOPY

      Still stands, motionless.  The thing that was a nameless 
      victim of the plague stands palely rigid, amid the dramatic 
      cadence of the drum, while the distillation sluices through 
      its veins.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    46.



                                  M.C. (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    The particular chemical responsible 
                    was later distilled and is now used 
                    in carefully controlled experiments 
                    which are conducted under the 
                      strict-est of legal supervision.
                          (dark chuckle)
                      Well...almost.  Ladies and 
                      gentlemen, I give you: The Dance of 
                    The Dead...

      Now the drum throbs increase; a racing heartbeat.  The 
      Loopy's eyelid twitches.



      CROWD

      In sick thrall.

      PEGGY

      Rapt, gripped by the horror.  Eyes wide, unblinking circles 
      that suck, into her brain, the sight of the thing that had 
      been a woman.

      THE LOOPY

      Its pale eyes flutter open.  In b.g., the band releases brass-
      throated moaning from the darkness, like some deranged animal 
      made of welded horns.

      Without warning the right arm of the Loopy jerks at its side, 
      the tendons suddenly contracted.  The left arm twitches, 
      snaps out, falls back against thigh.

      Right arm out.  Left arm.  Right.  Left-right-left-
        right...like marionette arms, twitching on dangling strings.

      VARIOUS

      Reactions are fixated, horrified.

      DRUM BRUSHES

      Scratch out a rhythm for the convulsions.

      PEGGY

      Presses back further in her chair, numbed and cold.

      THE LOOPY



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    47.



      Its right foot moves now, jerking up inflexibly.  A second 
      and third contraction cause the leg to twitch as the left leg 
      flings-out in a violent spasm.

      It also makes a horrible HUMMING sound (the air exiting the 
      lungs).

      Then, the woman's body lurched stiffly forward, filming the 
      transparent silk to its light and shadow.  ADJUST to

      PEGGY

      Reacting as the flailing Loopy heads straight for her.  Peggy 
      gasps dizzily, pressing back in horror, unable to take her 
      eyes from its now agitated face.

      She watches the mouth jerk to a gaping cavity, then a twisted 
      scar that splits into a wound again.

      She sees the Loopy's dark nostrils twitching, its flesh 
      writhing beneath ivory cheeks.

      THE LOOPY

      One lifeless eye winks monstrously.  OVER we HEAR the gasp of 
      startled laughter in the room.

      THE BAND

      Grating noise.  QUICK PAN to the Loopy's arms and legs 
      jerking with convulsive cramps that throw her body around the 
      lighted stage like a full-sized ragdoll given spastic life.

      CROWD

      Shocked by the twisting, leaping dance.

      BOXX

      Enjoying every second.

                                  BOXX
                          (to Jak)
                    He'll pay.  She's on fuckin fire!

      THE LOOPY

      Dancing, more and more erratically.  Out of control.  As she 
      convulses and weaves off the stage, the curtain closes.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    48.



                                  M.C. (V.O.)
                    Well?  Did you enjoy our first 
                    dancer?!  Did it make you want to 
                    consider a career in...science?

      THE CROWD

      Voyeurs.  Scum.  Scattered chuckles.

      THE M.C.

      Smoking, drinking.  Eyes scanning the ugly faces.

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                    Just can't get enough of the 
                    L.U.P.s can you?  Nothing like a 
                    little Lifeless Undeath Phenomenon 
                    to liven up a dull fuckin' night in 
                    nowhere.
                          (beat)
                    Well, there's more icky, spasmodic 
                    surprises in store.
                          (beat)
                    Time to welcome our second dancer.  
                    A girl who just loves the 
                      limelight.  Make her feel welcome 
                    and maybe she'll return the empty 
                    gesture by dancing her jellied 
                    heart out...

      THE CURTAINS

      Open fast.  A second Loopy stands with back to the crowd.  
      Her blonde hair hangs.  Her outfit is suggestive.  She wears 
      false nails on leprous hands.  A single muscular tic slightly 
      trembles her exposed back.

      THE BAND

      Begins its slo-mo assault.

      PEGGY

      Trapped by the wailing, malignant beat.

      THE LOOPY

      Begins to jerk.  The paroxysmal twitching and warping 
      convulsion make it turn toward the crowd.

      PEGGY




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    49.



      Studies the Loopy.  Then comes dawning, traumatized recogni-
      tion and Peggy SCREAMS.  Points at the Loopy.  Jak is beside 
      Peggy.

                                  JAK
                    ...what is it?

                                  PEGGY
                    ...it's impossible!

      She SCREAMS more.  But her voice is buried in the crush of 
      music.

      THE LOOPY

      Staggers forward, muscular seizures causing a fitful walk.  
      It springs forward, lipsticked and false eye-lashed.  It's 
      dark mouth is clamped then gapes wide with spasm.  The 
      horrible HUMMING sound is emitted.

      PEGGY

      Shrieking out a name;  Impossible to HEAR in the deafening 
      club.  Jak doesn't know what's wrong with Peggy.

      In front of them, the Loopy spins, again, arms a blur of 
      flailing white.  Peggys eyes have filled with agonized tears.

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    It's her!  It's HER!

      The lurid bleaching of the Loopy's face is now looking at the 
      crowd, only three feet away from Peggy.

      It lurches and bumps into the waist-high stage rail, bending 
      over its top.  It's mask of lavender-rained whiteness hangs 
      above Peggy, its dark eyes twitching open into a hideous 
      stare.

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    ...Anna?

      The Loopy keeps jerking forward, driving itself against the 
      rail as though it meant to scale it.

      THE LOOPY

      With every spastic lurch at the railing, the diaphanous silk 
      flutters like a film about it's scarred, bruised body.  It 
      continues to collide with the railing, head bent down toward

      PEGGY



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    50.



      Who looks up at the rigid muteness of the Loopy.

      Then it happens.

      VARIOUS

      The Loopy doubles-over the rail and with a flinging-up of its 
      muscle-knotted legs, falls, twitching and flailing, onto 
      Peggy's table!  Drinks fly and it crashes down, its limbs a 
      thrash of naked whiteness.

      The band's music scatters; total dissonance.

      Peggy SCREAMS as the Loopy flops and twists on the table, 
      like a new caught fish, seeming to stare up at her with it's 
      lifeless eyes.

      Peggy can barely speak, mind submerged in shock.

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    ...Anna?

      The music finally stops, grinding into silence.

      CROWD

      A rush of agitated murmur.  The horror-smoked room watches 
      everything.

      PEGGY

      As the Loopy gyrates on their table, Peggy manages to form 
      words for Jak.

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    ...we have to get her out!  We have 
                    to get her out!  NOW!  She's my 
                    sister!

      Boxx has heard, too.

                                  BOXX
                    Really?  Well, fuck her.  I want my 
                    money.

      Jak just looks at Boxx.  It would've come to this.  Jak 
      decides to trust Peggy; help her.

                                  JAK
                          (to Boxx)
                    Gimme the gun.

      Boxx hesitates.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    51.



                                  BOXX
                    It's not her fuckin sister, Jak.  
                    She's wasted.  She's seeing shit.  
                    You'll die.  Nowhere to go.

                                  JAK
                    The gun.

      Boxx hands it to him.

      JAK AND PEGGY

      Grab the Loopy, the best way they can.  They move her through 
      the crowd.  Anyone who tries to stop them gets the gun in 
      their face.

                                  JAK (CONT'D)
                    Outta the way!  GET OUTTA THE 
                    FUCKING WAY!

      Jack and Peggy are having a hard time holding onto the Loopy 
      but finally get through the back exit door.


        ALLEYWAY6363

      They move as quickly as possible, carrying/dragging the 
      LOOPY.

                                  PEGGY
                    Where do we go?!

                                  JAK
                    I don't know!  Keep moving.

      They take a left, then a right.  The alleys are a bit of a 
      maze.  As they move, struggling with the Loopy, they suddenly 
      run into

      KATE

      In the alley, shocked to see them.  ADJUST to Peggy, 
      confused.

                                  PEGGY
                    ...what are you doing here?

                                  KATE
                      ...looking for you.

      Peggy bursts into tears.  Tries to hold onto the Loopy which 
      twitches and writhes.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    52.



                                  PEGGY
                    I found her, Mom!  I found Anna!

      Kate says nothing.  Footsteps near.  (NOTE: thoughout this 
      scene, the LOOPY is still writhing and twitching but getting 
        weaker...the chemical effect wearing off.  But it continues 
      to convulse, make horrible throat noises etc.)

      THE M.C.

      Moves to them quickly.  Armed Door Man with him.

      JAK

      Points the gun.  It doesn't stop the Door Man who moves to  
      get the Loopy.  Jak shoots him in the upper arm.  He folds in 
      pain.

      ALL

      The M.C. is sheer cool, cruel.  Grabs the Door Man's dropped 
      gun.

                                  M.C.
                    ...where are you going with my 
                    dancer, Jak?

                                  PEGGY
                    Your dancer?  She's my sister!  How 
                    the hell did she get here?!!  WHAT 
                    IS SHE DOING HERE?

                                  M.C.*
                    "Doing"?  Not much.  She's dead.  
                    In a freezer all day.  Brrrrr.  I 
                    take her out, I shoot her up, she 
                    dances, I sell some tickets, I pay 
                    the rent.
                          (holds gun on Peggy)
                    I'll take her, now.  She's mine.

      Jak points his cocked gun at him.

                                  M.C. (CONT'D)
                    Stay out of it, Jak.

                                  JAK
                    Too late.

      Peggy holds the Loopy closely; protectively.

                                  PEGGY
                    She's not your property!


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    53.



                                  M.C.
                    Really?  I paid for her.  Ask your 
                    Mommy.

      Kate says nothing.  Peggy's eyes shoot to her mother's.

                                  PEGGY
                    What's he talking about?!
                          (off Kate's silence)
                    WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?!!

                                  M.C.
                    Tell her.  It's a heartwarming 
                    story.

      Kate glares at him, hatefully.

                                  KATE
                          (to Peggy)
                    ...let's go before things get 
                    worse.  She's not alive.  Let him 
                    have her.

      Peggy can't believe what her mother is saying.

                                  PEGGY
                    What do you mean let him have 
                    her?!!

                                  M.C.
                    ...a story brimming with commitment 
                    and loyalty and a mother's undying 
                    love.

      Kate tries to lunge for him with her knife.  He overpowers 
      her, tosses the knife.  Hits her skull with the butt of his 
      gun.  Tosses her to the pavement.  Her head hits the hard 
      ground.  She's bleeding, badly.

                                  KATE
                          (to Jak, re: M.C.)
                    Shoot him!

      Peggy doesn't move.

                                  PEGGY
                    No.  I wanna hear the story.

      Kate is weak but glares at the M.C.  She knows the M.C. is *
      going to tell the story.

                                  KATE
                      ...please.  Don't.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    54.



                                  M.C.
                          (to Peggy)
                    Now, let's see...I think it went 
                    something like this: your mother 
                    got sick of coming to the Club 
                    every weekend to bring your sister 
                    home, when she was still 
                      alive...and fucked up.

                                  KATE
                    ...you sonofabitch!

                                  M.C.
                          (to Kate)
                    The night she O.D.'d you decided to 
                    just leave her with me.  No muss, 
                    no fuss.
                            ("casually")
                    And...as I recall she was still 
                    alive.

                                  KATE
                    STOP IT!

                                  M.C.
                    What did I pay for her, again?  I 
                    forget?  I usually just pay by the 
                    pound.  But she was a pretty girl.

      KATE

      SCREAMS pitifully with everything she has left in her.

      ALL

      Jak and Peggy hold the Loopy; weak in their grasp.  It 
      writhes, collapsing to the pavement beside Kate, face beside 
      her's.  Its eyes twitch.  It weakly makes the hideous HUMMING 
      noise.  Kate is bleeding, badly.  The Loopy's mouth opens and 
      closes, slowly.  Peggy kneels to her mother.  Betrayed.

                                  KATE
                          (weakly)
                    ...after Daddy died...we had 
                    nothing.  She was always in 
                    trouble.  Half dead.

                                  PEGGY
                    ...you sold her.

                                  KATE
                    ...we had nothing.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    55.



      Kate looks at Anna; the daughter she sold out.  No guilt.  
      Just resentment.  Peggy can see it.

      THE M.C.

      Looks at Peggy with soulless edict.

                                  M.C.
                    Hey, this has been festive and 
                    touching.  But I got a Club to run.  
                    Already got one show fucked.  You 
                    owe me.

                                  JAK
                    Fuck you.

      PEGGY

      Looks at her mother, getting weaker  Her sister, moving in 
      abrupt spasm.  Both helpless.  One dead.  The other dying.  
      Peggy's eyes go cold.

                                  PEGGY
                          (to M.C.)
                    I'll make it right.

                                                              CUT TO:


      He's on stage; a sequined ghoul.  He smokes, hair shining.  
      The house band, in b.g., idles with a carnal beat.

                                  M.C.
                    Think of us as your home away from 
                    home.  And tonight, we have 
                    something very, very special.  
                    Cover the kid's ears and drug the 
                    dog 'til he can't fight back, cuz 
                    our next dancer has a whole lotta 
                    shakin going on...and we don't want 
                    anyone getting hurt.  Proving that 
                    death is just an ugly rumor...and I 
                    do mean fuckin ugly...welcome our 
                    next dancer!

      The music carves-up the smoky place; primitive and dark.

      THE CURTAINS

      Open and the dancer faces away from the crowd.  As the band's  
      hypno-throb intensifies, she begins to twitch and her head 
      convulses to one side.  She starts to gyrate and finally 
      turns.

      It's Kate, dressed like a vulgar clown; too much make-up, 
      fake freckles, see-thru negligee.  Her eyes are dead and her 
      limbs shoot out in an uncontrollable dance of the dead.

      CROWD

      Laughing at this old, dead woman.

                                  CROWD
                    TITS, GRANDMA!  2)ISN'T IT TIME FOR 
                    YOUR NAP? 3)BRING OUT A YOUNG ONE!

      KATE

      Writhes under the lights, dead fingers clawing air, mouth 
      suddenly agape.  Garish make-up a humiliation.

      THE DRUMMER

      Accents all her moves.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    57.



      KATE

      Spasms and twists as the crowd insults her; throwing drinks, 
      lit cigarettes.

      THE BAND

      Plays faster and louder.

      STAGELIGHTS

        Autopsy-bright.

      KATE

      Stares into them, unblinking; a punished marionette.

      THE BAR

      Peggy is with Jak.  She watches her mother dance with amoral 
      closure.

                                                              FADE OUT

                                  THE END
