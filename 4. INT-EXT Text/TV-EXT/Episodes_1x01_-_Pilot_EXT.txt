Beverly is getting into the car.  Sean is at the door.

                                  SEAN
                Bev, I m sorry!

                                    BEVERLY
                      (caustic)
                Don t be.  It s Hollywood.  You re 
                just trying to fit in.

She pulls out into the street and starts to drive off.  In her 
fury, she s unaware that she s in the left hand lane.

                                  SEAN
                Stop!  You re on the wrong side!

                                    BEVERLY
                No, Sean, you re on the wrong side!

                                  SEAN
                That s not what --

But Beverly never hears the end of that sentence.  She peels 
off, oblivious.                                                                  12/28/09      4.



MATT LEBLANC is driving in his car.  He touches a button on 
the wheel. 

                                  COMPUTER VOICE
                  Automated Dialing.  Command.

                                  MATT 
                Call Bob.

                                  COMPUTER VOICE
                Repeat.

                                  MATT
                Call Bob!

                                  COMPUTER VOICE
                Dialing Mom.

                                  MATT
                No!  Not Mom!  Bob!  

There is sound of dialing and then a phone ringing.

                                  MATT
                Cancel.  Cancel!  Stop!!

Instead, Matt s mother answers.

                                  MOTHER S VOICE
                Hello?

Matt picks up the phone.

                                  MATT  
                      ( shit! )
                Hey, Mom.  ...  No reason, just wanted 
                to say hi.

He turns a corner and sees Beverly bearing down on him.

                                  MATT 
                What the fu--

Beverly sees him and her eyes go wide.  She hits the brakes, 
but to no avail.  It s a head-on collision.  Air bags deploy 
in both cars.  Beat.  FADE TO WHITE.

TITLE CARD:   SEVEN WEEKS AGO                                                                   12/28/09      5.



CLOSE ON a giant replica of the BAFTA mask.  PULL BACK and we 
are at the gala following the TV Awards.  Lots of folks in 
black tie celebrating; tears and alcohol flow.  Sean and 
Beverly sit at a table, each with an award in front of them.  
They look smashing.  A MAN approaches them.  He s a fellow 
  writer/producer, about their age.

                                  MAN
                You bloody bastards.  You ve done it 
                again.  
                      (re: second award)
                And again.  
                      (mimes strangling them)
                Stop doing it!

They all laugh.

                                  SEAN
                We re so sorry.

                                    BEVERLY
                We promise, never again.

                                  MAN
                That s what you said last year.  But 
                I m really pleased for you.

                                  BEVERLY/SEAN
                That s sweet.  Thank you.

As the man moves off:

                                    BEVERLY
                He s not pleased.

                                  SEAN
                Not at all.

                                    BEVERLY
                Well, I m happy for us.

                                  SEAN
                I m just happy.

They kiss.  It s maybe a touch too passionate for a public 
place, but they re both rather tipsy and no one s looking.  

                                    BEVERLY 
                How soon can we leave?                                                                  12/28/09      6.


                                  SEAN
                I don t know.  Have we made enough 
                people feel bad about themselves?

They spot a man heading toward them.

                                  SEAN
                My god.

                                    BEVERLY
                What?  Who s that?

                                  SEAN
                It s Merc Lapidus.

                                    BEVERLY
                Who?

                                  SEAN
                      (she should know)
                Merc Lapidus.

                                    BEVERLY
                  Repeating it doesn t help me.

                                  SEAN
                From America.  He s president of --

MERC reaches them.  He s in his 40 s, very attractive.  He has 
an expansive personality.  Charismatic.  Lots of energy.  
You d think it s fueled by cocaine, but it s just him.  
Really. 

                                  MERC
                Winners!  Forgive me, don t wanna 
                  interrupt.  Merc Lapidus.  I m the --

                                    BEVERLY
                Please, we know who you are.  

                                  SEAN
                Sean and Beverly --  

He goes to shake Merc s hand, but Merc throws his arms around 
him.  Sean gives Beverly a startled look over his shoulder.  

                                  MERC
                      (to Beverly)
                And you!  With the funny speech!

                                    BEVERLY
                Oh, that s not necess--

But he s already enveloped her in a massive hug.                                                                  12/28/09      7.


                                    BEVERLY
                All right.

                                  MERC
                You know what my fantasy is?

                                    BEVERLY
                I m going to guess either shoes or 
                nuns.  

Merc laughs.  Maybe too hard.

                                  MERC
                My fantasy is I wake up tomorrow and 
                I ve got your show on my network.

                                    BEVERLY
                Well, that s very flatter--

                                  MERC
                No no, I m not just blowing smoke 
                here.  I love your show.  Love it.  
                  Seriously.  I want to have sex with 
                your show.  I m telling you, an 
                American version?  Would be huge.  It 
                could be like  The Office  meets...

He searches.

                                  SEAN
                ...our show?

                                  MERC
                Yes!  But we d have to do it right.  
                No farming this one out.  I want 
                what s in these amazing, British-y 
                heads.

                                    BEVERLY
                What, us come to LA?

                                  SEAN
                That s interesting.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (an intent look)
                Is it?

                                  MERC
                Uh oh, she s giving you the wife look.
                      (off Beverly s reaction)
                Whoa, now she s giving me the wife 
                look.                                                                  12/28/09      8.


A waiter passes with a tray of desserts.  Merc stops him.

                                  MERC 
                Hello!
                      (takes a tart)
                Have you guys tried these?  What are 
                these little berries?  They re genius.  
                They re like magic berries.

                                    BEVERLY
                They re actually loganberries.

                                  MERC
                  loganberries!  Now I want to have sex 
                with your show and these berries.

                                    BEVERLY
                When I was a little girl, my 
                  grandmother lived in Yorkshire and she 
                had loganberries in her garden.  Every 
                summer we d pick the berries and she d 
                make us jam.

                                  MERC
                Fuck.  My grandmother lives in 
                  Morristown, New Jersey, and hates 
                black people.  
                      (then)
                So what do you say?  Come play with 
                us!  I need  Lyman s Boys !  I ve got 
                four places on my schedule I could put 
                it right now.

                                    BEVERLY
                This is very flattering.  And we ve 
                all had a lot to drink...

                                  MERC
                Not me.  Not in seven years.  I m an 
                  alcoholic.

                                    BEVERLY
                But evidently not anonymous.

                                  MERC
                C mon!  We ll get you a house, a car, 
                name it.  How hard would it be?  
                You ve already written the scripts.  
                You ll work twenty minutes a day, the 
                rest of the time, you can screw in the 
                pool.                                                                   12/28/09      9.


                                    BEVERLY
                  Actually, my brother drowned in a 
                pool.

                                  MERC
                Oh.

                                  SEAN
                She s joking.  She s joking.
                      (to Beverly, tight smile)
                What are you doing?

                                  MERC
                See?  Funny!
                      (then)
                Look, if you don t want to do it, 
                fine.  Hey, maybe you don t like 
                money.  But I had to ask.  When I had 
                cancer -- that s right -- I realized 
                two things.  If you want something, go 
                for it, God doesn t wait for you.  And 
                also, you do not want cancer.


It s a wonderful, old house that exudes character more than 
affluence.  Sean and Beverly get out of the cab huddled under 
one umbrella.  They discover an enormous, lavishly-wrapped 
basket of loganberries in front of their door.  

                                    BEVERLY
                Jesus.

                                  SEAN
                      (reading card)
                 Come taste our berries.  Your biggest 
                fan, Merc Lapidus.                                                                 12/28/09      10.


                                    BEVERLY
                How did he do this??  We left him less 
                than an hour ago.  

                                  SEAN
                I can t believe he even remembered 
                that stupid loganberry story.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (unsettled)
                I can t believe he knows where we live.


  Brilliant blue sky.  PAN DOWN past palm trees to find Sean and 
Beverly driving in a snazzy convertible.

                                  SEAN
                Now you have to admit.

                                    BEVERLY
                It is fairly glorious.                                                                12/28/09      12.


                                  SEAN
                Feel that sunshine!

                                    BEVERLY
                Of course --

                                  SEAN
                      (before she can say it)
                Don t say skin cancer.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (smaller)
                Just glorious.


Beverly and Sean pull up to the grand entrance and guard gate.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (impressed)
                Oh, my.  

                                  SEAN
                Welcome home, darling.

They drive up to the SECURITY GUARD in the booth.

                                  SEAN

                No?  Well, we should be there.  

                                  GATE GUARD
                Are they expecting you?

                                  SEAN
                No, there s no one expecting us.  It s 
                a house we re renting -- well, that s 
                been rented for us --                                                                 12/28/09      13.


                                    BEVERLY
                Wait, there s the housekeeper.  She 
                might be there.

                                  SEAN
                Yes.  
                      (consults paperwork)
                  Florinda.

                                  GATE GUARD
                One moment.

The guard dials the house.  Pause.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (dry)
                This is fun.

                                  GATE GUARD
                      (into phone)
                  I have...

                                  SEAN
                Sean and Beverly Lincoln.  

                                  GATE GUARD
                Sean and Beverly Lincoln here.
                      (beat; hangs up)
                She says they re not home right now.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (getting frustrated)
                Well, of course they re not home,  
                because they re us and we re stuck here 
                with you!

                                  GATE GUARD
                Ma am, there s no need to raise your 
                voice.

                                    BEVERLY
                Oh, really?  Get in the car, I ll be 
                you, and you ll see if that s true.

                                  SEAN
                        (reasonable; reads name tag)
                Look -- Wallace -- I know once we ve 
                moved in the three of us will all have 
                a good laugh about this.  But we ve 
                been traveling for fourteen hours and 
                we d just love to get into the house.  
                Isn t there some way you can let us do 
                that?                                                                12/28/09      14.


                                  GATE GUARD
                Not if you re not on the list.  How do 
                I know who you are?

                                    BEVERLY
                Oh, has it not come up?  We re Sean 
                and Beverly Lincoln!

                                  SEAN
                Really not helping.

                                    BEVERLY
                Really don t care.

                                  SEAN
                I m sure we re on the list.  May I see 
                it?

                                  GATE GUARD
                No one sees the list.

                                  SEAN
                No one sees the list?

                                  GATE GUARD
                We got high caliber celebrities living 
                here.  We have to protect their 
                privacy.

                                  SEAN
                Oh, for god s sake.  Wallace.  I 
                  appreciate the seriousness with which 
                you approach your job.  I do.  But I 
                just want to find our names.  I 
                promise you, I won t reveal any 
                  information about your precious gated 
                  community or the secret identities of 
                its gated citizens.  Now give me the 
                list.

The guard reluctantly hands Sean the list.

                                  SEAN
                Ooo, Renee Zellweger lives here.

Beverly is equally intrigued.


Sean and Beverly stand looking up at the house.  It s the one 
from the opening.  An enormous Mediterranean.    

                                    BEVERLY
                All this just for the two of us?                                                                 12/28/09      15.


                                  SEAN
                  Apparently so.

Beverly giggles.  Sean is dazzled as well.


CAROL RANSOM is ushering Sean and Beverly into her office.  
Carol s the head of Primetime Programing.  In her 40 s.  
Smart.  A real person.  Or an incredible facsimile.  Another 
woman, MYRA, and a man, ANDY, are already in her office.

                                  CAROL
                Merc really wanted to be here, but he 
                had to be in New York.  This is Andy 
                Button, our head of Casting.

                                  ANDY
                Huge fan.  Ohmygod.  I ve been 
                watching tapes of your show.  Beyond 
                  hysterical.  Beyond.  

                                  CAROL 
                And Myra Licht, head of Comedy.

Myra wears a perpetually pained expression.

                                  MYRA
                      (with a grimace)
                It s really funny.

                                  CAROL
                Sit, sit, sit.  So are you settling 
                in?  Some house, huh? 

                                    BEVERLY
                We love it.  The only thing it s 
                missing is a moat.                                                                12/28/09      18.


                                  CAROL
                Get a big rating, Merc ll dig you a 
                moat.

They all chuckle.

                                  ANDY
                She s not kidding.

                                  SEAN
                It is somewhat strangely built.  
                Several of the columns are made of 
                  polystyrene.

                                  CAROL
                Oh my god, they re probably left over 
                from some set.  A lot of producers use 
                that house for reality shows.  They 
                shot a season of  The Bachelor  there.  
                And I think  The Apprentice: LA .  We 
                just had twelve girls living there 
                  competing to become a supermodel.  

                                    BEVERLY
                Right.  The bathroom did have a vague 
                vomity smell.

                                  CAROL
                That would be why.

Beat.

                                  CAROL
                So.   Lyman s Boys .  Let s talk about 
                casting.

                                  SEAN
                Well, we ve got Julian committed to 
                recreate the role of Lyman.  So that s 
                half the battle right there. 

                                  CAROL
                We love Julian.  He s hilarious.  We 
                just need to find a time when he can 
                fly over and audition for Merc.

                                  SEAN
                  Audition?

                                  CAROL
                No one gets cast in anything without 
                Merc seeing them first.                                                                12/28/09      19.


                                    BEVERLY
                That s mad.  Merc loves the show.  
                Julian is the show.  Why should he 
                have to audition?

Andy looks to Carol.  Awkward glances are exchanged.

                                  CAROL
                Yeah.  Um.  Here s the thing.  There s 
                a chance Merc may not have actually 
                seen your show.

                                  SEAN
                What?

                                  CAROL
                I m not saying he hasn t seen it.

                                    BEVERLY
                Has he seen it?

                                  CAROL
                No.

                                  SEAN
                Hang on.  He told us he loved it.  He 
                said he wanted to have sex with it.

                                  CAROL
                Well, if I had a nickel for everything 
                Merc would have sex with sight-
                  unseen... 

                                  ANDY
                She d have a lot of nickels.

                                    BEVERLY
                Then what about it did he love?

                                  CAROL
                Uh, it s a hit?  It wins awards?  It 
                ran for four years?   

                                    BEVERLY
                  Unbelievable...

                                  CAROL
                We ve all seen it.  And we do love it.  
                Which is why Merc really needs to see 
                Julian read.                                                                  12/28/09      20.


                                    BEVERLY
                But we ve already offered him the 
                part.  He gave up a play in the West 
                End to do this.

                                  CAROL
                I hear you.  I do.  And I m sure 
                Merc ll flip for him.  I mean, my god, 
                he s Julian...

                                  ANDY
                Bullard.

                                  CAROL
                Bullard.  

                                  SEAN
                Can t Merc just watch some tapes of 
                the show?

                                  CAROL
                It s better if we do it in person.  
                He s not a big TV watcher.

                                    BEVERLY
                And if we say no?

Andy and Myra look sharply at Carol.  You can feel the fear.  

                                  CAROL
                You don t want to say no to Merc.  You 
                really want him on your team.

                                  SEAN
                  I thought he was on our team.

                                  CAROL
                Totally.  But if he likes Julian -- 
                and he will -- you re pretty much 
                  guaranteed you re on the air.

                                    BEVERLY
                He already guaranteed we re on the 
                air.

                                  CAROL
                  Absolutely.  But you know, nothing s 
                in stone.

                                  SEAN
                  Actually, Merc said this was in stone.

                                  CAROL
                And it is.  But, you know.                                                                12/28/09      21.


                                    BEVERLY
                Clearly we don t know.

                                  CAROL
                It s in stone.  But... stone.  There s 
                things stronger than stone.

                                  SEAN
                Like what?

                                  CAROL
                Like Merc.  Merc is stronger than 
                stone.


Sean is driving.  Beverly is venting, as she tears open a bag 
of nuts.

                                    BEVERLY
                It s outrageous!

                                  SEAN
                Yes.

                                    BEVERLY
                He has to audition?!  The man has 
                played the part for four years!

                                  SEAN
                I agree.  What are you eating?

                                    BEVERLY
                Nuts from the plane.  They re awful.  
                Want some?

                                  SEAN
                Sure.

They pull up to the guard gate.

                                  SEAN
                Hello, Wallace.

                                  GATE GUARD
                And you re here to see...?

They just stare at him.
