      We re outside SAWYER S TENT -- establishing its location on 
      the beach at the edge of the jungle.  We hear an UNGODLY 
      SCREECH from inside as Sawyer CLUBS THE BEAST.

      Suddenly the blue tarp Sawyer uses as part of his structure 
      is ripped from its moorings.  The beast is running away -- 
      and taking the tarp with it.

      The tarp and the animal ROCKET OFF INTO the jungle.

      And Sawyer s running right after it.


      WE RE WITH SAWYER running through the jungle.  He doesn t get 
      far -- the beast is long gone.  And shirtless and shoeless 
      he s in no condition to give chase.

      His adrenaline s pumping.  Fired up, no scared.  He looks 
      around -- what the hell was that?  He takes a few deep 
      breaths, then, turns to head back toward his campsite.

      And that s when the WHISPERS start.

      They fade in gradually (as they did in episode 108.) Sawyer 
      glances around -- who the fuck is saying that?  We scan the 
      jungle -- it s dark, creepy.  But nobody s there.

      We 360 around Sawyer as the whispers BUILD.  And as they 
      reach crescendo, they CUT OUT COMPLETELY, replaced by a 
      single, WHISPERED VOICE:

                                  WHISPERED VOICE
                    I was gonna pay --

      Sawyer goes COMPLETELY PALE.  Off his terrified look we --

                                        ACT ONE


      TRACK across the scattered DEBRIS of Sawyer s area.  It s a 
      MESS -- since the tent came down, the wind has scattered much 
      of the CLOTHES, MAGAZINES, and GEAR Sawyer s been hoarding.

      FIND Sawyer, angrily collecting his belongings into a pile.  
      SAYID stands nearby, surveying the damage:

                                  SAYID
                    A boar.  Took you tarp.

                                  SAWYER
                          (muttering)
                    It was dark -- but yeah.  Pretty 
                    sure it was a boar...

                                  SAYID
                    I thought the boar had vacated this 
                    area...

      Sawyer clearly does not want to have this conversation.

                                  SAWYER
                    Well, genius, I think we got some 
                    bad info.

                                  SAYID
                    What was it doing in your tent?

                                  SAWYER
                    It was staring at me.

      Sayid frowns.  Sawyer realizes how ridiculous that sounds.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Then it came at me.  So I hit it.  
                    And it took off --

      He gestures toward the jungle where the boar disappeared.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Into the jungle.

                                  SAYID
                    With your tarp.
                          (pause; then)
                    Perhaps it wanted to go camping.

      Sawyer grits his teeth.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       6.

                                  SAWYER
                    You enjoying yourself?

      Sayid thinks about it, then:

                                  SAYID
                    A bit.  Yes.

      Sawyer shakes his head, fed up.  He starts walking into the 
      jungle after his tent.

                                  SAWYER
                    Laugh it up, Mohammed -- I get back 
                    and find my stuff s gone, I m 
                    coming after you.

      ON SAYID -- he takes a final glance at the wreckage, shakes 
      his head, and starts to walk off.  After he takes a few 
      steps, we hear:

                                  SAWYER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Sayid --

      Sayid turns back.  Sawyer s looking at him.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    What did you hear?

      Sayid doesn t understand the question.  Off his look:

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    After you ran into the French 
                    Woman, you said you heard something 
                    in the jungle...

                                  SAYID
                          (shakes his head)
                    I was injured and exhausted.  My 
                    mind was playing tricks on me...

                                  SAWYER
                    What did you hear?

                                  SAYID
                    I thought I heard... whispering.

                                  SAWYER
                    What was it saying?

                                  SAYID
                    Why?  Did you hear something?

      Sawyer stares at him a beat.  Then:

                                  SAWYER
                    Forget it.

      We re CLOSE ON HIM as he turns, walks toward the jungle.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    I didn t hear anything.

                    What are you afraid of?


      WE RE LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A GUN, MACRO-CLOSE.  AND --

      It FLIPS up, TWIRLS around deftly -- Now its HANDLE OUT.  And 
      we RACK FOCUS to find the gunslinger is --

                                  KATE
                    Thanks for the loaner.

      KATE stands with JACK by the tree where he stows THE 
      HALLIBURTON CASE.

                                  JACK
                    Always a pleasure.

      Jack takes the gun from Kate, EJECTS the CLIP as he places 
      both pieces back into the case.

                                  KATE
                    Anyone curious where they came 
                    from?

                                  JACK
                    The others know there was a Marshal 
                    on the plane.  Guess they assume he 
                    was travelling alone.  Protecting 
                    them from terrorists.
                          (beat; then)
                    Sounded like a good theory to me.

      ON KATE.  A moment of silent THANKS --

      Jack LOCKS up the case, ties the LEATHER STRAP with THE KEY 
      back around his neck.

                                  KATE
                    You get all of the guns back?

                                  JACK
                    All except one.

                        KATEJACK
      Who...?
                                                  -- How about I give you three 
                                                    guesses?

                                  KATE
                    Sawyer.

      Jack gives her a look --  Of course it s fucking Sawyer.  -- 
      Puts the Halliburton in its hiding place, begins to CAMO the  *
      opening.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    I can get it back.

                                  JACK
                          (uh huh)
                    Really.  How you gonna do that?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       13.

                                  KATE
                    I speak his language.

      Jack finishes secreting the case.  Turns to Kate... shaking 
      his head --

                                  JACK
                    We ve done this before, Kate.  If I 
                    remember it right, you made out 
                    with him and never even had what 
                    you said you could get.

      Beat.  Kate could try to defend herself here.  But instead --

                                  KATE
                    I only made out with Sawyer because 
                    torturing him didn t work.

      Another beat.  Then Jack can t help but GRIN at the pure 
      absurdity of it.  Tension broken --

                                  JACK
                    Let him keep the gun.  It s not 
                    worth it.

                                  KATE
                    Why?  You afraid he s gonna shoot 
                    me if I ask?

                                  JACK
                          (serious now)
                    No.  I just don t want you to owe 
                    him anything.

      And that s as close as Jack will ever get to declaring that 
      he might just be JEALOUS.  And OFF KATE, perhaps appreciating 
      precisely that...

      CAMERA TRACKS to find CHARLIE sitting off by himself, BINDING 
    a piece of BENT WRECKAGE to the end of one of the GOLD CLUBS.  
      And with just one look at him, it is instantly clear -- This 
      is not the Charlie we know and love.  Something just... OFF.

      CLOSE on him -- VERY focused on the task at hand, wrapping 
      the WIRE around and around and around.

                    Hey.

      Charlie looks up, sees CLAIRE.  He offers a smile, but 
      doesn t come close to selling it.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Hi.

        Awkwardness.  She s got amnesia.  He just killed a man.  What 
      the fuck are they going to talk about?

                    Very pregnant.

      Charlie just nods and continues BINDING.  Not rudely... just 
      DISTRACTED.  After watching him for a few beats --

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    I had... dreams last night.  More 
                    like memories, actually.  You were 
                    in them.  I...
                          (beat)
                    They were nice dreams.

                    Thought I d see if you wanted to 
                    take a walk...

      She s obviously reaching out.  Trying to make some kind of 
      connection.  But Charlie s so focused, it takes him a beat to 
      realize what she s saying.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Sorry. Can t right now.  There s...
                          (reluctant)
                      ...something I have to do.

                    Dude -- not the golf club.

      Charlie and Claire turn to see HURLEY -- standing there with 
    a makeshift TOOL (kinda resembles a shovel) of his own.

                                    CHARLIE
                    It was all I could find.

                          (shakes his head)
                    Jack will spaz.

      Charlie hops to his feet.  Offers Claire that weird smile --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Excuse me.  We ve gotta...

                    Sure.  Yeah.  All right.

      And Charlie walks off.

      Hurley stands there for a beat, looking at Claire.  And he s 
      got no fucking idea what to say to her.  So he just raises 
      his hand, offers a little WAVE --

                                  HURLEY
                    Bye.

      Hurley shuffles off after Charlie.  And OFF Claire, 
      displaced, confused... and ALONE --


      Sawyer walks through the dense jungle, searching for --

      HIS BLUE TARP

      It s in a clearing, the wind s blown it up against the tree.  
      Sawyer gathers it up in his arms, heads back toward camp.


      We re with Sawyer as he walks through TALL GRASS.  He s got 
      his tarp in his arms.  As he walks, we hear the wind blowing 
      through the grass, and ever-so-faintly:

                                  WHISPERED VOICE
                    I was gonna pay --

      Sawyer stops in his tracks.  Did I just hear that?

      As he listens closely, he hears RUSTLING.  Coming from BEHIND 
      HIM.  He turns around and sees MOVEMENT IN THE GRASS.  
      Something s out there...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       16.
      (CONT'D):1010


      We catch a glimpse of it -- it s THE BOAR.  And it s charging 
      right towards Sawyer.

      Oh. Shit.

      Sawyer starts to run.  HANDHELD CHAOS as he sprints through 
      the jungle.  He throws his tarp away.  As he flees, we catch 
      glimpses of the beast -- blurs of fur amidst the grass.  This 
      thing s moving fast.

      BOAR POV -- as it rushes up right behind Sawyer --

      The animal SHRIEKS and Sawyer s legs are cut out from under 
      him as the beast runs him down.  Sawyer goes down hard, 
      headfirst into the mud.  We catch QUICK, FRENETIC POPS of the 
      beast as it TRAMPLES SAWYER.

      It all happens fast...  And then it s over.  The beast is 
      gone.  It disappears into the tall grass.  Just like that.

      Leaving Sawyer facedown and trampled in the mud.

      He slowly gets to his feet.  He s filthy.  Breathing hard.  
      Sore as shit from the hit.  But he checks himself over -- no 
      severe damage.

      WE RE CLOSE ON HIS FACE as his fear hardens into anger.

                                  SAWYER
                    SON OF A BITCH --

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:


    A KNIFE IS SLAMMED INTO A SCABBARD.  WIDEN OUT AS Sawyer 
      shoves it into his BACKPACK.  He s focused -- angry 
      determination etched on his face.

      WE PULL BACK as he rummages through the debris of his site, 
      packing for the hunt.  He shoves various articles of FOOD and 
      CLOTHES into his pack.

      And then we see Kate is there with him.

      She sees Sawyer s site is a mess -- debris scattered about -- 
      and he s filthy, covered in dried mud from his run-in with 
      the boar.

                                  KATE
                    A boar.  Did all this.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       17.

      We can just feel the frustration rising off Sawyer.

                                  SAWYER
                    Yes.  A boar did all this.
                          (ranting)
                    Last night, it wrecked my tent.  
                    Then, this morning, when I was 
                    going to get my tent back, it 
                    attacked me from behind, and ran 
                    off into the jungle.  Like a 
                    coward.

      Long beat as Kate stares at him.

                                  KATE*
                    A boar wouldn t... attack you for 
                    no reason.

                                  SAWYER
                    Thank you, boar expert.  This one 
                    did.

      He searches through a pile, looking for something in 
      particular...

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                          (muttering)
                    It s harassing me...

      He finds what he s looking for: HIS GUN.

                                  KATE
                    What are you doing?

      He checks the magazine, slams it into his gun.  Tucks the gun 
      into his waistband.

                                  SAWYER
                    Gettin  even.

                                  KATE
                          (rolls eyes)
                    Listen to yourself.  It s a boar.  
                    Let s just... tell Locke, he ll go 
                    kill it.

                                  SAWYER

      She glances to the heavens -- oh christ.

                                        ACT TWO


      Hurley pokes at something BELOW FRAME with a STICK.

                                  HURLEY
                    Dude, I know how this works...

      Charlie enters frame, sees what Hurley s doing:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Trust me.  He s dead.

      We WIDEN TO REVEAL he s poking at a DEAD BODY wrapped for 
      burial in airplane blankets.  Charlie holds his shovel,  *
      Hurley s is next to his feet.

                                  HURLEY
                    We put him in the ground, 
                      everything seems cool, then when 
                    we re about to leave, his hand pops 
                    out of the dirt --

      Charlie takes his shovel, breaks ground.  Shrugs.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (matter of fact)
                    S pose we ll have to bury him deep, 
                    then...

      Hurley keeps his wary eyes focused on the body.

                                  HURLEY
                          (shakes head)
                    Doesn t matter.  There s no grave 
                    that can hold the undead.
                          (beat)
                    No, this ends with you and me 
                    running through the jungle, 
                    screaming and crying --

                                    CHARLIE

                                  HURLEY
                    -- and then he catches me first, 
                     cause I m heavy and I get cramps --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hurley --

      Hurley snaps out of it, looks at Charlie.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       20.

                    You don t have to do this, y know.  
                    I mean -- I appreciate the help and 
                    all, I really do...
                          (beat)
                    But I killed Ethan. I can bury him.

      And Charlie says it so simply, it brings Hurley back to 
      reality.  He exhales:

                                  HURLEY
                    Nah.  I m good.

      He takes one last look at the body, then picks up his shovel.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Let s just get it done.

      Charlie nods.  Hurley breaks ground next to him.

      We re CLOSE ON HURLEY as he glances at Charlie -- how is 
      Charlie so calm about this?


      WE RE MOVING SLOWLY through the dense foliage of the jungle 
      to find Sawyer creeping through the trees.

      He s focused.  Not making a lot of noise.  It s clear he s in 
      tracking mode -- he gets low, studies --

    A PRINT

      Barely visible in the soil.

      Sawyer looks it over, surveys the jungle in front of him.  As 
      he does all this, we start to get the sense that Sawyer may 
      in fact know what the hell he s doing.

      That is, until:

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    That s a footprint.

      Sawyer s face falls.  He turns and looks behind him.  Finds 
      Kate walking out of the trees.  She s wearing a BACKPACK.  As 
      she speaks, it s all very matter-of-fact, no sense of 
      smugness whatsoever:

                    Based on the weight, distance

                    you ve been tracking Boone for the 
                    last hour.

                    am -- so don t take it personal

                                  KATE
                    I want carte blanche.

                                  SAWYER
                          (after a beat)
                    What?

                                  KATE
                    It s pretty simple.  You can t 
                    track this boar without my help.

                                  SAWYER
                    Is that right?

                                  KATE
                    That s right.  Over the last few 
                    hours, you ve managed to follow the 
                    tracks of --
                          (counts them off on her 
                            fingers)
                    Humans, birds, a rockslide, 
                      yourself... everything except a 
                    boar, actually.
                          (beat)
                    You have no idea what you re doing.

      And he can t do anything but steam -- because he knows she s

                                  KATE (CONT D)

                    I know what it means.

                    whatever -- I get it.  No questions 
                    asked.

      Goddamn it, does he want to tell her to fuck off.  But he 
      knows he s screwed without her.

                                  SAWYER

                    Take it or leave it.

      And we see it -- the moment where he forces himself to put on 
    a good face and act like this doesn t bother him in the 
      slightest.

                                  SAWYER
                    All right.  You got a deal.

      And as Sawyer watches her lead him away --

      OMITTED1414


      Sawyer walks down an old dock toward a run-down boat repair  *
      shop.  Behind him we see one of the bridges of SYDNEY HARBOR  *
      and a slice of the famous SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE.*

      He ducks into a boat repair shop past somebody welding. *

                                  LAURENCE (V.O.)*
                    So you re Hibbs  mate, huh?... *
                    Worked a few jobs with Hibbs back *
                    in the States --*


      Kate and Sawyer trudge through the jungle -- Dirty and SWEATY 
      (and on these two, somehow it looks GREAT), BREATHING HARD.

      Kate stops, looks up at the sky.  Frowns.  Sawyer gets ahead 
      before he realizes she s not beside him.  Turns --

                                  SAWYER
                    What?

                                  KATE
                    Gonna be dark in half an hour.

                                  SAWYER
                    Then I guess we got half an hour to 
                    catch us a hog.

      Kate shakes her head, pulls off her PACK --

                                  KATE
                    Suit yourself.
                          (points)
                    He went that way.  I m making camp 
                    while I can still see.

                                  SAWYER
                    What?  You re just gonna let it get 
                    away?  How re we --

                                  KATE
                    Boars sleep too.

      ON SAWYER -- Frustrated, wanting to continue on...

      But without his guide, he s completely helpless to do 
      anything about it.  As he drops his OWN PACK in frustration --


      CLOSE ON A FIRE as a PIECE OF DRY WOOD kicks up a field of 
      EMBERS as it s dropped into the flames.

      Kate settles down next to the fire, Sawyer on the opposite 
      side.  Two outlaws, camped out under the stars.  Hell, if we 
      didn t know any better?

      We d think this was downright romantic.

      Sawyer digs around his pack, finally finds what he s looking 
      for -- a MINI-BOTTLE OF VODKA.  Cracks it open.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       27.

      Tosses it back in one cool shot.  REVEAL Kate, having watched 
      the whole process.

                    Where d you get that?

                                  SAWYER
                    Plane.

                        KATESAWYER
      Jack was looking for the 
      alcohol cart ---- Well, it s a good thing I 
                                                  found it instead then, huh?

      Kate just looks at him.  No idea what she s thinking.  Then --

                                  KATE
                    Got anymore of those?

                                  SAWYER
                    I got more a  everything.  But you 
                    ain t got carte blanche yet.

                                  KATE
                    Is that a  no? 

      Now it s his turn to look at her.  And dammit if Sawyer ain t 
      charmed.  Reaches into his pack, emerges with a whole HANDFUL 
      of mini-bottles.

                                  SAWYER
                    All right, Sassafrass -- but you 
                    wanna drink?  You gotta play.

                                  KATE
                          (smelling the rat)
                    Play what?

                                  SAWYER
                    I never.

                                  KATE
                    What?

                                  SAWYER
                    I.  Never.

                                  KATE
                    Am I supposed to know what that is?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       28.

                                  SAWYER
                    A game is what it is.  Call it a 
                    way to get to know each other 
                    better.  For example...
                          (grins)
                    I know you never went to college.

                                  KATE
                          (he s right)
                    And how do you know that?

                                  SAWYER
                    If you had, you d a heard of  I 
                    Never. 

      Sawyer tosses her a MINI-BOTTLE --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Simple.  You say  I never...  and 
                    then finish the sentence.  If it s 
                    something you did, you drink.  If 
                    it s something you never did, you 
                    don t drink.

      Kate absorbs this.  Then --

                                  KATE
                    That makes absolutely no sense.

                                  SAWYER
                    Then learn by example.
                          (declares)
                    I have never kissed a man.
                          (a beat)
                    Now you drink.
                          (another beat)
                     Cause you ve kissed a man.

      Subtext -- That man being him.  Kate sighs --

                                  KATE
                    What s the object of this game?

                                  SAWYER
                    What s the object of anything?

      ON KATE.  Deciding whether or not to embark on this 
        foolishness.  Sawyer s just lookin  at her, eyes twinkling --

      So she cracks open her bottle.  DRINKS.  Sawyer grins, 
      impressed --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       29.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Your turn.

                                  KATE
                          (thinks; then)
                    I ve never implied I went to 
                    college when I really haven t.

      And Sawyer s grin is GONE.  But rules are rules.  He drinks.

                                  SAWYER
                    I never been to Disneyland.

      Kate does NOT drink.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Aww.  That s plain sad.

                                  KATE
                    I ve never worn pink.

      Sawyer GLARES at her.  But DRINKS.  By way of explanation --

                                  SAWYER
                    The eighties.
                          (moving on)
                    I never voted Democrat.

      Kate doesn t drink.

                                  KATE
                    I ve never voted.

      Sawyer smiles.  Drinks.

                                  SAWYER
                    I never been in love.

                                  KATE
                          (bullshit)
                    You ve never been in love.

                                  SAWYER
                    Ain t drinking, am I?

      Kate might not buy it (hell, WE might not buy it), but she 
      drinks.  Then --

                                  KATE
                    I ve never had a one-night stand.

      Sawyer takes a healthy swig.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       30.
      (CONT'D): (4)1919


                                  SAWYER
                    I gotta drink for each one?

                                  KATE
                          (ha-ha)
                    Your turn.

                                  SAWYER
                    I never been married.

      Kate eyes him for a second.  And then she takes a little sip.

                                  KATE
                    Didn t last long.

      Sawyer, INTRIGUED as she reaches for a new bottle --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    I never blamed a boar for all my 
                    problems.

      O-kay.  Now it s getting personal.  Yet, Sawyer DRINKS.  
      Fires back --

                                  SAWYER
                    I never cared about getting carte 
                    blanche  cause I just wanted to 
                    spend some time with the only other 
                    person on this island who just 
                    don t belong.

      On KATE.  And that flash of VULNERABILITY.  Yeah -- He 
      fucking NAILED her.  But she meets his gaze.  Takes a drink.  
      And fires right back:

                                  KATE
                    I never carried a letter around for 
                    twenty years because I can t get 
                    over my baggage.

      And Sawyer goes cold.  Locks that stare into her.  But 
      drinks.  Holds the stare for a beat, then:

                                  SAWYER
                    I never killed a man.

      And there it is.  After all this time.  The handcuffs.  The 
      case.  The guns.  The Marshal.  It doesn t matter when he 
      found out, but he KNOWS.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       31.
      (CONT'D): (5)1919


      He looks at her, for a reaction.  SEES a flash of intense 
      vulnerability, then covers it.  She doesn t want to give him 
      the fucking satisfaction.

      And she drinks.

      ON SAWYER.  Not as surprised as we might expect him to be.  
      But what is surprising...

      Is that Sawyer drinks TOO.  Drains his whole mini-bottle.  
      And when he s done --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Well, looks like we got something 
                    in common after all.

      And OFF this dark tableau --

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK: *

      Sawyer awakes with a start as Kate rousts him from his 
      nightmare.

                                  KATE
                    Sawyer --

                    Wh-what --

      He focuses, realizes he s been dreaming.  He exhales, rubs

      Off his look we CUT WIDE TO REVEAL their camp has been 
      RANSACKED.  The entire contents of Sawyer s backpack are 
      strewn all about the area -- torn clothes, empty liquor 
      bottles, food wrappers.  It s a mess.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    I don t believe this...*

                          (reluctant)
                    Yeah.  There s... hoof marks 
                      everywhere and most of your stuff 
                    looks like it s been... chewed.

                                  SAWYER
                    Look at this!*

                                  KATE
                    I can t figure out how we didn t 
                    wake up --

                                  SAWYER
                          (looking around, furious)
                    It ate all our stuff...

                                  KATE
                    No, it only destroyed your stuff.  
                    My stuff s fine.

      She points -- there s her backpack on the ground, completely 
      intact.  Sawyer s face darkens.

                                  SAWYER
                    That hog s gonna suffer, I swear to 
                    god --

      And as he says that, they hear a rustling in the jungle.  
      Sawyer locks eyes at Kate -- Whip-fast, he yanks the gun from 
      his waistband, aims it just as

      LOCKE

      Walks right into their campsite.  Backpack strapped to his 
      shoulders.  He s eating a piece of fruit, not bothered in the 
      slightest.

                                  LOCKE
                    Mornin .

      They just stare at him -- what the fuck is he doing way out 
      here?  Locke takes a bite of his fruit, surveying the mess 
      around them.  Then:

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    What happened to your campsite?


      CLOSE ON A TIN POT heating coffee over the fire.  WIDEN OUT 
      as Locke pulls the pot off, pours CUPS for himself and Kate.

      While they talk, Sawyer angrily walks around camp, picking up 
      his destroyed items --

                                  KATE
                    So what re you doing all the way 
                    out here, John?

                                  LOCKE
                    Looking for salvage from the crash.  
                    Tail came off over the water, so we 
                    were losing pieces as we came in.  
                    I ve been back-tracking the course.

                                  KATE
                    Find anything useful?

                                  LOCKE
                    The occasional scrap of metal --
                          (raises his cup)
                    -- few bags of coffee.  Stumbled 
                    across your path about a mile back  
                    -- thought I d say howdy.

      Kate studies Locke for a moment.  Maybe starting to feel that 
      Locke ain t exactly telling the complete truth here.  Then --

                                  SAWYER
                      SONOFABITCH!

      Sawyer throws down a T-SHIRT like it s on fire --

                    It peed on my damn shirt!

                    Took my shirt out of my pack and

                    I wore that shirt the day we came 
                    here.  Only piece of clothing that

                          (glares at Kate)
                    And you say this ain t personal?

      Kate shakes her head, turns to Locke --

                                  KATE
                    He s convinced the boar we re after 
                    has a vendetta against him.

                                  LOCKE
                    Uh huh.

                      SAWYERKATE
      That s three!  Three times he 
      attacked me...-- Maybe it s got your scent.  
                                                    Doesn t like your cologne...

                      SAWYERKATE
    I don t wear cologne.
                                                  -- Yes you do.

                                  SAWYER
                    Yeah.  Well...
                          (fuck you)
                    He s got it in for me.

                                  KATE
                    It s just a boar.

      Sawyer stares at Kate.  Kate stares at Sawyer.  Then --

                                  LOCKE
                    My sister Jeannie died when I was a 
                    boy.  She fell off the monkey bars.  
                    Broke her neck.

      Kate and Sawyer turn to Locke, both wondering what s gonna 
      justify that segue --

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    My mother -- well, she blamed 
                    herself of course.  Thought she 
                    should ve been watching closer.
                          (beat)
                    So she stopped eating.  Stopped 
                    sleeping.  Then she just stopped 
                    speaking all together.  She d just 
                    sit on the couch and stare off into 
                    space.  The neighbors started 
                    talking -- afraid she might do 
                    something to herself, I guess.
                          (takes a sip of his 
                            coffee; savoring it)

                    Mmmmm.  That s good.
                          (then)
                    Anyway, about six months after 
                    Jeannie s funeral, this golden 
                    retriever comes padding up our 
                    driveway, walks right into our 
                    house, sits down on the floor and 
                    looks right at my mother there on 
                    the couch.  And my mother looks 
                    back at the dog.  And after a 
                    minute of this -- them both staring 
                    at each other like that...
                          (beat)
                    My mother burst into tears.

      Kate looks to Sawyer, but he is absolutely RIVETED on Locke --

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Beautiful dog.  No tags.  No 
                    collar.  Healthy.  And sweet.  A 
                    little older than a puppy.  About 
                    six months, we figured.
                          (and here it is)
                    Dog slept in Jeannie s old room on 
                    Jeannie s old bed and stayed with 
                    us until my mother passed eight 
                    years later.  Disappeared back to 
                    wherever it was she came from in 
                    the first place.

      Locke drains his coffee.  Story ended.  Sawyer still 
      transfixed, but Kate?  Well, Kate s a pragmatist --

                                  KATE
                    You re saying the dog was your 
                    sister?

                                  LOCKE
                    Well that would be silly.

      Then, he turns to Sawyer --

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    But my mother thought it was.  
                    Thought Jeannie came back to let 
                    her know that it was okay.  To tell 
                    her the accident wasn t her fault.  
                    To let her off the hook.

      And Sawyer does not like Locke s gaze.  Because somehow, it 
      can SEE right INTO HIM.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "Outlaws"         (BLUE)         12/13/04        37.
      (CONT'D): (3)2222


      And as twisted and bizarre as this parable is, we re most 
      certain that Sawyer is BUYING INTO IT --

                                  SAWYER
                    So whose fault was it.

                                  LOCKE
                    Sorry?

                                  SAWYER
                    The accident.  On the monkey bars.

                                  LOCKE
                    Oh.
                          (thinks; then)
                    I don t know.  Wasn t there.

                                  SAWYER
                    Then who says your sister wanted to 
                    let your momma off the hook?

      Locke considers this.  Then --

                                  LOCKE
                    Well I suppose if she hadn t...
                          (beat)
                    Jeannie would ve come back as a 
                    much meaner dog, wouldn t she?

      Locke smiles... but Sawyer doesn t take it as a joke.  Not at 
      all.  And as we PUSH IN ON SAWYER we CUT TO:


      CLOSE ON a car door opening.  Out steps Sawyer.  And he s  *
      holding the .357 REVOLVER he purchased at his side.  He puts  *
      it in his coat pocket.*

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Sawyer is standing not far from a lonely  *
      SHRIMP TRUCK open for business on the side of the Australian 
      beach.  Sawyer scans the area.  Nobody is around except a  *
      single customer at the truck.*

      And now Sawyer slowly starts walking towards it.  His hand s  *
      in his jacket pocket, holding the gun.

      He approaches the truck.  Gets in line behind the remaining  *
      CUSTOMER.  As he does so, he glances up toward the man 
      working at the counter and we see --





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "Outlaws"         (BLUE)         12/13/04        38.

      It s him.

      The guy who ruined Sawyer s life.  The guy Hibbs showed us 
      with the picture in Act One.  The Original Sawyer (but for 
      the sake of clarity, let s refer to him by his current alias, 
       Duckett. )

      DUCKETT s middle-aged.  Sagging face.  He has a sense of 
      danger about him -- a tough guy stuck behind the counter of a 
      second-rate shrimp truck.

      ON SAWYER -- his eyes are locked on Duckett.  And as we HOLD 
      ON HIM, everything GOES QUIET.

      ON DUCKETT -- he takes the money from the customer in front 
      of Sawyer.  Everything played silent.

      BACK ON SAWYER -- we see it play out on his face -- he s 
      found him.  The man he s been looking foro his entire life.

      Sawyer s so focused, in fact, that he fails to realize --

                                  DUCKETT (O.S.)
                    Hey -- pal --

      Duckett s talking to him.

                                    DUCKETT (CONT D)
                    Only two choices -- shrimp in mild 
                    sauce and shrimp in hot sauce.

      Sawyer snaps out of it.  Swallows.

                                  SAWYER
                    I ll go with the hot...

                                    DUCKETT
                          (nods)
                    Hot it is...

      He turns around, places a handful of shrimp in a basket, 
      drops the basket in boiling water.  As he works, he speaks 
      over his shoulder:

                                    DUCKETT (CONT D)
                    Fellow American, huh?...  Good for *
                    you.  You missed the lunch rush.*

      Sawyer looks to his left -- EMPTY BEACH.  He looks to his 
      right -- EMPTY BEACH.  They re alone.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       39.

                                  DUCKETT (CONT D)
                      Whereabouts you from?

      He stares at Duckett s back.  Keeping his eyes locked on him.

                                  SAWYER
                      Tennessee...

      But as Sawyer stares at him, we see his eyes start to waver.  
      Something s wrong...

                                    DUCKETT
                          (nods)
                    Love the South.  Miss the southern 
                    women.

      Now that Sawyer s in the moment, he s having second thoughts.   *
      Because it s not that easy to kill a man.  And we see it play  *
      out on his face.*

                                    DUCKETT (CONT D)
                    You in Australia long?

                                    SAWYER*
                    Not really.

      Sawyer wipes the rain out of his eyes.  Duckett continues 
      with his business, pulling the shrimp out the water.

                                    DUCKETT
                    Well -- fer what it s worth -- I 
                    run a special here at the truck -- 
                    half off for all Americans.

      He turns around, faces Sawyer.

                                    DUCKETT (CONT D)
                    My name s Frank, by the way.

      And we HOLD ON SAWYER -- what does he tell him?  A beat, 
      then:

                                  SAWYER
                          (quietly)

      Duckett nods, turns back around.

                                    DUCKETT
                    Good to meet ya, James.

      WE RE CLOSE ON SAWYER -- on his face: the moment he realizes 
      he s not a killer.  He looks down -- what am I doing?

      ON DUCKETT, wrapping the shrimp up for sale.

                                  DUCKETT (CONT D)
                    Okay -- one shrimp in hot sauce 
                    comin  right --

      But as he turns back around, we reveal Sawyer s gone.

                                    DUCKETT (CONT D)
                    -- up...

                    Yo Sayid --

      Sayid looks up, finds Hurley approaching.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Can I ask you a question?

      Sayid nods -- of course.

                          (off Sayid s look)
                    That s just it -- I mean, he killed

      And as Sayid takes this in --

      past a creek.  Kate s a few steps behind him -- he seems to  *
      be following the boar s tracks on his own.

                                  KATE
                    You don t believe him, do you?

                                  SAWYER
                    Man says he s tracking wreckage, 
                    he s tracking wreckage.

                    Sawyer -- seriously --

      But he s got that INTENSITY in his eyes -- he s barely paying 
      attention as he presses onward.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Sawyer --

      She stops in her tracks.  Once he realizes she s no longer 
      following him, he turns, looks at her.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    What are we doing?

                    We re miles from camp.  Even if we *

                    Eight hundred pounds?  There s no

                                  SAWYER
                    Who said anything about bringing it 
                    back?

      CLOSE ON SAWYER as he turns, continuing onward --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    We re out here to kill it.


      THWACK!  A make-shift machete (made from a sharp piece of 
      aircraft metal with a wrapped handle) LOPS THE TOP OFF a 
      coconut husk.

      WIDEN to reveal Charlie using the machete.  He s sitting on 
      the beach husking coconuts and stacking four or five finished 
      ones.  He s working skillfully but without much enthusiasm.

                                  SAYID (O.S.)
                    You re developing quite a talent.

      Charlie looks up to see Sayid there.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah well, you know, musical trends 
                    being what they are... who knows 
                    what ll be popular when we get back 
                    home?
                          (thwack!)
                    Now I ve got a skill I can fall 
                    back on.

      He works the latest coconut from its husk and tosses it on 
      the pile.  Sayid sits down next to him.  Charlie turns and 
      meets Sayid s concerned stare.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Oh, I get it.  You re here to check 
                    up on me...*

                                  SAYID
                          (simple; but without any 
                            judgement)
                    You killed a man.

                                    CHARLIE
                    A man who killed one of us, who 
                    kidnapped Claire -- who strung me 
                    up and left me for dead.  He 
                    deserved to die -- and I d do it 
                    again in a minute...

      THWACK!  Harder now with the machete.  This whole little 
      speech comes out stronger than Charlie intended --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)

      Sayid nods.  Then after a beat --

                                  SAYID
                    When I was in the army in Tikirt, 
                    in Iraq, the man who lived next 
                    door was a policeman.  One day his 
                    car was rigged with a bomb.  It 
                    went off but it missed him -- it 
                    killed his wife and two young 
                    children instead.
                          (beat)
                    They caught the man who did it.
                          (another beat)
                    I volunteered to be on the firing 
                    squad.  And I did my duty without a 
                    single ounce of remorse.

      Charlie listens to Sayid, acting somewhat disinterested -- 
      but the thing is, he s stopped work completely.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Then... for no reason, I started 
                    waking up nights.  Replaying what I 
                    did in my mind.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Looks like you re the one who needs 
                    checking up on.

                                  SAYID
                    What I m saying is this: what 
                    happened with Ethan will be with 
                    you for the rest of your life.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Meaning an impending lack of sleep?

                                  SAYID
                    More than that.

      Charlie now meets Sayid s eyes.  They bore right into him.  
      Charlie s try for a casual and slightly flippant attitude is 
      providing him literally no cover.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Any suggestions?

                                  SAYID*

      OFF Charlie as that lands with more impact than he thought.


      Sawyer and Kate trek through the jungle.  They push through 
      the tangled vegetation, Kate scanning the ground ahead of 
      them,  cutting for sign. 

      They are dirty, sweaty and breathing hard.  Sawyer looks 
      around at the dense, bleak jungle as they march forward.

                                  SAWYER
                    I take comfort in knowing... 
                    someday this is all gonna be a real 
                    nice shoppin  complex or maybe an 
                    auto mall...

      Kate is focused on something else.  She veers quickly off 
      their path onto a narrow sliver of trail.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Where ya goin ?...

      Kate stops ahead on the trail because she s found something.  
      She waits for Sawyer to catch up.  Which he does.

                                  KATE
                    Know what this is?

                                  SAWYER
                    A hole in the mud?

                                  KATE
                    A wallow.

      What the hell s a wa--
                                                  -- A boar s wallow.  It s his

                                                  look at the tree rubbings 
                                                  from his tusks.

                    Maybe

      That s when Sawyer hears a RUSTLING NOISE.

      Sawyer rushes into the bushes following the noise.  He s all 
      AMPED UP.  URGENT and INTENSE.  KNOWING he s damn close to 
      finding the boar now.

                                  KATE
                    Wait --

      Too late.  We hear RUSTLING, BRUSH CRASHING, BRANCHES 
      SNAPPING -- and we HEAR Sawyer GRUNTING, SCRAMBLING --

                        KATESAWYER (O.S.)
      Sawyer?!...
                                                    Gotcha!

      Followed by an intense SHRIEKING HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL.  Kate 
      starts after him, but then the bushes part and Sawyer 
      reemerges -- holding a BOAR PIGLET.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                          (deadpan)
                    I thought it d be bigger.

                                  SAWYER
                    Funny.  Now we know daddy s gotta 
                    be close by.

      So Sawyer grabs the piglet s little leg and starts TWISTING 
      IT.  The piglet starts to WAIL LIKE A BANSHEE.  SQUEALING and 
      YELPING INSANELY.

                        KATESAWYER
      Stop it Sawyer!  What is the 
      matter with you?!
                                                  Here PIGGY, PIGGY, PIGGY -- !
      Stop it!  Damn it!  Let it (twisting some more)
      go!Over here, daddy!

      PUT IT DOWN -- RIGHT NOW!Where are ya?!   Cause we re 
                                                  right over here!
    I said PUT IT DOWN!

      She tries to grab the piglet but Sawyer twists away from her, 
      so Kate does the only reasonable thing she can do -- she 
      KICKS SAWYER IN THE ACHILLES TENDON.  Kicks him HARD.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    OWWW!  What are YOU DOIN ?!*

      In his weakened state Kate GRABS THE PIGLET from his arms -- 
      and lets it go.  The piglet hits the ground scrambling for 
      purchase -- SQUEALING like crazy -- and SCURRIES OFF fast as 
      its little legs can carry it into the bushes.

      She starts to storm off.

                                  KATE
                    We re done.  Game over.

                                  SAWYER
                    What are you talkin  about?! --

                                  KATE
                    Find your own way back.

                                    SAWYER*
                    No problem.*

      And she strides away, angry as hell.  OFF Sawyer, pissed, 
      watching her go, but still on this fucking mission.*


      RAIN is still FALLING.  Duckett is closing up his shrimp  *
      truck.  He hefts a large TRASH BAG, carries it to a nearby  *
      DUMPSTER.

      REVERSE to find Sawyer, waiting.  Now he starts walking  *
      towards Duckett.  And he s different.  No longer nervous.  No 
      longer conflicted.  His conversation with Jack s dad has him 
      steeled for what he has to do.

      As Duckett hefts the garbage bag into the dumpster, Sawyer 
      walks up behind him --

                                  SAWYER
                    Sawyer --

      And as Duckett turns around --

      BAM -- Sawyer shoots him.  Right in the stomach.

      Duckett DROPS.  He lands on the ground, back against the 
      dumpster.  Not quite dead.  Not yet.

      Sawyer kneels down next to him.  Duckett gasps, shock 
      splashed all over his face.

      Sawyer calmly reaches into his pocket and pulls out his 
      LETTER (last seen in episode 106.)

      Duckett squirms on the ground, holding his stomach, life 
      draining out of him.  He looks at his hands -- they re 
      covered in blood.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                     Dear Mr. Sawyer --

                          (coughing)
                    Who --

      And that s enough to give Sawyer pause.

                                  SAWYER
                    You used to go by the name 
                    Sawyer...

      Duckett shakes his head, losing focus.

                                  DUCKETT
                    The hell you talkin  about...

      He coughs, looks at his hands again.

                                  DUCKETT (CONT D)

      And as soon as Sawyer hears  Hibbs  his face drops.

                                  SAWYER
                    You know Hibbs?
                          (beat)
                    How do you know Hibbs?

      But Duckett s almost gone.

                                  DUCKETT
                    Tell Hibbs I would ve paid him...

                                  SAWYER
                          (putting it together)
                    You borrowed money from Hibbs...

      Duckett coughs, looks at Sawyer.

                                  DUCKETT
                    You don t know what you re doing, 
                    do you...
                          (glassy eyed)
                    It ll come back around.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       54.
      (CONT'D): (3)3030


      And as he dies, he whispers his final words:

                                  DUCKETT (CONT D)
                    I was gonna pay...

      Sawyer stares at Duckett.

      And we see it play out on his face: He s been fucking conned.

      And we re CLOSE ON Sawyer when the horror of the full-
      realization hits him: he s now a cold-blooded killer.


      Sawyer spins around 360 degrees, realizes he s fucked out 
      here by himself.  He makes up his mind, jams off through the 
      jungle after Kate, pissed but exasperated that she deserted 
      him.

                                  SAWYER
                    Kate!


      Sawyer strides into a more open area, looks around, trying to 
      follow the direction she took -- but hell -- he doesn t know   *
      -- and she s nowhere in sight.

                                  SAWYER
                    C mon, Kate!  Where are y--?

      Suddenly, he stops short.  Even backs up a step or two 
      because standing right in his path is the fucking BOAR.  That 
      big one.  The one he s been hunting.

      Sawyer draws his gun.

      The boar doesn t move -- doesn t go anywhere.  Instead, its 
      head turns and A BIG BROWN EYE stares over at Sawyer.

      Sawyer, looks out over his outstretched gun, stares right 
      back at the boar.

      Now we see KATE step INTO VIEW, behind Sawyer.  But he 
      doesn t see her.

      Instead, for the longest moment Sawyer and the fucking boar 
      have a STARE-OFF.  They look at each other.

      And from the intense expression on Sawyer s face we re just 
      waiting for him to pull the trigger...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       55.
      (CONT'D):3232


      But he doesn t.  Instead he lowers the gun.

      The BOAR waits a final beat, watching him, then turns and 
      walks off into the brush.

      Sawyer stands there, gun hanging down at his side, trying to 
      collect himself.

      Now he senses something -- turns to see Kate watching him.  
      SEES that she saw the whole thing -- and in her face is an 
        appreciation for what he just did.  Except Sawyer DOESN T 
      WANT IT.  He walks right back past her.  Meets her eyes for 
      only the briefest of moments to say --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)*
                          (shrugs)*
                    It s just a boar.*
                          (as he goes)*
                    Let s get back to camp.

      Kate takes this in then walks after him, drawn toward this 
        complicated, troubled soul.  Because she is one herself.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "Outlaws"         (BLUE)         12/13/04        56.


                                        ACT FIVE


      FIND Kate and Sawyer walking back out of the jungle and onto  *
      the beach.*

                                  KATE
                    ...a deal s a deal.

                                  SAWYER
                    The deal was for toiletries --

                                  KATE
                     Carte blanche.   Whatever I want.  
                    And I want the gun.

      And now we see they are being observed by Jack, much further  *
      down the beach.  Way out of earshot, and they do not see him,  *
      but he SEES them returning together and takes note.*

      BACK ON SAWYER AND KATE*

                                    SAWYER*
                    I didn t kill the damn hog --

                                  KATE
                    I said I d help you find it.  We 
                    found it.

      Sawyer stops in his tracks, realizing something.

                                  SAWYER
                    Jack asked me for the gun two days 
                    ago...
                          (beat, cold)
                    That why you came on this trek -- 
                    to do your doctor boyfriend a 
                    favor?

      She meets his gaze, not giving him an inch.

                                  KATE
                    You needed help.  I helped.  You 
                    don t like the deal?
                          (beat)
                    Not my problem.

      As Sawyer stares at her, jaw set, mulling this.


      We re ON CLAIRE as she watches DOWN THE BEACH --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "Outlaws"         (BLUE)         12/13/04        56A.

      Walt and Vincent are running through the shallows of the 
      ocean.  Laughing.  PLAYING.  Michael is there also, now 
      adding decking to connect his bundled bamboo pontoons. (Or 
      whatever appropriate advancements we see in the raft 
      construction.)











































                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       57.

      Beyond them, JIN and SUN are working together making  *
      (repairing or adding to) Jin s fishing net.  They are  *
        comfortable, working in tandem.  Make small talk to  *
        themselves.*

      BACK ON CLAIRE -- Hand on her belly, brow furrowed.  This is 
    A JOY she is trying to connect to.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Hey.

      Claire turns to see CHARLIE.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hey.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Wanna go for that walk?

      Claire looks at him.  Sees him trying to reestablish their 
      connection.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Sure.

      He helps her up and they walk off together down the beach --


      AS JACK moves some gear, we hear a voice behind him say:

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    Stick  em up.

      Jack turns around, FINDS SAWYER, his gun actually pointing up 
      at Jack from his hip.  OUTLAW STYLE.  Jack regards him, then:

                                  JACK
                    You trying to be funny?

                                  SAWYER
                    Yeah.  But I was fresh out of pies 
                    to throw atcha.

      And we sit in this tableau for just a few moments longer.  
      Despite the smile on Sawyer s face, it s TENSE.  And it s a 
      reminder that these two are not big fans of one another.

      Finally, Sawyer turns the gun around, extends it to Jack -- 
      who, to say the least, is SURPRISED by the gesture --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       58.
      (CONT'D):3535


                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Here ya go, Sheriff.

                                  JACK
                    I asked you for this two days ago --

                                  SAWYER
                    -- and I told you to stick it.
                          (beat)
                    Guess I had a change of heart.

      SAWYER turns, starts heading out of the cave.  We re on him 
      as we see Jack in the background ask:

                                  JACK
                    What d she give you?

      Sawyer turns around, locks eyes with him.

                                  SAWYER
                    Sorry?

                                  JACK
                          (don t fucking play with 
                          me, asshole)
                    Kate.  What d she give you?

      Sawyer considers this.  Reads a hint of Jack s jealousy here.  
      And then?  He GRINS --

                                  SAWYER
                    Nothin  she wasn t willing to part 
                    with.

      Jack shakes his head.  Not gonna take the bait.  Turns his 
      back on Sawyer, resumes with his gear --

      Sawyer s grin WIDENS, pleased with himself as he again turns 
      to go -- And he BARELY hears Jack mutter to himself --

                                  JACK
                    That s why the Sox ll never win the 
                    series.

      Sawyer freezes.  Turns back --

                                  SAWYER
                    What d you just say?

      Jack keeps his back to Sawyer, continuing with his GEAR --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       59.

                                  JACK
                    Huh?

                                  SAWYER
                    What d you just say?

                                  JACK
                    I said  That s why the Red Sox will 
                    never win the Series. 

                                  SAWYER
                    What the hell does --?!?

                                  JACK
                    Something my dad used to say.  So 
                    he could go through life knowing 
                    people hated him.  Instead of 
                    taking responsibility, he put it on 
                    fate.  Said he was made that way.

      ON SAWYER as the synapses fire.  Connections are made.  
      Revelations are realized.  He can t fucking believe it.

                                  SAWYER
                    Your daddy -- He a doctor, too?

                                  JACK
                    He was.  He s dead.

      Then it occurs to Jack that he s actually having this 
        conversation with Sawyer.  He stops, turns back to him --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Why do you want to know about my 
                    father?

      AND WE HOLD ON Sawyer for a LONG BEAT -- REAL LONG.  And 
      here s his opportunity to let Jack off the hook.  To end his 
      suffering.  To tell Jack his father didn t blame him for what 
      happened.  To tell him his father did take responsibility for 
      his actions.  To tell Jack his father LOVED HIM.

      And finally --

                                  SAWYER
                    No reason.

      Oh.  Fuck.

      And ON SAWYER -- wondering how he can have more compassion 
      for a fucking boar than he can for this man...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       60.

      But if he s gonna suffer?  So is everyone fucking else.
