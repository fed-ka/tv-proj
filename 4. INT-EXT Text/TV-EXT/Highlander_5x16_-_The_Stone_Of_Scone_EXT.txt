      We are TIGHT on Fitzcairn and MacLeod.  Dawn fog drifts over
      a field bumpy with rocks and obstacles, as MacLeod and
      Fitzcairn face each other with grave solemnity, dressed for
      dueling.  They are giving each other their best Tyson/
      Hollyfield stares.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Are you ready?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Ready.  I'm going to bury you,
                    MacLeod.

      Then we PULL BACK to find MacLeod and Fitzcairn are on an
      old golf course.  They are on a raised area that serves as
      the tee.  Far down the field we see a STICK protruding from
      the ground with a limp handkerchief tied to it as a flag. 
      Fitzcairn reaches for his club.  We --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Back at the old golf course Fitzcairn is swinging, loosening
      up.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Who has the honor of the first swing?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It makes no matter to me.
                          (with a sneer)
                    Because I intend to drive you into
                    the ground.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Don't expect any mercy from me.

                                      MACLEOD
                    From an Englishman?  I dinna need
                    it.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You will when you see how I use this.
                          (he offers his club)
                    The best money can buy.  English
                    Briar.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You call that a club?

      He swings up his own club.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Now this... this is a real club.

      They glare at each other a BEAT, then turn to face the field.

      Fitzcairn uses his heel to create a dirt "tee", then drops a
      leather, feather-stuffed GOLF BALL on it.  Then he lines up
      his shot, waggles, addresses the ball and swings.

      ANGLE ON FIELD

      as the ball lands far from the flagged stick, in the rough.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Nicely done.  Is that some new English
                    strategy?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Let's see you do better.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96515  "The Stone of Scone"    8.   Final Shooting Script 12/10/96

1504CONTINUED:1504

      MacLeod steps to his ball and readies himself.  Just as he's
      about to take his swing --

      Fitzcairn makes a sudden motion with his club pointing it
      right over MacLeod's "sight line".

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    Mind the cow there.

      MacLeod has to abort his swing.  He's pissed.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                            (innocently)
                    Just trying to help.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I dinna want your help.  Or need it.

      MacLeod lines up the ball again, brings back his club, and
      just as he swings --

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (a mighty sneeze)
                    AH-CHOO!

      MacLeod flinches and hooks the ball into the rough.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Dammit, Fitzcairn, you put me off!

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    That's a lame excuse.  Anyone can
                    see your grip on the club is all
                    wrong.

      MacLeod puts a hand on Fitzcairn's throat.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There's nothing wrong with my grip.

      As Fitzcairn reacts to the hand on his throat.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      MacLeod and Fitzcairn are swinging their clubs like scythes,
      in search of lost balls.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Two strokes down, Fitzcairn.  You'll
                    be swinging a pick before the night
                    is through.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96515  "The Stone of Scone"    9.   Final Shooting Script 12/10/96

1505CONTINUED:1505

      Fitzcairn spots the two balls, lying near his feet.  He makes
      sure MacLeod isn't looking, then --

      CLOSE - MACLEOD S BALL

      as Fitzcairn STEPS on it, almost burying it against a large
      rock.  He kicks his own ball INTO THE FAIRWAY, then

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    MacLeod!  Here!

      MacLeod looks -- his face drops as he sees his ball.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How could it bury itself in the ground
                    like that?

      MacLeod studies his predicament.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                      I couldn't say.  Bad luck?
                          (re his ball)
                    You mind?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (testy)
                    Go on... Go on.

      Fitzcairn takes his swing - and chips onto the "green" -
      maybe ten feet from the hole.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                            (grudgingly)
                    Well played... for an Englishman.

      Now MacLeod swings.  His club hits the rock instead of the
      ball and breaks.  The ball doesn't move.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You can always take a penalty stroke.

      MacLeod reaches for another club.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Penalty, my ass.

      MacLeod grimaces.  He tries again.  His ball sails out --
      thunk, against a tree.  It rolls back near his feet.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I keep telling you.  Your grip.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (pissed)
                    There s nothing wrong with my grip.

1505CONTINUED: (2)1505

      Fitzcairn strolls cheerfully off as MacLeod glowers at him.


      A fuming MacLeod putts out as Fitzcairn adds up the scores.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Looks like I won t be swinging that
                    pick after all, MacLeod.
                            (cheerfully)
                    Rotten luck, you hitting into the
                    rough like that.  But you are a man
                    of honor to play it as it lay.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (not happy about it)
                    Aye.  That I am.

      They move down the field towards their tethered horses.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (reminding him)
                    And as a man of honor, you're bound
                    to help me restore the true King.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (testy)
                    I gave my word, and I'll keep it.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Tonight, the abbey is rubble.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Tonight!  Are you daft?  After last
                    night, they'll be waiting for us.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Piffle.  What can they do to us?

                                      MACLEOD
                    The same thing they did to Guy
                    Fawkes... hung, drawn and quartered.

      Fitzcairn stops, involuntarily touches his neck.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    But we Catholics have wanted to
                    restore the rightful King since
                    Cromwell!  Blowing up Westminster
                    Abbey is just what we need to rally
                    support.

1506CONTINUED:1506

                                      MACLEOD
                    You blow up the Abbey, you blow up
                    the Stone.  The Scots would never be
                    behind you then.
                          (beat)
                    And you need the Scots.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I hate it when you're right.
                          (beat)
                    There must be some way to rally men
                    to the cause.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You'd need the bloody Crown Jewels
                    to rally enough support...

      Fitzcairn stops.  A light goes on.  He looks at MacLeod with
      a spreading grin.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You are a bloody genius!

      MacLeod sees his look.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No, Fitzcairn... not the Crown
                      Jewels.... you can't!

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Why not?  It's brilliant!

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's madness!  No one gets into the
                    Tower of London... only a lunatic
                    would even try it!

                                                                                  CUT TO:



      A BURLAP SACK chinks softly to the grass.  Then a ROPE dangles
      down.  A moment later --

      MACLEOD

      rappels down the rope and stands on the grass, peering around
      him in the dark.  All clear.  He calls up --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (a whisper)
                    All clear!

      A beat later --

      FITZCAIRN slides down the rope -- and lands on MacLeod's
      SHOULDERS, riding him piggyback.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Am I supposed to carry you all the
                    way to the Tower?

      Fitzcairn clambers down.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Sorry.  No need to get huffy about
                    it.

      The two move several yards away to --

      NEW ANGLE - A DOOR

      a stout one, set into the stone of the tower proper.

      Fitzcairn examines the rusty PADLOCK on the door.  He holds
      his hand out surgeon-like.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    Mallet and chisel.

      MacLeod stares at him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I thought you had it.

      They look at each other for a BEAT, then --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I'll get the bloody tools.
                          (starts, then --)
                    Whatever you do, don't touch anything. 
                    You're an accident waiting to happen.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96515  "The Stone of Scone"    16.   Final Shooting Script 12/10/96

1509CONTINUED:1509

      He moves off in the dark.  Fitzcairn waits, miffed, then
      glances at the padlock.  A BEAT -- he draws his sword, makes
      a careful golf like adjustment to his grip - and WHACKS it. 
      It drops off.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Shows what he knows.  Bloody Scot.

      He pushes the door open and slips inside.


      ON - A PILE OF WOODEN CRATES

      as several UNIFORMED GUARDS run past at a trot, pikes and
      swords at the ready.

                                      BEEFEATER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Search every house!  They're around
                    here somewhere!

      As the FOOTSTEPS fade in the distance --

      The CRATES are pushed aside -- MacLeod and Fitzcairn clamber
      out.  Fitzcairn rubs his still-smarting rear.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    If I didn't know any better, I'd
                    think they were waiting for us.

                                      MACLEOD
                    They were.  Crimmins must have sold
                    us out.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (incensed)
                    That dishonest bastard.  We're going
                    back and get our money...

      He starts off.  MacLeod pulls him back into a doorway.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The only thing you're going to get
                    out of him is your head on a plate!
                          (beat)
                    And he wouldn't have my money if you
                    didn't steal it.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    And how you're going to let him keep
                    it?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes.
                          (beat)
                    in case it escaped your notice, we've
                    just committed an act of treason
                    against the English Crown!  If we re
                    caught, we'll be thrown in the Tower..
                          (beat)
                    And beheaded by your friend Crimmins.

                          (beat)
                    Since you put it that way, a vacation
                    in Tuscany may be in order...

      MacLeod and Fitzcairn turn and slink down the street, glancing
      over their shoulders.  Fitzcairn is walking awkwardly. 
      MacLeod glances at him.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      SUPER: SEDGEWICK GREENS, ENGLAND - 1950

      A modern golf course with manicured greens, fairways, and
      rough.  MacLeod and Fitzcairn are at the first tee, wearing
      natty golfing outfits, their golf-bags nearby.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    An open fairway, the smell of damp
                    grass, a driver in your hand --
                    reminds me of the old days.

      He swings.  His face falls as it heads down the fairway --
      and hooks into the rough.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (dry)
                    Me too.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (defensive)
                    There was a cross-wind.  I'll just
                    take my mulligan.

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                    No mulligans.

      AMANDA arriving, dressed in chic '50's women's golf wear:
      plus-fours, sweater, long hair tucked in under a golf cap --
      she looks like she was born on a green.  Trailing her is
      ANDREW, an older Scottish caddy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're late.

                                      AMANDA
                    Sorry.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Of course there are mulligans.  There
                    are always mulligans.

      Amanda turns to her old caddy.

                                      AMANDA
                    Andy.

                                      ANDREW
                    It ain't gentlemanly, sir.

                                      ANDREW (CONT'D)
                    One never takes a mulligan in a proper
                    round of golf.  It's something only
                    children and --
                          (tips his hat)
                    -- beggin' your pardon, Miss, wimmin
                    do.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    But I gave her odds.

      MacLeod shoots Amanda an accusing look.

                                      AMANDA
                    I needed the money.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Fitz; incredulous)
                    You bet against Amanda when she needs
                    money?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You think I'm taking unfair advantage?

      MacLeod winds up and swings -- it hooks into the rough.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think you're an idiot.

      Amanda steps up to the tee.  Andrew wordlessly slides out a
      three-wood and hands it to her.

                                      AMANDA
                    Three wood.  Exactly.

      She addresses the ball, takes a couple of practice swings. 
      Fitzcairn starts to put in his two cents worth --

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Easy on the backswing, Amanda.  You
                    might want to adjust your grip... a
                    little.

      Amanda winds up -- and smacks a beautiful shot straight down
      the fairway.

      ON MACLEOD AND FITZCAIRN

      hands to their eyes, watching the ball sail up.  And sail
      and sail.

      Amanda turns back to them.

                                      AMANDA
                    Sorry, Fitz... you were saying?

                    Ta-ta, boys... see you on the green.

      She starts off down the side of the fairway, Andrew following
      with her clubs.  Fitzcairn stares after her.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I think she's done this before.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Fitzcairn, she's done everything
                    before.

                    How much did you bet her?

                    A few pounds.
                          (beat)
                    A few thousand pounds... How good is
                    she?
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    Maybe she'd forget it if I asked her
                    nicely?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not a chance.

      He starts off, pulling his clubs.  A BEAT -- Fitzcairn
      follows.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      Amanda has already shot.  So has Fitzcairn.  MacLeod takes a
      mighty swing, obliterating half of the vegetation, and manages
      to "pitch" twenty yards into the fairway.

      ON FITZCAIRN

      off to the side, his ball damn near unplayable.  It's hard
      to see -- only the top visible from its nesting place between
      some rocks.

                                      AMANDA
                          (calling)

      Fitzcairn casually slips a NEW BALL from his pocket, and
      DROPS IT in an ideal position to hit out.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    No problem.  Here it is!

      He takes his swing and hits near the green.  Pleased with
      himself, he turns to pick up his bag - and is looking at
      Andrew.  Andrew points to Fitzcairn's real ball.

                                      ANDREW
                          (stern)
                    I believe that is your ball, sir.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    No, no, that's not mine.
                          (pointing to green)
                    See?  Mine's out there.  That must
                    be someone else s.

      Andrew looks to Amanda and shakes his head.  Amanda lifts
      the ball out of the rocks, and examines it.

      INSERT OF BALL

      a THREE DOT pattern inked on the dimples.

                    It was an honest mistake...

                            indignance)
                    You miserable, lying, little cheat.

      Fitzcairn shushes her, trying to keep MacLeod from
        overhearing.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Amanda, please, I'll forfeit the
                    game... The money is yours.  Just
                    don't tell MacLeod!

                    Seems our friend here is playing
                    fast and loose with the rules.

      She holds up Fitzcairn's ball.  MacLeod takes the ball, looks
      at the dots, his face tightening.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You cheated.

                    Just a simple mistake, anyone could've
                    made it...

      MacLeod's face grows cold as he advances on Fitzcairn.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I've seen you cheat at cards.  And I
                    know you cheat with women...
                          (barely getting it
                            out)
                    But GOLF?!  What kind of man cheats
                    at golf?

      He lifts his club as if it were a sword.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I'm sorry.

                    I had an unplayable lie!  I swear, I
                    haven't done it in centuries!

                          (beat -- the penny
                            drops)
                    Which century?

      Fitzcairn starts to back off.

                    A long, very long time ago.  In fact,
                    I hardly remember myself...

      MacLeod grabs Fitzcairn's shirt and drags him out of the
      rough, out of Andrew's earshot.

                                      MACLEOD

      He turns, shoulders his bag, and stalks off.  Fitzcairn
      follows.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                      MacLeod... it was a long time ago. 
                    Forgive and forget...

      As they move off --

      Amanda turns to Andrew, who is just approaching.

      Amanda, MacLeod and Fitzcairn, bundled against the cold,
      emerge from the fog and furtively move to a large CARVED
      WOODEN SIDE DOOR.  Amanda immediately goes to work with her
      locksmith tool kit as a shivering Fitzcairn looks nervously
      around.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Are you sure I agreed to this?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You agreed.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    But it's Christmas!  Nobody works on
                      Christmas!

                                      AMANDA
                    Exactly.  I've made some of my best
                    scores on Christmas.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Now shut up and let her work.

      Amanda fiddles a bit more -- the lock CLICKS open.

                                      AMANDA
                    Now for stage two.

      She slips inside.  Fitzcairn is still complaining.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You're absolutely sure?


      MacLeod and Fitzcairn struggle mightily with the Stone, slung
      between them in a net made of ropes.  As they approach their
      car -- a two-door Ford Prefect.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    You could help.

                                      AMANDA
                    I don't do lifting.

      Amanda opens the rumble-seat and they heave and shove and
      get the Stone into it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I owe you one, Amanda.

                    Bernie Crimmins?  You made a deal

                                      AMANDA
                    I had to.  I got an advance on what
                    I thought was a giant diamond.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    No one said it was a diamond.

                    No one said it wasn't.  And Crimmins
                    is expecting one.

      Suddenly a shrill POLICE WHISTLE cuts the air.

                    Cops.

      They scramble into the Ford, all three fighting for the wheel. 
      MacLeod wins.

      ON THE CAR

      as MacLeod hits the gas, and the small car screams off into
      the pea soup fog of a London night, as POLICE WHISTLES sound
      in the distance.


      Stock footage of the old Z-CARS with clanging bells -- seen
      in all the old British Detective films -- race out of the
      Scotland Yard forecourt and into the night.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

      MACLEOD, AMANDA AND FITZCAIRN

      huddled in a corner, looking at the paper.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Don't you think I'm prettier than
                    this?  The eyes are too close
                    together.  The nose is all wrong.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, as long as it doesn't look

                    the Stone now.

      ANGLE - THE CUSTOMER

      the one reading the paper.  As Amanda and Fitzcairn pass, he
      lowers it: we see he is the "BUTLER" from Crimmins' club.


      Amanda steps outside the inn, carrying a suitcase.  As she
      does --

      THREE MEN

      suddenly step from the shadows and grab her.  Amanda

      MacLeod, covered in so much dust he looks like a Pillsbury
      doughboy, is rubbing at something with a rag, it looks like

      or what looks like it.  He brushes away dust and steps back
      to appraise his handiwork.

                                          ACT : TAG

      FADE IN:


      Amanda is teeing up, MacLeod is nearby with his club arguing
      with Amanda.  Fitzcairn sits behind them on a rock, watching,
      as Amanda's about to swing.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    What's wrong with hustling golf?  We
                    could make a bloody fortune with me
                    as your coach.

      Amanda drives the ball down the center of the fairway. 
      MacLeod approaches the tee.

                                      MACLEOD
                    She doesn't need a coach, Fitz.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Are you serious?  Everyone needs a
                    coach, especially you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Really.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    Look at that grip.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There is nothing wrong with my grip.

      MacLeod hits the ball and blasts it down the fairway.

      Fitzcairn steps up with his club, starts demonstrating.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    See?  If you get the hands right,
                    slow the backswing down, the follow-
                    through comes easily.

      Smiling, Amanda moves over to MacLeod -- and looks past him
      to the rock Fitzcairn just vacated where we see --

      THE STONE OF SCONE

      is now the bench by the first tee.

                                      AMANDA
                    MacLeod, it's...

      MACLEOD

      holds up a finger, shakes his head with a smile.  This is
      their secret.  He puts his arm around her, just as Fitzcairn
      follows through on his swing.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (pleased with himself)
                    Now that's how it's done.

      He grabs his bag, and slings it over his shoulder.

                                      FITZCAIRN (CONT'D)
                    It may seem complicated, but, after
                    all, it's a Scottish game.
                          (beat)
                    I'm sorry about the stone.  We did
                    our damndest.
                          (beat)
                    Maybe somethings aren't meant to be.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You tried.

                                      FITZCAIRN
                    I'll always feel I owe you something. 
                    However long it takes, I'll make I
                    it up to you.

      He starts down the fairway.  Amanda smiles at MacLeod, and
      they follow.  As they do --

                                      AMANDA
                    Is it true that whoever sits on the
                    Stone is the rightful ruler of
                    Scotland?

                                      FITZCAIRN
                          (shaking his head)
                    So they say.

      And OFF MacLeod and Amanda's shared smiles as the three of
      them walk down the green --

      PAN BACK to the Stone of Scone, as TWO OLD LADIES approach
      with their clubs and sit on the stone bench.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
