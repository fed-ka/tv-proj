          and as it comes down, we reveal the incredible estate -  
          a small group of reporters and photographers have started
          to arrive at the scene... there are several police officers
          and cars visible as well...

          Purdy is the first one out of the chopper, ducking down
          below the rotors, followed by Johnny... and this almost
          feels like newsreel-style footage...

          Purdy shakes hands with a couple of PUBLIC RELATIONS
          persons who work for the Markoffs... Purdy intros Johnny
          in a scene we cannot hear due to the rotor blades noise... 
          Johnny looks tight somehow, some uncertainty in his eyes...

          They move toward the house....

          Finding Walt observing as Johnny approaches...

                                        WALT
                        I'm glad you're here.

          Johnny just nods and follows the lead of the family reps
          toward the house... as he passes the reporters waiting
          outside, start snapping his picture, turning video cameras


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - ACT ONE - 10/7/02 YEL   17.

          in his direction and calling his name, Johnny, Johnny,
          over here... as he glances over, he sees --

          ANGLE - DANA

          among them... she throws him a half-grin of hello which
          he returns... and we can sense he's uncomfortable...



          And the following sequence is done without dialogue...

          Johnny crouches by a cracked circle of glass that was cut
          out of a nearby sliding glass door.  There's an expectant
          hush broken only by the clicking of camera shutters.

                                                                            INTERCUTTING:


          ANGLES FROM LONG LENS CAMERAS SNAPPING

            ...and...

          NEWS CHOPPERS OVERHEAD SHOOTING VIDEO (VIDEO CAMERA ANGLES
          APPEAR AS 'LIVE' VIDEO)...

          Here he is again, the one and only Johnny Smith, front
          and center, and the whole world is watching... 


          EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF JOHNNY'S EYES

          and there's something in there we haven't seen before...
          you might almost call it fear... but fear of what?


          WIDER

          Johnny hesitates a beat, then touches the glass.  More
          furious clicks.


          EYES - VARIOUS

          watching... Walt, Goddard, Dana, Purdy, Markoff... all
          watching --


          JOHNNY

          who moves to the door itself, the edges of the cut-out
          bearing the remnants of fingerprint dust.  He touches
          that, then the door handle.

          And we may expect to ramp in, see a flash, anything, this
          is the Dead Zone after all, isn't it...

          But we don't... instead we begin a slow pull back... and
          dissolve to wider angle... and dissolve to a wider angle
          still as Johnny gets smaller and smaller in our frame...
          as Johnny moves to examine the soft ground and reaches
          out to touch it...

          And our pull back is so wide now that we can barely even
          see Johnny Smith any more...



          The Purdy limo pulls into Johnny's driveway... and Johnny
          gets out...

                        You tried - that's all anyone can
                        ask of you.  We'll write a release
                          reminding everyone that your gift
                        doesn't always work.  It will be
                        a footnote to the coverage. 
                        Nothing to be worried about.

          But Purdy's words can't mask a basic disappointment and a
          touch of personal embarrassment...

                                        PURDY
                        We'll talk tomorrow.

          He signals the driver to leave... and Johnny closes the
          door... stands there a beat as the car exits...



          Thunder rumbles as the rain comes down harder... several
          police cars remain parked in front of the estate...
            reporters huddle in media vehicles to stay warm... it now
          has all the markings of a major crime scene...





          is picking up his morning paper as Walt drives up in the
          patrol car...

                                        WALT
                        Come on... we've got a lead from
                        the copy shop...

          Johnny gets in the patrol car...



          A one-story home that's being remodeled.

          Walt's patrol car and an FBI sedan are parked outside.



          They run out, helping the poor woman who is losing her
          home... moving safely away from the house just as it erupts
          in flames and explodes in a million pieces... 

                                                                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



          An outdoor, quickly organized conference... the reporters
          and photographers stand pretty much where they were
          standing when we first saw them at the top of the show,
          though there are more of them now... there's a news
          coverage quality to this footage... as though we're one
          of the stations covering this story... Purdy, Arthur
          Markoff and Agent Goddard stand behind Johnny at a
            podium... looking like a man unused to being on
            television... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not really comfortable with
                        all this... I've never spoken in
                          a public forum like this before...
                        but today, I have no choice. 
                        Because I need to make an appeal
                        to the kidnapper of Christopher
                        Markoff...



          Walt and Goddard leading the way for an FBI SWAT team...
          they're approaching a commercial building in an urban
          area... {SWAT TECH}...

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        This was between you and me,
                        Johnny.  I was lending you a
                        helping hand every step of the
                        way... every clue that you'd need
                        to find me....



          The SWAT team rushes into the commercial building...


  6161RESUME JOHNNY/KIDNAPPER INTERCUT

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        By now, I expected you and Walt
                        to have traced the real estate
                        records from the house... found
                        out my name... figured out where
                        you might find me...



          As Johnny walks toward the structure, police search teams
          are searching the surrounding area for a body or a place
          where the boy might be hidden... they have dogs sniffing
          the ground, dumpsters... Johnny moves:


          RAMPANT LIONS - DAY

          In a neighborhood going through Urban Renewal.  As we
          tilt down to find Johnny arriving in his jeep...


          CLOSER - JOHNNY

          Looks up at the lions.  He crosses to the entrance --
          where we can see a street number, 77 -- and tries the
          front doors.  They open with a squeak...
