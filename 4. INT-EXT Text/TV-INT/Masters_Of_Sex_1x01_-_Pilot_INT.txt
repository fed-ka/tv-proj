  Black tie.  Filled to capacity.  CHANCELLOR SHEPLEY speaks 
  from the podium, bestows his benevolent gaze on DR. WILLIAM 
  MASTERS.  Masters sits at the head table, stares into middle 
  space with a vague frown, rubs his finger along the base of 
  his water glass.  He doesn t appear to notice the SQUEAK.  

  Shepley continues to tout his hospital s accomplishments, as 
  LIBBY MASTERS places her hand over her husband s to settle 
  him.  Gives a smile.  Masters SIGHS, as the woman on his other 
  side, DODIE BRODHEAD, leans toward Libby with a loud WHISPER.

                                    DODIE
                ... it was the January House & 
                Garden.  Because they were the first, 
                I m quite sure of it, to introduce 
                the whole idea of cork flooring.

                                    LIBBY
                I think I saw it in Woman s Day.

  Masters remains deaf to this CHATTER as we follow his GAZE.  
  He takes in Dodie s profile.  Her cleavage.  Her neck.  A 
  curious LOOK crosses his face, as Dodie TURNS to him brightly.  

                                    DODIE
                You re the tie-breaker, Doctor.  Cork 
                flooring vs. wall-to-wall vs...?

                                    MASTERS
                Your tracheostomy.  About seven years 
                ago.  What was the reason for it?                                                                                      2.


  Masters speaks QUIETLY, so only she can hear.  Dodie STARES at 
  him.  A beat.  Her hand slowly moves toward her neck.  

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                Don t worry, the scar isn t 
                  noticeable.  Not to an untrained eye.

  An odd moment between them.  Dodie s VOICE drops to a WHISPER.

                                    DODIE
                My jaw was... shattered.  And my 
                nose...  It was all so long ago...

  Dodie gives a little laugh to brush it off, but Masters  eyes 
  stay on her.  His GAZE then shifts to the hulking husband by 
  her side.  Shepley s voice BOOMS from the podium.  

                                    SHEPLEY
                ... his constant innovations to 
                  obstetric surgery have earned him 
                  dominance in the field.  He 
                  introduced the Infertility Research 
                Program here at Maternity, set up the 
                first... in polite company let s say 
                   donation  bank...
                            (more laughter)
                ... the first in the nation.  If I 
                hear one thing during the course of 
                my day, it s  thanks to him, we have 
                  a family.   Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. 
                William Masters...

  Masters gives Dodie a last look, SLIDES from his seat.  He 
  joins Shepley up front.  LOOKS over the crowded room.  A beat.

                                    MASTERS
                I am a man of science.  Which is why 
                I ll let my friend Chancellor Shepley  
                supply the words tonight.  And most 
                  regrettably... I have to go.  It 
                turns out I m working this evening.

                                    SHEPLEY
                            (leans in)
                Bill Masters has yet to devise the 
                baby that arrives during business 
                hours.  But mark my words.  He will.  

  The room LAUGHS again, knows well a schedule held hostage by 
  the erratic arrival of babies.  Masters NODS appreciatively.  

                                    MASTERS
                But I do thank you.  I thank you for 
                honoring me here tonight.                                                                                       3.



  A tiny room.  Mostly bed.  A small chair holds a Fedora, suit 
  jacket, a briefcase.  On the bed, ERNIE TURK kneels with his 
  pants at his ankles, poised behind the raised haunches of 
  SALLY DIMELLO.  Sally stoically receives her client s 
    affections as Ernie shifts awkwardly.  Can t find his balance.    

                                    ERNIE
                Sorry.  I m... a little...

                                    SALLY
                You re tangled.  In your pants.

  Ernie sees she s right, attempts to kick himself free as...

  ANGLE - THROUGH A PEEPHOLE

  A single eye PRESSES against the opening.  The eye BLINKS.  
  The pas de deux on the bed clearly visible as we...

  PULL BACK TO REVEAL - WILLIAM MASTERS

  Flush against the closet door.  He sweats into his tuxedo 
  shirt, his legs cramped from standing.  He PULLS AWAY from the 
  peephole.  Trains a small flashlight on the clipboard in his 
  hand.  He GLANCES at his stopwatch.  Shakes his head.   

  Masters jams the light in his mouth, scribbles on the board, 
  just as the light drops and CLATTERS to the floor.  Masters 
  freezes.  Quickly puts his eye back to the aperture.

  RESUME - SALLY 

  As she GLARES toward the closet, mouths the words,  Shut the 
  fuck up.   But Ernie is oblivious to the intruder as he flails 
  away.  Time seems to stretch into eternity.  Sally rolls her 
  eyes.  Exasperated.  Tired.  Suddenly starts to MOAN.  

                                    SALLY (CONT D)
                Oh my God... so good... you re a 
                fucking animal, Ernie...  I m gonna 
                come... Oh my God... I m gonna...  

  Sally SCREAMS, her sudden burst of enthusiasm causing Ernie to 
  finally climax, as their SHOUTS ricochet around the tiny room, 
  and we go back to...

  MASTERS 

  As he watches this.  An inscrutable expression on his face.  
  He CHECKS his stopwatch.  Notes the time on his board.  He 
  sinks onto the small stool behind him with a weary SIGH.  
  Switches off the flashlight with a CLICK.                                                                                      4.



  A jumble of equipment as Masters, in his lab coat and bow tie, 
  PUSHES an unwieldy EKG machine across the polished linoleum.  
  DR. IRA GALL, young and charmingly cocksure, reclines on the 
  exam table, feet propped comfortably on the stirrups.   

                                    GALL
                They placed her in our department.  
                  Insurance processing.  Out on that 
                desk in the hall, which makes it very 
                  convenient to casually run into her.

  Masters YANKS out the stirrups.  Gall s legs FLOP awkwardly.  

                                    MASTERS
                My patients hate stirrups.  Yours?

                                    GALL
                  Stirrups.  Pap smears.  Husbands.  
                Although that also provides for some 
                  opportunities.  Anyway, rumor is the 
                new girl s just now getting divorced.   

  Masters regards the stirrups.  Then SHOVES them in a cupboard.

                                    GALL (CONT D)
                  Ex-husband s a band leader, she was 
                his singer, so she s probably dying 
                for something stable.  A doctor type.

                                    MASTERS
                Grab the other side.  

  Gall hops down to help as Masters LEANS INTO the next piece of 
    equipment.  They now SLIDE an EEG machine across the floor.

                                    GALL
                This EEG isn t... you re not still 
                going ahead with that, are you?

                                    MASTERS
                Going ahead and about to enter the 
                second phase.  Enthusiasm is 
                  building.  Support grows every day...

                                    GALL
                Support from...?

                                    MASTERS
                  Shepley s going to present my 
                proposal to the Board tomorrow.  In 
                the meantime, I m looking for 
                  volunteers.                                                                                         7.


                                    GALL
                I say this with the greatest respect, 
                Bill.  Even affection.  But this 
                study of yours is doomed.

                                    MASTERS
                You want to bet?  Or would you rather 
                bet on the fact this will 
                  revolutionize the face of medicine?

                                    GALL
                They ll sooner approve a trip to the 
                moon.  How would the Board even begin 
                to defend this to the donors?

                                    MASTERS
                They won t have to.  The program will 
                be conducted in perfect secrecy.  

                                    GALL
                In a teaching hospital.  Where no one 
                ever gossips.

  Masters SHOVES the machine into place beside the other one.  
  He begins to UNRAVEL the wires.  Gall shakes his head.

                                    GALL (CONT D)
                If it does ever get up and running... 
                can I watch?

                                    MASTERS
                When it does, no.

                                    GALL
                            (shrugs, then)
                Come meet the new girl with me?

                                    MASTERS
                          (a long look)
                Do you not have patients, Dr. Gall?  
                Because I ll happily reassign yours 
                to Dr. Allen if you re too busy.  

  A beat, as Gall is reminded he can only push Masters so far.  

                                    GALL
                I ll be in my office.  And your 
                secret here is safe with me.  
                  Obviously.  

                                    MASTERS
                  Obviously.

  As Masters makes it very clear where Gall stands.                                                                                      8.



  Masters MOVES through the busy hospital, oblivious to the 
  crush of humanity around him.  As he nears the processing 
  desk, his GAZE lands on the new girl.  He SLOWS.  Dark-haired 
  and vivacious, VIRGINIA JOHNSON smiles at a patient.  Hands 
  over forms.  Gives their arm a reassuring squeeze.  Masters 
  WATCHES her.  A beat.  Until a stern VOICE startles him.

                                    VOICE
                Dr. Masters...

  Masters TURNS.  His secretary, MISS HORCHOW, gives him a 
  loaded LOOK, both injured and defiant.  Masters SIGHS.  


  MISS HORCHOW sits rigidly across the desk as Masters braces 
  for the inevitable.  She FLICKS a sheet of paper in her hand.

                                    MISS HORCHOW
                The interviews you ve requested 
                appear to me to be secretarial 
                  candidates.  Now either we re adding 
                staff to our office or I m being 
                  replaced.  Would you care to clarify?  

                                    MASTERS
                            (beat, finally)
                The job has changed, Miss Horchow. 

                                    MISS HORCHOW
                But why wasn t I told about this 
                change?  And why wouldn t I be right 
                for this  new job ?  

                                    MASTERS
                Because I have another, new study 
                pending.  One that will require a 
                  secretary not at all... squeamish.  

                                    MISS HORCHOW
                            (offended)
                Dr. Masters... I grew up on a farm.  
                I have beheaded chickens.

                                    MASTERS
                I can imagine it.  But did you ever 
                see one of those chickens fake an 
                orgasm?  More importantly, do you 
                know why a woman would fake an 
                orgasm?  Because that s one of the 
                  questions I hope to answer.
                            (dead silence, then)
                                    (MORE)                                                                                      9.

                                    MASTERS (CONT'D)
                The new job will require taking 
                sexual histories in intimate, 
                explicit detail.  And to be honest... 
                you don t seem the kind of woman that 
                would cotton to such a task. 

  Miss Horchow slowly STANDS.  Red-faced.  Gathers her dignity.  

                                    MISS HORCHOW
                I m not sure what kind of woman 
                would.  I m not sure what kind of 
                woman could hold her head up in 
                church every Sunday knowing she d 
                spent the entire week talking smut.

                                    MASTERS
                Science.

                                    MISS HORCHOW
                Slap on any fancy term you d like. 
                            (off his look)
                I will schedule the first round of 
                  interviews as early as tomorrow.

                                    MASTERS
                Thank you, Miss...

  But the door SHUTS before he can finish.


  Masters EXITS his office as Miss Horchow pointedly AVOIDS his 
  gaze, pretends to be busy.  Masters CONTINUES down the hall.  
  A beat, then he notices Gall standing with Johnson.  

  Gall HOLDS her coat as Johnson grabs her purse.  The two 
  continue to the elevator.  They CHAT easily.  Gall says 
  something to make her LAUGH.  Masters WATCHES them until they 
  disappear inside the lift.  


  Gall TURNS to Johnson, beside him on the bench seat.  She 
  chooses her words carefully as she finishes her thought.  

                                    JOHNSON
                ... I suppose OB-GYN seemed like the 
                best place for... advancement, quite 
                  honestly.                                                                                    10.


                                    GALL
                  Advancement.  Miss Virginia Johnson, 
                soon to be Dr. Virginia Johnson.

                                    JOHNSON
                Poke fun, but I am capable of more 
                than insurance forms.  Plus I ve had 
                babies, I ve been on those exam 
                  tables... maybe I can help women by 
                being a friendly face for a change.  

                                    GALL
                There s also a high turn-over in 
                  obstetrics.  You can use that to your 
                  advantage if you re smart about it.  

                                    JOHNSON
                I will keep my eyes open.

                                    GALL
                Because I am more than happy to 
                champion the intelligent, capable, 
                  beautiful ones when they come along. 

  Johnson smiles, OPENS the door to exit.  Gall touches her arm.

                                    GALL (CONT D)
                I mean it.  Let me help you.  In the 
                  meantime... well... there s no one 
                waiting for me at home.

                                    JOHNSON
                I have two children waiting for me.

                                    GALL
                Are your kids friendly?  Because 
                maybe they ll take pity on me and 
                invite me in.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (laughs, then)
                I do appreciate the ride, Dr. Gall.

                                    GALL
                Ira.  And I ll take that to mean 
                you d like me to shove off.  

                                    JOHNSON
                  Actually, I look forward to knowing 
                you.  Maybe even becoming friends.  
                But that s all it will be.  It s all 
                my life can accommodate right now.

  Gall NODS.  Tries to hide his disappointment.                                                                                      11.


                                    GALL
                Sorry.  I must look like an idiot.  
                But the truth is... all I could think 
                about the entire drive home was 
                kissing you.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (watches him, smiles)
                Friends can kiss.

  As we HOLD ON Gall s face, not exactly sure what this means.


  Masters stands in the atriumed foyer, flips through the mail.  
  Pat Boone sings  Love Letters In The Sand  on the stereo.  
  Masters LOOKS UP, notices the music.  MOVES into...   


  Where Masters finds a Corning Ware casserole simmering on the 
  stove.  He OPENS the oven, a chocolate souffle begins to rise.  
  He takes this in, then GLANCES into...

  ANGLE - THE DINING ROOM 

  Where candles FLICKER on a Paul McCobb table set for two.

  RESUME - MASTERS

  He frowns.  Just as Libby ENTERS, an unopened bottle of 
  champagne in her hands.  A happy smile lights up her face.   

                                    LIBBY
                Daddy.  On time tonight.  That alone 
                is cause for celebration.

  A quick KISS on the lips, then Libby hands him the bottle to 
  open, removes her apron.  Masters GESTURES toward the table.

                                    MASTERS
                Candles usually mean guests.

                                    LIBBY
                Not tonight.  Just us two.

  Libby sets aside her apron, reveals a pretty dress underneath.                                                                                    12.


  Masters WATCHES as she moves to him, and almost shyly, slips 
  her arms around his waist.  Masters returns with a polite hug.

                                    MASTERS
                You took your temperature.
                            (off her nod)
                That doesn t mean you have to make a 
                souffle, Lib.

                                    LIBBY
                It s romantic.  It s chocolate.  
                  Chocolate makes people feel... 

  She doesn t finish the thought, as her cheeks flush a lovely 
  shade of pink.  They share a LOOK.  Masters manages a smile.    


  Masters stands alone before the mirror.  He holds a copy of 
  PLAYBOY in his hands, the centerfold unfurled before him.  He 
  STARES at the image.  Then refolds it, sets it back down.  He 
  grabs a copy of STAG, the next magazine in the stack.    

  He FLIPS through the pages, a curious expression on his face, 
    impossible to tell if this is stimulation or some kind of 
  punishment.  Another beat, he sets this aside, GRABS the 
  entire stack and SHOVES them into the back of a cupboard.  

  Masters unties his shoes, REMOVES them.  Then takes off his 
  pants, revealing plain white boxers underneath.  He TURNS to 
  leave, then stops.  He slips off his suit jacket, but leaves 
  on his shirt and bow tie.  Finally OPENS the door.     


  Masters ENTERS, finds Libby waiting in one of their two twin 
  beds.  She PULLS BACK the covers to reveal a modest nightgown.  
  He CROSSES.  Sits beside her.  She takes his hands gently.     

                                    LIBBY
                A quick prayer first, Daddy.
                            (she closes her eyes)
                Dear Lord... please bring us the baby 
                we already love and adore.  Amen.

  Masters NODS.  A beat.  They kiss.  Then Masters takes Libby s 
    shoulders, turns her away from him.  He moves on top of her, 
  they begin to have sex, and in under ten seconds, this 
    unceremonious act is over.  A beat.  Masters sits back up.       

                                    MASTERS
                On your bottom now.  Knees to chest.

  Libby obliges as she WATCHES her husband.  A beat.                                                                                     13.


                                    LIBBY
                We could look in each other s eyes 
                  sometimes...  

                                    MASTERS
                Once you re pregnant.  Until then, 
                this is the most effective position.

  Libby NODS, but even she knows there s more to it than that.  

                                    LIBBY
                What do you see when you look at me?

  Masters hesitates.  Clearly doesn t want to have this 
    conversation.  Answers honestly nonetheless.

                                    MASTERS
                Love.

  Libby NODS again.  Then wriggles around so her head rests in 
  his lap.  She WRAPS her arms tightly around him.  

                                    LIBBY
                Love.

  A moment between them.  Masters reaches down, STROKES her 
  hair, his affection for his wife very real.  Equally as real 
  as his complete inability to take in her adoration.


  Master and Gall WEAVE through the crowded corridor.  Gall 
  tries unsuccessfully to keep his voice to a WHISPER.

                                    GALL
                It was like something out of a movie. 
                I mean, that kind of movie.  First I 
                get the  just friends  speech.  Next 
                thing I know, I get a blow job.  A 
                blow job.  Right there in the car.
                            (off Master s look)
                  Fellatio...

                                    MASTERS
                I know what it is.

                                    GALL
                What it is... is incredible.  And 
                  thrilling.  And so, so sexy.  Jesus.  

  Gall shakes his head.  Masters pretends to be bored by this.  

                                    GALL (CONT D)
                But... what does it mean?                                                                                    14.


                                    MASTERS
                What does a blow job mean?  What are 
                you, a girl? 

                                    GALL
                Okay, who cares what it means and why 
                she did it.  Although I do think it s 
                the rare bird that is both elegant 
                and smart and volunteers that kind of 
                thing.  All I do know for sure is I m 
                going to marry that woman.

  Maters gives a weary LOOK as a desk nurse WAVES him over.  

                                    NURSE
                Code blue in the ER, Dr. Masters.  C-
                section, bleeding out...  

                                    MASTERS
                Scrub up and assist, Dr. Gall.

                                    GALL
                            (nods, starts to move)
                I m right behind you...

  And before Masters can protest, Gall is RUNNING the opposite 
  direction down the hall.


  As JANE MARTIN, perky and efficient, ORGANIZES files into 
  orderly stacks.   Johnson listens.  Takes detailed notes.   

                                    JANE
                ... these are insured patients and 
                Dr. Phillips insists these files be 
                separate from ward patients, who are 
                walk-ins and usually poor.  Dr. Hunt, 
                he wants his files kept in storage...

                                    JOHNSON
                            (stops writing)
                I need a directory.  I need to know 
                all the doctors  names, their 
                  departments, their titles...

                                    JANE
                ... their quirks, their incomes, 
                their marital status, their 
                  availability despite their marital 
                  status...

  Jane GIGGLES as she pulls out a heavy tome, PLUNKS it on the 
  desk.  Johnson begins to FLIP through the pages.                                                                                      15.


                                    JOHNSON
                For example, if I wanted to know 
                about Dr. Gall... 

                                    JANE
                You would go to obstetrics.  Dr. Ira 
                Gall.  First year fellow.  OB/GYN. 
                            (off Johnson s look)
                He s one of the young pups.

                                    JOHNSON
                And his boss is...?

                                    JANE
                Dr. Masters.  He s the alpha dog of 
                coochie medicine.

  Jane SNICKERS again as she flips to Masters  name.

                                    JANE (CONT D)
                Masters is brilliant.  Some say he s 
                the best women s doctor in the entire 
                Midwest.  But if you get flustered 
                around him, look out.  Even his 
                  secretary, Miss Horchow, no picnic 
                herself, she s leaving because, in 
                her words, Dr. Masters is demanding 
                and weird...

  As an out-of-breath Gall suddenly APPEARS.  He GRABS Johnson s 
  hand, and before she can protest, PULLS her from the desk.

                                    GALL
                I want to show you something.  
                            (off Johnson s surprise)
                Your man in action.

  As he RUNS with Johnson down the hall.  


  Masters BLOWS into the theater, fully scrubbed, Gall now on 
  his heels.  The room resembles a slaughterhouse.  Blood 
  everywhere.  A dead fetus wrapped in a sheet to one side.  Two 
  DOCTORS and staff TURN to Masters.  Their panic palpable.

                                    DOCTOR
                She s lost over 4000 cc s, Bill...

                                    MASTERS
                Placenta previa?

                                    DOCTOR
                  Precreata...                                                                                    16.


  Masters and Gall exchange a LOOK.  A ghastly condition.  The 
  room immediately cedes to Masters  authority.

                                    MASTERS
                How long has she been on the table?

                                    DOCTOR
                  Ninety-eight minutes...

  Masters MOVES to the ravaged patient, a young African American 
  woman, clearly dying.  He touches the nearly empty blood bag 
  on the IV pole.

                                    MASTERS
                How many bags? 

                                      ASSISTING NURSE
                Four.

                                    MASTERS
                Two more, 500 cc s.  Another on deck.

  Gall gets to work, GLANCES up at the high row of windows as...

  ANGLE - THE GALLERY

  Virginia Johnson stands at the glass, eyes wide, as she LOOKS 
  DOWN on the grisly scene.  

  RESUME - THE OPERATING THEATER

  Gall takes this in, pleased, quickly TURNS BACK to the crisis 
  before them as Masters REACHES in the gaping incision.

                                    MASTERS
                  Respiratory, heart rate, BP...?

                                      ASSISTING NURSE
                36.  125.  80 over 40.

                                    MASTERS
                            (shakes his head)
                Which one of you geniuses is her doc?

                                    DOCTOR
                She s a ward patient...  

                                    MASTERS
                Well... you didn t get all the 
                  placenta, for starters.  Twelve gauze 
                packs, Dr. Gall...

                                    DOCTOR
                  I already used twelve...                                                                                    17.


                                    MASTERS
                Twelve more and a no. 10 scalpel.

  Gall hops to it, as again he GLANCES up to see...

  ANGLE - JOHNSON

  Her eyes still glued to the unfolding drama.  We FOLLOW her 
  gaze, then suddenly realize it s not Gall that Johnson is 
  watching at all, but... 

  MASTERS

  As he takes the scalpel and gets to work, trains his laser-
  like focus on the carnage before him.  Until for one brief 
  moment, he glances up, LOOKS Johnson directly in the eye as...

  JOHNSON

  Realizes Masters has been aware of her all along.  The 
  smallest LOOK between them.  Then Masters puts his head down, 
  gets back to the grisly business of saving a woman s life.


  Masters and Gall at the sinks as the residue of the ordeal 
  SWIRLS down the drain.  Gall yanks off his bloody shirt, HUMS 
  happily to himself.  Masters gives him a LOOK.  Keeps washing.


  As Johnson SCOOPS up a stack of paperwork from her desk.  Jane 
  SCRIBBLES beside her.  Phone to her ear.  Johnson GESTURES.

                                    JOHNSON
                I ll deliver these on my break.  

                                    JANE
                            (whispers)
                Let the messenger boys do that...

  But Johnson just smiles, MOVES OFF with the files anyway.


  Johnson ENTERS the waiting area to find every seat filled with 
  secretarial candidates.  The women fill out applications, read 
    magazines, check their lipstick.  Johnson takes stock of the 
  applicant pool.  MOVES toward Miss Horchow s desk.


  As Masters, meticulous again in his lab coat and bow tie, 
  makes his way down the hall.  He MOVES into...                                                                                    18.



  Where he enters and STOPS.  He takes in the sea of women.  
  Frowns.  Until his GAZE lands on Johnson.  A beat.  Then he 
  CROSSES.  Johnson notices him as he approaches.  Pulls herself 
  up with confidence.  Holds out her hand. 

                                    JOHNSON
                Dr. Masters.  We haven t yet...

                                    MASTERS
                Are you here to interview or on some 
                other business?  

  An odd beat.  Johnson lowers her hand.  Decides right there.

                                    JOHNSON
                Can you squeeze me in now?


  The TICK of a wall clock as Johnson now sits across the desk 
  from Masters.  She gives a polite SMILE.   

                                    JOHNSON
                I m sure it seems unorthodox, going 
                from night club singer to secretary.  
                But I am very capable.  Organized.  
                I m the hardest worker I know... 

                                    MASTERS
                You don t know me.

                                    JOHNSON
                I assume that comes with the job.

  Johnson SMILES again.  Manages to keep her composure in the 
  face of Masters  formidable scrutiny.  A long beat of SILENCE.  

                                    MASTERS
                Any education in medicine?

                                    JOHNSON
                            (an odd flicker, then)
                I was an undergrad at Drury College.  

                                    MASTERS
                  Studying...?

                                    JOHNSON
                Music.  

                                    MASTERS
                So you graduated with a BA.                                                                                      19.


                                    JOHNSON
                  Actually... marriage interfered 
                before I could graduate.  But I m 
                enrolled in classes now, here at the 
                  University.  I ll have my degree by 
                year s end.

                                    MASTERS
                In...?

                                    JOHNSON
                The... sciences.  Behavioral Science.

                                    MASTERS
                            (considers this, then)
                  Interfered.  You didn t want to get 
                married?

                                    JOHNSON
                          (a beat)
                Are we talking about my husbands 
                again? 

                                    MASTERS
                There s more than one?

                                    JOHNSON
                Two.  I stopped at two.

                                    MASTERS
                So... the first marriage was for 
                  interference.  The second was for...? 

                                    JOHNSON
                  Children.  I have a boy and a girl.

                                    MASTERS
                Is that unusual?

                                    JOHNSON
                I think it s average, statistically.

                                    MASTERS
                Is it unusual that you didn t marry 
                for love in either marriage?

                                    JOHNSON
                          (a beat, finally)
                You re surrounded by women.  Perhaps 
                you can best answer that question.

                                    MASTERS
                I m curious what you have to say.                                                                                    20.


                                    JOHNSON
                  Alright...  well... Good Housekeeping 
                quizzes will tell you women marry for 
                love.  Or what they think is love.  
                But I think they often confused love 
                with physical attraction.

                                    MASTERS
                Sex.  

                                    JOHNSON
                Yes.  Women often think sex and love 
                are the same thing.  But they don t 
                have to be.  They don t even have to 
                go together.  Sex can be perfectly 
                good on its own, while love is...

  Johnson SHRUGS.  Masters watches her carefully.  Finally.

                                    MASTERS
                I don t think I ve ever heard a woman 
                express such an opinion.

                                    JOHNSON
                It s not a theory I trot out at 
                dinner parties.  But you re a doctor.  
                I assume you re not easily... 
                  flustered.
                            (off his look, beat)
                Did she live?
                            (off his blank look)
                The woman in surgery today?

                                    MASTERS
                Yes. 

                                    JOHNSON
                Would she have died if you hadn t 
                stepped in?

                                    MASTERS
                            (matter of fact)
                Yes.

                                    JOHNSON
                Then I envy you.  That s a day well 
                spent.

  A LOOK between them.  Johnson GLANCES at her watch.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                They re very strict about my break.

  Masters NODS as she stands to leave.  A beat.                                                                                    21.


                                    MASTERS
                Since you brought up the subject of 
                sex...

                                    JOHNSON
                  Actually, you did...

                                    MASTERS
                Why would a woman fake an orgasm?

                                    JOHNSON
                              (considers, then)
                To get the man to climax quickly.  
                Usually so the woman can get back to 
                whatever it is she d rather be doing.

  Masters WATCHES her a long beat.  Finally smiles.  


  As Johnson stands at the counter, fills out the requisite 
    admissions forms.  An ADVISOR, weary and middle-aged, watches 
  Johnson with obvious annoyance.  She GLANCES at the clock.

                                    JOHNSON
                I know it s late, but I need to sign 
                up for classes now.  Get myself in 
                the system.  Officially registered as 
                  a student and... all that. 

  Johnson SMILES, turns back to the applications.  The woman 
  gives her a suspicious look.  Reluctantly OPENS a catalogue.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                I was thinking my emphasis of study 
                could be nature vs. nurture.  I 
                recently read an article and found 
                the subject very informative.  

                                    ADVISOR
                We don t offer that as a major.

                                    JOHNSON
                I don t mean as a major, necessarily.  
                But the subject must fall in the 
                  department of Behavioral Sciences 
                or... something.

                                    ADVISOR
                We don t have a department of 
                  Behavioral Sciences.

  An uneasy beat, as Johnson realizes her earlier blunder.                                                                                     22.


                                    JOHNSON
                Well... the article was very 
                  interesting.  It made me look at my 
                children in a whole new light.  It 
                even made me think back to my own 
                  childhood and how I was raised.

                                    ADVISOR
                My advice?  Go home to your children.  
                Figure out what it is you want...

                                    JOHNSON
                I want a degree.  In an interesting 
                subject.  Something... important.  

                                    ADVISOR
                When I was your age, I thought my 
                children were important.

                                    JOHNSON
                          (a deadly look, finally)
                Do you have a Sociology department?
                            (off her nod)
                Then I would like you to sign me up 
                in the Sociology department.  As an 
                  undeclared major.  Now.

  Johnson TURNS back to her forms.  Fills them out determinedly.


  Shepley paces as he WAVES Masters  proposal in his direction.

                                    SHEPLEY
                I did promise I would present this to 
                the board, but that was before I read 
                it.  You do know what s in here?

                                    MASTERS
                            (with a look)
                I wrote it specifically to showcase 
                this as a physiological study...

                                    SHEPLEY
                It s smut, Bill.  That s how every 
                board member will see it.  As 
                  pornography.  Or prostitution.  Or 
                  something equally depraved.

                                    MASTERS
                You didn t even show it to them.

                                    SHEPLEY
                Because I live in the real world.                                                                                    23.


                                    MASTERS
                Where the real offense is the medical 
                  community s total ignorance about 
                sex.  There are libraries on how 
                babies are born, not a single study 
                on how babies are made.  We are 
                doctors, for chrissake, and I simply 
                want to answer the question -- What 
                happens to the body during sex?

                                    SHEPLEY
                By using live subjects, flopping

                    Self-stimulating...

                                    MASTERS
                  Monitored for the collection of 
                  physiological data...

                                    SHEPLEY
                For chrissake, Bill, why are you 
                doing this?  You own this place.  
                Your practice is the envy of every 
                doctor in this hospital...

                                    MASTERS
                My practice is a revolving door of 
                  cripples.  Women disappointed, 
                  confused, even tortured by sex.  They 
                are desperate for help, and you know 
                what advice I have to offer?  Get a 
                divorce, get used to it, or cheat.

                                    SHEPLEY
                Let psychiatrists help those women.  
                It s not medicine...

                                    MASTERS
                It is medicine, and I m so far out in 
                front of it that I m the only one 
                that can see it.
                            (off Shepley s look)
                I want the truth.
                            (beat)
                I want to make my name in uncharted 
                  territory.
                            (another beat)
                I want a Nobel Prize.                                                                                    24.


                                    SHEPLEY
                Then this discussion is over.  This 
                study will never be seen as serious 
                science and you will be labeled a 
                pervert.  You can thank me later for 
                saving you from yourself.

  As we HOLD ON Master s face...


  Masters enters brusquely, SLAMS the door behind him.  He moves 
  through the foyer, passes by...


  Where Libby STARES at their new RCA 21-inch TV.  A grainy 
  black and white image of Elvis Presley moves across the 
  screen, hips swiveling irresistibly as he sings  Hound Dog.   
  Libby turns as Masters approaches.  GESTURES to the TV.  

                                    LIBBY
                The Ed Sullivan show. 
                            (with a look)
                Imagine what my mother would say if 
                she could see this boy.

  Masters LOOKS toward the TV and the sexual energy that jumps 
  off the screen.  He crosses to the set, snaps it OFF.  

                                    MASTERS
                I need to go out.  

                                    LIBBY
                Now?  Your dinner s in the warmer...

                                    MASTERS
                Slide it all in the sink.  I want my 
                martini shaken by Vito tonight.

                                    LIBBY
                What... happened?  You look...

                                    MASTERS
                Like what?  Like I spent the last 
                hour of my busy day explaining to a 
                man not normally an imbecile why he s 
                now being pathetically short-sighted 
                and cowardly?
                            (off her face)
                Shepley refuses to present my study.

                Which study...?                                                                                    25.


                                    MASTERS
                It s an adjunct to the infertility 
                work.  It s... it s complicated...

                                    LIBBY
                Tell me anyway...

                                    MASTERS
                It s about how the human body reacts 
                to... various physical stimuli...

  Masters STARES at his wife.  An odd moment, as Masters 
  realizes he can t say this in front of her.  

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                Don t make me explain this now.  I 
                want a drink, then another drink, 
                then I want to hear about your day.

                                    LIBBY
                My day?  Nevermind about my day.  

  Libby LOOKS at her husband, then suddenly BURSTS into tears.  
  Masters CROSSES to her, completely taken aback.   

                                    MASTERS
                What...?  Libby... 

                                    LIBBY
                I... had a... a visitor...

                                    MASTERS
                            (beat, as he realizes)
                But you said your basal temp spiked 
                last night.  That puts you mid-cycle, 
                not starting a new one...

                                    LIBBY
                Do we have to discuss this...?

                                    MASTERS
                But if you don t correctly monitor...

                                    LIBBY
                            (now sobbing)
                I am just... so tired.  Alright?  Of 
                being a failure.  At the one thing we 
                want most.  Two years and nothing.  
                Nothing.  What kind of woman can t 
                have a baby?  What kind of woman 
                can t give her husband a child...?  

                                    MASTERS
                Lib... honey... let s not...                                                                                     26.


  But Libby only cries harder.  Masters sits there, at a total 
  loss, until Libby stands and HURRIES from the room.  A beat.  
  Masters CROSSES to the liquor cabinet, GRABS a bottle of gin 
  and a glass.  He POURS a healthy slug.  Downs it in one gulp.


  Johnson leaves a stack of papers on Masters  desk as he works.  
  She waits for his attention.  He GLANCES up.      

                                    JOHNSON
                These forms need your signature.

  Masters nods.  Johnson gives a polite smile, TURNS to leave.  

                                    MASTERS
                My wife is coming in tomorrow.  We ve 
                decided she ll join my cervical cap 
                trial.  I ve had great success with 
                it, and I d appreciate it if you help 
                her through the admissions process.

                                    JOHNSON
                Of course.  I m sorry.  I can imagine 
                  infertility is very stressful.

                                    MASTERS
                For Libby it is, yes.

                                    JOHNSON
                But not for you?

  Masters LOOKS at her.  Not interested in answering that.

                                    MASTERS
                Libby has a reproductive tract 
                  incompatible with conception, which 
                is stressful for her.  And certainly 
                it s no secret infertility is 
                  distracting.  And time-consuming.  
                Filled with all sorts of drama while 
                at the same time being endlessly 
                tedious and annoying.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (off his obvious annoyance)
                For her.

                                    MASTERS
                            (reads her look)
                  Anyway... I ve helped so many other 
                couples conceive, it seems impossible 
                I can t help my own wife.                                                                                    27.


                                    JOHNSON
                It does seem unlikely.   Anyway... my 
                shift ended an hour ago...

                                    MASTERS
                Right.  You can go.  

  Masters STANDS to walk her out.  They MOVE toward the door.

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                But don t get too attached to regular 
                hours in this office.  Reproduction 
                is a round-the-clock business.  

  As they MOVE through the door...


  Masters is surprised to find Gall PERCHED on Johnson s desk.  
  He gives Gall a look, as Johnson GRABS her coat and purse.  

                                    GALL
                I warned her you re a slave driver.

                                    JOHNSON
                I don t mind the late hours.  I just 
                need some warning to make 
                  arrangements for my children.

  Masters NODS, as they move off together.  He CALLS after her.

                                    MASTERS
                Good first day.

  Johnson turns back.  Gives him a SMILE.  Gall tucks Johnson s 
  arm under his, gives Masters a knowing grin.  Masters WATCHES 
  them until they re gone.


  Gall pulls into her drive as Johnson relays the day s events.

                                    JOHNSON
                ... of course, I didn t dare admit I 
                had no idea what a cervical cap is.

                                    GALL
                It s a device Masters invented 
                himself.  Basically a rubber cap that 
                takes dud sperm and places it right 
                against the cervix.

                                    JOHNSON
                 Dud  sperm?                                                                                    28.


                                    GALL
                Or in Masters  case, no sperm.  Most 
                men in the study have a low sperm 
                count.  Masters  is close to zero.  

                                    JOHNSON
                No.  He told me himself.  His wife is 
                the one with the problem...

  Gall LAUGHS as she realizes.  Gall parks.  Kills the engine.

                                    GALL
                Don t take it personally.  I mean, I 
                love Bill.  He s taught me so much.  
                  Championed me when I was a resident.  
                I owe him... everything, really.  But 
                his ego...?  There is no way in hell 
                the great Bill Masters is going to 
                admit he s shooting blanks.

                                    JOHNSON
                Except to you.

  Gall shrugs as Johnson takes this in.  Gall WATCHES her.  

                                    GALL
                Is there any chance you could, you 
                know... kiss me again?  I feel stupid 
                asking but... well, it s the only 
                thing I could think about all day.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (considers him, finally)
                I m not sure I d call it kissing.  
                But... alright.  If you return the 
                favor.

  Gall NODS.  But again, not entirely sure what she means.


  Gall and Johnson now tangled in the sheets.  Naked.  Sweaty.  
  It s clear Gall has never had sex like this in his life.  They 
  tussle like two cats in a bag.  Gall presses into her.  She 
  holds him off.  He MOANS, a mix of ecstasy and frustration.     

                                    GALL
                Come on...

                                    JOHNSON
                No... we had a deal...

                                    GALL
                I ve never done that before...                                                                                     29.


  Johnson ROLLS on top of him.  Puts her nose to his.

                                    JOHNSON
                Whatever feels good to you... you do 
                the same to me.

                                    GALL
                          (a look)
                You don t have a penis.

                                    JOHNSON
                Is that what they taught you in 
                medical school?

                                    GALL
                I m not finding school very helpful 
                right now...

                                    JOHNSON
                            (kisses him)
                  Confidence, Doctor.  That s the key. 

                                    GALL
                            (beat, a deep breath)
                  Confidence.  

  Johnson NODS.  Gall steels himself, literally in over his head 
  as he disappears under the covers.  After a beat.

                                    GALL (CONT D)
                My God... this is even sexier...

  As Johnson smiles, clearly in agreement.  Then Gall s VOICE. 

                                    GALL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                Is that alright?  

                                    JOHNSON
                Ira, shut up.

                                    GALL
                What...?

                                    JOHNSON
                Shut.  Up.

                                    GALL
                            (pops up beside her)
                Too much talking?

  She takes his face in her hands.  LOOKS him in the eye.  

                                    JOHNSON
                It s good.  It s great.  I want more.                                                                                     30.


                                    GALL
                Really?
                            (off her nod)
                You are the most beautiful creature 
                I ve ever seen.

  Johnson smiles, clearly charmed.  Gall returns the smile, 
  suddenly filled with all the confidence in the world.  


  As Masters sits with the young black women from the operating 
  room, JOSEPHINE MAY.  A tangle of tubes and wires connect her 
  to machines.  She looks at Masters.  Her grief palpable.  

                                    MAY
                I can see it... the nurses... they re 
                  thinking... why s she not in the 
                Negro ward?

                                    MASTERS
                You re not in the Negro ward because 
                I moved you here.  This is where 
                you ll get the best care.  

  May watches him a beat.  The tears fall despite her efforts.

                                    MAY
                That baby... was everything...

                                    MASTERS
                          (a beat)
                You ll have another.

                                    MAY
                I don t think so... 

                                    MASTERS
                Mrs. May... I m your doctor now.  And 
                when I say I will work day and night 
                until you leave this hospital with a 
                baby in your arms... that s what will 
                happen.  Do you understand?  

  May STARES at him, ravaged by sadness, desperate to believe.


  As Johnson and Gall lie on the floor, snug in a blanket, 
  linens and clothes strewn everywhere.  They kiss.      

                                    GALL
                  I should ve met you when I was 
                  eighteen.                                                                                    31.


                                    JOHNSON
                Why?  What would you have done?

                                    GALL
                Dropped out of medical school and 
                become your love slave.

                                    JOHNSON
                There s not much money in that.

                                    GALL
                  I wouldn t be in it for the money.
                          (a sweet moment, then)
                  Hopefully my lab coat will hide the 
                fact I m wearing the same clothes two 
                days in a row.  

  Johnson gives him a LOOK.  Sits up.  Smiles kindly.

                                    JOHNSON
                I told you we d be friends, Ira.  
                Good friends.  And I meant it.  

                                    GALL
                That sounds ominous...

                                    JOHNSON
                But that s all we ll be.  So it would 
                just be confusing for my kids and 
                awkward for us if you stayed.

                                    GALL
                            (as he realizes)
                So... I m not spending the night.  
                You re kicking me out.

                                    JOHNSON
                I can make you coffee for the road.

                                    GALL
                            (beat, can t believe this)
                Coffee.  Uh... no.  Thanks, anyway.

  Johnson NODS, then stands and heads for the bathroom.  Hurt 
  and confused, Gall GRABS his pants and begins to dress.

  light boxes.  Masters and Gall STAND before the images.  

                                    GALL
                It s not like I pressured her into 
                it.  In fact, she pressured me.                                                                                    32.


                                    MASTERS
                How traumatic for you.  
                            (points)
                Scar tissue along the anterior wall.  

                                    GALL
                And it was like... like the kind of 
                sex you have when you re married.
                            (off Masters  look)
                Or on your honeymoon.  I m guessing.  
                Or like sex with a prostitute, if she 
                were a nice girl... not that I ve 
                been with a prostitute, but... Jesus 
                Christ, I need your help.

                                    MASTERS
                            (points again)
                Mrs. May needs my help.  Mrs. May 
                wants a baby and, off this, I d put 
                her chances at ten percent.  

                                    GALL
                            (looks at the x-rays)
                Fifteen.  Maybe.  You might be able 
                to remove the lesions surgically.

  Masters STARES at the x-rays as he considers it.  Clearly 
  worried.  He senses Gall s eyes on him.  Finally.

                                    MASTERS
                I am terrible at playing cupid.

                                    GALL
                But you see Gini every day.  Maybe 
                you could put in a good word for me.  

                                    MASTERS
                So we ll both look like we re twelve?

                                    GALL
                I don t know what else to do.  I m 
                crazy about her, but she s killing 
                me.  I mean, what is it she wants?

                                    MASTERS
                What does the woman you re sleeping 
                with want? 
                            (pulls the x-rays)
                The conundrum of deep space and the 
                riddle of life itself can t come 
                close to the unfathomable mystery of 
                that question.

  As Masters CLICKS off the lights.                                                                                    33.



  Libby Masters SITS across the desk from Johnson.  She CLUTCHES 
  her purse in her lap, deeply uncomfortable.  

                                    JOHNSON
                We start with the intake forms.  The 
                  procedure itself comes later.

  Libby NODS.  Then glances uneasily around the waiting room.  

                                    LIBBY
                Being married to Bill can often feel 
                like a spectator sport. 
                            (off Johnson s look)
                I just mean... you attract attention.  
                Whether you want to or not.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (considers this, then)
                The garden in the courtyard is nice.  
                We can sit there, like two 
                  girlfriends, fill out forms and no 
                one will be the wiser.  As for the 
                  procedure, I can have you wait in the 
                exam room instead of out here.  How 
                does that sound?

  Johnson smiles.  Libby looks ready to weep with relief.


  As Johnson sets out women s magazines.  ADJUSTS the table.  
  The door OPENS and Libby enters in a hospital gown, her 
  clothes in her hands.  Johnson TAKES the blouse on top.

                                    JOHNSON
                I ll hang this so it won t wrinkle.  
                Here are magazines.  A pillow.  It 
                helps to put it under your knees...

                                    LIBBY
                You ve been so kind, Mrs. Johnson.  

                                    JOHNSON
                Call me Virginia.  Or Gini.

                                    LIBBY
                I will tell my husband you are his 
                new secret weapon, Gini.

  The women exchange smiles, Johnson EXITS into the corridor...                                                                                    34.



  Where she CROSSES to find Sally DiMello waiting on the other 
  side of her desk.  Johnson takes in Sally s clothes, make-up, 
  hair.  A curious LOOK between them.

                                    SALLY
                The doc wanted me to be the last one 
                in tonight. 

                                    JOHNSON
                          (a look, checks the sheet)
                Right.  Sally Dimello.  I see you 
                started on the intake forms...

                                    SALLY
                Only the name and address stuff.  The 
                other questions, you can answer.

                                    JOHNSON
                The other questions are your medical 
                history. 

                                    SALLY
                Oh.  How about I talk and you write?  
                My handwriting is for the birds.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (beat, takes the forms)
                Okay.  Let s start with your 
                  infertility history.

                                    SALLY
                  Meaning...?

                                    JOHNSON
                  Meaning... how long have you been 
                trying to get pregnant?  Have you 
                ever gotten pregnant?  Do you have a 
                history of miscarriages?

                                    SALLY
                I ve had three pregnancies taken care 
                of, if you follow.  And then two 
                years ago had my tubes tied.  

  Johnson just LOOKS at her, then writes this down, as the door 
  to Masters  office opens and he EXITS.  He addresses Johnson.    

                                    MASTERS
                Please put Miss DiMello in room five.  
                Tell Dr. Gall to meet me in room one.                                                                                     35.


  Masters MOVES to the exam rooms.  Johnson gives him a pointed 
  LOOK, then turns back to Sally, whose GAZE reveals nothing.  


  Masters RAISES the stirrups as Libby WATCHES him nervously.

                                    MASTERS
                The cap is small, but sometimes 
                fitting it can be uncomfortable.   
                            (off her look)
                A sharp pinch, apparently.  

                                    LIBBY
                            (grasps his hand)
                You can tell me when it s over.

                                    MASTERS
                I won t be the one fitting it.
                            (off her disappointment)
                It s against hospital protocol to 
                treat a family member.

                                    LIBBY
                            (tries to smile)
                And since when do you care about 
                  protocol?

  Masters sees she s about to cry.  Gives her a playful LOOK.

                                    MASTERS
                I let you follow the rules so I can 
                break them.  Isn t that the deal?

                                    LIBBY
                Be careful, Bill.  Be careful about 
                making me the boring one.

  Masters sees the expression on her face.  An uneasy reminder 
  just how well she knows him.  Masters SQUEEZES her hand, a 
  nice moment between them, when there s a KNOCK.  Gall ENTERS.  

                                    GALL
                Mrs. Masters...

                                    LIBBY
                This must mean you re doing the 
                honors, Ira.
                            (off his smile)
                But stay a minute, can t you, Daddy?

  But Masters is already back to business, the moment passed.                                                                                      36.


                                    MASTERS
                I have a patient waiting, but I ll 
                check in on you later.
                            (to Gall)
                Perfect technique and impeccable 
                bedside manners for my wife today?

                                    GALL
                  I wouldn t dare do anything less.

  Masters gives Libby a quick peck and EXITS.  Libby watches him 
  go, as Gall helps her feet into the stirrups.  

                                    GALL (CONT D)
                No one can replace your husband.  But 
                I have done this many times, and so 
                far, not a single complaint.

  Gall smiles at her.  Libby NODS, her legs uncomfortably in the 
  air.  A tear slides down her cheek as they BEGIN.


  Masters CONTINUES down the hall to find Johnson waiting for 
  him.  He avoids her loaded GAZE as she hands him the file.

                                    MASTERS
                Thank you.

  Masters MOVES to Room Five, disappears inside.  Johnson 
  notices the sign on the door that reads  OUT OF SERVICE. 


  As Sally also reclines on a table, only this one fitted with 
  EKG and EEG machines.  Masters enters and CROSSES to her.

                                    SALLY
                So I m your first guinea pig.

                                    MASTERS
                My first guinea pig was year two of 
                medical school.  Then came rabbits.  
                But yes, you re my first human 
                subject on day one of my new study.  
                            (off her look)
                  I appreciate your coming.

                                    SALLY
                You re paying.

  Sally opens her gown to REVEAL her naked body.  Masters begins 
  to attach the electrodes.  Sally WATCHES his hands as dozens 
  of wires now connect her to the machines.                                                                                      37.


                                    SALLY (CONT D)
                My mother always said I d end up in 
                the electric chair.

                                    MASTERS
                There s a reason the French call it 
                 la petite mort. 

  Masters gives a smile.  Sally SHRUGS.  Clearly doesn t get it.

                                    SALLY
                We got everything we need?

                                    MASTERS
                EKG, EEG...

                                    SALLY
                  Vibrator?

                                    MASTERS
                            (with a look)
                You said nothing about a vibrator...

                                    SALLY
                This is why I keep telling you.  Why 
                you need a female partner...

                                    MASTERS
                And I am working on it...

                                    SALLY
                Do you at least have magazines?

                                    MASTERS
                I do.  They re for men.

                                    SALLY
                Okay.

                                    MASTERS
                With pictures of women.

                                    SALLY
                Good.

                                    MASTERS
                Naked.

                                    SALLY
                Even better.
                            (off his blank look)
                When I have sex, on my own time, I 
                have sex with women.  With Helen, in 
                fact.  Helen is my lover.                                                                                     38.


  Masters STARES.  Clearly taken aback.  Sally rolls her eyes.

                                    SALLY (CONT D)
                So who s your lover?  You must love 
                  somebody.

                                    MASTERS
                I m married.

                                    SALLY
                That s an answer?

                                    MASTERS
                That s my personal life, which is of 
                no interest to you or anyone else.  
                I ll go get the magazines.


  Johnson and Jane sit with their heads together at a far table.  
  Their voices low.  

                                    JANE
                But he must have given you details.

                                    JOHNSON
                He did.  But it s... confidential.  
                He said I could only talk about it to 
                women who were willing to volunteer.

  Johnson turns back to her food.  Lets that hang there a beat.  
  Jane watches her closely.  

                                    JANE
                  Volunteer for... what?

                                    JOHNSON
                Well... the study is about sex.  
                Things we ve always suspected but 
                never had proven, scientifically.  
                It s a new world we re opening up, 
                and it s ground-breaking and very 
                exciting and, for women especially, 
                it will probably be the biggest thing 
                to change women s lives since the 
                right to vote.   

                                    JANE
                            (eyes wide)
                Really.  

  Johnson NODS, again turns back to her lunch.  Pretends not to 
  notice Jane as she LEANS IN intently.  Finally.                                                                                       41.


                                    JANE (CONT D)
                So... how do you volunteer?

  Johnson looks up.  Smiles.


  As Johnson hands Jane a stack of forms, Jane pulls out a pen, 
  gets to work.  They chat happily as Johnson glances over to...  

  ANGLE - MASTERS

  Exciting his office with Josephine May.  Masters and May talk 
  quietly, May s expression somber.  He shakes her hand, she 
  heads toward the elevators, as Masters TURNS to see... 

  JOHNSON

  Watching him.  Their eyes meet.  Then Masters notices Jane, 
    scribbling away.  Johnson MOVES toward Masters with a look.  
  As she PASSES...

                                    JOHNSON
                Our new volunteer starts tomorrow.  

  Johnson GRABS a file and heads off.  Masters hides a smile.  


  As Johnson stands at the checkout desk before the inimitable 
  Miss Horchow, who now sits behind.  She gives Johnson a stern 
  look as she STAMPS the large stack of books with vigor.  

                                    MISS HORCHOW
                  I actually find this position an 
                  improvement.  It s quiet.  Appeals to 
                one s higher sensibilities.  It s 
                  certainly better than Dr. Masters  
                office, which is an unsavory, even 
                sleazy environment, don t you find?

                                    JOHNSON
                Hmmm.  No.  I ve not found that.

                                    MISS HORCHOW
                Give it time.

  Miss Horchow continues to POUND the books aggressively.  

                                    MISS HORCHOW (CONT D)
                You re checking these out under the 
                Doctor s name?
                            (off Johnson s nod)
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    42.

                                    MISS HORCHOW (CONT D)
                  Essentials of Physiology, Harper s 
                Anatomy, Basic Biology... 
                          (a pointed look)
                Hard to imagine why Dr. Masters would 
                need any of these. 
                            (leans in)
                Unless he just wants to look at the 
                dirty pictures. 

                                    JOHNSON
                  Actually, I do.

  As Johnson grabs the stack in her arms, heads for the door.


  As Johnson stands with Jane, now wearing a bathrobe.  She 
  shakes hands with Masters.  Smiles nervously.

                                    JANE
                I just feel lucky you could fit me in 
                at all.  Gini was telling me there s 
                quite a waiting list for volunteers.

                                    MASTERS
                          (a look to Johnson)
                Right.  Quite a list.  As for how 
                we ll proceed today, it s important 
                to lay out the ground rules...

                                    JANE
                You don t have to.  Gini already 
                  explained them to me.

  As Jane CROSSES to the exam table.  Slides up on top.  She 
  waits expectantly.  Masters gives Johnson another LOOK.


  As Masters and Johnson sit together at Masters  desk, sift 
  through the first graphs and charts.  Johnson LOOKS UP.  
  Surprised to find Masters WATCHING her.  She gives a smile.  
  Masters quickly turns back to the work. 

                                    MASTERS
                You find this funny?

                                    JOHNSON
                Not at all.  I find it interesting.  
                When you look at the data, you get a 
                very clear picture of what is 
                  happening to the subject 
                  physically...                                                                                    43.


                                    MASTERS
                    Physiologically...

                                    JOHNSON
                ... physiologically.  But if you want 
                to answer a question like,  How does 
                an orgasm feel for a woman?...   It s 
                not so easy to see it in the numbers.    
                            (off his look)
                You can, I m sure.

                                    MASTERS
                            (considers this)
                I m always willing to see more.  But 
                I m clinically unqualified to 
                describe how a female orgasm feels, 
                so...

  Masters gestures her to continue.  Johnson gives a look, 
  realizes she stepped right into this.  Waves it off.  

                                    JOHNSON
                It was just an observation.

                                    MASTERS
                No.  Please.  Go ahead.

                                    JOHNSON
                It s... like trying to describe salt 
                to someone who s never tasted salt.

                                    MASTERS
                I ve tasted salt.

                                    JOHNSON
                Not the way I ve tasted salt.

                                    MASTERS
                But you have me curious now, 
                  Virginia.  I have this data detailing 
                muscle tension, muscle spasms, heart 
                and respiratory rate.  Let s hear 
                some words for a change.  

                                    JOHNSON
                How does an orgasm feel for a woman?

  Masters NODS.  Johnson thinks about it a beat.  

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                Great.

  A beat.  They both smile.                                                                                    44.



  The room filled with the usual support team as Masters again 
  operates on Josephine May.  Gall works beside him as Masters 
  NARRATES.

                                    MASTERS
                That s why the first thing we retract 
                is this tissue here.  This is called 
                the uterus cephalad...

  Gall and another assisting surgeon share a curious LOOK.

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                Once that s secured, we move to 
                what s called the vesicurterine 
                fold...

                                    GALL
                We know what it s called, Bill.

                                    MASTERS
                I m not talking to you.

  An odd beat.  Gall GLANCES up, finally notices...

  ANGLE - THE GALLERY

  Where Johnson again stands at the glass.  Master s VOICE comes 
  through the overhead speaker.

                                    MASTERS (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  I retract the vesicurterine fold to 
                expose this shiny, grapefruit sized 
                mass here, which is the uterus...

  RESUME - THE OPERATING THEATER

  As Gall WATCHES Johnson.  A dark expression crosses his face.


  As Johnson oversees a WORKER while he unloads partitions, 
  scales, monitors, a defribrillator.  Johnson checks a 
    clipboard.  

                                    JOHNSON
                I also ordered an ultrasound machine.  
                Where s the ultrasound machine?

                                    WORKER
                Probably back on the loading dock.  

  He doesn t move.  Johnson frowns.  She turns and exits into...                                                                                    45.



  Where she MOVES down the hall and makes her way to the 
    elevators.  Johnson rounds the corner, suddenly STOPS as she 
  sees...

  ANGLE - A DOCTOR

  Halfway down the hall, he leans against the wall, one end of 
  his stethoscope to his ears, the other PRESSED to the plaster.  

                                    JOHNSON
                Dr. Gilpatrick...?

  As THOMAS GILPATRICK turns, clearly startled.  Athletic and 
  handsome, he quickly STUFFS his stethoscope in his pocket.   

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                Can I help you?

                                      GILPATRICK
                No.  I m fine.  I was... just... 

                                    JOHNSON
                  Listening to our exam room.

                                      GILPATRICK
                          (a beat, then)
                There s some money trading hands 
                about what s going on in Room Five.  
                I don t know if you knew that.

                                    JOHNSON
                I didn t.

                                      GILPATRICK
                I think maybe a decorator is in there 
                now.  Moving... furniture.

                                    JOHNSON
                I hope you re not out a lot.

                                      GILPATRICK
                Twenty bucks.  

  He gives a sheepish smile.  Then he walks past her and 
  CONTINUES down the hall.  Johnson WATCHES him as he goes. 


  As Masters and Johnson again sit together behind his desk.  
  Masters excitedly shows her a set of drawings.                                                                                      46.


                                    MASTERS
                If I can make the camera small 
                enough, that will allow the viewer to 
                actually witness it in real time.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (off the drawing)
                But can you vary the size of the 
                device?  Because this looks big, and 
                some women can accommodate big much 
                better than others, of course.  

                                    MASTERS
                Of course.

  He clearly hadn t thought of this at all.  Masters STARES back 
  at the drawings.  Starts to revise.


  The room now crammed with four times the equipment.  Masters 
  and Johnson, now both wearing lab coats, watch Shepley as he 
  holds the LONG CYLINDRICAL DEVICE from the drawings.  
  Delicately.  As if it were about to explode.                                                                                    47.


                                    JOHNSON
                We call it Ulysses.  After the Kirk 
                Douglas movie with the giant cyclops.

  Masters turns a handheld rheostat.  The device WHIRS and 
  starts to MOVE.  Shepley nearly drops it.  Startled.

                                    MASTERS
                It even adjusts for the physical 
                  variations in each woman s shape.

  Masters and Johnson smile, then Masters gives her a LOOK.  She 
  nods and slips from the room.  Shepley stares at the device.  

                                    SHEPLEY
                I don t like where this is going.

                                    MASTERS
                  I designed Ulysses myself, using cold-
                light illumination with a miniature 
                camera attached to the end.  Who else 
                is doing this?  No one.  Who will be 
                doing it in five years?  Everyone...

  As Johnson re-enters with Jane, again in a bathrobe.  Masters 
  quickly draws a partition across the exam table and the women 
  VANISH behind the drape.  Shepley watches this uneasily as...

  ANGLE - BEHIND THE PARTITION

  Jane turns to Johnson with a worrisome frown.  She WHISPERS.

                                    JANE
                I don t think this is a good idea...

                                    JOHNSON
                Jane.  Relax.  Deep breath.  It will 
                be just like all the other times...

                                    JANE
                Except the Chancellor of the entire 
                  University is watching me.

                                    JOHNSON
                No.  He s not watching you.  He s 
                watching science.

  Johnson smiles reassuringly.  Jane takes a deep breath as...

  RESUME - MASTERS AND SHEPLEY

  They hear RUSTLING, then Jane s lower half appears from under 
  the drape, still covered.  Masters grabs a chair, plops it at 
  the business end of the table.  Gestures to Shepley.                                                                                     48.


                                    MASTERS
                Best seat in the house.

  Shepley slowly sits as Johnson re-appears from behind the 
    partition.  She takes the device from Masters, wraps it in a 
  warm towel.  Masters CONTINUES to explain.   

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                The patient controls Ulysses herself.  
                The only thing you have to do is lean 
                in close, like this, to get the best 
                possible view through the lens. 

                                    JOHNSON
                But not too close or you get poked in 
                the eye.  

  Johnson gives him a smile.  Shepley does return it.  

                                    SHEPLEY
                You re saying... watch out for the 
                dildo.  

                                    MASTERS
                            (pats him on the back)
                Just think of yourself as Sir Edmund 
                Hilary leaving base camp.

  Shepley frowns, has no interest in being Sir Edmund Hilary, as  
  a pair of hands reach through the sheet and grab the device.  
  Shepley gives Masters a loaded LOOK.  Masters smiles. 

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                Whenever you re ready, Jane.


  Masters and Johnson sit at his desk, sort through the latest 
  data, food pushed to the side.  They glance at the phone, 
    conspicuously silent on Masters  desk.  A beat.  They both 
  glance again.  Masters checks his watch.  Another beat.   

                                    MASTERS
                He s not going to call. 

                                    JOHNSON
                          (a beat, finally)
                Now what do we do?

  Masters clearly doesn t have an answer.  Johnson sees his 
  distress as he stares at the phone.  Can t believe it doesn t 
  ring.  There s a KNOCK.  Masters quickly stands, but Gall 
  sticks his head in.  Masters frowns as Johnson realizes.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                Ira.  I m sorry.  I forgot...

                                    GALL
                You re not even dressed yet...  

                                    MASTERS
                            (sits back down)
                Is this about the NICU benefit?  For 
                  godssake, Ira... go ahead.  Gini can 
                come with Libby and me later.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (to Masters)
                Libby s had me over twice this week.  
                I m sure she d like time alone...

                                    GALL
                          (a look to Masters)
                And I would like a date.  Bill.  So I 
                can wait another fifteen minutes...                                                                                    51.


                                    MASTERS
                We have another hour here at least.

  An uncomfortable beat.  Johnson gives Gall a sheepish smile.

                                    JOHNSON
                I ll meet you there, okay?

                                    GALL
                            (beat, finally)
                See you there.

  He SHUTS the door.  Masters turns back at his work.  A beat.

                                    MASTERS
                  I thought you d broken that off.

                                    JOHNSON
                Broken what off?  We re friends.

                                    MASTERS
                Really.  Because our professionalism 
                and standards have to be beyond 
                  reproach, Virginia.  This is not 
                research into kidney disease, which 
                might survive an incident of inner-
                  departmental scandal.  Our study is 
                the scandal.  So even a hint of 
                  impropriety could derail all our work 
                now and everything that s to come...

                                    JOHNSON
                Bill... I know you re upset about 
                  Shepley...

                                    MASTERS
                I m not talking about Shepley.

  As Masters stands, unable to contain himself any longer.  

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                I m talking about gutlessness.  And 
                petty small-mindedness.  When every 
                museum in the world is filled with 
                art created from this basic impulse.  
                The greatest literature.  The most 
                  beautiful music.  The study of sex is 
                the study of the beginning of all 
                life and the progression of our 
                entire species and the mystery of our 
                deepest desires and science holds the 
                key.  And yet we all sit huddled in 
                the dark.  Like prudish cavemen.  
                Filled with shame.  And guilt.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    52.

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                When the truth is, nobody understands 
                sex.  And now... nobody will.

                                    JOHNSON
                Nobody understands it or... you don t 
                  understand...

  The phone RINGS.  A loaded look moment.  Masters answers.

                                    MASTERS
                  Masters...

  A long beat.  Masters locks eyes with Johnson as he LISTENS.


    A crowded, smoky room.  Masters, Libby, and Johnson ENTER, a 
  handsome threesome in their evening wear.  They MOVE through 
  the crush of people as Libby reacts to the latest news.

                                    LIBBY
                I m so happy you and Shepley made up.

                                    JOHNSON
                It wasn t exactly valentines and 
                roses.  But Bill can be very 
                  persuasive, as you know.

                                    MASTERS
                            (kisses Libby s cheek)
                  I persuaded her to marry me.  Now I m 
                  persuading her to find us a bottle of 
                  champagne so we can celebrate.

                                    JOHNSON
                I ll go with you, Lib.

  Libby gives a playful scowl and moves off.  Johnson hesitates 
  as Masters WATCHES her, then suddenly throws his arm around 
  her shoulder and gives her a quick hug.  It s over in a blink, 
  as Johnson looks at him.  Surprised.  Masters shrugs.  

                                    MASTERS
                It s a good day.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (smiles, considers him)
                But I am curious.  Would you have 
                done it?  Leave, I mean.

                                    MASTERS
                  Shepley s the one that folded.  I 
                don t have to show my hand.                                                                                    53.


                                    JOHNSON
                I do think you should level with him 
                about what we re planning to do.

                                    MASTERS
                And have him shut us down again?  
                We ll do what we did with Ulysses.  
                Expand the study to include men, and 
                couples, then put together another 
                dazzling display, and only then show 
                Shepley what he s been missing. 

  Johnson considers this as her eyes drift across the room to...

  ANGLE - THOMAS GILPATRICK

  He stands alone with his wife.  Sips his drink.  Looks bored.

  RESUME - JOHNSON

  She points him out to Masters.

                                    JOHNSON
                I ve been asking around about 
                  Gilpatrick.  He s married.  He s had 
                numerous affairs.  Mostly nurses, but 
                a few in the secretarial pool.  

  They share a LOOK.  Both thinking the same thing.

                                    MASTERS
                Maybe I ll talk to him.

                                    JOHNSON
                You?  I m the only one that s had 
                success recruiting.

                                    MASTERS
                  Gilpatrick is a doctor.

                                    JOHNSON
                So are you.  And I insinuated my way 
                in with you easily enough.

                                    MASTERS
                You seem to have forgotten I picked 
                you for this job.

                                    JOHNSON
                If that s what you need to tell 
                  yourself.
                            (off his smile)
                See if you can get him away from his 
                wife and I ll find you later.                                                                                    54.


  Masters WATCHES her as she turns, follows Libby to the bar.


  The last patients sit waiting as Johnson sorts through the 
  mail at her desk.  She flips through invoices, notices, then 
  sees a small cardboard box.  She opens it, reaches inside, 
  pulls out what she realizes is the latest shipment of lewd 
  men s magazines.  

  An odd moment.  Johnson looks at a cover with a nearly naked 
  woman, then replaces it and closes the box.  She LOOKS OUT 
  over the waiting room.  Make-up hides a faint bruise along her 
  cheek.  The previous night still weighs heavily.  She takes a 
  breath, as the first look of real doubt settles on her face.  

  She stands there.  Watches as Josephine May exits Masters  
  office.  May walks a few steps, then stops.  She sags against 
  the wall.  Johnson takes this in, then moves from behind her 
  desk and APPROACHES her.  She touches May s shoulder. 

                                    JOHNSON
                Mrs. May... are you alright?

  May looks up, her cheeks wet with tears.  She reaches for 
  Johnson s hand.  Grasps it.

                                    MAY
                I m going to have a baby... another 
                baby...

  Johnson STARES as she realizes.  Smiles.  Her enthusiasm 
  genuine.

                                    JOHNSON
                That is... such happy news.

                                    MAY
                So, so happy.  Dr. Masters promised 
                and look... God bless him.  Truly.  
                Dr. Masters gave me my life back.

  She LAUGHS, overcome with joy, gives Johnson a delirious hug.  
  As Johnson looks over May s shoulder, her gaze lands squarely 
  on the closed door of Exam Room Five.


  The lighting low.  The exam table now replaced by a double 
  bed.  Johnson stands with Jane, again in her robe, as she 
  looks on apprehensively.  Johnson HOLDS a handful of 
  electrodes.  Masters WATCHES from behind the one-way mirror.  

                                    JOHNSON
                Once you two get settled, I ll attach 
                the leads.                                                                                    59.


                                    JANE
                While we just lay there... naked?  

                                    JOHNSON
                There s a sheet, if you re feeling 
                shy.  We ll see how it goes.  That s 
                the fun of being first.

                                    JANE
                            (uneasily)
                Fun.  

  There s a KNOCK on the door.  Gilpatrick ENTERS, wearing a 
  similar bathrobe.  A beat, as they both take in the 
  awkwardness of the moment.  Gilpatrick holds out his hand.  

                                      GILPATRICK
                Nice to meet you.  I m... anonymous.

                                    JANE
                What a coincidence.  I m anonymous, 
                too.

  They both LAUGH nervously.  Johnson leads them to the bed.

                                    JOHNSON
                Hang your robes here.  Then make 
                  yourselves comfortable there.

  As they disrobe, Gilpatrick sees Jane s beautiful body and 
  instantly becomes aroused.  He tries to hide the obvious with 
  the sheet as they CRAWL quickly onto the bed.  Jane also grabs 
  at the linens, as Johnson sits beside them and attaches 
  electrodes.  Masters continues to WATCH from behind the glass.  

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                There really are no rules, in terms 
                of what you can and can t do.  You 
                simply need to move through all four 
                stages so we can monitor the 
                  response.  We start with excitement..

  Both women LOOK at Gilpatrick, who gives a sheepish smile.

                                      GILPATRICK
                Moving on...

                                    JOHNSON
                To plateau, which is usually 
                  intercourse, but can also be more 
                  foreplay.  Then orgasmic, that s self-
                  explanatory, I think.  Ending with 
                  refractory, the physiological 
                reflexes returning back to normal. 
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    60.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                            (off their looks)
                All this comes very naturally, so 
                don t get too in your head about it.

                                      GILPATRICK
                Too late for that.

                                    JOHNSON
                Your other head.

                                      GILPATRICK
                            (smiles, charmed)
                And all the wires...?

                                    JOHNSON
                I would advise going slowly.

                                      GILPATRICK
                            (flirting)
                More fun that way.  

  Johnson returns his smile as Masters WATCHES this exchange.    

                                    JOHNSON
                Whenever you two are ready.  

  She WALKS behind the barrier, takes her place beside Masters.  
  They can hear WHISPERS between Gilpatrick and Jane.  

                                    JANE (O.S.)
                You can go... like this...

                                      GILPATRICK (O.S.)
                Okay.  And can I kiss you...?

  Jane GIGGLES.  The SOUND of a KISS.  Then bodies shifting.  
  Masters gives Johnson a LOOK.  Notices.

                                    MASTERS
                Your cheekbone is bruised.

  Johnson s hand reflexively touches her face.  She gives a wan 
  smile.

                                    JOHNSON
                Watch out for open medicine cabinets.

  Masters considers this, as Johnson LOOKS back through the 
  glass to see... 

  ANGLE - ON THE BED

  The shadowy outlines of two naked bodies.  They seem to shift.  
  Rearrange themselves.                                                                                      61.


                                    JANE (O.S.)
                  I think... maybe we did meet once.  
                Dr. Shaw s birthday party...

                                      GILPATRICK (O.S.)
                Oh.  Right.  You were the one with 
                clothes on...

  They both laugh awkwardly.  Then more KISSING.  The needles 
  skitter across the paper as talk is replaced with SIGHS.  
  Which is then replaced by the SOUNDS of sex.  

  Masters and Johnson WATCH through the glass, the scene before 
  them both erotic and mysterious, as this handsome young couple 
  not only does what comes naturally, but does it very well. 


  Shepley SHOWS Gall to a chair with a frown.  He walks back to 
  the door.  SHUTS it behind them.

                                    GALL
                I ve known about it for a long time.  
                Bill Masters and I share a rotation, 
                but we re also friends.

                                    SHEPLEY
                            (with a look)
                Any other friends that know?

                                    GALL
                That s why I m here.  I m worried 
                Bill has put himself at risk.  And by 
                  extension put the university at risk.    

                                    SHEPLEY
                Dr. Gall... I m aware of the limb 
                we ve stepped out on here.  But if 
                you know the study, you also know the 
                work is first rate.  Cutting-edge.

                                    GALL
                That s true...

                                    SHEPLEY
                And if any reputation can withstand 
                the shit storm that might be headed 
                our way with this, it is the sterling 
                  reputation of Bill Masters. 

                                    GALL
                And if it were Bill alone, I d agree.  
                But he s partnered now with Virginia 
                Johnson.                                                                                    62.


                                    SHEPLEY
                            (not following)
                The secretary?

                                    GALL
                Virginia hasn t been his secretary 
                for awhile.  She also hasn t been a 
                doctor, ever.  She s not a college 
                  graduate.  She basically unqualified 
                in every way to be running a study in 
                a major university teaching hospital, 
                much less one as politically 
                  sensitive as this.  Yet Masters gives 
                her more and more authority as more 
                and more people are becoming aware of 
                what is actually going on in there.

                                    SHEPLEY
                            (beat, finally)
                If and when Bill publishes the 
                Ulysses study, I suspect the 
                  secretary will be the least of my 
                  headaches.  

                                    GALL
                With Ulysses, maybe.  But from what I 
                gather, using couples was actually 
                  Virginia s idea.

                                    SHEPLEY
                What s that mean...?  Couples...?    

                                    GALL
                It means two people in their exam 
                room, stripped naked, plopped on a 
                bed, and then monitored as they... 
                well, fuck. 
                            (off his face)
                But obviously you know that since you 
                were the one that got it approved by 
                the board.

  A long beat, as the muscles in Shepley s jaw begin to twitch.  


  Masters and Johnson sit at his desk, surrounded by new data.  
  Johnson scribbles on a chart.  She GLANCES up.  Again finds 
  Masters WATCHING her.  They share a LOOK.  Both of them buzzed 
  from the evening.  Energized.  

                                    JOHNSON
                It s surprising what it reveals.                                                                                    63.


                                    MASTERS
                Both in the differences and 
                  similarities.

                                    JOHNSON
                Heart rates, brain waves, skin flush, 
                all similar.  Perspiration, of 
                course, widely divergent.

                                    MASTERS
                I doubt we re going to set the world 
                on fire with the news that a man 
                sweats more than a woman.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (smiles, checks her watch)
                My sitter needed me home an hour ago.

  Johnson LOOKS at Masters, clearly doesn t want to go.  

                                    MASTERS
                I can give you a ride.

                                    JOHNSON
                That s okay.  I should have been 
                taking the bus all along.
                            (back to the chart)
                But when I was watching them, it 
                occurred to me... what if we start 
                  interviewing our subjects?  I mean, 
                  separately, after the monitoring.  
                Apply what you and I bring as 
                  individuals to a more detailed 
                  exploration of what the data reveals.  
                You could take Jane, I d sit down 
                with Gilpatrick...

  Masters shakes his head.  Johnson gives a LOOK.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                  Because...?

                                    MASTERS
                Because I m concerned.  About the 
                  possibility of sexual transference 
                between us and our patients.
                            (off her look)
                We re going to be watching couples 
                have sex.  Daily.  And these couples 
                know we re watching them.  Freud 
                would have pointed out long ago...

                                    JOHNSON
                We debunked Freud...                                                                                    64.


                                    MASTERS
                ... that the likelihood of us 
                  transferring all this libidinous 
                energy on to our patients is high. 

                                    JOHNSON
                Is this... something you re 
                  struggling with?  

                                    MASTERS
                No.  Not yet.  But I could see the 
                  beginnings of it already between you 
                and Gilpatrick.  
                            (off her look)
                He was flirting with you and you 
                  responded.

                                    JOHNSON
                What?  I was trying to make him 
                  comfortable.  He was standing there 
                with an erection...  

                                    MASTERS
                Which is why we need to implement a 
                system that ensures that this kind of 
                  transference doesn t occur.

                                    JOHNSON
                It didn t occur.  

                                    MASTERS
                My job is to protect the project.

                                    JOHNSON
                            (with a look)
                As opposed to my job?  

                                    MASTERS
                Then we agree the sanctity of the 
                work comes first.  So you won t 
                object to devising a system that 
                avoids any doctor/patient conflict, 
                plus potentially enhances the 
                  reliability of the data.

                                    JOHNSON
                I won t object, but why don t you 
                just come out and say whatever it is 
                you re trying to say.

                                    MASTERS
                The two of us should undertake the 
                research ourselves.                                                                                       65.


  A long beat.    

                                    JOHNSON
                Have sex with our patients?  That, 
                Bill, would be transference.

                                    MASTERS
                We should undertake the research with 
                each other.

  An even longer beat.  Johnson just STARES at him.  Masters 
  turns back to the work before him.  He writes as he SPEAKS. 

                                    MASTERS (CONT D)
                I ve considered this carefully, and I 
                realized it s the best way to ensure 
                the longevity of the project.  We get 
                the benefit of interpreting the data 
                first hand, plus it deflects any 
                  inappropriate projection away from 
                our patients.  Keeps it just between 
                us.  

  Johnson continues to WATCH him.  Masters doesn t look up from 
  his work.  She realizes he s not going to.  Finally.

                                    JOHNSON
                Can I... take the weekend to think 
                about this?

                                    MASTERS
                Of course.

                                    JOHNSON
                          (a beat)
                  Goodnight, then.

                                    MASTERS
                  Goodnight.

  As Johnson GRABS her bag and heads for the door.  Masters only 
  LOOKS UP as the door SHUTS behind her.  He STARES at the door, 
  listens to her footsteps until they finally FADE AWAY.

                             THE END
