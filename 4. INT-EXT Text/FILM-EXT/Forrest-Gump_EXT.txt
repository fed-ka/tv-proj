A feather floats through the air. The falling feather.
A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather
floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down
toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive
by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.
He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked
back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car.
The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward
the street.
The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying
back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather
floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's
mudsoaked shoe.
The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is
FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a
box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.
Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a
pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.
Forrest pulls out a book titled "Curious George," then places
the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase.
Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all
there.
Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard.
A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus
continues on.
A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at
the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a
magazine as Forrest looks at her.
FORREST
Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.
He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.
FORREST
You want a chocolate?
The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this
strange man next to her.
FORREST
I could eat about a million and a
half of these. My momma always said,
"Life was like a box of chocolates.
You never know what you're gonna
get."
Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's
shoes.
FORREST
Those must be comfortable shoes.
I'll bet you could walk all day in
shoes like that and not feel a thing.
I wish I had shoes like that.
BLACK WOMAN
My feet hurt.
FORREST
Momma always says there's an awful
lot you could tell about a person by
their shoes. Where they're going.
Where they've been.
The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his
own shoes.
FORREST
I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I
think about it real hard I could
remember my first pair of shoes.
Forrest closes his eyes tightly.
FORREST
Momma said they'd take my anywhere.
Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street. Forrest
walks stiffly next to his mother.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, when I was a baby, Momma named
me after the great Civil War hero,
General Nathan Bedford Forrest...
A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded
sheet over his head.
The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse.
The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan
members dressed in full uniform.
FORREST (V.O.)
She said we was related to him in
some way. And, what he did was, he
started up this club called the Ku
Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in
their robes and their bedsheets and
act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks
or something. They'd even put
bedsheets on their horses and ride
around. And anyway, that's how I got
my name. Forrest Gump.
Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.
FORREST (V.O.)
Momma said that the Forrest part was
to remind me that sometimes we all
do things that, well, just don't
make no sense.
Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's
brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and
tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a
barber shop and watch.
MRS. GUMP
Just wait, let me get it.
Mrs. Gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.
MRS. GUMP
Let me get it. Wait, get it this
way. Hold on.
Forrest pulls his foot out of the grate.
MRS. GUMP
All right.
Mrs. Gump helps Forrest up onto the sidewalk. She looks up
and notices the two old man.
MRS. GUMP
Oooh. All right. What are you all
staring at? Haven't you ever seen a
little boy with braces on his legs
before?
Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two
old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.
MRS. GUMP
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest. If
God intended everybody to be the
same, he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.
FORREST (V.O.)
Momma always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.
Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a dirt road. A row of
mailboxes stands left.
FORREST (V.O.)
We lived about a quarter mile of
Route 17, about a half mile from the
town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in
the county of Greenbow. Our house
had been in Momma's family since her
grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come
across the ocean about a thousand
years ago. Something like that.
Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House
driveway.
FORREST (V.O.)
Since it was just me and Momma and
we had all these empty rooms, Momma
decided to let those rooms out. Mostly
to people passing through. Like from,
oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like
that. That's how me and Mommy got
money. Mommy was a real smart lady.
MRS. GUMP
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody
else is.
Mrs. Gump heads Forrest to the porch. She bends down to look
Forrest in the eye.
MRS. GUMP
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.
Forrest sits on a swing outside the house. Loud organic male
grunts are heard coming from inside the house. Forrest sits
on the swing as the grunts continue. The principal steps out
of the Gump House and wipes the sweat from his face.
Forrest is sitting on the porch.
PRINCIPAL
Well, your momma sure does care about
your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.
The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back
at Forrest.
PRINCIPAL
You don't say much, do you?
Forrest grunts, imitating him. The principal, embarrassed,
turns and walks away.
A cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk
toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch.
FORREST (V.O.)
But we didn't mind. Our house was
never empty. There was always folks
comin' and goin'.
MRS. GUMP (V.O.)
Suppa.
Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk. A television
inside a store window reveals Elvis Presley as he performs
"Houng Dog" on a stage.
FORREST (V.O.)
...was out shoppin', and we walked
right by Benson's Furniture and
Appliance store, and guess what.
The television reveals Elvis as he thrusts his hips and sings.
ELVIS
(sings)
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...
Mrs. Gump and Forrest watch the television. Elvis dances
around in the same manner Forrest did. A woman in the audience
screaming and applauding.
ELVIS
(sings)
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...
MRS. GUMP
This is not children's eyes.
Mrs. Gump walks away, pulling Forrest with her. Forrest stops
and takes one last look. Elvis continues to perform over the
television.
ELVIS
(sings)
"Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine."
FORREST (V.O.)
Some years later, that handsome young
man who they called "The King," well,
he sung too many songs, had himself
a heart attack or something.
Forrest is still sitting on the bus bench. The black nurse
looks at him.
FORREST
Must be hard being a king. You know,
it's funny how you remember some
things, but some things you can't.
Mrs. Gump and Forrest wait for the school bus. The bus pulls
up as Mrs. Gump prepares Forrest for his first day of school.
MRS. GUMP
You do your very best now, Forrest.
FORREST
I sure will, Momma.
FORREST (V.O.)
I remember the bus ride on the first
day of school very well.
The bus driver opens the door and looks down. Forrest walks
to the steps of the bus and looks at the bus driver. She is
smoking a cigarette.
BUS DRIVER
Are you comin' along?
FORREST
Momma said not to be taking rides
from strangers.
BUS DRIVER
This is the bus to school.
FORREST
I'm Forrest Gump.
BUS DRIVER
I'm Dorothy Harris.
FORREST
Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.
The bus driver smiles as Forrest steps up into the bus.
Forrest continues talking as he sits on the bus bench.
FORREST (V.O.)
I, I... don't recall what I got for
my first Christmas and I don't know
when I went on my first outdoor
picnic. But, I do remember the first
time I heard the sweetiest voice...
Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree.
FORREST (V.O.)
She taught me how to climb...
Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest.
JENNY
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.
Forrest dangles from the branch.
FORREST (V.O.)
...I showed her how to dangle.
Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read.
FORREST
"...a good little monkey and..."
FORREST (V.O.)
She helped me to learn how to read.
Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and
forth. Forrest's braces are wedged in the tree.
FORREST (V.O.)
And I showed her to swing.
The silhouete of the oak tree, Jenny and Forrest as they sit
on a branch.
FORREST (V.O.)
Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait
for the stars.
FORREST
Momma's gonna worry about me.
Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand.
JENNY
Just stay a little longer.
FORREST (V.O.)
For some reason, Jenny didn't never
want to go home.
FORREST
Okay, Jenny. I'll stay.
FORREST (V.O.)
She was my most special friend.
Jenny and Forrest walk. A dirt clod hits Forrest in the back
of the head. Jenny looks as Forrest rubs his head. THREE
YOUNG BOYS get off their bikes and pick up more rocks.
BOY #1
Hey... dummy!
Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod. Forrest
falls backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him.
BOY #2
Are you retarded, or just plain
stupid?
BOY #3
Look, I'm Forrest Gump.
Jenny helps Forrest back up. Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more
dirt clods at Forrest.
JENNY
Just run away, Forrest.
Another dirt clod hits Forrest in the arm.
JENNY
Run, Forrest!
Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces makes it
impossible. He hobbles along as Jenny yells after him.
JENNY
Run away! Hurry!
Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes.
BOY #2
Get the bikes!
BOY #3
Hurry up!
The boys pick up their bikes and ride after Forrest.
BOY #3
Let's get him! Come on!
BOY #2
Look out, dummy, here we come!
The boys ride after Forrest. Jenny stands and watches.
BOY #2
We're gonna get you!
JENNY
Run, Forrest! Run!
Forrest hobbles along the dirt road.
JENNY
Run, Forrest!
Forrest looks over his shoulder. The three boys race on their
bikes.
BOY #1
Come back here, you!
Forrest begins to run faster with his braces on. Forrest
continues running as the boys chase him. Blood drips down
from a cut on his head. The boys on the bikes are gaining on
Forrest. Forrest hobbles along. He begins to gain speed.
JENNY
Run, Forrest! Run!
SLOW MOTION --
Forrest runs from the chasing room. He looks over his shoulder
in fear.
The boys on the bikes peddle faster as they gain on Forrest,
running.
Forrest tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly his
braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the
air.
Forrest runs and look down at his legs in surprise.
Forrest continues to run faster as the metal braces and straps
fly off his legs.
Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed.
The chasing boys ride over the remains of Forrest's braces.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, you wouldn't believe it if I
told you.
FORREST
But I can run like the wind blows.
The black woman continues to read her magazine. Forrest smiles
as he remembers.
FORREST
From that day on, if I was going
somewhere, I was running!
Forrest sprints away from the boys. The boys stop the chase
and watch in disbelief. Forrest is already at the far end of
the road, clear of the chasing boys.
BOY #2
He's gettin' away! Stop him!
Boy #1 throws his bike down in frustration. Forrest runs
across a field.
Forrest runs past a chain gang in their prison uniforms.
They are cutting at the weeds on the side of the road.
Forrest runs across the street. THE TWO OLD MEN sit in front
of the barber shop.
OLD CRONY
That boy sure is a running fool.
Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now remember how I told you that
Jenny never seemed to want to go
home? Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma
had gone up to heaven when she was
five and her daddy was some kind of
a farmer.
Forrest knocks on Jenny's door.
FORREST
Jenny? Jenny?
Forrest look around the field at the left. He notices Jenny
and runs toward her.
FORREST (V.O.)
He was a very lovin' man. He was
always kissing and touchin' her and
her sisters. And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to
school.
Forrest runs to Jenny.
FORREST
Jenny, why didn't you come to school
today?
JENNY
Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.
Jenny grabs Forrest's hand and runs into the field. Jenny's
DAD drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts.
JENNY'S DAD
Jenny!
JENNY
Come on!
JENNY'S DAD
Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd
better come back here, girl!
Jenny's dad steps out toward the field. Jenny leads Forrest
into the thick tobacco field. Jenny's dad runs through the
field searching for Jenny with a liquor bottle in his hand.
JENNY'S DAD
Where you at?
Jenny and Forrest run into a corn field as Jenny's dad tries
to chase her.
JENNY'S DAD
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!
Jenny drops to her knees and pulls Forrest down with her.
JENNY
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.
JENNY'S DAD
Jenny!
JENNY
Dear God, make me a bird so I can
fly far, far, far away from here.
Dear God, make me a bird so I can
fly far, far, far away from here.
FORREST (V.O.)
Momma always said that God is
mysterious.
JENNY'S DAD
Jenny! Get back here!
FORREST (V.O.)
He didn't turn Jenny into a bird
that day. Instead...
A police officer escorts Jenny to her grandmother's trailer.
Jenny's grandmother meets Jenny outside and leads her toward
the trailer.
FORREST (V.O.)
...he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.
She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue, which
made me happy 'cause she was so close.
Jenny climbs over a second-floor railing and enters the house.
FORREST (V.O.)
Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and
come over to my house, just 'cause
she said she was scared. Scared of
what, I don't know...
Forrest and Jenny are teenagers now. They walk along an
oaklined road.
FORREST (V.O.)
...all the way to high school.
Suddenly Forrest is hit in the back with a rock. Forrest and
Jenny turn around.
OLDER BOY #1
Hey, stupid!
JENNY
Quit it!
A teenage boy throws another rock as a pickup truck pulls up
behind him. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest.
JENNY
Run, Forrest, run!
OLDER BOY #1
Hey. Did you hear me, stupid?
JENNY
Run, Forrest!
Forrest drops his books and runs down the road. The teenage
boy jumps into the back of the pickup truck with another boy
as the truck speeds after Forrest. Jenny steps left and gets
out of the way.
OLDER BOY #2
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!
JENNY
Run, Forrest! Run!
OLDER BOY #1
You better be runnin', stupid.
Forrest runs along the road. The truck speeds after him.
OLDER BOY #2
Come on, dummy!
OLDER BOY #1
Haul ass, dummy!
Older Boy throws rocks at Forrest.
OLDER BOY #1
Yeah, you better be runnin'!
The boys in the back of the truck throw rocks at Forrest as
they drive up to him.
OLDER BOY #1
Move it, jack rabbit!
The truck follows right on Forrest's heels. A rebel flag
license plate adorns the truck's grill.
OLDER BOY #1
Come on!
Forrest runs along the road as the truck chases him. The
boys in the back of the truck pound on the roof as the truck
turns right, after Forrest. The truck drives into a field.
Forrest runs toward a fence.
BOY
Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on,
Forrest! Yeah!
JENNY
Run, Forrest!
Forrest leaps over a five-foot fence as the boys try to catch
him.
Forrest looks left as he continues telling his life story.
FORREST
Now, it used to be, I ran to get
where I was goin'. I never thought
it would take me anywhere.
Forrest runs along the road in front of the high school. The
truck continues to chase him as the boys pound on the roof.
OLDER BOY
Come on. Whoo-hoo!
The truck speeds past Forrest as he turns from the road and
runs onto the high school football field. Forrest runs across
the field during a football scrimmage.
In the stands watching the scrimmage is the legendary
University of Alabama football coach BEAR BRYANT, wearing
his trademark plaid hat.
A group of assistant coaches sit around him, as well as the
high school football coach. The quarterback throws the ball
into the air.
Forrest runs past the quarterback. The receiver catches the
ball. Forrest runs past the receiver as an opposing player
tackles the stunned receiver.
The football coach stands, followed by the assistant coaches.
FOOTBALL COACH
Who in the hell is that?
HIGH SCHOOL COACH
That there is Forrest Gump. Coach.
Just a local idiot.
Forrest runs under the field goal post and through the end
zone.
FORREST (V.O.)
And can you believe it? I got to go
to college, too.
The crowd roars with excitement as a football is kicked off.
The football players run around on the field. The crowd of
cheering fans create a huge sign that reads: "GO."
Forrest is in a University of Alabama football uniform. He
looks up into the cheering crowd as his teammate fields the
kickoff. The teammate runs over to Forrest and hands him the
ball.
FOOTBALL COACH
Okay! Run!
The football coach, the assistants, and Alabama players cheer
for Forrest.
FOOTBALL COACH
Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run!
Forrest runs across the field. He speeds past the defending
players. Forrest runs past the opposite players. The crowd
cheers wildly, holding up cards, making a large sign that
reads: "Go."
They turn the cards over, creating the word: "ALABAMA." The
football coach runs along the sidelines as he yells.
FOOTBALL COACH
You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go!
Run!
Forrest cuts and runs toward the sidelines. Two opposing
players collide. The football coach, the assistants and the
players all motion for Forrest to run toward the end zone.
FOOTBALL COACH
Run! Turn! Go!
Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone.
Some opposing players fall down. Forrest runs along the
sidelines. The opposing players try to catch him.
Forrest runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives
at his feet. The referee holds up his arm, signaling a touch
down. The crowd cheers wildly.
Forrest continues to run, smashing through the band members,
then all the way toward the team tunnel. The football coach
looks at an assistant coach.
FOOTBALL COACH
He must be the stupidest son-of-a-
bitch alive. But he sure is fast!
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, maybe it was just me but college
was very confusing times.
Forrest walks through a crowd of people.
CHET HUNTLEY
Governor George Wallace had carried
out his symbolic threat to stand in
the schoolhouse door.
GOVERNOR WALLACE
We hereby denounce and forbid this
illegal and unwarranted action by
the central government.
Forrest steps over to a young man as the crowd looks at the
demonstration.
KATZENBACH
...statement that you are going to
stand in that door, and that you are
not going to carry out the orders of
this court, and that you are going
to resist us from doing so. I would
ask you once again to responsibility
step aside and if you do not, I'm
going to assure you...
FORREST
Earl, what's going on?
EARL
Coons are tryin' to get into school.
FORREST
Coons? When raccoons try to get on
our back porch, Momma just chase 'em
off with a broom.
EARL
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggas. And
they want to go to school with us.
FORREST
With us? They do?
Forrest walks toward the schoolhouse.
Some of the Alabama policeman and citizens clap their hands
as the National Guardsmen stand at attention with their
weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd.
Two black students were being led toward the schoolhouse.
NEWSMAN
And so at day's end the University
of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been
desegregated and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone had been signed up
for summer classes.
The young black girl drops one of her books. Forrest notices
and steps past the policeman toward the book on the ground.
Forrest steps out from the crowd and picks up the book. He
brings it up to the girl.
FORREST
Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am.
Forrest sits on the bench as the black woman looks at him. A
WHITE WOMAN with a bay sits left.
FORREST
But he didn't die.
A bus pulls up to the bus stop. The BLACK WOMAN looks down
at her watch.
BLACK WOMAN
My bus is here.
FORREST
Is it the number 9?
BLACK WOMAN
No, it's the number 4.
The Black Woman gets up and steps over to the bus.
FORREST
It was nice talkin' to you.
The white woman sits closer to Forrest.
WHITE WOMAN
I remember when that happened, when
Wallace got shot. I was in college.
FORREST
Did you go to a girls' college, or
to a girls' and boys' together
college?
WHITE WOMAN
It was co-ed.
FORREST
'Cause Jenny went to a college I
couldn't go to. It was a college
just for girls.
EXT, GIRLS' COLLEGE/JENNY'S DORM - NIGHT (1963)
Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain.
FORREST (V.O.)
But, I'd go and visit her every chance
I got.
A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest,
holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people
inside the car begins to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny
is inside the car with a boy. She leans back against the
passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable.
JENNY
Ouch! That hurts.
Forrest gets up and runs toward the car. He tries to look in
the window as he steps over to the driver's side door. He
opens the door and begins to punch the boy inside. Jenny
jump out of the car and runs over to Forrest.
JENNY
Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it!
Stop it!
BILLY
Jesus!
JENNY
What are you doing?
FORREST
He was hurtin' you.
Jenny's date, named BILLY, gets out of the car angrily.
BILLY
What the hell is going on here?
JENNY
No, he's not!
BILLY
Who is that? Who is that?
JENNY
Get over there!
Jenny turns and looks at Billy. He shoves Jenny's hands away
from him.
JENNY
Billy, I'm sorry.
BILLY
What in the hell, git, would you git
away from me!
JENNY
Don't... Wait a second!
BILLY
Git, just git away from me!
JENNY
Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
Billy gets back into the car.
JENNY
He doesn't know any better!
Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest.
JENNY
Forrest, why'd you do that?
Forrest holds out the box of chocolates.
FORREST
I brought you some chocolates. I'm
sorry. I'll go back to my college
now.
JENNY
Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come
on.
Jenny grabs Forrest hand and leads him toward the dorm.
Forrest runs across the field as the defending team chases
him. The crowd yells for Forrest. They flip a sign that reads:
"Go Forrest."
CROWD
Run! Run! Run!
Forrest runs along the field. The crowd cheers.
CROWD
Run! Run! Run!
Forrest runs into the end zone. The band members rush toward
Forrest with their hands up, signaling him to stop. The crowd
flips over cards, creating a sign that reads "STOP."
CROWD
Stop!
Forrest stops in the end zone as he hears the crowd yells.
The band motions for Forrest to stop and stay in the end
zone. A group of defending players fall over each other in
the end zone. Forrest looks as the crowd cheers wildly.
FORREST (V.O.)
College ran by real fast 'cause I
played so much football.
BLACK AND WHITE PARAMOUNT NEWSREEL - DAY (1963)
The White House with the words "The eyes and ears of the
world Paramount News" superimposed.
FORREST (V.O.)
They even put me on a thing called
the All-America Team where you get
to meet the President of the United
States.
BLACK AND WHITE NEWSREEL
PRESIDENT KENNEDY holds an autographed football as the All-
American Team stands behind him. Forrest is among the players
in suits.
ANNOUNCER
(over newsreel)
President Kennedy met with the
Collegiate All-American Football
Team at the Oval Office today.
Forrest sits on the bench and shakes his head.
FORREST
It must be hard being brothers. I
wouldn't know.
Students in their caps and gowns step forward the podium to
receive their diplomas. Forrest's name is called. He steps
up and accepts his diploma.
DEAN
Forrest Gump.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now can you believe it? After only
five years of playing football, I
got a college degree.
The dean shakes Forrest's hand vigorously. Forrest looks out
into the crowd.
DEAN
Congratulations, son.
Mrs. Gump, sitting in the audience, cries.
FORREST (V.O.)
Momma was proud.
Forrest and Mrs. Gump have their picure taken in front of a
large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest and steps
up to him.
MRS. GUMP
Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here,
I'll hold this for you.
Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest. The recruiter slaps
Forrest on the shoulder and hands him some military
literature.
MILITARY RECRUITER
Congratulations, son. Have you given
any thought to your future?
FORREST
Thought?
Forrest looks at a pamphlet with a photo of "Uncle Sam" and
the caption "EXCELLENT CAREERS FOR EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN. Apply
now at your local U.S. Army Recruiting Center."
FORREST (V.O.)
Hello, I'm Forrest...
Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the night club.
JENNY
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.
You can't keep tryin' to rescue me
all the time.
FORREST
They was tryin' to grab you.
JENNY
A lot of people try to grab me. Just --
you can't keep doing this all the
time!
FORREST
I can't help it. I love you.
JENNY
Forrest, you don't know what love
is.
Jenny turns and looks over the bridge.
JENNY
You remember that time we prayed,
Forrest? We prayed for God to turn
me into a bird so I could fly far,
far away?
FORREST
Yes, I do.
JENNY
You think I can fly off this bridge?
FORREST
What do you mean, Jenny?
JENNY
Nothing.
Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle.
She steps into the street.
JENNY
I gotta get outta here.
Jenny runs and flags down the approaching vehicle.
FORREST
But wait. Jenny!
JENNY
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.
A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver.
JENNY
Can I have a ride?
DRIVER
Where you going?
JENNY
I don't care.
DRIVER
Get in the truck.
FORREST
So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me
to Vietnam. It's this whole other
country.
Jenny walks toward Forrest. She looks at the driver.
JENNY
Just hang on a minute.
Jenny walks up to Forrest.
JENNY
Listen, you promise me something,
okay? Just if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave, you just run,
okay? Just run away.
FORREST
Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the
time.
Jenny takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the
truck. Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away.
FORREST (V.O.)
And just like that.
Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out
at a river.
FORREST (V.O.)
...she was gone.
Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on
the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's
shoulder.
MRS. GUMP
You come back safe to me, do ya hear?
The shadow of a helicopter over the rice field below. A
soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter. The
solider looks left, Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter.
The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase.
SONG
"Some folks are born made to wave
the flag. Ooh, they're red, white
and blue. And when the band plays
"Hail to the Chief," ohh, they point
the cannon at you all. It ain't me.
It ain't me. I ain't no Senator's
son, no. It ain't me. It ain't me..."
Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear/
They walk and look around oddly.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, they told us that Vietnam was
gonna be very different from the
United Sates of America.
The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases.
He takes two beers out and walks away. In the background,
soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer.
FORREST (V.O.)
Except for all the beer cans and the
barbecue, it was.
BUBBA
Y'know, I bet there's shrimp all in
these waters. They tell me these
Vietnams is good shrimp. You know,
after we win this war, and we take
over everything we can get American
shrimpers to come on here and shrimp
these waters. We'll just shrimp all
the time, man. So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.
Lieutenant DAN TAYLOR steps out of a tent. Shirtless, he
holds a roll of toilet paper in his hand.
LT. DAN
You must be my F.N.G.'s.
BUBBA AND FORREST
Morning', sir!
LT. DAN
Ho! Get your hands down. Do not salute
me. There are goddamned snipers all
around this area who would love to
grease an officer. I'm Lieutenant
Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth Platoon.
Lt. Dan looks at Bubba.
LT. DAN
What's wrong with your lips?
BUBBA
I was born with big gums, sir.
LT. DAN
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.
Where you boys from in the world?
BUBBA & FORREST
Alabama, sir!
LT. DAN
You twins?
Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get
the joke.
FORREST
No, we are not relations, sir.
LT. DAN
Look, it's pretty basic here.
Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear
and follow him.
LT. DAN
You stick with me, you learn from
the guys who been in country awhile,
you'll be right. There is one item
of G.I. gear that can be the
difference between a live grunt and
a dead grunt.
Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys.
LT. DAN
Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green.
Try and keep your feet dry when we're
out humpin'. I want you boys to
remember to change your socks wherever
we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's
feet right off his legs.
Lt. Dan steps over to a large black soldier named SERGEANT
SIMS.
LT. DAN
Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is
that sling-rope I told you to order.
SGT. SIMS
I put in requisitions at Battalion.
LT. DAN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those
sonabitches again, call them again
and again and again. I don't care
how much it takes...
FORREST (V.O.)
Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt
real lucky he was my lieutenant. He
was from a long, great military
tradition. Somebody in his family
had fought and died in every single
American war.
A distant relative of Lt. Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war
uniform, falls dead in the snow.
Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a
striking resemblance to Lt. Dan, falls down dead.
Another relative, wearing a World War II, falls down dead on
the beach at Normandy.
LT. DAN
Goddamnit, kick some ass!
SGT. SIMS
I'm on it, Lieutenant.
LT. DAN
Get on it!
Lt. Dan steps back up to Bubba and Forrest.
FORREST (V.O.)
I guess you could say he had a lot
to live up to.
Lt. Dan walks along the walkway and Bubba and Forrest follow.
LT. DAN
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there. Little
Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake
down your gear, see the platoon
sergeant, draw what you need for the
field.
Lt. Dan steps inside the latrine, still holding the roll of
toilet paper.
LT. DAN
If you boys are hungry, we got steaks
burnin' right here.
Lt. Dan sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands
up, looking at the boys.
LT. DAN
Two standing orders in this platoon.
One, take good care of your feet.
Two, try not to do anything stupid,
like gettin' yourself killed.
Lt. Dan sits back down out of sight in the latrine. Bubba
and Forrest look at each other.
FORREST
I sure hope I don't let him down.
Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon
walk across the rice field. Some Vietnamese rice farmers are
working as the soldiers walk past.
FORREST (V.O.)
I got to see a lot of countryside.
We would take these real long walks.
Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road.
SONG
And we were always lookin' for this
guy named Charlie. I can't get no
relief.
Suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to
stop. He motions for them to get down.
LT. DAN
Hold it up!
SGT. SIMS
Hold up, boys!
Forrest gets down and looks around.
FORREST (V.O.)
It wasn't always fun. Lt. Dan always
gettin' these funny feelings about a
rock or a trail, or the road, so
he'd tell you to get down, shut up!
LT. DAN
Get down! Shut up!
FORREST (V.O.)
So we did.
Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down. Lt. Dan
crouches down. Lt. Dan looks at the soldiers and points to
his eyes. He lies down on the dirt road and crawls.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, I don't know much about anything,
but I think some of American's best
young men served in this war. There
was Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland,
he was from Detroit.
CLEVELAND
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the
hell's going on?
Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know.
FORREST (V.O.)
And Tex was, well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.
LT. DAN
Ah, nothin'. Fourth Platoon, on your
feet! Still got ten clicks to go to
that river.
Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon.
LT. DAN
All right, move out! Comin' out.
Look alive out there.
FORREST (V.O.)
The good thing about Vietnam is there
was always someplace to go.
LT. DAN (V.O.)
Fire in the hole!
Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols
in the hole, then climbs inside.
FORREST (V.O.)
And there was always something to
do.
LT. DAN
Mount 'em up.
SGT. SIMS
Spread out! Cover his back.
ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through a rice paddy, waits
deep in water. It begins to rain.
FORREST (V.O.)
One day it started raining, and it
didn't quit for four months.
The rain pours down on Forrest and Bubba as they sit in a
foxhole.
FORREST (V.O.)
We been through every kind of rain
there is. Little bitty stingin'
rain...
ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through the jungle as rain
pours down on them.
FORREST (V.O.)
...and big ol' fat rain.
ANOTHER DAY - The platoon shelters themselves as they walk
through the wind and rain.
FORREST (V.O.)
Rain that flew in sideways.
ANOTHER DAY - Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep
through a river. The rain splatters back up from the river,
hitting the soldiers. Forrest holds his hand up to protect
his face.
FORREST (V.O.)
And sometimes rain even seemed to
come straight up from underneath.
The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in
a camp. Bubba sits down next to Forrest.
FORREST (V.O.)
Shoot, it even rained at night.
Bubba leans his back up against Forrest's back.
BUBBA
Hey Forrest...
FORREST
Hey Bubba...
BUBBA
I'm gonna lean up against you, you
just lean right back against me.
BUBBA
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud. You know
why we a good partnership, Forrest?
'Cause we be watchin' out for one
another. Like brothers and stuff.
Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've
been thinkin' about. I got a very
important question to ask you. How
would you like to go into the
shrimpin' business with me?
FORREST
Okay.
BUBBA
Man, I tell you what, I got it all
figured out, too. So many pounds of
shrimp to pay off the boat, so many
pounds for gas, we can just live
right on the boat. We ain't got to
pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we
can just work it together. Split
everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty.
And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp
you can get.
FORREST
That's a fine idea.
FORREST (V.O.)
Bubba did have a fine idea.
ANOTHER NIGHT - Some soldiers patrol the area. Forrest lies
in a pup tent and writes a litter as the rain pours down. He
uses his flashlight to see.
FORREST (V.O.)
I even wrote Jenny and told her all
about it. I sent her letters. Not
every day, but almost. I told her
what I was doin' and asked her what
she was doing, and I told her how I
thought about her always.
Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar.
She hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a
Volkswagen bus with another guy.
FORREST (V.O.)
And how I was looking forward to
getting a letter from her just as
soon as she had the time I'd always
let her know that I was okay.
Forrest writes a letter in his tent.
FORREST (V.O.)
Then I'd sign each letter, "Love,
Forrest Gump."
The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and
rain.
SONG
"There's something happenin' here.
What it is ain't exactly clear.
There's a man with a gun over there,
telling' me I got to beware."
FORREST (V.O.)
This one day, we was out walking,
like always, and then, just like
that, somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.
Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's
platoon is attacked. A bullet kills the soldier standing
next to Forrest. Bombs explode all around as the soldiers
scramble to the ground.
LT. DAN
Take cover!
Forrest crawls over a berm as bullets fly overhead and explode
all around him. Forrest rolls over and pulls his pack off
Lt. Dan lies next to Forrest.
LT. DAN
Get that pig up here, goddammit!
BUBBA
Forrest, you okay?
Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle. Lt.
Dan shouts into the radio. Forrest begins firing his weapon
into the jungle.
LT. DAN
...Strongarm, please be advised...
Two soldiers pull a wounded soldier into the jungle.
BUBBA
Medic, we got a man down!
LT. DAN
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!
LT. DAN
Roger, Strongarm, be advised we have
incoming from the treeline at point
blue plus two. A.K's and rockets...
The machine gunner fires into the treeline. Another soldier
helps him with the ammunition. The machine gun jams.
SOLDIER WITH BIG MACHINE GUN
Misfire! Misfire!
LT. DAN
Goddammit, Mac! Get that pig unfucked
and get it in the treeline!
A rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier,
killing them. Forrest looks down and covers his head as
rockets explodes all around him.
LT. DAN
(into radio)
Ah, Jesus! My unit is down hard and
hurting! 6 pulling back to the blue
line, Leg Lima 6 out! Pull back!
Pull back!
BUBBA
Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest!
LT. DAN
Pull back!
BUBBA
Forrest! Run! Run, Forrest! Run!
Run!
SGT. SIMS
Pull back! Let's go!
Lt. Dan gets up and grabs Forrest by the collar.
LT. DAN
Run, goddammit, run!
The platoon gets up and runs toward the cover of the jungle.
Rockets explode all around the field. Forrest runs into the
jungle. The soldiers run through the jungle as bullets explode
all around. A soldier is blown up by a rocket. A soldier
runs through the jungle. Forrest runs past the soldier.
SOLDIER
Medic! Medic! Jesus, can I get a
medic?
FORREST (V.O.)
I ran and ran, just like Jenny told
me to.
Rockets explode in the jungle as Forrest runs out toward a
clearing.
FORREST (V.O.)
I ran so far and so fast that pretty
soon I was all by myself, which was
a bad thing.
FORREST
Bubba!
Forrest turns around, then runs back into the jungle.
FORREST (V.O.)
Bubba was my best good friend. I had
to make sure he was okay.
Rockets explode in the jungle. Forrest runs back into the
jungle to look for Bubba.
1ST SOLDIER
Any friendlies out there?
2ND SOLDIER
Yeah, I've got three over there.
1ST SOLDIER
Where the hell are you?
Forrest stops and aims his weapon. He looks around, scared.
FORREST
Bubba?
Something moves. Forrest turns and looks, then rushes over.
FORREST (V.O.)
And on my way back to find Bubba,
well, there was this boy laying on
the ground.
FORREST
Tex!
Tex lies on the ground, his face distorted with pain.
FORREST
Okay.
Forrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground. Forrest
pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs.
FORREST (V.O.)
I couldn't just let him lay there
all alone, scared the way he was, so
I grabbed him up and run him out of
there.
Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing.
He sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into
the jungle.
FORREST (V.O.)
And every time I went back looking
for Bubba, somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."
Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of
the river next to Tex, and then runs back toward the jungle.
Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground
and turns him over. It is DALLAS.
DALLAS
Can't hear... Can't hear...
Dallas is dropped off at the bank next to the other wounded
soldiers. Forrest turns to go back to the jungle.
2ND WOUNDED SOLDIER
No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're
gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.
FORREST (V.O.)
I started to get scared that I might
never find Bubba.
STRONGARM
(over radio)
You're danger close for crack air,
over.
Forrest trips over something and falls to the ground. He
looks up to find two bloody legs. It is Lt. Dan, who is
wounded. He speaks into the radio.
LT. DAN
(into radio)
Roger, Strongarm, I know my position
is danger close! We got Charlie all
over this area! I gotta have those
fast movers in here now! Over!
STRONGARM
(over radio)
Six, Strongarm, we want...
FORREST
Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!
LT. DAN
I know he's dead! My whole goddamned
platoon is wiped out!
STRONGARM
(over radio)
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6, how copy you
this transmission? Over.
Forrest tries to pick up Lt. Dan, who tries to push Forrest
away.
LT. DAN
Goddammit! What are you doing? Leave
me here! Get away. Just leave me
here! Get out!
Forrest pulls Lt. Dan over his shoulder and runs through the
jungle.
STRONGARM
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6. This is
Strongarm, be advised, your fast
movers are inbound at this time,
over.
FORREST (V.O.)
Then it felt like something just
jumped up and bit me.
Forrest falls down.
FORREST
Ah, something bit me!
Forrest gets up as Lt. Dan yells. Lt. Dan fires his pistol
at the unseen enemy as Forrest pulls him away.
LT. DAN
You dink son-of-a-bitch! I can't
leave the platoon! I told you to
leave me there, Gump. Forget about
me. Get yourself out! Did you hear
what I said! Goddammit, pull me down!
Get your ass out of here!
Forrest drops Lt. Dan down at the bank, next to the other
wounded soldiers. Lt. Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry.
LT. DAN
I didn't ask you to pull me out of
there, goddamn you! What the hell do
you think you're going?
FORREST
To get Bubba.
LT. DAN
I got an air strike inbound right
now. They're gonna nape the whole
area.
Forrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him.
LT. DAN
Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That's
an order!
FORREST
I gotta find Bubba!
Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest
slows down and looks around carefully.
BUBBA
Forrest...
FORREST
Bubba...
Bubba looks up as he lies on the ground.
BUBBA
I'm okay.
Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the
frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown
open.
FORREST
Oh, Bubba, no...
BUBBA
Naw, I'm gonna be all right.
Forrest looks around as he hear the voices of the enemy.
FORREST
Come on. Come on. Come here...
Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of
approaching planes fills the air.
BUBBA
I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right.
The roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks
up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They
fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs.
Forrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind
him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs.
Forrest carries Bubba to the bank of the river. Lt. Dan and
the other wounded soldiers wait for a rescue helicopter.
LT. DAN
Helo's inbound. Pop smoke, get it up
there!
FORREST (V.O.)
If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna
talk, I'd a thought of something
better to say.
Forrest looks down at Bubba. A soldier releases a smoke
canister.
FORREST
Hey, Bubba...
BUBBA
Hey, Forrest. Forrest, why'd this
happen?
FORREST
You got shot.
FORREST (V.O.)
Then Bubba said something I won't
even forget.
BUBBA
I wanna go home.
FORREST (V.O.)
Bubba was my best good friend. And
even I know that ain't something you
can find just around the corner.
Bubba was gonna be a shrimpin' boat
captain, but instead he died right
there by that river in Vietnam.
The helicopter fly overhead.
BUS STATION - DAY
Forrest continues with his life story. A MAN is sitting next
to Forrest on the bus bench.
FORREST
That's all I have to say about that.
MAN
It was a bullet, wasn't it?
FORREST
A bullet?
MAN
That jumped up and bit you.
FORREST
Oh, yes sir. Bit me directly in the
buttocks. They said it was a million
dollar wound, but the Army must keep
that money, 'cause I still ain't
seen a nickel of that million dollars.
The only good thing about being
wounded in the buttocks...
Forrest walks by the Lincoln Memorial. A fence surrounds the
Memorial, as well as armed military guards.
FORREST (V.O.)
After that, Momma went to the hotel
to lay down, so I went out for a
walk to see our national capital.
ISABEL
Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,
what do you want me to do with them?
HILARY
What are you doing here so late?
Forrest takes a photo of the memorial as a woman named Hilary
gathers together some veterans against the Vietnam War.
HILARY
We've been waiting for you for half
an hour, so just get them in a line,
will you. Hey, hey, come on, pictures
later. You look great. Oh come on,
get in this line, come on, come on
right in line. Come on, let him here,
let him in here.
Hilary grabs Forrest and puts him in the line with the other
vets against the war.
FORREST (V.O.)
It's a good thing Momma was resting,
'cause the street was awful crowded
with people looking at all the statues
and monuments. And some of them people
were loud and pushy.
Hilary leads the line of vets toward the large anti-Vietnam
War rally.
HILARY
Okay, follow me! Come on.
The group of vets walk as Forrest tries to take another
picture. A vet behind him pushes him along.
HILARY
Let's move it out.
VET
Hey, buddy, come on. We could use
your help.
Forrest walks in the line. A banner reads "Veterans against
the War in Vietnam."
FORREST (V.O.)
Everywhere I went, I had to stand in
line.
HILARY
Follow me, let's go!
Hilary leads the vets through a crowd of people outside the
rally. Another woman, named Isabel, leads the vets toward
the back of a stage.
ISABEL
All right, come on, guys.
HILARY
Stand here.
VET
Hey, you're a good man for doin'
this. Good!
FORREST
Okay.
A man, wearing an American flag shirt, stands on the stage.
He is anti-war activist ABBIE HOFFMAN.
ABBIE HOFFMAN
We must declare to that fucking
impostor in the White House --
Johnson. We ain't going to work on
your farm no more! Yeah!
FORREST (V.O.)
There was this man, giving a little
talk. And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a
shirt...
ABBIE HOFFMAN
Now, I'm going to bring up some
soldiers that are going to talk about
the war, man...
FORREST (V.O.)
...and he liked to say the "F" word.
A lot. "F" this and "F" that. And
every time...
ABBIE HOFFMAN
...that war has come home, and we
have to stop these politicians...
FORREST (V.O.)
...he said "F" word, people, for
some reason, well, they'd cheer.
ABBIE HOFFMAN
...these guys just told Lyndon Johnson
where to stick this fucking war!
Yeah!
Forrest looks up at the cheering crowd. Abbie turns and
motions for Forrest to come up on the stage.
ABBIE HOFFMAN
Come on, man. Come up here, man.
HILARY
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Hilary pulls Forrest up onto the stage.
HILARY
Come on, get up there. Come on. Move,
move. Let's go! Let's go.
The other vets follow Forrest pushes onto the stage and push
him toward the microphones.
VET
Come on, go. You can do it. Just get
up there. Go on. That's it.
Thousands of cheering protesters stand around the Washington
Monument. Forrest looks at the crowd. Abbie Hoffmann steps
up to Forrest.
ABBIE HOFFMAN
Tell us a little bit about the war,
man.
FORREST
The war in Vietnam?
ABBIE HOFFMAN
The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly.
FORREST
Well...
FORREST (V.O.)
There was only one thing I could say
about the war in Vietnam.
FORREST
...there was only one thing I could
say about the war in Vietnam.
Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman looks
around as he sneaks over to the audio circuit board.
FORREST
In Vietnam war...
The policeman pulls the patch cords out of the audio board.
Forrest's amplified voice becomes inaudible. Forrest continues
to speak into the microphone, even though no one can hear
what he is saying. Hilary looks over and notices the
policeman. Hilary rushes over toward the audio board, pushes
the policeman away and grabs his night stick. Another
protester grabs the policeman and pulls him away.
POLICEMAN
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
HILARY
I'll beat your head in, you goddamned
oinker!
Isabel, Hilary and another protester try to plug the tangled
mess of wires back into the audio board.
ISABEL
Christ, what'd they do with this?
Forrest continues to speak into the microphone. The crowd
grows restless.
CROWD
We can't hear you! We can't hear
anything!
HILARY
This one! This one! Give me that!
Hilary plugs in the right patch cord.
HILARY
That's it.
FORREST
...and that's all I have to say about
that.
Forrest looks at the massive crowd. They are silent. Abbie
Hoffman steps over to Forrest and pats him on the shoulder.
ABBIE HOFFMAN
That's so right on, man. You said it
all. What's your name, man?
FORREST
My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest
Gump.
ABBIE HOFFMAN
Forrest Gump!
Abbie raises his fist into the air. Abbie steps away from
Forrest. The crowd cheers.
CROWD
Forrest Gump!
JENNY
(screaming)
Forrest! Forrest!
Jenny wades out into the reflection pool and waves her hand
into the air. Forrest recognizes her.
FORREST
Jenny!
Forrest rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into
the pool.
JENNY
Forrest!
Forrest jumps down into the crowd and runs. Jenny smiles as
she tries to run through the water. The crowd parts as Forrest
runs into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him.
JENNY
Hey! Hey!
The massive crowd cheers for the embracing couple in the
pool.
FORREST (V.O.)
It was the happiest moment of my
life.
Forrest and Jenny walk past the protesters who are camping
out on the lawn.
FORREST (V.O.)
Jenny and me were just peas and
carrots again. She showed me around,
and even introduced me...
Forrest and Jenny walk past the White House. Protesters hold
a candlelight vigil behind them.
JENNY
He doesn't mean it when he does things
like this. He doesn't.
FORREST
I would never hurt you, Jenny.
JENNY
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.
FORREST
I wanted to be your boyfriend.
They walk in silence. Jenny touches Forrest's uniform.
JENNY
That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You
look handsome in it. You do.
FORREST
You know what?
JENNY
What?
FORREST
I'm glad we were here together in
our national capitol.
JENNY
Me too, Forrest. I have so much to
tell you, you won't believe what's
been going on...
FORREST (V.O.)
We walked around all night, Jenny
and me, just talkin'.
Jenny stands in the rain, hitchhiking. A car pulls over to
pick her up. Jenny and other other girls get into the car.
FORREST (V.O.)
She told me about all the travellin'
she's done.
A hippie gives Jenny a sugar cube of acid as they sit in
front of a roaring fire.
FORREST (V.O.)
And how she'd discovered ways to
expand her mind and learn how to
live in harmony...
A star with the name "Jean Harlow" on the sidewalk. Jenny
and two other girls sing on the sidewalk and collect change
from the passersby. Jenny plays the guitar.
FORREST (V.O.)
...which must be out west somewhere,
'cause she made it all the way to
California.
JENNY
(sings)
"Smile on your brother, everybody
get together, try to love on another
right now"
A young hippie looks over his faded Volkswagen at the girls.
YOUNG HIPPIE
Hey, anybody want to go to San
Francisco?
JENNY
I'll go.
YOUNG HIPPIE
Far out!
Forrest and Jenny walk through the park.
FORREST (V.O.)
I was a very special night for the
two of us. I didn't want it to end.
Jenny carries a backpack as she prepares to board a bus back
to Berkeley.
FORREST
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.
JENNY
I have to, Forrest.
WESLEY
Jenny? Things got a little out of
hand. It's just this war and that,
that lyin' son-of-a-bitch Johnson. I
would never hurt you. You know that.
FORREST
You know what I think? I think you
should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!
JENNY
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.
Forrest looks down at Jenny. He pulls his Medal of Honor
from around his neck.
FORREST
I want you to have this.
Forrest places the Medal of Honor in Jenny's hand. Jenny
looks up at him.
JENNY
Forrest, I can't keep this.
FORREST
I got it just by doing what you told
me to do.
JENNY
Why're you so good to me?
FORREST
You're my girl.
JENNY
I'll always be your girl.
Jenny and Forrest hug each other. Wesley waits for Jenny.
Jenny turns and walks up to Wesley. They walk toward the
entrance of the bus. Forrest smiles as Jenny looks at her.
Jenny climbs up into the bus. Wesley glares at Forrest.
Forrest gives Wesley the "evil eye." Jenny through the near
window of the bus, knocks on the window. Forrest turns and
looks. Jenny waves to Forrest. Forrest looks up and smiles
sadly. Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign as the bus pulls
away. The sign on the back of the bus reads "Berkeley to
D.C." Forrest gives Jenny the peace sign.
FORREST (V.O.)
And just like that, she was gone out
of my life again.
Forrest plays ping-pong against a Chinese player. A large
mural of Mao Tse-tung hangs on the wall. A crowd of communist
leaders sit and watch.
FORREST (V.O.)
...the Army decided I should be on
the All-American Ping-Pong Team. We
were the first Americans to visit
the land of China in like a million
years or something like that, and
somebody said that world peace was
in our hands. But all I did was play
ping-pong. When I got home...
BUS STOP - PRESENT - DAY
FORREST
...I was national celebrity. Famouser
even than Captain Kangaroo.
Color footage of the DICK CAVETT Show. Dick Cavett stands up
as he introduces Forrest.
DICK CAVETT
Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.
Forrest makes his way onto the stage, shakes hands with Dick
Cavett.
DICK CAVETT
Mr. Gump, have a seat.
Forrest sits down between JOHN LENNON and Dick Cavett.
DICK CAVETT
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.
JOHN LENNON
Welcome home.
DICK CAVETT
You had quite a trip. Can you, uh,
tell us, uh, what was China like?
John Lennon lights a cigarette.
FORREST
Well, in the land of China, people
hardly got nothing at all.
JOHN LENNON
No possessions?
FORREST
And in China, they never go to church.
JOHN LENNON
No religion, too?
DICK CAVETT
Oh. Hard to imagine.
JOHN LENNON
Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.
Forrest looks oddly at John Lennon.
FORREST (V.O.)
Some years later, that nice young
man from England was on his way home
to see his little boy and was signing
some autographs. For no particular
reason at all, somebody shot him.
A guard lets Forrest out a side entrance door. Forrest steps,
an then stops as he hears s man sitting in a wheelchair speak
to him.
LT. DAN
They gave you the Congressional Medal
of Honor.
FORREST
Now that's Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant
Dan!
Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He is a dirty with long hair.
LT. DAN
They gave you the Congressional Medal
of Honor!
FORREST
Yes sir, they sure did.
LT. DAN
They gave you an imbecile, a moron
who goes on television and makes a
fool out himself in front of the
whole damn country, the Congressional
Medal of Honor.
FORREST
Yes, sir.
LT. DAN
Well, then, that's just perfect!
Yeah, well I just got one thing to
say to that. Goddamn bless America.
Lt. Dan's wheelchair begins to slide down the ramp and spins
around on the icy ground. Forrest looks down at Lt. Dan
crashes at the bottom of the ramp.
FORREST
Lieutenant Dan!
Taxi cabs crowd the street as Forrest pushes Lt. Dan along
the sidewalk.
FORREST (V.O.)
Lieutenant Dan said he was living in
a hotel. And because he didn't have
no legs, he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.
LT. DAN
Take a right, take a right.
A taxi driver honks his horn as Forrest wheels Lt. Dan out
in front of the taxi.
TAXI DRIVER #1
Hey! Come on already!
LT. DAN
Ah!
FORREST
What are you doing here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?
LT. DAN
I'm living off the government tit.
Sucking it dry.
A taxi skids to a stop, almost hitting them as they cross
the street. The taxi honks at Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan slaps the
bumper of the taxi.
LT. DAN
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind? I'm
walking here! Ah, get out...
TAXI DRIVER #2
Why don't you go home before you
kill yourself? Get out of the way!
LT. DAN
Come on, go! Go! Go!
A Bob Hope Christmas special in Vietnam on television. Lt.
Dan and Forrest watch the television.
FORREST (V.O.)
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan and
celebrated the holidays.
BOB HOPE
You have a great year and hurry home.
God bless you.
LT. DAN
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?
FORREST
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.
Lt. Dan chuckles, drinks the rest of a bottle of wine and
tosses it down. He looks at Forrest. He wheels himself over
to television and turns it off.
LT. DAN
That's all these cripples, down at
the V.A., that's all they ever talk
about.
Lt. Dan picks up another bottle of port wine, but it is empty.
He tosses it onto the floor.
LT. DAN
Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I
found Jesus? They even had a priest
come and talk to me. He said God is
listening, but I have to help myself.
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,
I'll get to walk beside him in the
Kingdom of Heaven.
Lt. Dan tosses the empty liquor bottle down and picks another
bottle. He becomes enraged as he throws the bottle and looks
at Forrest.
LT. DAN
Did you hear what I said? Walk beside
him in the Kingdom of Heaven. Well,
kiss my crippled ass. God is
listening. What a crock of shit.
FORREST
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.
LT. DAN
Huh? Ah, well, before you go, why
don't you get your ass down to the
corner and get us another bottle of
wine.
FORREST
Yes, sir.
An ANCHORMAN reports in front of the White House.
ANCHORMAN
The U.S. Ping-Pong Team met with
President Nixon today at an Oval
Office ceremony...
FORREST (V.O.)
And wouldn't you know it...
PRESENT - BUS STOP
Forrest looks at the fat man on the bus bench.
FORREST
...a few months later they invited
me and the ping-pong team to visit
the White House. So I went again.
And I met the President of the United
States again.
Mrs. Gump walks out of the house and smiles. Forrest walks
up to the house, wearing his uniform.
FORREST
I'm home, Momma.
MRS. GUMP
I know, I know.
Forrest walks up to a shack on the edge of the Bayou. A group
of black kids play in the front yard.
FORREST (V.O.)
I didn't stay home for long, because
I'd made a promise to Bubba. And I
always try to keep my promise. So I
went on down to Bayou La Batre to
meet Bubba's family and make their
introduction.
Bubba's mother named MRS. BLUE and her other children look
at Forrest.
MRS. BLUE
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?
FORREST
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.
MRS. BLUE
I guess.
Forrest steps over to Bubba's tombstone.
FORREST (V.O.)
And of course, I paid my respect to
Bubba himself.
FORREST
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I
remember everything you said, and I
got it all figured out.
Forrest pulls out notes from his pocket.
FORREST
I'm taking the twenty-four thousand,
five hundred and six-two dollars and
forty-seven cents that I got...
Forrest walks across a yard where men are cleaning shrimp.
FORREST (V.O.)
...well, that's left after a new
hair cut and a new suit and I took
Momma out to real fancy dinner and I
bought a bus ticket and three Doctor
Peppers.
Forrest walks along a wooden pier. Forrest pays an old black
shrimper a large wad of cash.
OLD SHRIMPER
Tell me something. Are you stupid or
something?
FORREST
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.
Forrest stands at the grave.
FORREST
Well, that's what's left after me
saying, "When I was in China on the
All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just
loved playing ping-pong with my Flex-
O-Ping-Pong Paddle." Which everybody
knows it isn't true, but Momma says
it's just a little white lie so it
wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway,
I'm putting all that on gas, ropes
and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin'
boat.
Forrest steers his shrimping boat. The boat is old and rusty.
Forrest unleashes his nets as his catch of the day drops to
the deck. It is a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks
up one shrimp.
FORREST (V.O.)
Now, Bubba had told me everything he
knows about shrimpin', but you know
what I found out? Shrimpin' is tough.
Forrest pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket.
FORREST
I only caught five.
OLD SHRIMPER
A couple of more, you can have
yourself a cocktail.
The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks
at Forrest.
OLD SHRIMPER
Hey, you ever think about namin'
this old boat?
FORREST (V.O.)
I'd never named a boat before, but
there was only one I could think of.
Forrest paints a name on the side of his boat. The name is
"Jenny."
FORREST (V.O.)
The most beautiful name in the wide
world.
Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the
water.
FORREST (V.O.)
But I thought about her a lot. And I
hoped that whatever she was doing
made her happy.
Jenny steps out onto the high-rise balcony. She steps up on
a table and stands on the edge of the balcony. A busy street
lies many stories below. Jenny looks down to the intersection
below.
She slips over the edge, regains her balance, turns and looks
back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from
the edge.
Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down.
She sits down on a chair. Jenny rocks back and forth as she
cries. She looks up at the sky.
The moon shines above in the sky. Forrest lies in a hammock
on his boat.
FORREST (V.O.)
I thought about Jenny all the time.
Forrest stands at the helm of his boat and slowly glides by
the docks. Forrest looks around and notices something and
bends down to get a clear view. Lt. Dan sits in his wheelchair
on the deck. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He smiles, surprised.
FORREST
Hi!
Forrest leaps off of his moving boat and into the water. The
boat continues as Forrest clumsily swims. Lt. Dan sits in
his wheelchair at the edge of the dock. Forrest flails his
arms as he swims up to the dock. Lt. Dan waits for Forrest,
smoking a cigar. Forrest climbs up a ladder onto the dock.
FORREST
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing
here?
LT. DAN
Well, I thought I'd try out my sea
legs.
FORREST
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.
LT. DAN
Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump. I
had to see this for myself. And I
told you if you were ever a shrimp
boat captain, that I'd be your first
mate. Well, here I am. I am a man of
my word.
FORREST
Okay.
Forrest shakes Lt. Dan's hand.
LT. DAN
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm gonna be calling you sir.
FORREST
No, sir.
Forrest's boat glides, crushing a dock. Forrest and Lt. Dan
look at it.
FORREST
That's my boat.
Forrest's shrimping boat is alone on the gulf waters.
LT. DAN
I have a feeling if we head the east,
we'll find some shrimp. So, take a
left. Take a left.
Forrest looks up. Lt. Dan is sitting in the rigging.
FORREST
Which way?
LT. DAN
Over there! They're over there! Get,
get on the wheel and take a left!
FORREST
Okay.
LT. DAN
Gump, what are you doing? Take a
left! Left! That's where we're gonna
find those shrimp, my boy! That's
where we'll find 'em.
Forrest empties the net. Their "catch" is debris that falls
to the deck.
FORREST
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
LT. DAN
Okay, so I was wrong.
FORREST
Well, how we gonna find them?
LT. DAN
Well, maybe you should just pray for
shrimp.
A catch of junk is dumped onto the deck. Lt. Dan lowers
himself from the rigging.
FORREST
No shrimp.
LT. DAN
Where the hell's this God of yours?
The wind begins to blow strong.
FORREST (V.O.)
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.
Water sprays on deck during a hurricane. Lt. Dan on the
rigging, shouts and shakes his fist as he is pelted by wind
and rain.
LT. DAN
You'll never sink this boat!
FORREST (V.O.)
Now me, I was scared. But Lieutenant
Dan, he was mad.
LT. DAN
Come on! You call this a storm?
Forrest slides back and forth as he attempts to steer the
boat.
LT. DAN
Blow, you son-of-a-bitch! Blow! It's
time for a showdown! You and me. I'm
right here. Come and get me! You'll
never sink this boat!
The anchorman is standing in front of the ruined pier and
boats.
ANCHORMAN
...destroying nearly everything in
its path. And as in other towns up
and down the coast, Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry...
The man sitting on the bench listens to Forrest. An ELDERLY
WOMAN sits next to the man.
FORREST
...and we were the only boat left
standing "Bubba-Gump" shrimp's what
they got. We got a whole bunch of
boats. Twelve Jenny's, a big ol'
warehouse, we even have hats that
says "Bubba-Gump" on 'em. "Bubba-
Gump Shrimp." It's a household name.
MAN
Hold on there, boy. Are you telling
me you're the owner of the Bubba-
Gump Shrimp Corporation?
FORREST
Yes, sir. We've got more money than
Davy Crocket.
MAN
Boy, I've heard some whoppers in my
time, but that tops them all. We was
sitting next to a millionaire!
The man laughs as he walks away.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Well, I thought it was a very lovely
story. And you tell it so well. With
such enthusiasm.
FORREST
Would you like to see what Lieutenant
Dan looks like?
ELDERLY WOMAN
Well, yes, I would!
Forrest shows her the cover of a "Fortune" magazine with
Forrest and Lt. Dan on the cover.
FORREST
That's him right there.
The elderly woman looks at the magazine and at Forrest with
surprise.
FORREST
And let me tell you something about
Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest and Lt. Dan are working on the boat.
LT. DAN
Forrest, I never thanked you for
saving my life.
Forrest looks a little surprised. Lt. Dan smiles, then looks
away. Lt. Dan pulls himself out of his chair to the railing
and jumps into the water.
FORREST (V.O.)
He never actually said so, but I
think he made his peace with God.
Forrest and Lt. Dan have dinner on the deck. The television
shows an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford.
ANCHORMAN
(over television)
For the second time in seventeen
days, President Ford escaped possible
assassination today when a woman,
Sarah Jane Moore, fired on him as he
stepped out of a hotel in San
Francisco.
MARGO
(over radio)
Base to Jenny One. Base to Jenny
One.
LT. DAN
Jenny One, go Margo.
MARGO
(over radio)
Forrest has a phone call.
LT. DAN
Yeah, well you'll have to tell them
to call him back. He is indisposed
at the moment.
MARGO
(over radio)
His momma's sick.
ANCHORMAN
(over television)
Lynett Alice Fromme, a follower of
Charles Manson better known as
"Squeaky," attempted to assassinate
the President as he was...
Forrest dives into the water as he reacts.
Forrest carries a suitcase as he runs down the road. Forrest
runs past the row of mailboxes and turns into the drive.
Louise and others are on the front porch.
FORREST
Where's Momma?
LOUISE
She's upstairs.
The elderly woman and Forrest sit. The woman is crying and
wipes her eyes with a hankie.
FORREST
And that's all I have to say about
that.
A bus stops. Forrest looks at the elderly woman.
FORREST
Didn't you say you were waiting for
the Number Seven bus?
ELDERLY WOMAN
There'll be another one along shortly.
FORREST
Now, because I had been a football
star, and a war hero, and a national
celebrity, and a shrimpin' boat
captain, and a college graduate, the
city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,
decided to get together and offered
me a fine job.
Forrest rides a lawn tractor as he moves the football field
lawn.
FORREST (V.O.)
So, I never went back to work for
Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest takes out a letter and opens it.
FORREST (V.O.)
Though he did take care of my Bubba-
Gump money. He got me invested in
some kind of fruit company. And so
then I got a call from him saying we
don't have to worry about money no
more.
FORREST
And I said, "That's good. One less
thing."
The sign reads: "Four Square Baptist Church." A new cross is
placed on the steeple. New furniture is taken inside.
REVEREND
Praise the Lord.
FORREST (V.O.)
...and the rest is just for showing
off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Four Square Gospel Church.
The sign reads: "Gump Medical Center Bayou La Batre, Alabama."
The ribbon-cutting ceremony.
FORREST (V.O.)
And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou
La Batre Fishing Hospital.
A postman delivers a letter to Bubba's mom. She opens the
letter.
FORREST (V.O.)
And even though Bubba was dead, and
Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts. I
gave Bubba's mommy Bubba's share.
She is surrounded by her many children. She looks at the
check and faints.
FORREST
And you know what...
Forrest rides the mower.
FORREST (V.O.)
And 'cause I was godzillionaire and
I liked doing it so much. I cut that
grass for free.
Forrest looks down the road as he steps onto the porch.
FORREST (V.O.)
But at nighttime, when there was
nothing to do and the house was all
empty, I'd always think of Jenny.
Jenny's image walks, then vanishes. Forrest looks away. He
turns and walks into the house.
Jenny walks across the lawn to Forrest.
FORREST (V.O.)
And then, she was there.
JENNY
Hello, Forrest.
FORREST
Hello, Jenny.
FORREST (V.O.)
Jenny came back and stayed with me.
Forrest and Jenny walking.
FORREST (V.O.)
Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd
jabber on like a monkey in a tree.
And she'd listen about ping-pong and
shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a
trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'.
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.
FORREST
...big ol' gobs of rain and little
bitty stinging rain and rain...
Jenny's old house stands at the end of the dirt road. It
appears to be deserted. Jenny walks toward the house and
stops. She stares at the house. Forrest walks toward Jenny.
Jenny suddenly heaves a rock angrily at the house. She throws
other things at the house.
JENNY
How could you do this?
She breaks a window. Jenny collapses to the ground and sobs.
Forrest knees down next to her.
FORREST (V.O.)
Sometimes I guess there just aren't
enough rocks.
Jenny and Forrest sit on a limb together.
FORREST (V.O.)
I never really knew why she came
back, but I didn't care. It was like
olden times. We was like peas and
carrots again.
Forrest closes his eyes as he sits on the porch. Jenny places
a box of Nike running shoes in his lap.
FORREST (V.O.)
And she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.
JENNY
Okay, you can open your eyes.
FORREST
New shoes.
JENNY
They make them just for running.
Through the windows, Forrest and Jenny are dancing as it
rains outside.
FORREST (V.O.)
And she even showed me how to dance.
And, well, we was like family...
Jenny and me.
Jenny and Forrest sit on a log together and look at the river.
Jenny places her arms around Forrest.
FORREST (V.O.)
And it was the happiest time of my
life.
The fireworks explode in the sky.
The house stands in the rain.
Forrest lies in his bed as the door opens. Jenny gets into
bed next to Forrest.
FORREST
Jenny?
JENNY
Forrest, I do love you.
Jenny and Forrest kiss. Jenny takes off her nightgown as
they make love.
Jenny carries her purse and walks toward a waiting cab.
CAB DRIVER
Where are you running off to?
JENNY
I'm not running.
Forrest sit on a rocking chair with his running shoes on. He
is still, as if in a trance. He slowly puts on his Bubba-
Gump cap. Forrest stands. He walks off the porch. He begins
to jog across the lawn. His speed increases as he runs farther
away. Forrest runs down the drive away from his house.
FORREST (V.O.)
That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.
Forrest runs to the end of the drive, then turns right and
runs down the highway.
FORREST (V.O.)
So I ran to the end of the road, and
when I got there, I thought maybe
I'd run to the end of town.
The sign reads "Entering Greenbow County."
FORREST (V.O.)
...I thought maybe I'd just run across
Greenbow County. And I figured since
I run this far, maybe I'd just run
across the great...
Forrest runs by a sign that reads "Mississippi welcomes you.
The Magnolia State."
FORREST (V.O.)
...state of Alabama. And that's what
I did I ran clear across Alabama.
FORREST
For no particular reason, I just
kept on going. I ran clear to the
ocean.
The sign reads "Santa Monica yacht harbor sports fishing -
boating - cafes." Forrest runs under the sign and onto the
pier.
FORREST (V.O.)
And when I got there, I figured since
I'd gone this far, I might as well
turn around, just keep on going.
Forrest runs to a pier at the Atlantic Ocean.
FORREST (V.O.)
When I got to another ocean, I figured
since I've gone this far, I might as
well just turn back, keep right on
going.
Forrest runs across the pier. A lighthouse stands at the end
of the pier.
FORREST (V.O.)
When I got tired, I slept. When I
got hungry, I ate.
FORREST
When I had to go, you know, I went.
ELDERLY WOMAN
And so, you just ran?
FORREST
Yeah.
Forrest is running along the highway. Forrest runs down a
road between field of wheat. A Mountain river. Forrest runs
across a cobble-stone bridge. The Rocky Mountains are behind
him in distance. Forrest runs through some meadowland.
Split rail fences line the road.
FORREST (V.O.)
I'd think a lot about Momma and Bubba,
and Lieutenant Dan, but most of all,
I thought about Jenny. I thought
about her a lot.
The three men in the barber shop watch the news on television.
NEWSCASTER
For more than two years now, a man
named Forrest Gump, a gardener from
Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to
sleep, has been running across
America.
NEWSMAN
Sir, why are you running?
1ST REPORTER
Why are you running?
2ND REPORTER
Are you doing this for world peace?
3RD REPORTER
Are you doing this for women's right?
NEWSMAN
Or for the environment?
REPORTER
Or for animals?
3RD REPORTER
Or for nuclear arms?
FORREST (V.O.)
They just couldn't believe that
somebody would do all that running
for no particular reason.
2ND REPORTER
Why are you doing this?
FORREST
I just felt like running.
FORREST
I just left like running.
Forrest runs as a YOUNG MAN runs up to him.
YOUNG MAN
It's you. I can't believe it's really
you.
FORREST
Now, for some reason what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.
The young man jobs behind Forrest.
YOUNG MAN
I mean, it was like an alarm went
off in my head, you know. I said,
here's a guy that's got his act
together. Here's somebody who's got
it, all figured out. Here's somebody
who has the answer. I'll follow you
anywhere, Mr. Gump.
FORREST (V.O.)
So, I got company.
Forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road. A group of
people are jogging behind him.
FORREST (V.O.)
And after that I got more company.
And then...
A large group jogs behind Forrest across the desert road.
FORREST (V.O.)
...even more people joined in.
Somebody later told me...
FORREST
...it gave people hope. Now... Now,
I don't know anything about that,
but...
Forrest and his followers job through a small town. A man
runs up and talks to Forrest.
FORREST (V.O.)
Some of those people asked me if I
could help them out.
AGING HIPPIE
Hey, man, hey, listen. I was wondering
if you might help me, huh? Listen,
I'm in the bumper sticker business
and I've been trying to think up a
good slogan. And since you have been
such a big inspiration to the people
around here, I thought you might be
able to help me jump into... Whoa!
Man, you just ran through a big pile
of dogshit!
The hippie jumps over the "dogshit" as he runs along Forrest.
FORREST
It happens.
AGING HIPPIE
What, shit?
FORREST
Sometimes.
The hippie stops to ponder this profound thought.
FORREST (V.O.)
And some years later I heard that
fella did come up with a bumper
sticker slogan...
A bumper sticker reads "Shit Happens."
FORREST (V.O.)
...and he make a lot of money off of
it.
The truck with the bumper sticker drives into an intersection.
It collides with a car.
Forrest runs, followed by his group, as a man runs up to
him.
FORREST (V.O.)
Another time I was running along,
somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business, and he wanted
to put my face on a T-shirt, but he
couldn't draw that well and he didn't
have a camera.
WILD-EYED MAN
I think it would be really fortunate
for me if I could get your name on
these, oh, your face and name on
these T-shirts. It would be wonderful.
A truck splashes mud onto Forrest as it goes by. The man
hands Forrest a yellow T-shirt to use as a rag to wipe the
mud off.
WILD-EYED MAN
Here, use this one. Nobody likes
that color anyway.
Forrest wipes his face on the towel and hands it back to the
man.
FORREST
Have a nice day.
The man looks at the T-shirt. He holds it up displaying the
"Happy Face."
FORREST (V.O.)
And some years later I found out
that that man did come up with a
idea for a T-shirt and he made a lot
of money off of it.
Forrest runs with a group that follows behind him.
FORREST (V.O.)
Anyway, like I was saying, I had a
lot of company. My Momma always said
you got to put the past behind you
before you can move on. And I think
that's what my running was all about.
I had run for three years, two months,
fourteen days, and sixteen hours.
Forrest stops running. The group stops behind him. Forrest
stands and looks as the group waits expectantly. Forrest
turns and look.
YOUNG MAN
Quiet. Quiet, he's gonna say
something.
FORREST
I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go
home now.
Forrest walks toward the group. The group parts for Forrest
as he walks down the middle of the road.
YOUNG MAN
Now what are we supposed to do?
FORREST (V.O.)
And just like that, my running days
was over. So, I went home to Alabama.
A television shows President Reagan and his staff as they
react to gunshots in front of a limo.
NEWSCASTER
(over television)
Moments ago, at two twenty-five p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the
Washington Hilton Hotel...
Forrest takes the letter out of his pocket.
FORREST
...wondering if I could come down to
Savannah to see her, and that's what
I'm doing here. She saw me on TV,
running, I'm supposed to go on the
Number Nine bus to Richmond Street
and get off and go one block left to
1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4.
The elderly woman looks at the letter.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Why, you don't need to take a bus.
Henry Street is just five or six
blocks down that way.
FORREST
Down that way?
ELDERLY WOMAN
Down that way.
Forrest hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands.
FORREST
It was nice talking' to you.
Forrest runs, the elderly woman shouts from the bus stop
bench. A truck honks its horn as Forrest runs across the
street past the truck.
ELDERLY WOMAN
I hope everything works out for you.
Forrest and Jenny sit on a bench. Forrest Jr. swings behind
them.
JENNY
Forrest, I'm sick.
FORREST
What, do you have a cough due to
cold?
JENNY
I have some kind virus. And the
doctors don't, they don't know what
it is. And there isn't anything they
can do about it.
FORREST
You could come home with me. Jenny,
you and little Forrest could come
stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll
take care of you if you're sick.
JENNY
Would you marry me, Forrest?
FORREST
Okay.
A group has gathered on the lawn for the wedding. Louise
walks up to Forrest.
MINISTER
Please take your seats.
LOUISE
Forrest, it's time to start.
Jenny walks out of the house. Forrest walks over to greet
her. She wears a white dress. She walks up to Forrest and
adjusts his necktie.
JENNY
Hi. Your tie.
Lt. Dan is walking across the lawn. He uses a cane. A WOMAN
is walking next to him.
FORREST
Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!
LT. DAN
Hello, Forrest.
Jenny walks over to Forrest and Lt. Dan.
FORREST
You got new legs. New legs!
LT. DAN
Yeah, I got new legs.
Lt. Dan lifts his pant leg to display his metal leg.
LT. DAN
Custom-made titanium alloy. It's
what they use on the space shuttle.
FORREST
Magic legs.
LT. DAN
This is my fiancee, Susan.
FORREST
Lieutenant Dan!
Susan shakes Forrest's hand.
SUSAN
Hi, Forrest.
FORREST
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.
JENNY
Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally.
Jenny steps forward and kisses Lt. Dan's cheek. The group is
seated as they watch Forrest and Jenny take vows on the front
lawn. Forrest Jr. stands next to Jenny.
MINISTER
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be
your wife? Do you, Jenny, take Forrest
to be your husband? If so, I pronounce
you man and wife.
The wind blows fallen leaves across the ground. Jenny,
Forrest, and Forrest Jr. walk toward the house. They all
hold hands as they walk.
Forrest looks up into the sky as the rain stops. Forrest
removes his helmet. The stars emerge from behind the clouds.
FORREST (V.O.)
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.
And then it was nice. It was like
just before the sun goes to bed down
on the bayou...
Forrest stands on his boat and looks at a deep orange and
red sunset.
FORREST (V.O.)
There was over a million sparkles on
the water. Like that mountain lake.
Forrest runs along a highway. A lake reflects the mountains
and the sky.
FORREST (V.O.)
It was so clear, Jenny. It looks
like there were two skies, one on
top of the other. And then in the
desert, when the sun comes up...
Forrest runs along a desert highway. The morning light casts
an orange glow over the desert.
FORREST (V.O.)
I couldn't tell where heavens stopped
and the earth began. It was so
beautiful.
Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been
buried.
FORREST
And I had you placed here under our
tree.
Jenny's grave marker. Forrest tries to hold back his tears.
FORREST
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.
Forrest watches as Jenny's dad's house is knocked down by a
bulldozer.
FORREST (V.O.)
Momma...
FORREST
...always said dyin' was a part of
life.
Jenny's grave marker reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March
22, 1982 Beloved Mother, Wife and Friend
FORREST
I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest,
he's doing just fine.
Forrest looks down as he sobs.
FORREST
...every day. I make sure he combs
his hair and brushes his teeth every
day. Teaching him how to play ping
pong.
Forrest tries to teach Forrest Jr. how to play ping-pong.
FORREST
Okay...
FORREST (V.O.)
He's really good.
FORREST
Forrest, you go.
Forrest Jr. serves the ball, causing Forrest dive and miss
it.
Forrest and Forrest Jr. sit on a log by the river and fish.
FORREST (V.O.)
We fish a lot.
Forrest looks down at the grave marker.
FORREST
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so
proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a
letter, and he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to, so I'll just
leave it here for you.
Forrest places the letter down at the grave marker, next to
fresh flowers. The name on the envelope reads: "Mom." Forrest
steps back and looks down at the grave.
FORREST
Jenny, I don't know if Momma was
right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan.
I don't know if we each have a
destiny, or if we're all just floating
around accidental-like on a breeze,
but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe
both is happening at the same time.
I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything
you need, I won't be far away.
As Forrest walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead and
lands in the tree. Forrest turns and watches.
Forrest walks with Forrest Jr. for the bus. The bus drives
toward them.
FORREST
Here's your bus. Okay.
Forrest pulls "Curious George" out of Forrest Jr.'s backpack.
FORREST
Hey, I know this.
FORREST JR.
I'm gonna show that for show-and-
tell because grandma used to read it
to you.
Forrest looks at the book. The feather from the beginning of
the movie drops out of the book, unnoticed.
FORREST
My favorite book.
The bus comes to a stop. The door opens.
FORREST
Well...
Forrest puts the book back into Forrest Jr.'s backpack and
hands it to him.
FORREST
...okay. Hey, there you go.
Forrest Jr. walks toward the bus. Forrest stands up.
FORREST
Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to
tell you I love you.
FORREST JR.
I love you too, Daddy.
FORREST
I'll be right here when you get back.
Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver. It is
the same bus driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to
school when he was a young boy.
SCHOOLD BUS DRIVER
You understand this is the bus to
school now, don't you?
FORREST JR.
Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris
and I'm Forrest Gump.
Forrest Jr. looks over and waves to his father. Forrest nods
approvingly.
Forrest Jr. gets on the bus. The bus pulls away. Forrest
stands next to the mailbox.
Forrest sits down. The camera cranes down, revealing the
feather as it lies at Forrest's feet.
A gust of wind picks the feather up. The feather floats up
into the air.
Forrest sits at the side of the road. The feather floats
higher into the air.
The feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down,
then covers the camera lens.
THE END
