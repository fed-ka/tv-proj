  1... moment

  EXT. BRENTWOOD STREET -- MORNING11

  A beautiful day on a beautiful block; large houses and lawns 
  being watered, sprinklers hissing...

  ... and JO, a 11 (or 12) year-old Hispanic boy, pedals his 
  bicycle down the street.  Tossing newspapers on one lawn 
  after another...

  A BLACK MAXIMA

  trails behind him.  Crawling slowly, almost predatory; inside 
  are RICO and CARLOS, two formidable looking Hispanics, early 
  20 s, in dark suits.

  INT. WILL BRADFORD S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM -- MORNING22

  WILL BRADFORD pours coffee.  DON paces the room.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Coffee?

                              DON
                Yeah... no... yeah.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Maybe decaf? 

                              DON 
                Sorry... feel like I should be at 
                work.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                You always feel like you should be 
                working?

                We still have ten minutes before 
                the session.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Thought we were having a 
                  conversation.  If you want to wait -
                -

                              DON 
                No, no...
                      (beat)
                When you were a cop... you ever get 
                that feeling like it was all on 
                your shoulders?  Like everything 
                you weren't there to stop... would 
                happen?

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Last I heard, they handed out more 
                than one gun and badge.

  Bradford considers for a beat, then:

                              WILL BRADFORD (CONT'D)
                Turn off your cell phone.

                              DON
                I can't --

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Yeah, you can.  You're not on duty.
                      (off Don)
                My room, my rules.

  Don hesitates, then turns off his cell phone.  Giving 
  Bradford the stink-eye.

  EXT. BRENTWOOD STREET -- CONTINUOUS33

  Jo throwing more papers... the MAXIMA following... Jo throws 
  a paper that lands in a

  DRIVEWAY --

  where a Hummer H2 is parked.  DUQUE (Hispanic, 30's) behind 
  the wheel, MALONEY (White, 20's) riding shotgun.

  They let Jo pedal past, then the Hummer H2 backs out; heavy 
  wheels rolling over the newspaper --




                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    3.

  -- stopping crosswise in the street...

  THE MAXIMA --

  brakes to a halt... RICO starting to open the passenger 
  door...

  JO --

  turns at the sound of screeching brakes, stops pedaling...

  DUQUE AND MALONEY --

  jump out of the Hummer H2.  Duque sprints after Jo --

                              RICO
                Hey --

  Rico reaching into his jacket --

  -- as Maloney pulls up an M-4 ASSAULT RIFLE and opens fire on 
  the bodyguards.  Bullets stitch across the windshield, 
  killing CARLOS behind the wheel...

  ... hitting Rico as well.  He drops halfway out the door, a 
  BERETTA falling out of his hand.

  JO --

  starts pedaling again as Duque sprints after him; the bicycle 
  wobbling with panic as Duque catches up --

  -- yanking Jo off.  Maloney rolls the Hummer H2 up behind 
  them, passenger door still open; Duque tosses the kid inside 
  and jumps in after him.

  The Hummer H2 speeds off, crushing the bicycle in its wake.

                You re mad at me now.

                Okay, maybe.  A little.

                When you came in here the first 
                time, to get signed off for 
                shooting Crystal Hoyle, you got mad 
                at me then, too.

                              DON
                I was in the middle of a case, I 
                just wanted to get out.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Fastest way to do that would have 
                been put a smile on, spend a few 
                minutes charming me.

                              DON
                So what... I was subconsciously 
                looking for help?

                Let s make a deal... if you don t

  EXT. BRENTWOOD STREET -- CONTINUOUS55

  The early stages of a crime scene -- crime scene tape going 
  up, UNIFORMS blocking off the street --

  -- COLBY and DAVID conferring with a DETECTIVE.

                              MEGAN
                How're we doing?

                                                                INTERCUT WITH:

  INT. CHARLIE'S CAR (TRAVELING) -- CONTINUOUS1414

  CHARLIE driving, AMITA sitting in the passenger seat, typing 
  on her computer.  Both speaking on the hands-free:

                              CHARLIE
                We'll be there in less than five 
                minutes.

                              MEGAN
                We might not have five minutes.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    16.

                              AMITA
                If you give me the receiving phone 
                number, I can put an exploit on it.

                              MEGAN
                An exploit?

                              CHARLIE
                  A computer-based phone call is 
                really no different from e-mail. 
                  Information packets travel across 
                the internet --

                              AMITA
                Kind of like luggage at the 
                airport. 

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION --

  of a SUITCASE handed to an AIRLINE AGENT -- carried across 
  the conveyor belt --

                              AMITA (CONT'D)
                In order to get the suitcase to its 
                  destination point, it may have to 
                travel through a number of 
                  different airports.
                      (beat)
                Using an exploit, we mark the call--

  On the SUITCASE, as STICKERS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES are 
  slapped across it --

                              AMITA (CONT D)
                -- slapping stickers on it so we 
                can see which countries it visited.

  -- dropping into a LUGGAGE CAROUSEL, covered with stickers 
  now.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              CHARLIE 
                The bodyguard s cell phone is both 
                the origin point and the 
                  destination for these packets -- if 
                we know where they travel, we may 
                be able to locate the other caller.

                              MEGAN
                Sounds kind of like a computer 
                virus.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    17.

    CONTINUED:1414


                              CHARLIE
                Pretty much...

                              AMITA
                  I thought you liked the analogies --

                              MEGAN
                Any other day.

  Megan hangs up, turns to LIZ WARNER, who is entering --

                              LIZ WARNER
                Rico Orojos is out of surgery.

                Orojos --

                              LIZ WARNER
                The bodyguard who survived the 
                  kidnapping.

                              MEGAN
                Head over to the hospital.  Minute 
                he can tell a story, I want to know 
                what it is.
                      (beat)
                And make sure you've got a full 
                tactical kit in your trunk.  In

  Liz nods and heads out...

  Will looks at Don skeptically; neither of them believe it. 
  Don pauses, then walks into the office.  Will follows him in, 
  closing the door behind them.

  INT. CHE LOBO'S MANSION, FOYER/OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS1616

  COLBY and Che Lobo sitting amid a buzz of FBI AGENTS in high-
  activity mode.  The CELL PHONE sits on the table between 
  them.

                              CHE LOBO
                You people wanted to get inside 
                here for three years.

                              COLBY
                How do you know we haven't been?

                              CHE LOBO
                      (smiles)
                No way.  I have the place swept for 
                wires every other day.

                              COLBY
                Hell of a way to live.

                              CHE LOBO
                You have something, there are 
                people who'll try to take it from 
                you.

                              COLBY
                You mean people like you?

                              CHE LOBO
                Yeah... people like me.

                I swore my life would never touch 
                him.  He d have a chance to be 
                  something better.
                      (beat)
                Few months ago -- he tells me he 
                wants a paper route so he can be a 
                  businessman, just like me.  And I 
                know he meant it all the right ways 
                -- because that s the only part I 
                ever let him see.  You re 9 years 
                old, your dad should be...

                              COLBY

                              CHE LOBO
                Yeah...

  Colby is silent for a beat, then...

                              COLBY
                Any idea who would ve done this?

                You mean, do I have enemies? 
                Yeah... every gang in town, half 
                the record companies, and anyone

  Lobo reaches for it; COLBY, listening on his cell phone, puts 
  a hand up to stop him --

                So what do you think, Che?  Want to

  enough pose not to draw any attention.

  He moves along the tables; only a few computers are being 
  occupied; by students, researchers, oddballs.  He scans them 
  all, assessing each person with a glance...

  ... then moves through the stacks, checking everyone out...

  ... takes out his cell phone to make a call --

  -- and A LIBRARIAN is right on him.

                                LIBRARIAN
                No phone calls.  What is it with 
                you people?

  David taking out his ID --

                              DAVID
                Us people?

                                LIBRARIAN
                I just chased another one out of 
                here -- it's bad enough when they 
                listen to music on their laptops -- 
                now they sit and talk to them.

  Off David --

  Don and Bradford --

                              WILL BRADFORD
                How do you think Sinclair feels 
                about you?

                              DON
                      (at a loss)
                I'm his boss... like to think I'm a

                              WILL BRADFORD
                You're telling me what you think -- 
                what does he think?

  Don gives that a moment's fair thought --

                              DON
                Probably that I'm tough on him, 
                  sometimes.  But he knows it's about 
                getting the job done.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                How does he handle it -- when 
                you're tough.

                              DON
                The way we all do... put it away 
                and get back to work.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Where do you put it?

                      (beat; evasive)
                  I thought we were talking about 
                David.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                We're never talking about just one 
                thing.

  DAVID on the phone with MEGAN --

                  Librarian describes him as a Male, 
                Hispanic, 40's, short hair, goatee.  
                We missed him by about five 
                minutes.

  Megan brings up RAP SHEETS on RICO and CARLOS on the plasma--

                              MEGAN
                LAPD was right -- Rico Orojos and  
                Carlos Lalo were 18 Street Mexicali 
                with long rap sheets.
                      (beat)
                Of course, so are two-thirds of Che 
                Lobo's people.  You have something?

                              DAVID
                Kind of wondering how the 
                  kidnappers knew that Orojos  cell 
                phone was on this Webline service.

  CHARLIE and AMITA entering the WAR ROOM --

                              CHARLIE
                We were just about to raise that 
                very point.

                              AMITA
                When you make a VoIP call to a 
                  traditional phone number, you have 
                to pay a fee --

                              CHARLIE
                -- which involves a traceable 
                  transaction... usually a credit 
                card.
                      (beat)
                The reason that these calls weren't 
                  traceable by traditional means was 
                that Orojos  cell phone was a VoIP 
                client as well -- which required 
                the installation of special 
                  software.

                              MEGAN
                The kidnappers had to know that in 
                advance.

                              AMITA
                I ran a check through Webline --

                              CHARLIE
                -- via a method that must violate 
                two or three telecommunications 
                laws --





                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    27.

    CONTINUED:3232


                              AMITA
                -- Rico Orojos didn t download the 
                VoIP software onto his cell phone 
                until last week.

                              CHARLIE
                Which means that he was expecting 
                the call.  Which means -- 

                              MEGAN
                -- I know what it means.
                      (into phone)

                have a hard talk with Orojos.

  INT. GUEST HOUSE -- DAY3333

  As COLBY and Lobo tear through the guest house -- tossing 
  cushions, opening drawers --

                              COLBY
                This'll go a lot faster if you let 
                the SID team in here --

                              CHE LOBO
                Bad enough having one Fed in here, 
                nosing through my boys' things, 
                looking for dirt --

                              COLBY
                -- looking for a way to get your 
                son home.

                              CHE LOBO
                What if you find some weed, maybe a 
                gun --

                              COLBY
                I'll probably faint from the 
                  surprise.

                              CHE LOBO
                No way Rico was in on this.

                              COLBY
                Guy lives in your guest house -- he 
                wakes up every morning, looks out 
                the window, and sees how rich you 
                are -- how rich he isn t.

  Colby finds a STACK OF PAPERWORK --

  INT. HOSPITAL, ER -- DAY3434

  DAVID looking at Rico as LIZ WARNER gets off her phone --

                              LIZ WARNER
                      (re: Rico)
                Colby just found evidence in 
                Orojos  room -- Lobo s tax returns, 
                Stone Ladron s company reports --

                              DAVID
                He wanted to know how much cash 
                Lobo had liquid...

                              LIZ WARNER
                ... and how much he could raise on 
                short notice.  Think he s the 
                brains behind this?

  David studies Rico through the window --

                              DAVID
                Guy like him soldiers as a banger, 
                he s probably a soldier now.

                              LIZ WARNER
                Am I good cop or bad cop?

                              DAVID

                up one day and realize he's been 
                doing this too long.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                How long is that?

    CONTINUED:3535


                              DON
                Long enough to get mean, and 
                cynical.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Think he's headed that direction?

                              DON
                No one heads that way... all it 
                takes is that one bad day.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                You mean the day you sent Agent 
                Edgerton in to work over a suspect.
                      (off Don, surprised)
                You d be amazed at what I know, and 
                how I know it... you see Sinclair 
                doing the same thing in the same 
                  situation?

  Don considers, the next statement reflecting back on himself 
  as well as David:

                              DON
                No... the thing I really respect 
                about David is, the rules never get 
                in his way.  He always seems to 
                know how to make them work for him.

  INT. HOSPITAL, ER -- DAY3636

  DAVID and LIZ WARNER double teaming Rico, in a hospital bed--

                              DAVID
                Two bodyguards get shot.  One dies, 
                the other catches an easy shoulder 
                wound.
                      (beat)
                Not hard to guess which one was the 
                inside man.

                What're you, crazy?  I love Che... 
                and I love Jo like he was my own

                We know that you subscribed to 
                Wireline to give the kidnapper an 
                  untraceable line to Che Lobo.  And 
                we found his tax returns in your 
                room.

                Hope you're okay with some first 
                year public defender -- because 
                somehow I don't see Che footing the 
                bill for a good one.

  Rico gives Liz a sullen look.

                              DAVID
                You don't want to talk, that's your 
                right; but you ought to listen.  In 
                  twenty-five minutes, we've already 
                tied you to Jo Lobo's kidnapping; 
                by the end of the day, we'll have 
                enough to convict you.
                      (beat)
                The boy comes out of this alive, 
                that's serious enough; he dies, 
                you're looking at the death 
                penalty.  

                              RICO
                You can't put me on that!  They

                Only met them twice -- once when 
                they laid it out for us, once to 
                give them the books.
                      (direly)
                Told Carlos we shouldn't hold

                He was right, too -- when they 
                started shooting, and he went 
                down... soon as I got hit, I laid 
                down and played dead.

                They figured the money would cut 
                better two ways than four.

                              RICO
                Cold blooded sons of bitches -- 
                killing is just part of doing

  WILL BRADFORD and DON.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                  Granger's the junior agent.

                              DON
                Least time with the Bureau -- but I 
                don't know about "junior."

                              WILL BRADFORD
                He's got military.

                              DON
                  Afghanistan.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                He bring it back with him?

                              DON
                  Probably... but he doesn't let it 
                eat him up.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Maybe you've got something to learn 
                from him there.

                              DON
                Maybe.

  EXT. STREET CORNER -- DAY3838

  As a CADILLAC ESCALADE pulls up on a corner...

  ... and a PAIR OF BANGERS roll up in a BANGER CAR and PASS A 
  DUFFEL BAG from window to window --

  INT. ESCALADE -- CONTINUOUS3939

  As the DRIVER passes the bag back to CHE LOBO, who unzips it 
  and looks at the STACKS OF CASH inside.  COLBY looks on --

                              COLBY
                No questions asked...

                              CHE LOBO
                Ever seen that much money in one 
                place?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    33.

                              CHE LOBO
                Keep a little for yourself?

                You didn't did you.  Dudley Do-
                Right.

                              COLBY
                I don't look good in gold chains 
                and a luxury SUV.

  Che laughs at this.  Colby talks into an EARMIKE RADIO --

                We've picked up the money.

  INT. WAR ROOM -- CONTINUOUS4040

  And MEGAN --

                              MEGAN
                I've got David and Liz about five 
                minutes out.  They'll run the 
                physical surveillance.

  Megan hangs up -- tries a PHONE NUMBER again -- busy -- 

                              MEGAN (CONT'D)
                Your brother still isn t answering 
                his phone -- 

  CHARLIE and AMITA have TAX RETURNS and ACCOUNTING BOOKS up on 
  the big screen, and Charlie is working a problem on the clear 
  board --

                              CHARLIE
                Does 3.2 million dollars strike you 
                as an odd ransom amount?

                              MEGAN
                  Initially, I assumed there was a 
                  psychological significance.  But 
                once we knew the kidnappers had 
                accessed Lobo s financial 
                  information --






                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    34.

                              CHARLIE
                -- you assumed they searched for a 
                Pooling Equilibrium -- using the 
                data to calculate the largest sum 
                of money Lobo would be able to 
                obtain on short notice.

                              AMITA
                Which suggests some fairly 
                  sophisticated thinking.

                              CHARLIE
                Given their systematic approach to 
                the ransom demand... well, there 
                are a whole set of strategies 
                called cake-cutting algorithms.

                              MEGAN
                Kind of like -- a cake?

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION --

  of a FROSTED CAKE --

                              CHARLIE 
                Yes... picture a chocolate and 
                vanilla layer cake.  How do two 
                people share it?

  The cake is sliced open, revealing layers of white and black, 
  chocolate frosting on the outside, vanilla on the inside --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                The obvious strategy is to cut it 
                down the middle.  But if one person 
                likes frosting more that the other, 
                or one person prefers vanilla cake, 
                or one person prefers chocolate 
                cake with vanilla frosting --

  -- RESLICE the cake -- cutting out a piece of chocolate with 
  vanilla frosting --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                -- it may be that slices unequal in 
                size actually create a fairer 
                  distribution.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                When you get into three people, the 
                strategies become drastically more 
                complex...

                              MEGAN
                We don't know how many kidnappers 
                we re dealing with.

                              CHARLIE
                We may not need to...

  Charlie points to the "3,200,000" figure on the board --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                ... if we can start from this 
                number and work backwards.  At 
                least two gunmen, plus the two 
                  bodyguards...

                              MEGAN
                -- but they never intended to cut 
                them in --

                              CHARLIE
                No, but the ransom demand had to 
                convince them that they would 
                receive shares.  Those shares would 
                reflect the relative difficulties 
                and risks each participant 
                  undertakes...
                      (beat)
                If we induce a cut and choose a 
                method, with an implicit Pareto 
                  Optimality -- account for costs 
                involved in preparation and 
                  anticipation of escape, assumptions 
                of negotiation or loss--

  Charlie's pen flying across the board --

                              AMITA
                That is some really cool math.

                              CHARLIE
                Always nice to have someone notice--

  He pauses, looks at the work... and writes "1,650,000."

  COLBY gets off his cell phone and walks over to Che Lobo, who 
  stands next to a PAY PHONE out front.

                              COLBY
                What does 1.65 million dollars mean 
                to you?

                              CHE LOBO
                Chump change.

                              COLBY
                Yeah, we're all very impressed with 
                you.  It was your startup cost for 
                Stone Ladron.

  Che Lobo's expression becomes even more guarded --

                              CHE LOBO

  INT. WILL BRADFORD S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS7474

  Don and Will Bradford.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                You grew up in the shadow of Albert 
                  Einstein.  Played baseball just not 
                good enough to make the bigs.
                      (beat)
                You finally find something you're 
                good at, and you're terrified 
                that'll get taken away from you, 
                too.

                              DON
                      (dryly)
                These sessions are making me feel a 
                lot better --

                              WILL BRADFORD
                You want to feel better, take a 
                pill.  You want to get right, face 
                the truth: you're not worried that 
                your team will fall apart if you're 
                not there --
                      (beat)
                -- you're afraid that they won't.  
                That Don Eppes doesn't matter.

                              DON
                      (darkly)
                Like you said... there're a lot of 
                guns and badges out there.  One of 
                us falls, another takes his place.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                That's pretty much the human 
                  condition, Don.
                      (beat)
                What you do before you fall -- 
                that's what counts.

                Yeah, right.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                You brought Sinclair along from a 
                rookie -- Granger too.  When Reeves 
                gets her own team -- who's she 
                going to come to for advice?
                      (beat)
                Who had the pair big enough to 
                bring a damned math professor in to 
                solve federal felonies -- and the 
                brains to watch it work?

  Don shrugs, but hey, it never hurts to hear what you've done 
  right --

                              WILL BRADFORD (CONT'D)
                What you've got to do is stop 
                worrying about life passing you by -
                - start enjoying what you've put 
                into it.  Every time one of your 
                people shines -- it's on you.

  Off Don -- considering --

  out...

  ... into the arms of Che Lobo.  Lobo squeezes him, closes his

  INT. FBI, COFFEE ROOM -- DAY7676

  MEGAN, CHARLIE, COLBY, DAVID, LIZ and AMITA having coffee, 
    bullshitting --

                              COLBY
                A maze.  You risked my life on a 
                maze.

                              CHARLIE
                There was no risk involved, 
                  obviously --

                              COLBY
                      (to Megan, David)
                And you guys let him.

                              DAVID
                The real risk was letting you get 
                on a train -- alone -- with three 
                million dollars.

  Laughter --

                              AMITA
                The math is really very elegant --
                      (to Charlie)
                -- you should think about 
                  publishing.

                What's wrong with your phone?

  Don Checks his phone --

                              DON
                Oh, man -- I turned it off, forgot

                                FLOATING SCENE

  INT. BULLPEN -- NIGHTXYXY

  MEGAN sits alone at her desk -- the office has wound down to 
  almost no one around.  Her PHONE RINGS.

                              MEGAN
                Reeves...
                      (listens)
                Yes sir. I ve given it a lot of 
                  thought....
                      (pauses)
                ... I don t think I can do it.
                      (listens)
                  I understand, but --
                      (listens)
                I take it I don t have a choice in 
                the matter.
                      (listens)
                Yes, sir.

  Megan hangs up.  Takes a long moment to compose herself...

  ... then gathers her things and walks to the elevator.
