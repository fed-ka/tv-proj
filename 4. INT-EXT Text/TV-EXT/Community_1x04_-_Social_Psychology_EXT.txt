Jeff and Britta walk together, out of the school building and 
onto the quad. *

BRITTA
I find Shirley very easy to talk 
to.  And aren t you supposed to 
have, like, an olympic gold medal 
in jibber jabber?

JEFF
Yeah, but I m a sprinter, I m at my 
best during high speed bursts of 
wit.  You lock me into Shirley s 
stride for a marathon banter about 
her brownies?  The awkward silence 
is going to set in before we pass 
the stoner tree.

We see a tree where stoners are hanging out.  VAUGHN, a hot, 
laid-back guy, plays hackey sack with no socks on and his *
shirt in his back pocket.

VAUGHN
Hey, Britta.  Hi.   Sup?

BRITTA
Hey, Vaughn.  How s it going?

VAUGHN
No worries.

JEFF
(to Britta)
Interesting.  Cause I might worry 
if I played hackey sack a decade *
too late.

BRITTA
My class is this way.*

JEFF*
Alright, but I just wanted to point *
out that we easily walked more than *
a hundred yards without a single *
awkward pause, and that s the mark *
of a true friend.  So, nice walking *
with you, friend.*"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised -  8/24/09      2A.

Prof. Duncan (now wearing a lab coat) addresses several psych 
student assistants, including Annie.

PROF. DUNCAN
Welcome, research assistants.*

Annie claps.

Prof. Duncan winks.  Annie titters excitedly.

The waiting is the experiment.  The *
Duncan Principle is simple:  The 
more control lost by - actually, I *
should take this down, too.*

The more control lost by the ego, *
the more gained by the id,

predictable emotional eruption or *

it)
Annie, please let our subjects know *
that the experiment will start in 
five minutes.  

A smiling Annie crosses to the door. 

(CONT D) DUNCAN PROF.
(whispering to everyone)
But it s never going to start.*

Educated titters.  Annie waves her hand over her face, going 
from a smile to a serious face. She opens the door into the 
waiting room. 


Jeff exits the school building with Shirley and some other 
students.  He bends down to tie his shoe, hoping Shirley will 
keep walking.  When he stands, she is right there.

SHIRLEY
Did you know we walk the same way 
after class?  I m sure you didn t 
or else we would ve been walking 
together, unless you re a jerk, 
just kidding.

JEFF
it. do Let s  Ha.

Jeff starts walking with her.

SHIRLEY
Oh hold on now, going a little too 
fast for these dogs.

The walk is even slower.  Long, awkward silence.  They both *
try to break it.

JEFF (CONT D)SHIRLEY
You have a kid, right?How do you like Greendale?

SHIRLEY(CONT D)* 
What s that?

JEFF
Nothing.

Shirley exhales.  This is painful for her too.  Long silence.*"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised -  8/24/09      10.

Pierce is not exactly right in his 
head, is he?

Jeff smiles.  This perks him up.

JEFF*
Oh, I don t know, he seems like a *
pretty normal guy, oh wait, he s *
NUTS.*

Shirley giggles.*

SHIRLEY
You better be careful, he might be 
listening with his Inspector Gadget 
hearing aid.  You know that show?  *

JEFF*
I do know that show. *

SHIRLEY*
Oh, and how about that Hackey Sack 
guy?  Always around, flirting with 
Britta.  It s embarrassing. 

JEFF*
(too loud)
I know!  He s the worst!*

SHIRLEY*
I mean, what is with that hair?

JEFF
It s perpetually moist.  And the 
incessant evangelizing of green 
tea.  No offense, but if I want 
medical advice, I ll get it from 
someone wearing socks.

Shirley loves that one.  They continue gabbing.*


Shirley and Jeff sit on the bench, laughing.

SHIRLEY
Oh, and have you seen how often 
Hackey Sack takes his shirt off?  *
He d play shirts and skins in a 
game of checkers.*

I am so glad to be able to talk 
about that guy.  I wanted to say 
something to Britta but we re *
supposed to be friends now and *
she d think I was jealous.*

SHIRLEY*
I don t see why you and Britta 
aren t together.  Two cute white 
people, going to school together, 
just seems right.

JEFF
Shirley, we re not pandas in a zoo.  

SHIRLEY
(seeing something)
Oh dear.

Jeff looks.  Britta and Vaughn make out on the quad.

JEFF
That is not what I want to see.

Britta looks up, sees Jeff watching her.

SHIRLEY
And there goes the shirt.

to Shirley.

direction.  He clearly doesn t like what he hears.


An angry Jeff walks across the quad.  Shirley catches up with 
him.

SHIRLEY
Jeff, wait!  I m sorry I sold you 
out.

JEFF
Britta s never going to forgive me.  *
I can t believe I showed you that 
poem - good lord, when did my life *
