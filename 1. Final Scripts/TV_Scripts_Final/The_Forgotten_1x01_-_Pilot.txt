      EXT. INTERSTATE - MORNING

      Traffic moves briskly on this highway just outside CHICAGO.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    So many people.  Heading to school.  
                    Late for work.  Just singing along.  
                    Living their lives.

      From the shoulder, a LONE DEER peers out at the cars and 
      noise.  And the woman continues to speak to us:

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    None of them sees me.  They don t 
                    even know that I m here.

      Startled, the deer bolts from the shoulder and back towards 
      some NEARBY WOODS.  We follow.

      EXT. EMBANKMENT - SAME

      The woods are shallow, opening up towards an ACCESS ROAD on a 
      flat Midwestern plain.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    I was on my way somewhere, too.  I 
                    had finally figured everything out.  

      The deer is gone but we linger.  More ominous, more quiet; 
      the highway and all the life it entails seems a world away.  
      Moving down towards a DITCH-- and ending on a LIFELESS BODY.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And then this happened to me.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FLASH!

      as a photo is taken of her.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: a BUSY 
      CRIME SCENE.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. CITY MORGUE - NIGHT

      The young woman here.  On a slab in an open drawer.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    And now I m here.  In a drawer.  In 
                    the dark.  Day after day I ve been 
                    waiting.  Not waiting to be 
                    saved...

      A CORONER makes some final notations on a clipboard.  He 
      slides the drawer closed, one among many.                                                                                        2.



                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Waiting to be found.

      A small ID slot marks the outside of the cabinet.  Written on 
      it:  JANE DOE.  The Coroner shuts off the light.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT - DOWNTOWN - DAY 

      Loud and gritty and action-packed.  PIMPS chained to desk 
      chairs, inappropriate sexual banter among co-workers, 
      somebody bleeding. 

      Watching and leaning against the front counter, but very much 
      on the other side of it: ALEX DONOVAN (30s).  Handsome and 
      winning, but the passion underneath trumps all.  

      Having seen all of this before, and been in the middle of 
      half of it, he watches with amusement as a biggish female 
      DESK CLERK doesn t even look up from her paperwork.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    You miss it, Alex?

                                  ALEX
                    I miss you.  Sexy.

      She smirks but still doesn t look up.  Alex sees DETECTIVE 
      GRACE OLIVO (20s) walking over.  She s city tough but has a 
      soft spot for the man opposite.  She hands him a file.

                                  DET OLIVO
                     Highway Jane.   Here it is.

                                  ALEX
                    Here she is.  She s a person, 
                    Grace.  Did I teach you nothing?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Right.  Sorry.

      She s not being sarcastic, she just forgot how particular he 
      gets over such things.  He s looking through the file.

                                  ALEX
                    Five days and she s in the ground?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Yeah.  Keep in touch, all right?  
                    And thank you.

      He offers a reassuring smile.

                                  ALEX
                    I m late for court.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Witness or defendant?                                                                                      3.



      He walks out the door--

      INT. CITY COURTROOM - (MOMENTS) LATER

      Empty seats, some low-level matter.  Alex stands before the 
      weary JUDGE (female).

                                  JUDGE
                    Mr. Alex Donovan.  You know this 
                    fine individual?

      Seated at the defendant s table: TYLER DAVIES (early 20s), 
      lean and raggedly handsome, guilty of something, unhappy in 
      his only suit. 

                                  ALEX
                    It s personal, your honor.  I mean, 
                    it s not  it s personal  like  I 
                    can t tell you,  I mean it s not 
                      professional.  I was in Homicide 
                    for seven years, a uniform for five 
                    before that.  I didn t know him 
                    there.  Did that make sense?  

                                  JUDGE
                      Eventually.

                                  ALEX
                    I ve known Tyler since he was--
                          (turns to someone)
                    --you were six, right?

      Tyler just stares at Alex, expressionless.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    First grade.  At Newport Prep.  My 
                    wife, at the time, was a teacher s 
                    aide there.  We became friends with 
                    the family, with Lars and Brenda...

                                  JUDGE
                    This is fascinating.

                                  ALEX
                    All I m saying, your honor, is that 
                    Tyler s a good kid.  He completed 
                    an alcohol abuse program--

                                  JUDGE
                    Which clearly didn t take.

                                  ALEX
                    True.  But he has so much 
                      potential.  The artisticness is 
                    bursting out of him.

                                  JUDGE
                    Onto the overpass at State Street.  
                    In several different colors of 
                    spray paint.                                                                                      4.



                                  ALEX
                    Exactly.  Which is why we need to 
                    find a way to channel that energy.

      Alex takes a few steps towards the judge.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    May I approach?

                                  JUDGE
                    You are approaching.

      As Alex and the Judge confer, Tyler watches with interest 
      from his seat...

      EXT. COURTHOUSE - (MOMENTS) LATER

      Alex walks out with Tyler, handing him a scrap of paper.

                                  ALEX
                    She was going to have you pick up 
                    trash on the Interstate.  You know 
                    that, don t you?

                                  TYLER
                    I know.

                                  ALEX
                    Be at this address at 7PM tonight.  
                    We re a victim s rights group.  We 
                    need your help.  200 hours of it.

                                  TYLER
                    Okay.  Thanks.  But there s just 
                    one thing.

                                  ALEX
                    Sure.

                                  TYLER
                    Who the hell are you?

      Tyler has never seen Alex before in his life.  But Alex is 
      already walking away and making a call.

      INT. LINDA MANNING S HOUSE - DAY

      Middle class, quiet.  A BABY sleeps in a crib.  LINDA MANNING 
      (late 30s), looks out from a window at the world.  Single 
      minded, sharp focus, hard shell.  We ll learn why.

      She s looking at something in particular: an AMAZON BOX, 
      halfway up her front walk.  She can feel herself tensing up.  
      If she could will it into the house, she would.

                                  LINDA
                          (to herself)
                    It s four steps.

      Finally she takes a deep breath and heads                                                                                      5.



      OUTSIDE

      to retrieve it, quick focused steps--

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    One two three four...

      It s all going well, but then as she bends to grab it the 
      WORLD GOES HAYWIRE as she wavers, sounds get loud and crazy, 
      neighbors stare and whisper, her heart THUMPS in her chest... 

      She scrambles to pick it up, almost stumbling as she grabs it 
      finally, then turns and RUNS back inside.

      INT. LINDA S KITCHEN - DAY

      She s drained.  The PHONE is ringing.  She rushes in to 
      answer it, tearing open the box as she speaks.

                                  LINDA
                          (into phone)
                    Alex-- you got it?  

      She jots something down on the cardboard flap, sounding 
      commanding and unafraid, contrary to what we ve just seen...

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    That works.  I ll let them know.

      She hangs up.  Tearing off the note, leaving the box, we see 
      what s inside: GROCERIES.  She moves to her 

      LIVING ROOM

      which is more of a great room-- couch and TV, plus a dining 
      area, then a little work area in the corner: desktop 
      computer, filing cabinets, an empty CORKBOARD.  Some kind of 
      home business.  Or something else.  She sits down at the 
      computer and calls up an INSTANT MESSAGE WINDOW--

      INT. HIGHRISE OFFICE - DOWNTOWN - DAY

      A large WOMAN (40s) blows out candles on a birthday cake.  Co-
      workers cheer and line up for a slice.  We MOVE AWAY from 
      them to show a LARGE PLAIN OFFICE: cubicles, paper pushing, 
      soul crushing.  And all the workers drawn to the party 
        distraction, except one--

      CANDACE BUTLER (20s).  Dark good looks and whip-smart, she 
      retains her quirks and sarcasm in a sea of gray, but it s a 
      losing battle.  She yawns and works on some documents; the 
      Meaning Of Life is not herein.  

      An INSTANT MESSAGE goes PING on Candace s computer:

                   HIGHWAY JANE 7PM tonight

      Candace perks up.  This she cares about.  She grabs her cell 
      phone and begins typing a text message--                                                                                      6.



      EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

      A white PHONE COMPANY VAN is parked.  Up on a phone pole: 
      hard-hatted WALTER SNELL.  40s, lumpy, working hard at 
      something.  CO-WORKERS listen to a ballgame on the radio 
      below.  They pay no attention to him.

      Walter s cell phone rings-- the theme from  COPS.   He 
      reaches inside his blue coverall, the one with his name on a 
      little white patch, this is the call he s been waiting for, 
      his moment to shine, the day he ll prove--

      He drops the phone.  It hits a co-worker on the helmet.  
      THONK.

      EXT. LINDA S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Tyler stands outside, checking that scrap of paper:

                  144 Mulberry Drive

      He has the right place.  He exhales, not happy to be there.  
      He pulls a fifth of WHISKEY from his pocket and takes a sip.

      He approaches, knocks, and Linda answers, gives him a small 
      smile, and lets him in.  She takes a paranoid glance out into 
      the street before shutting the door behind him.

      INT. LINDA S KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Linda pours coffee for Tyler.  

                                  LINDA
                    So Alex explained who we are?   The 
                    Identity Network? 

                                  TYLER
                    Not really.  He said you were a 
                     victims  rights group. 

                                  LINDA
                    We help identify John and Jane 
                    Does.   A body is found, no wallet 
                    or anything, no friends or family 
                    come forward... the police have 
                    done what they can.  

                                  TYLER
                    Okay...

                                  LINDA
                    So  The Identity Network  is made 
                    up of volunteers across the 
                    country, connected on the Internet.  
                    We share tips, ideas, we use our 
                    own knowledge and expertise... and 
                    we re all committed to finding out 
                    who these people are.

      Tyler nods.  Maybe getting it.  Linda starts walking towards                                                                                      7.



      THE LIVING ROOM

      and Tyler follows.  She turns to him:

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    So this is it.  The Midwest 
                    Regional Headquarters of  The 
                    Identity Network. 

      It s a middle class living room with a bassinet in the 
      corner.  Tyler can t hide the skepticism.  Walter looks up--

                                  WALTER
                    What, you were expecting  CSI? 

      Before Tyler can react--

                                    CANDACE
                    Just ignore him.  I m Candace.  

      She extends a hand and smiles.  Tyler shakes.  Maybe this 
      won t be so bad.

                                  LINDA
                    Tyler does facial reconstructions.
                          (to Tyler)
                    Sometimes a guy in Texas helps us 
                    out, but it s good to finally have 
                    one of our own.

                                    CANDACE
                    You complete us, Tyler.

                                  LINDA
                    He and Alex go way back.

      She gives Tyler a wry smile.  But before he can respond, 
      Walter walks over.  He s wearing his blue coverall from work.

                                  WALTER
                          (to Tyler)
                    What happened to your face?

                                  TYLER
                    Excuse me?

      Walter gives Tyler a long hard look.

                                  WALTER
                    That bruise.  On your cheek.  It 
                    tells me ten different things about 
                    you.  Maybe ten things you don t 
                    want me to know.

                                  TYLER
                    It s paint.  I m an artist.

                                  WALTER
                    Oh.                                                                                      8.



      Alex hurries into the room, carrying a file box.  And PIZZA.

                                  ALEX
                     Highway Jane.   Murdered. 
                      Interstate 88, the Westside Road 
                    exit.  Behind it there s an access 
                    road, Diehl Lane.  No ID on the 
                    body, no DNA match in the 
                      databases.
                          (takes a breath)
                    Hello everyone.

      Alex hands some photocopies to Linda as everyone assembles 
      around the dining table.  She begins passing them out as Alex 
      wheels in the CORKBOARD that was in a corner.  

      Alex tacks a GOOGLE MAP to the corkboard at one corner, and a 
      MONTHLY CALENDAR to the other.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    She was found here...
                          (circles a date)
                    And now we re here...
                          (2 weeks later)
                    And we have until here.

      Five days from now.  Tyler leans over to Candace.

                                  TYLER
                    What happens then?

                                    CANDACE
                    They bury her.  Unmarked grave in 
                    Potter s Field.  Everyone forgets 
                    about her.

                                  ALEX
                          (to Tyler)
                    And a murderer goes free.
                          (to group)
                    Here s our girl--

      He thumbtacks some CRIME SCENE PHOTOS to the board.  

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    White.  Dyed black hair.  Five foot 
                    seven.  Approximate weight 110 
                    pounds.  Approximate age 18-22.  

      Photos aren t pretty; the team reacts.  

                                  WALTER
                    Whoa.  That s a lot of decomp.

                                  ALEX
                    Which is why I ve recruited our 
                    face friend here.  Highway Jane was 
                    in the ditch at least a week.  
                    Animals probably got to her.
                    Cause of death was strangulation.                                                                                      9.



                                    CANDACE
                    That s a crime of passion.  

                                  WALTER
                    Like Jennifer Levin.  Central Park, 
                    1986.

                                  ALEX
                    Remember it s about her story.  
                    Because without who  is  it--

                                    CANDACE
                    There s no who  done  it.  We know.

      Alex smiles.  They re well trained.

                                  ALEX
                    Okay.  Here s what we ve got: black 
                    nail polish--

      Linda is up at the corkboard.  She s writing on an index 
      card: NAIL POLISH.  

                                    CANDACE
                    Goth chick?

                                  ALEX
                    Maybe.  
                          (next)
                    Clothes--

      Linda shrugs as Candace gets out her computer and powers up, 
      Linda tacks up another index card: CLOTHES.

                                  LINDA
                    Jeans and shoes look pretty 
                    regular.  But this blouse--

                                  WALTER
                    So the card should say  blouse.   
                    Alex always says to be specific.

                                  ALEX
                    I m standing right here, Walter.
                          (smiling)
                    He s right.  Chassoni.  Expensive.

                                  LINDA
                    A fancy blouse with black nails?

                                  ALEX
                    Police checked the boutiques--

                                    CANDACE
                    What about thrift stores?  She s 
                    not rich.  Rich girls have someone 
                    looking for them.                                                                                    10.



                                  ALEX
                    Good idea.  Can you get a clean 
                    photo of the blouse somewhere, 
                    something we can show around?

      Candace nods.  Linda rips up the CLOTHES card and writes 
      BLOUSE.  Alex keeps going--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Tattoo, on her ankle--

      Alex tacks up the photo-- it looks like a bunch of SQUIGGLY 
      LINES.  Linda gives it a TATTOO card.

                                  WALTER
                          (looks at photo)
                    Of what?

                                  LINDA
                    Looks like a foreign alphabet.

                                    CANDACE
                    Maybe it s a tag.  Like a human 
                      trafficking thing.

                                  ALEX
                    We ll need some help from the 
                    Network. 

                                  LINDA
                    I ll highlight it when I set up the 
                    web page.

                                  ALEX
                    Great.  And last but not least-- 
                    this was found in her back pocket.

      Alex puts up a photocopy of a crumpled SCRAP of paper.  
      Handwritten on it:  747 - 50 

                                    CANDACE
                    It s a math problem.

                                  WALTER
                    Phone digits.

                                  LINDA
                    A flight number.

      Alex looks at it too.  Unsure.  Linda makes a card that says 
      NOTE.  Meanwhile Walter writes his own index card and puts it 
      on the corkboard.  It says ID-COC.

                                    CANDACE
                    Id-Cock?

                                  WALTER
                     ID Community Outreach 
                      Coordinator.   That is me.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                  WALTER (CONT'D)
                    In charge of flyer production and 
                      distribution.  

      Everyone ponders this in silence.  

                                  ALEX
                    Of course.  We just didn t 
                    recognize the... evocative 
                      abbreviation.

      Then Candace realizes--

                                    CANDACE
                    Hey.  Where d Face Boy go?

      Tyler is gone.  They hear the front door CLOSE.  Alex hurries 
      out after him.

      EXT. LINDA S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Tyler walking away.  Alex behind.

                                  ALEX
                    Hey.  It might help if you took a 
                    copy of the pictures from the 
                    morgue.  Unless you have one of 
                    those photographic memory thingys--

      Tyler keeps walking.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    You know we identified 17 victims 
                    last year.  And we helped catch the 
                    killers a dozen times.  We re good 
                    at this.  And with you we ll be 
                    even better.

      Still nothing.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I took a chance with you, all 
                    right?  I ve been tracking every 
                      quote-unquote  artist  who gets 
                    busted for the past six months.  
                    And you re the jackpot.  You took 
                    all those forensic classes--

      Finally Tyler stops and turns around.  

                                  TYLER
                    So?  It s all been practice.  I ve 
                    never done one of these for real.  
                    I m not an expert.

                                  ALEX
                          (gestures towards house)
                    Did they look like experts?  It s 
                    not a requirement.                                                                                    12.



                                  TYLER
                    The guy in the blue onesie seemed 
                    pretty sure of himself.

                                  ALEX
                    There might be people somewhere 
                    looking for Highway Jane.  But 
                    they re not looking for black 
                    nails.  They re looking for her 
                    face.  We need you.

                                  TYLER
                    I can t do it.  I m calling 
                    probation tomorrow.  I can t sculpt 
                    a dead girl.  It s too weird.

                                  ALEX
                    You need to really think about 
                    what s going to happen five days 
                    from now.  Okay?  Some low level 
                    guy is gonna pull her out of that 
                    drawer, mangled face and all, and 
                    he s gonna bury her in an unmarked 
                    field, with an unmarked grave, and 
                    she s gonna be Jane Doe forever.  
                    We need to make sure that doesn t 
                    happen.  We need to get her story 
                    out there.

                                  TYLER
                    I know that but--

                                  ALEX
                    And it s not just for her, man.  
                    It s for her parents.  Maybe a 
                    sister or brother.  Right now 
                    they ve lost track of her.  Maybe 
                    it s been months or years since 
                    they ve heard her voice.  And they 
                    go to sleep every night wondering 
                    where she is.  And what happened.

                                  TYLER
                    But what s the point?  Telling them 
                    she s dead is gonna fix that?

                                  ALEX
                    It s knowledge.  And then we can 
                    try to get justice.

                                  TYLER
                    It s still grief.  And pain.  It s 
                    just a different kind.

      Alex takes a step towards him.  Choosing his words carefully.

                                  ALEX
                    Three years ago my daughter Lucy 
                    was kidnapped.  My only child.  11 
                    years old.  Lincoln Park Zoo, on a 
                    Tuesday afternoon.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    They never found out who did it.  
                    And they ve never found her.  Is 
                    she dead?  Maybe.  Probably.  But I 
                    don t know.  And I may never know.

      Tyler softens a bit.  Alex hands him an ENVELOPE.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    So you re right.  There s grief and 
                    pain all around.  But when you 
                    know, you can heal.  It matters.  
                    Trust me.

      Alex heads back in.  Leaving Tyler there to think about it.

      INT. TYLER S LOFT - NIGHT

      Sparsely furnished, Tyler home, having a drink.  He types in 
      a web address: 

                       www.idnetwork.org

      He sees the homepage for  THE IDENTITY NETWORK.   It s easy 
      to navigate, but homey and not high tech.  In a word: 
      amateur.  There s a US map with different regions... listings 
      of HOT CASES... a button to REPORT A TIP... 

      Tyler goes to the Highway Jane page, which is now up: the 
        information, the headings, recapping what we know:

      HOT CASE MW-209
        UNIDENTIFIED WHITE FEMALE
      VITAL STATISTICS
      ESTIMATED HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
      CLOTHING

      and then the empty square where it says PHOTO NOT AVAILABLE.

      Tyler packs up some of his paints and works in progress, 
      clears a table, loads up a paint-splattered CD player, and 
      grabs a beer from a fridge that holds little else.

      He opens the ENVELOPE that Alex gave him: photos from the 
      morgue, close-ups, measurements.  Then he gets to work--

      -- pouring RESIN into a cast, then removing it to reveal the 
      basic shape of a CRANIUM;

      -- attaching the CRANIUM to the lower part of a separate 
      skull cast...

      Tyler consults the photos and measurements.  Then he begins 
      cutting small RUBBER PEGS into distinct lengths and numbering 
      them with a fine black pen.

      He installs two EYEBALLS into the dried skull... painting 
      them brown... shining a flashlight into each to align them... 

      We pull away, seeing Tyler s focus and skill, yet knowing 
      he ll be at this long into the night.                                                                                    14.



      INT. LINDA S HOUSE - (NEXT) MORNING

      Alex follows Linda back into the living room.  Tyler, 
      Candace, and Walter are standing there, in a small circle...

      They step aside, and on the dining room table we see the back 
      of a YOUNG WOMAN S head.  As Alex comes around the front, the 
      group parts slightly so Alex can see--

      The FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION of Highway Jane: black hair, brown 
      eyes, expressionless but impeccable.  And THE VOICE OF OUR 
      VICTIM RETURNS:

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    So there I was.  With a name that 
                    isn t  Jane.   With a family that s 
                    waiting.  And I don t want them 
                    waiting anymore.

      Alex gives Tyler a look of thanks.  But it s the face that 
      draws him.  And gives all of them pause, and focus.

                                  ALEX
                    This is her.  This is our girl.  
                    Her story starts here.

      Linda moves forward, puts her hand lightly on Alex s arm.

                                  LINDA
                    She s not your daughter, Alex.

      He turns to her.  He looks okay with it.  Or as okay with it 
      as someone could be.

                                  ALEX
                    I know.  But she s somebody s 
                    daughter.

                                  TYLER
                    So what do we do now?

                                  ALEX
                    We get to work.


                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    15.



                                            ACT TWO



      EXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY

      The scene of the crime: highway and woods in the near 
      distance.  There s a slight ditch alongside the access road 
      where the body was dumped.  We GLIDE ABOVE it from the tree 
      tops, as if Highway Jane were looking down on her saviors. 

                                  WALTER
                    There s nothing here, Alex.

                                  ALEX
                    She died here.  I needed to see it.   

      As he studies the dead leaves on the ground, light snow 
      drifting around them-- 

                                                                          FLASH TO:

       DOE MOMENT 

      which is a way for us to grab a quick glimpse of our victim 
      when she was alive, as Alex and the others follow her path 
      and trace her footprints in the world--

      A man's hands around JANE DOE's neck.  She tries to scream.  
      She can't.  She falls to the floor.  Life leaves her body.  
      Eyes go dark.

                                                                              RESUME:

      EXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY 

      Walter watches as Alex stares at one spot.

                                  ALEX
                    We look backwards and fill in the 
                    rest.  In four days.  No problem.

      Alex looks up and gives him a small smile, knowing the 
      enormity of the task.  He starts walking back to his car, 
      next to Walter s white van.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Candace is going to work on the 
                    nail polish.  Maybe narrow down to 
                      a specific shade, or find the 
                    people who sold it to her if she s 
                    lucky.  I m gonna track down the 
                    blouse, maybe our girl was a 
                    regular at one of the thrift shops, 
                    made some friends behind the 
                    counter.

      Walter is wearing his coverall.  He walks behind.  Alex 
      points across the plain:                                                                                    16.



                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    And you re heading there, right?

      There s an OLD GAS STATION, down the access road maybe a 
      quarter of a mile away.  And a quick 360 shows no other 
      businesses or homes.

                                  WALTER
                    Yeah.  I mean, if that s okay--

                                  ALEX
                    It s more than  okay  it s 
                      important.  It s the only place out 
                    here.  Work your magic, W.

                                  WALTER
                    Please don t call me that.

      Alex smiles and drives away, leaving him there.  Walter looks 
      at the crime scene briefly... then back to the gas station.

      EXT. GAS STATION - ACCESS ROAD OFF INTERSTATE - DAY 

      A closer look.  A few customers, a small shop.  No carwashes 
      or sub shops attached.  Walter drives in and parks.  

      INT. WHITE VAN - DAY 

      Walter climbs over the front seat and into the back.  He 
      unzips the coverall-- and is fully clothed underneath in 
      slacks, short sleeve dress shirt, and tie.  The full 
      Sipowicz, ready for action.

      INT. ACCESS ROAD GAS STATION - CASHIER AREA - (MOMENTS) LATER

      The bell CHIMES as Walter enters.  The CASHIER (20s) looks up 
      briefly: dark hair, ponytail, not friendly.

                                  WALTER
                    Hey there.  Cold out.  Chilly.

      Cashier nods but doesn t say anything.  Walter pretends to 
      look at items on the counter, fingering a keychain.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Business pretty slow, huh?

                                    CASHIER
                    The porn s over there.

                                  WALTER
                    No, no-- I was wondering if I could 
                    ask you something.  I don t know if 
                    you re aware of this, but there was 
                    a murder a couple of weeks ago, 
                    over there across the road.  

      Walter gestures out the window, towards the highway and woods 
      in the near distance, a slight ditch alongside the access 
      road where the body was dumped.                                                                                     17.



                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    And I was hoping we could leave 
                    some flyers here, for the 
                      customers.

      He puts a stack on the counter.  We catch a glimpse: they say 
      DO YOU KNOW HER? and there s pictures of the facial 
        reconstruction, the tattoo, the note.  Cashier pushes them 
      away.

                                    CASHIER
                    No.  That s against store policy.  

      Walter seems surprised.  But he s ready with a comeback.

                                  WALTER
                    Really?  Well your policy is 
                    against my policy.

                                    CASHIER
                    Get them out of here.

      Cashier seems pretty serious.  Walter nods, picks them up, 
      but he isn t done yet.

                                  WALTER
                    This is the closest gas station 
                    around.  It s the only gas station 
                    around.  You were here that night, 
                    right?  By yourself?

                                    CASHIER
                    So what?

                                  WALTER
                    So maybe you saw something.  Or 
                    maybe... you did something.

                                    CASHIER
                    I already talked to the police.  
                    And unless you ve got some kind of 
                    badge, we re done talking.

      Walter s done.  He s leaving.  But as he s walking out he 
      quickly turns back-- and SNAPS a PHOTO.

                                  WALTER
                    I m watching you.

                                    CASHIER
                    Rock on, Shaggy.

      Walter exits.  Cashier returns to a magazine.

      EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 

      Walter is pumped.  He looks at the photo.                                                                                    18.



                                  WALTER
                     Maybe you did something.   That 
                    was good.

      He looks beyond the bright lights of the station, towards the 
      crime scene, holding up one of the flyers and looking at her 
      face as it flaps in the breeze and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

      We follow Candace through the store at a high angle as she 
      ends up browsing at the cosmetic counter.  The place is luxe 
      and the CLERKS look down at her if they look at all.  And THE 
      VOICE OF OUR VICTIM returns: 

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    I was always a ruby and peach kind 
                    of girl.  Bright red, soft pink.  
                    Nothing in between.

      Candace realizes what she s looking for isn t here.  She 
      exits.

      INT.  TEEN TEES  MALL STORE - DAY

      Like that HOT TOPIC store: black velvet posters, goofy gifts, 
      jailbait fashion.  Candace shows the flyer to the SALES 
      CLERK, but she doesn t recognize the picture.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    But that was the old me.  The new 
                    me wanted it dark and different. 

      Candace buys several different black nail polishes.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    It s amazing how just a little 
                    thing -- the color of your nails -- 
                    can change not just how you see the 
                    world... but how you see yourself.

      As Candace waits to pay for them, she notices several 
      different HANDOUTS next to the register.  Advertisements for 
      CLUBS, CONCERTS, etc.  One in particular has striking, snazzy 
      graphics:  SILVERTONGUE.   She grabs all of them and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:

       DOE MOMENT 

      and this time we get a tight close-up of Highway Jane s 
      nails, and then her hands... perhaps a hint of her forearm... 
      tantalizing glimpses of a moment she lived... slow motion, 
      sound muted... a dream we can t fully remember...

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    So all I can say is-- paint it 
                    black, baby.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    19.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I didn t do it to match my mood.  I 
                    did it to give me one.

      And she paints her nails, blows them dry, assesses them in 
      the light... holding them up to a face we still can t see...

                                                                              RESUME:

      INT. CANDACE S OFFICE - PRESENT

      Candace back at her cubicle.  She has just finished painting 
      her nails black.  She looks at them, kind of digging it--

      Co-workers MONICA and MEL (20s) watch from another cubicle.

                                  MONICA
                    What a freak.

      Candace has had enough.  She stands up and smiles sweetly.

                                    CANDACE
                    Hey Monica, Melanie.  It s so 
                    totally weird.  There s like, ten 
                    different kinds of black nail 
                    polish.  Did you know that?

      They re a little put off, office cowards smiling awkwardly.  
      Candace shows them all ten fingers.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    Anyway, I m not sure which I like 
                    best... but I m leaning towards 
                    these two.

      She curls up her hands-- only middle fingers now extended.   
      Monica and Mel are shocked, faces filled with OMG.  Candace 
      sits back down, loving it.  Maybe the nails have done 
      something to her mood, too.

      INT. LINDA S LIVING ROOM - (THAT) NIGHT

      CLOSE on some new cards: USHER/AUGUSTA, PSYCHIC/DETROIT... 
      Candace writes the second one and pins it to the board.  
      Everyone present.  Empty pizza boxes, coffee cups... Walter 
      peers at Linda s computer screen.

                                  WALTER
                    Ten new  forwards  already? 

      Tyler looks at Candace, confused.

                                    CANDACE
                    It s a person who comes  forward  
                    with a tip.

                                  TYLER
                    Ah.

      Tyler sits down on the couch and it SQUEAKS.  He looks 
      underneath: he sat on a baby toy.                                                                                    20.



                                  LINDA
                    Actually 12 now.  The flyers and 
                    the email blast really helped.

      Tyler tosses the toy to Linda, who is printing pages, hands 
      them to Candace, who reads the pages and shakes her head but 
      makes a new card anyway-- DRAG QUEEN/HOUSTON. 

                                    CANDACE
                    Some better than others.

      It joins the rest under a new heading on the corkboard: 
       FORWARDS.   Meanwhile Alex is attaching a business card and 
      photos from the thrift shop to the corkboard under BLOUSE.  
      The first of many fragments of her life, a collage that has 
      begun to come together.

                                  ALEX
                    The blouse was purchased at 
                    Sunshine Thrift, on Ashland Avenue.  
                    Record of the sale but no record of 
                    the buyer.

                                    CANDACE
                    West Loop, right?  The University s 
                    near there.  Was she a student?

                                  LINDA
                    I don t think any of the local 
                    colleges reported anyone missing.  
                    But I ll double check that.

      Another heading now says MISSING CROSS-CHECK and has a list 
      of states and a STATE MAP.  Linda has several windows open on 
      her computer monitor and a couple of three-ring binders open 
      on her desk-- all featuring FACES OF YOUNG WOMEN. 

                                    CANDACE
                          (to Alex)
                    Anything on the tattoo from 
                    Detective Olivo?

                                  ALEX
                    She says there s nothing from the 
                    federal or international databases, 
                    so it s nothing with organized 
                    crime or trafficking.  

                                  LINDA
                    I got an email from a new member, 
                    this professor of Near Eastern 
                    studies at UCLA.  He thinks it s 
                    the Arabic word for  thunder. 

                                  ALEX
                       Thunder?   That s an interesting 
                    choice for a teenage girl.

                                  WALTER
                    Maybe she was dating an Arab guy.  
                    Part of a sleeper cell.                                                                                    21.



                                  TYLER
                    Or studying to be a meteorologist.

      Alex smiles, appreciating Tyler s humor-- but he is also 
      looking at a photo on the cork board-- the gas station 
      attendant.

                                  ALEX
                    Who s that guy?

                                  WALTER
                    The gas station clerk.  I m 
                    watching him.

      Alex considers this and is tempted to comment... then just 
      shrugs and accepts it.

                                    CANDACE
                      I couldn t really narrow down the 
                    nail polish--

                                  TYLER
                    There s more than one black?

                                    CANDACE
                      Apparently.  But I did pick up 
                    these.

      She shows them the flyers from the mall store.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    If she gets her nail polish there, 
                    maybe she gets her social life 
                    there, too.

                                  ALEX
                    Good.  We ve got less than four 
                    days, people.  Remember-- she s 
                    still Highway Jane because it isn t 
                    obvious.  If this were easy she d 
                    be home already.
                          (to Candace and Tyler)
                    You guys want to handle it?  You 
                    look like the nightclubbing types.

                                  TYLER
                    I went to Catholic school.

                                    CANDACE
                    We ll go.

                                  ALEX
                    Great.  Check in later.  And be 
                    careful.  Her story s out there but 
                    so is the person who ended it.

      They nod and get up to head out.  Meanwhile Walter is also 
      putting on his coat.                                                                                    22.



                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Uh Walter?  Most social 
                      establishments have a  no jumpsuit  
                    policy.

                                  WALTER
                    I m not going with them.  I have to 
                    go to work.  

                                  ALEX
                    Oh.  Okay.

      Walter gets defensive (for no reason).

                                  WALTER
                    I m sorry, all right?  But they 
                    don t let people at the phone 
                    company take their pension at 40.

      Linda looks at the clock.

                                  LINDA
                    I thought you were supposed to be 
                    there two hours ago.

                                  WALTER
                          (irritated)
                    We can only provide a window, 
                    Linda.

      Walter leaves.  Alex and Linda exchange a look.

      INT. CLUB SILVERTONGUE - NIGHT

      Dark and crowded, we hear more than we see: a METAL BAND 
      plays on stage, the music is LOUD and AGGRESSIVE, bodies 
      mashed together, corners and shadows where we don t want to 
      linger...  

      Candace and Tyler climb to a BALCONY, jostling as they go.  
      Tyler looks particularly unimpressed with the crowd.

                                    CANDACE
                    This one s even more crowded.  Who 
                    are these people?

                                  TYLER
                    Please tell me we re out of flyers.

      They reach the balcony where there s another BAR crammed with 
      people, they look down at the crowd and take it in as we:

                                                                          FLASH TO:                                                                                    23.



       DOE MOMENT 

      As in the crowd we see a snippet of Highway Jane dancing... 
        slow-motion, almost dreamlike... another one of her 
      footprints in the world...

                                                                              RESUME:

      INT. CLUB SILVERTONGUE - CONTINUOUS

      Candace takes a picture of the downstairs with her phone.  
      Then she pulls a stack of flyers from her bag, handing a 
      bunch to Tyler and starting to work the crowd:

                                    CANDACE
                    Hey do you know this girl?  No?

      But Tyler s still at the railing-- and ONE GUY is looking 
      right back up at him... he s got a SHAVED HEAD, skull tattoo, 
      flesh tunnels on both ears-- but his cold eyes are the most 
      frightening thing of all.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    Tyler!

      Candace grabs his arm and he turns suddenly-- but she s not 
      in any danger, she just wants him to get to work.  Tyler 
      nods, taking some of the flyers-- when he turns back to look 
      down below for Shaved Head, he s gone.

      Tyler s puzzled, but Candace has already pushed him forward 
      into the crowd at the bar as she s handed a flyer to a YOUNG 
      DRUNK GUY:

                                  YOUNG DRUNK GUY
                    That s awesome!  You re really 
                    talented!

      People pushing, it s difficult to hear (or be heard) over the 
      music-- behind them they don t notice as Shaved Head has 
      climbed the stairs and spotted them--

                                  TYLER
                    Have you seen her before?

                                  YOUNG DRUNK GUY
                    Her eyes are haunting, man!  It s 
                    like the despair of a generation!

                                    CANDACE
                          (yelling)
                    Do you know her?!?!

      He nods and shakes his head and smiles, bobbing, huh?  
      Candace and Tyler look at each other-- and then Shaved Head 
      grabs Tyler roughly from behind--

                                  TYLER
                    Hey--                                                                                    24.



                                  SHAVED HEAD
                    You cops?

                                    CANDACE
                    No.  We re just looking for anyone 
                    who knows this girl--

      She holds up a flyer, and he grabs it and crumples it.

                                  SHAVED HEAD
                    You don t belong here.  Get out.

      Tyler puts his hands up in surrender, but Shaved Head is 
      still herding them towards the stairs.  

      Busy with Tyler, he doesn t notice as Candace leans behind 
      and stashes a bunch of flyers on the edge of the bar... 

      INT. LINDA S LIVING ROOM - SAME

      Alex and Linda are comparing a MISSING PERSON PHOTO to the 
      sculpture of the head, which is on the coffee table.

                                  ALEX
                    Nope.

                                  LINDA
                    That s the last one.

      Alex gets up and wanders into the kitchen.  Meanwhile Linda 
      goes to the corkboard and crosses off OHIO and colors it in 
      on a US map, then moves up a card that says IOWA...  

      Alex walks back in.  He s chugging something into his mouth.  
      Linda reacts, replacing one binder off the shelf and grabbing 
      another.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Please tell me that s not baby 
                    food.

                                  ALEX
                    It tastes like chicken.

                                  LINDA
                    It is chicken.

      He looks at the jar.

                                  ALEX
                    Cool.  

      Suddenly there s a CRACK CRACK CRACK noise out front.  Alex 
      turns to Linda as they both look up.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    What was that?

      Alex heads out--                                                                                    25.



      EXT. LINDA S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Alex outside as CRACK a final EGG hits against the front of 
      the house.

                                  ALEX
                    Hey!

      A couple of teenagers hop into a car, Alex hurries down to 
      the sidewalk as the car SCREECHES and pulls away.

      Alex watches them go.  He looks across the street, where an 
      ELDERLY NEIGHBOR watches from behind a curtain.  As Alex 
      gives him a  what s up?  look, the curtain closes.

      INT. LINDA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Alex storms back in.  

                                  ALEX
                    If I were still a cop--

                                  LINDA
                    Don t.

      Linda is unperturbed, she has gone back to the binders, 
      sorting out the relevant pages...

                                  ALEX
                    Screw it.  I m calling it in.

      She turns to him, much more insistent.

                                  LINDA
                    Don t.

                                  ALEX
                    You can t live like this.  You re 
                    husband is the criminal.  He s the 
                    murderer.

                                  LINDA
                    And to them I m the one who didn t 
                    do anything to stop him.

      She points outside: the street, the world.

                                  ALEX
                    What could you have done?  You 
                    didn t know anything about it, 
                    Linda.  You didn t do anything 
                    wrong!

                                  LINDA
                          (re corkboard)
                    She needs us.  We re wasting time.

      She s tough.  And as determined for her own reasons.                                                                                     26.



                                  ALEX
                    I should stay--

                                  LINDA
                    No.  Go home and get some rest.

      She smiles at him faintly.  

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      It s friendship, and support, but there s limits to it all.  
      Alex nods.  Grabs his coat.

      INT. SILVERTONGUE NIGHTCLUB - (LATER THAT) NIGHT

      Still going strong, upstairs at the bar those flyers Candace 
      left have spilled onto the floor.

      But a few are left on the counter, and a girl named JESSICA 
      leans over and a wet one sticks to her arm, she laughs as she 
      talks with her FRIENDS and peels it off... but then she sees 
      the picture on it and her face changes...

      She makes sure no one s looking... then folds it up and puts 
      it in her pocket.

      EXT. SILVERTONGUE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      Candace and Tyler hand out a few flyers to CLUBBERS waiting 
      in line-- a GIRL shakes her head, a GUY crumples it up and 
      tosses it aside.

      Shaved Head comes out on the front step-- glares at them.  
      Tyler turns back to Candace.  Not worried, just worn out.

                                  TYLER
                    Maybe we should call it a night.

      But Candace is undaunted.  

                                    CANDACE
                    Wuss.  It s not even four yet.

      As they walk the line she hands out a couple more flyers, 
      attaches another to a telephone pole.  Tyler watches.

                                  TYLER
                    So what s your deal?  You re into 
                    this for a reason, right?  I mean, 
                    Alex has the thing with his 
                      daughter... did you lose someone?  
                    Or something?

                                    CANDACE
                    Just my mind in a day job I hate.  

      Tyler laughs.  But Candace is serious.  She holds up a flyer.                                                                                    27.



                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    She has no one.  Think about it-- 
                    what s the first thing that happens 
                    when you re brought into the world?

                                  TYLER
                    You get a name.

                                    CANDACE
                    So you should have it when you 
                    leave.

      She says it with authority-- it s the simple law that 
      justifies all her work.  

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    I always think,  what if that were 
                    me?   I d want someone to care 
                    about me.  I d want the world to 
                    remember I was here.  That I did 
                    things.  That I affected people. 

      She gets emotional, a hint of vulnerability we haven t seen.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    Does that make any sense?

                                  TYLER
                    Yeah.  But it feels weird to care 
                    about someone I don t even know.

                                    CANDACE
                    She s a human being.  You know her.

      Tyler nods.  Willing to concede the point.  

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    And next thing you know you re 
                    spending all of your time at 
                    Mulberry Drive.

      A young woman walks by and jostles Candace-- it s Jessica 
      from inside. 

                                    JESSICA
                    Her name s Vivian.

      She keeps her head down.  Speaks nervously.

                                    CANDACE
                    Excuse me?

                                    JESSICA
                    Her name s Vivian.  We can t talk 
                    here.

                                  TYLER
                    You know her?                                                                                    28.



                                    JESSICA
                    Yeah.  But so does he.

      She makes eyes behind her, to her right, where Shaved Head is 
      watching, he starts towards them and they walk quickly away--



                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    29.



                                          ACT THREE



      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

      A few blocks from the club, ducking off the main drag, music 
      still audible.  Tyler and Candace stand across from Jessica.

                                    JESSICA
                    We used to see her out, weekends 
                    mostly late but every once in a 
                    while for a show on weekdays.  

      Candace looks up.  Alex spots them from the head of the 
      alley, and walks over to join them.

                                    CANDACE
                    Jessica, this is Alex, I was 
                    telling you about him...

      Alex extends a hand and smiles.

                                  ALEX
                    Hey Jessica.  Thanks for talking to 
                    us.

                                    JESSICA
                    And you guys are totally not 
                    police, right?

                                  ALEX
                    Not police.  Well I used to be.  
                    Before I came to my senses.

      A little joke to put her at ease.  

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    So you said her name was Vivian.  
                    But you don t know her last name?  

                                    JESSICA
                    Yeah, I mean we weren t friends 
                    like that.  We were club friends.  
                    I saw her out, she saw me, it was 
                    like  hey Vivian. 

                                  ALEX
                    So you don t have a picture of her.  
                    On your phone or anything.

                                    JESSICA
                    Nah.

      Alex pulls out a small folded sheet of paper from his wallet.

                                  ALEX
                    And does this mean anything to you?                                                                                    30.



      It s a copy of the note: 747 - 50.  Jessica shakes her head.  
      She looks anxiously back towards the street.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    It s okay.  I saw him go back 
                    inside.  

      Jessica nods, relieved.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    He s just a bouncer, right?  

                                    JESSICA
                    Yeah.  But half the fights in there 
                    are ones he starts.  His name s 
                    Quint.

      Alex writes it down.

                                  ALEX
                    Were they dating?

                                    JESSICA
                    Quint dates a lot of girls.  He 
                    likes it rough.  Even if the girls 
                    don t.

      Tyler shows her a close up photo of the tattoo.

                                  TYLER
                    She had this tattoo on her ankle.  

      Jessica looks at it, smiling in some fond memory.

                                    JESSICA
                    I know.  So cool... I asked her 
                    about it.  

                                    CANDACE
                    And what d she say?

                                    JESSICA
                    She said it was a long story.  It 
                    was three years old, from just 
                    before she moved here. 

                                  ALEX
                    Moved here from where?

      Jessica shrugs.  Alex is frustrated but not angry with her.  

      EXT. STREET - (MOMENTS) LATER

      Back out from the alley, they re saying goodbyes.  Alex a few 
      steps behind, on his cell phone--

                                  ALEX
                          (into phone)
                    His name s Quint.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    31.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    He s a bouncer at The Silvertongue 
                      Nightclub.  Bad news, I think.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT - DOWNTOWN

      Olivo at her desk, jotting it down.

                                  DET OLIVO
                          (into phone)
                    Okay.  I ll take a look.

                                                                              RESUME:

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Alex rejoins the group, turns to Jessica--

                                  ALEX
                    One last thing.  At the end of the 
                    night, how did she get home?  She 
                    take the train?

                                    JESSICA
                    I think so.

                                  ALEX
                    That way, or that way?

      He points both ways.  She s not sure why it matters--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Close your eyes, Jessica.  Picture 
                    yourself.  The two of you, walking 
                    out of here,  okay! Goodbye!   And 
                    then--

      She closes her eyes, thinks about it--

                                    JESSICA
                    That way.

      She points left.  Alex smiles at her in thanks.

      EXT. LINDA S HOUSE - BACKYARD - (NEXT) MORNING

      A small yard.  Linda pushes her baby in the stroller from one 
      end to the other.  It s tiny and the laps are small; it s 
      like being in a prison courtyard.

                                  ALEX
                    Our girl liked the clubs.  Darker 
                    stuff.  She s been in the city a 
                    little less than three years. 

                                  LINDA
                    So a runaway from somewhere?                                                                                    32.



                                  ALEX
                    Possibly.  And she was sleeping 
                    with this guy, this bouncer dude.  
                    He might have knocked her around, 
                    according to this Jessica person.

      The back door of the next house opens.  Linda looks up with 
      alarm, and before the NEIGHBOR can emerge she quickly grabs 
      her baby daughter from the stroller and hurries back inside.  
      Alex watches, dumbfounded, then follows her in.

      INT. LINDA S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Linda walks in from the back door, Alex behind.

                                  ALEX
                    You okay?

      She nods.  Candace is at the corkboard, adding photos from 
      the club-- plus photos of the bouncer and Jessica.  Walter 
      looks up at it.

                                  WALTER
                    So crime of passion.  It all makes 
                    sense.  You ve got the boyfriend--

                                    CANDACE
                    I don t know that I d call him 
                       boyfriend.   According to Jessica 
                    it may have been more like  creep 
                    with benefits. 

      Alex joins her, adding: another map, a card that says VIVIAN 
      and then has a blank line after it for the last name.  The 
      board has really filled up.

                                  ALEX
                    Whatever.  Olivo s running his 
                    priors.  Maybe we ll get a hit.

      Tyler pours coffee for Candace.  Alex looks up at the 
      corkboard: that TATTOO card and accompanying photo are alone 
      and forlorn; so is the NOTE from her pocket.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Tattoo and note are looking pretty 
                    lonely.

                                  WALTER
                    Note s gonna take a miracle.

                                  TYLER
                    I thought the tat was Arabic for 
                    thunder.

                                  LINDA
                          (shakes head)
                    I posted the UCLA guy s tip.  Four 
                    other people emailed today to say 
                    the loop is wrong.  Or something.                                                                                    33.



                                  ALEX
                    So she s not a meteorologist.

      Linda finishes printing out a COLORED MAP.  Hands it to Alex--
      he attaches it to the corkboard.  It s a COLORED RAIL MAP for 
      the CTA - Chicago Transit Authority.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    There s two CTA lines off Kedzie, 
                    near the club.  Green is north.  
                    Blue is south.

                                  LINDA
                    And Jessica said--

                                  ALEX
                    Our girl walked South.  To the blue 
                    line.  Which means--

      He points to the map.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Highway Jane had a wild side but 
                    she wasn t stupid.  When you can 
                    walk to either train, you choose 
                    the one that takes you straight 
                    home, right?   

      He points to a broad area slightly north of downtown.

                                  TYLER
                    West Loop.  Near the thrift store 
                    where she bought the blouse.

                                  ALEX
                    Yup.  Which means our girl slept 
                    there.  She woke up there.  She 
                    bought... cereal there.

                                  LINDA
                    And maybe she worked around there--

                                  ALEX
                    Yes!  You don t just wander through 
                    the world without leaving tracks!  
                    She was here!  We ve only got three 
                    days but we re close!  Let s find 
                    her!

      Alex SMACKS the corkboard map of her neighborhood.  He s 
      fired up.  And that gets them fired up.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    We re gonna expand the radius.  Use 
                    the Division El stop at the center 
                    and go from there.  Walter--

                                  WALTER
                    I m on my way.                                                                                    34.



      Walter heads out.  

      INT. WALTER S HOUSE - MORNING

      Homey but worn (sort of like Walter).  He unlocks the door 
      and enters, moving with a purpose.  

      But then he stops and takes it in: his son WALTER JUNIOR (10) 
      playing a violent video game in the living room.  Nut cutting 
      wife ARIANNA (40s) cooking something nasty in the kitchen.   
      This is his life. He walks past them both into a

      SUNPORCH

      which has been modified and transformed into Walter s 
       MYSTERY STUDY.   

      Walls overflowing with books and binders, hundreds of mystery 
      novels, crime encyclopedias, DVD box sets.  A signed headshot 
      of PATRICIA CORNWELL; a photo of Walter and DENNIS FRANZ on 
      some golf course (possibly photoshopped).  

      This is his haven; these people -- real or otherwise -- his 
        inspiration.  As Arianna finally looks up he closes the 
      sliding door and that world disappears.  

                                  WALTER
                    Expand the radius... find her 
                    haunts...

      He calls up GOOGLE EARTH and types in the address of the 
      thrift store and the DIVISION El stop.  It shows up visually 
      and then he works outward from there, the train station 
      visible as the epicenter.  There s names/addresses of the 
      nearest drug stores, gyms, dry cleaners... 

      INT. LINDA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

      There s a new heading on the corkboard: HAUNTS.  Linda is 
      printing them out as Walter sends them, adding lists and maps 
      and check-off boxes... 

                                  LINDA
                    Come on... someone send her home...

      She finishes an email, sends it on to Candace--

      EXT. DIVISION STATION - DAY

      Located adjacent to a commercial strip that runs through West 
      Loop: more Mom and Pop than yuppie.  Tyler and Alex divide up 
      a stack of flyers as Candace checks her cell phone, feeding 
      maps and data directly into a HAUNTS file.  And as they head 
      down the street we:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    35.



       DOE MOMENT 

      As we see Highway Jane from behind, window-shopping down 
      Ashland Avenue... black cropped hair blowing in the breeze.  
      Alex and the group are in the right place.  They re on her 
      trail...

                                                                              RESUME:

      INT.  UNIVERSITY FITNESS  - DAY

      Tyler chats with the FRONT DESK CLERK, showing him the new 
      flyer, the clerk shaking his head.  Tyler CHECKS OFF another 
      business on his own HAUNTS phone file.  It s all coordinated.

      INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY 

      Candace chats with a group of CASHIERS, showing them the 
      flyer.

                                    CANDACE
                    Any of you guys remember her?  

      No response.  Candace shows them a bottle of black nail 
      polish, trying to make friends.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    She might have bought this.  You 
                    don t sell a lot of it, do you?  
                    You probably thought to yourself, 
                     wow that stuff s really ugly, but 
                      whatever. 

      Still nothing from the clerks.  Candace a bit frustrated.  
      Then one in the back pipes up:

                                  CLERK
                    Oh yeah.  I seen her.  She was in 
                    here like a month ago.  She was in 
                    here a bunch of times.
                          (to other clerks)
                    Remember?  Paid with all those 
                    coins and ones?

                                    CANDACE
                    Small bills?

      Candace nods and thinks about this... looking out the window 
      at a CAFE across the street...

      EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY 

      Alex steps off the main drag and puts a few flyers under the 
      front mats along a group of ROWHOUSES.  His phone rings.  
      CANDACE calling.  He answers it--                                                                                    36.



      INT. CAFE HELENE - DAY 

        A sandwich/coffee shop in the neighborhood.  Alex and Candace 
      are there with the MANAGER.  Good-looking, mid 20s.  She s 
      given him a flyer.  

                                    CANDACE
                    They said she paid with coins and 
                    small bills.  So I figured she was 
                    using tip money--

      She points across the street where the DRUGSTORE is.  Alex 
      smiles at her-- impressed.  They turn to the manager.

                                  ALEX
                    So?

                                    MANAGER
                    It s her.  She quit three weeks 
                    ago.  Something happened.  Someone 
                    came in, she got really upset.

                                  ALEX
                    A guy?

                                    MANAGER
                    No.  A woman.  

                                    CANDACE
                    This woman?

      She holds up a photo of Jessica.

                                    MANAGER
                    No.  Older.  Maybe 40.  Brown curly 
                    hair.  With her husband and a 
                    little boy.

      Alex nods.  It gets even more complicated.  And now he waits 
      for the rest...

                                    MANAGER (CONT D)
                    Simmons.  Her name is Vivian 
                    Simmons.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY (INTERCUT)

      Detective Olivo walks through the busy office. 

                                  DET OLIVO
                          (on phone)
                       Simmons?   Alex are you sure?

      She stops, grabs a pen from a COLLEAGUE, jots it down.                                                                                    37.



      INT. CAFE HELENE - MANAGER S OFFICE - DAY (INTERCUT)

      Alex on the phone--

                                  ALEX
                          (on phone)
                    I m sure.  The manager gave her 
                    address, it s six blocks away on 
                      Hennessey.  We re gonna go knock on 
                    the door, maybe there s a roommate.  
                    Get started on the permanent 
                    address.

      He hangs up.  The manager going through some folders, finds 
      the right one and hands it to Alex--

      INT. CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY (INTERCUT)

      Olivo standing there with a dead phone.  A little put off.

                                  DET OLIVO
                          (to herself)
                    Yes sir...

      Behind her, another COP is bringing in Quint (the bouncer) 
      for questioning.  Not pleased.  The Cop looks to Olivo, who 
      gestures where she wants him.

      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

      The elevator opens-- Alex emerges, Tyler in tow.  The 
      building is modest, not fancy.  Alex knocks on the door.  No 
      answer at the door.

                                  ALEX
                    Let s try the neighbors.

      They knock on another door.  One side, then the other-- a 
      DOOR finally opens and a YOUNG GUY leans out.  Glasses, 
      khakis, clean cut and normal.  His name is CLAY.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Hey.  Did you know the girl who 
                    lived here?

      He points to Vivian s door.

                                  CLAY
                    Vivian?  Sure.

                                  ALEX
                    She lived by herself?

                                  CLAY
                    I think so.  Pretty sure, yeah.  I 
                    haven t seen her in a while.  I 
                    thought she d moved somewhere else.

                                  ALEX
                    Any idea where?                                                                                    38.



                                  CLAY
                    No.

                                  ALEX
                    You were friends?

                                  CLAY
                    I guess.  I mean, we were.
                          (laughs)
                    Strange girl.

                                  ALEX
                    What do you mean?

                                  CLAY
                    She moved in, like, a year ago?  
                    I d see her once in a while, here 
                    or at Cafe Helene when I was 
                    studying.  We d say hello, no big 
                    deal.  And then about six months 
                    ago...

      He stops, not sure how to describe it.

                                  TYLER
                    Six months ago?  What happened?

                                  CLAY
                    Her hair.  Her clothes.  Everything 
                    changed.  It all went... dark.

                                  ALEX
                    So she wasn t always like that?

                                  CLAY
                    Not at all.  It was like the sun 
                    went down.  I saw her in the mail 
                    room-- whoa.  I didn t even 
                    recognize her.  Overnight she was 
                    somebody else.

                                  TYLER
                    Any idea why?

                                  ALEX
                    Any guys hang around?  Maybe a big 
                    guy, shaved head?

      Clay shakes his head, stumped.  Before Alex can press him, 
      his phone RINGS.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Excuse me.
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    39.



      EXT. CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT - GARAGE - DAY

      Olivo walking through the garage, heading to a sedan.

                                  DET OLIVO
                          (into phone)
                    Vivian Simmons.  22 years old.  
                    Home address is up in Evanston.  
                    I ll meet you there in an hour.  

                                                                              RESUME:

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Alex hangs up.  Turns back to Clay.

                                  ALEX
                    We have to go.  What s your name? 

                                  CLAY
                    Clay.  Is Vivian all right?  

                                  ALEX
                    Not exactly.  Thanks for your time, 
                    Clay.

      They hurry towards the elevator.  Clay watches them go, 
      shrugs, and heads back into his apartment.

      EXT. TREE LINED STREET - EVANSTON - DUSK

      Stately homes.  Alex pulls up and parks.  Gets out and we see 
      Olivo has arrived in a sedan.  They approach the front door.

      EXT. SIMMONS HOUSE - DUSK

      Alex rings the doorbell, Olivo standing beside him.  A MAN 
      (50s) in a suit answers.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Is this the Simmons residence?

                                  MAN
                    Yes.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    I m Detective Grace Olivo, Chicago 
                    Police.  This is Alex Donovan.

                                  ALEX
                    I m with a group called  The 
                    Identity Network. 

                                  MAN
                    What s this about?

                                  ALEX
                    Sir, do you by any chance have a 
                    daughter named Vivian?                                                                                    40.



                                  MAN
                    Yes.

                                  ALEX

                    Vivian?  Can you come here for a 
                    minute?

      Olivo reacts--

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Uh, Alex?

                                  ALEX
                          (under his breath)
                    Dammit...

      The man pulls the door open and a YOUNG WOMAN walks over.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                    I m Vivian Simmons.  Can I help 
                    you?  

      She has dark hair, and dark nails... and is very much alive.

      INT. LINDA S LIVING ROOM - (NEXT) MORNING

      Status meeting.  The corkboard is almost full, but it feels 
      like a fraud.  They seem blindsided by what has happened.

                                  ALEX
                    So the real Vivian Simmons had her 
                    purse stolen at the Art Institute 
                    almost three years ago.

                                  LINDA
                    Highway Jane must have done it.  
                    She took her identity.  

      Walter attaches a photo of the  real  Vivian to the 
      corkboard, taken from the front of her Evanston house.

                                    CANDACE
                    Highway Jane became this girl.  She 
                    didn t want to be found.

                                  TYLER
                    I know the feeling.

                                  ALEX
                    So where are we?

                                  WALTER
                    Back to calling her  Highway Jane  
                    for one thing.

      Walter pulls down some credit card receipts, then crosses out 
      Vivian s name on the card, then grabs and crumples it. 

                                  ALEX
                    No.

      Alex smooths out the VIVIAN card and puts it back on the 
      board; it s a record of everything, the hits and the misses.  

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    The things she did, the places she 
                    went... we still have that.  We 
                    don t have the name but we ve still 
                    got two days and it s still her.  
                    This is still her.

      Alex gestures towards the corkboard.  They seem willing to 
      concede it.  As they study it--

                                  TYLER
                    What about the bouncer?

      On Alex:                                                                                    42.



      EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY 

      Olivo heading somewhere, Alex trying to keep up.

                                  ALEX
                    You what?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    We let him go.  He checked out.  No 
                    priors, nothing.

                                  ALEX
                    But he slept with her--

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Not a crime.  Couldn t hold him.

                                  ALEX
                    He s dangerous!  Ten girls at that 
                    club would have said so!  

      Finally she turns to him.  Angry.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    You want to start questioning my 
                    judgment, Alex?  You want to make 
                    any more suggestions?  Because your 
                    last one sent me to Evanston, so I 
                    could flash my badge and look like 
                    an idiot.

                                  ALEX
                    Hey.  We had credit card receipts, 
                      a driver s license... that was an 
                    honest mistake and you know it.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Fine.  Make a mistake.  You can do 
                    that.  But my job has rules.  It 
                    has laws.  You should know that 
                    better than anyone.

                                  ALEX
                    You could have kept him overnight, 
                    or got a warrant for his place--

                                  DET OLIVO
                    I m late for an arraignment.  Woman 
                    in Hyde Park shot her ex-husband 
                    three times in the back last night.  
                    And we ve got witnesses, and a 
                    murder weapon-- and we ve got 
                    names!  A real case!  Imagine that!

      She enters the building and leaves him on the steps.  Alex 
      knows there s some truth in what she says, but he s not 
      giving up yet.  He takes out his phone and makes a call:                                                                                    43.



                                  ALEX
                          (into phone)
                    Walter, it s me.  Do you have a 
                    window?

      INT. TIP TOP LIQUOR - DAY 

      Bulletproof glass, wrong side of town.  Bouncer Quint 
      finishes paying for a pack of cigarettes and a newspaper and 
      exits.

      EXT. TIP TOP LIQUOR - DAY

      As he walks down the street, we see Walter s phone company 
      van start up down the block.  He follows.  Quint walks two 
      blocks... Walter behind.  Finally Quint turns down an alley, 
      and as Walter pulls up Quint is GONE.

      Walter curses, stops the van, hops out, steps to the head of 
      the alley... where did the guy go?  He couldn t just 
      disappear--

      SUDDENLY Quint grabs Walter and spins him around, pushing him 
      against the brick wall--

                                  QUINT
                    You a cop?

                                  WALTER
                    I work for the phone company--

                                  QUINT
                    You with those people at the club?

                                  WALTER
                    Yes--

      Quint PUNCHES him in the face, knocking him to the ground.

                                  QUINT
                    I did her once.  That s it.  She 
                    was nothing.  And if I ever see you 
                    again, I ll kill you.   

      Walter nods, getting to his knees, rubbing his cheek.  Quint 
      is gone.

      INT. CAFE HELENE - DAY

      Candace, Tyler, Alex at a booth.  They ve got some of the 
      files spread on the table in front of them.  

                                  ALEX
                    Why just become someone else?   You 
                    move here, you re 17 or 18--

                                    CANDACE
                    Maybe she didn t know who she was.  
                    Maybe she was still trying to 
                    figure it out.                                                                                     44.



      Meanwhile Tyler is sort of half listening... he s found the 
      photo of the tattoo, half-buried under some other stuff.  
      Alex is still pondering.

                                  ALEX
                    No.  Something big must have 
                    happened.  Her world changed.  This 
                    was her way of fighting back.

      Walter arrives and slides into the booth.  He s got a rising 
      bruise on his cheek.  He s nonchalant, going with the Badge 
      of Honor approach.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    What happened?

                                  WALTER
                    Hey.  It s okay.  This is what we 
                    do.

                                  TYLER
                    Get hit in the face?

                                    CANDACE
                    He s been seriously id-cocked.

      The Manager approaches, surprised to see all of them.

                                    MANAGER
                    You re here.

                                  ALEX
                    Because she was here.  

      Manager doesn t get it.  Meanwhile Tyler has figured 
      something out.  He takes the edge of the sheet, slides it 
      DIRECTLY up to the edge of the tattoo, and begins sketching.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                          (to Tyler)
                    Hello?

                                  TYLER
                    It s not a word.  It s part of an 
                    animal.  

      As Alex, Candace, and the Manager move closer to look: the 
      outline of the bottom half of an ANIMAL is clearly visible... 
      and Tyler has added a rough sketch of the other half...

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    I can make fun of it now, but at 
                    the time?  When you re 17?

                    Making that choice?  Feeling that 
                    pain?  Doing something permanent?

      And now that we know so much more, we don t just watch her 
      wander in a club or down a street-- we stay with her.  
      Friends in the room, context of life.  She gets that tattoo.

                    It s like the most important thing

                    got Vivian so upset-- remember how 
                    I said she had a little boy with 
                    her?  It was on his sweatshirt.  
                    With a big C around it, like this--

      He takes a pen and draws a large C around the animal.  They 
      look at each other--

                    She was pretty.  I bet she was a 
                      cheerleader.                                                                                     46.

      They hurry over to her computer, where the tattoo fragment is

                    It s a tiger.  A Bengal tiger, to 
                    be specific.  The ear is different 
                    and the stripes are slightly wider.

      Candace has her own computer out, she types something in--

                    Alex.

                                  ALEX
                    Sorry.

      The SCHOOL PRINCIPAL (40s) approaches Alex, trailed by some 
      LOCAL POLICE.  

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Thanks for the call.  The students 
                    are ready.  

      They walk into the school together.  Detective Olivo is with 
      them.  She and Alex acknowledge each other but it s icy.

      INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

      A hundred students, hastily assembled.  Some of the TEACHERS 
      as well, supervising and shushing.  Alex and Olivo on stage.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    I m Detective Grace Olivo from 
                    Chicago.  And I d like to introduce 
                    Alex Donovan, who works with a 
                    group called The Identity Network.

      No applause or anything, but they are basically paying 
      attention.  Alex takes the microphone from Olivo.

                                  ALEX
                    Thanks.  
                          (to kids)
                    Hello.                                                                                     48.



      He seems pretty comfortable on stage.  Meanwhile Candace has 
      brought up a cardboard box and places it on a table.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    So-- there s a girl who went to 
                    school here, three years ago.  We 
                    don t know her name.  We don t know 
                    exactly how old she is, so we re 
                    not exactly sure if she was a 
                    junior then, or a senior and she 
                    was graduating...

      Students fidget: what does this have to do with us?

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I know.  It sounds crazy.  But she 
                    ran away to Chicago, someone killed 
                    her there.  She was strangled, she 
                    was left by the side of the road. 

      Now he has their attention.  For better or worse.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Now we know where she s from.  We 
                    know she s one of you.  And we re 
                    hoping one of you can tell us 
                    exactly who she is.

      Alex opens the box and pulls out the facial reconstruction.  
      The students MURMUR -- one part nervous laughter, two parts 
      morbid fascination -- and Candace presses a button on her 
      laptop and the image goes up on two large MONITORS so all the 
      students can see... 

                                  DET OLIVO
                    If anyone has any information--

      Suddenly a FEMALE STUDENT bolts from her seat, running back 
      out of the auditorium--

                                  ALEX
                    Excuse me?  Hey!

      She doesn t stop.  She s out the door, Alex and Candace look 
      at each other and then head for a side exit--

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Alex and Candace into the hallway-- the girl visible at the 
      other end--

                                    CANDACE
                    Hey!  Stop!

      She doesn t.  She s out the door--                                                                                    49.



      EXT. COLLINS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

      The girl running across the parking lot... Alex and Candace 
      chasing after her... finally she stops, leaning against a 
      car, collapsing in tears.  Alex and Candace reach her.

                                  GIRL
                    Tracy... that s my sister Tracy...

      Alex comforts her.  Then he sort of hands her over to Candace 
      and Olivo, keeping some students away-- and then Alex locks 
      eyes with someone:

      From a distance a FEMALE TEACHER is staring at him -- 30s 
      with CURLY BROWN HAIR.  She looks stricken.  

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Alex let s go.

      Alex turns back to Olivo and heads off with her, escorting 
      Amy from the school.

      EXT. BENEDICT HOME - DAY

      Alex and Olivo approach the front door.  Behind we see 
      Candace walking towards the house with sister Amy.  Alex 
      knocks.  SALLY BENEDICT (40s) answers.  Working-class, tired.

                                  ALEX
                    Mrs. Benedict?

                                  SALLY
                    Yes?
                          (sees daughter)
                    Amy?  Are you all right?

      She nods but doesn t say anything.  

                                  ALEX
                    My name s Alex Donovan.  I m a 
                    former detective with the Chicago 
                    Police Department, and now I work 
                    with a group called  The Identity 
                    Network.   This is Detective Grace 
                    Olivo from the--

                                  SALLY
                    Tracy?  You found her?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Yes.

      She doesn t continue.  And Sally realizes.

                                  SALLY
                    Oh God...

      She starts to cry, Amy moving to hug her.                                                                                    50.



                                  ALEX
                    I m so sorry.

      She nods and invites them inside.

      INT. BENEDICT HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      The house is clean, quiet, a sense of absence.  Alex and 
      Olivo sit across from Sally.

                                  SALLY
                    She was a great girl.  Honor 
                    student, cheerleader, Homecoming 
                    Princess.  Everything a Mom could 
                    hope for.  Until Trevor died.  
                    About three years ago.

                                  ALEX
                    Her father?

                                  SALLY
                    They were very close.  She and I 
                    got along, but Tracy was Daddy s 
                    little girl.  He d been sick.  
                    Cancer.  But we didn t know how to 
                    tell her.  She was so busy with 
                    school, and activities... before we 
                    figured it out, he had a seizure on 
                    his way to work.  Car accident, he 
                    ran off the road.  Killed 
                      instantly. 

                                  DET OLIVO
                    I m sorry.

                                  SALLY
                    She was cutting class, getting a 
                    tattoo with a couple of her 
                    friends.  It wasn t a big deal.  
                    Until I had to pull her out and 
                    tell her that her father was dead.
                    She ended up with this half 
                    finished tiger on her ankle.  She 
                    wore it like a badge of honor.  

      Sally remembers the moment with a faint smile.

                                  ALEX
                    But she was angry.

                                  SALLY
                    She blamed me.  She stopped 
                    speaking to me and her sister.  
                    Tracy and I had argued about things 
                    before, but Trevor was always there 
                    to work it out between us.  This 
                    time there was no one.  And a few 
                    weeks later she was just gone.  

      Candace comes downstairs.                                                                                    51.



                                    CANDACE
                    Amy s resting.

                                  SALLY
                    Thank you.
                          (to Olivo)
                    I filed a missing persons report 
                    three years ago with the Iowa State 
                    Police.  Wouldn t that have somehow 
                    gotten to Chicago?  

                                  DET OLIVO
                    It may have, but with missing 
                    persons, the databases... they 
                    aren t always linked between 
                    different cities or states.

                                  SALLY
                    Oh.

                                  ALEX
                    And some of the details were 
                      complicated.

      We PAN over to some FAMILY PHOTOS, including a SCHOOL 
      PORTRAIT-- and Tracy was BLONDE.  Alex notes this.  

      EXT. BENEDICT HOME - DAY

      Alex at the front step, saying his goodbyes, some of the 
      local police staying behind.  Sally hands him the school 
      portrait.   

                                  ALEX
                    Thank you.  This will help.  And if 
                    you need anything else, please just 
                    call me.

                                  SALLY
                    Thank you.  

      Alex turns to go and some of the police follow Sally inside, 
      matters to attend to, closing the door.  There s other police 
      outside, neighbors peeking out, lots of activity.

      Alex begins walking towards Candace-- when he sees Olivo over 
      by her sedan.  She s talking with the woman from the school.  
      Her name is ZOE.  Alex walks over.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    This is Zoe Franks.  She s a 
                    teacher at Collins.  She saw Tracy 
                    in the city a few weeks ago.

                                  ALEX
                    At the diner, right?  What 
                    happened?

      She s stammers, in a bit of a daze.  Alex puts his hand on 
      her shoulder and steers her away from Olivo.                                                                                    52.



                                  ZOE
                    I was there with my husband.  We 
                    took our son Nathaniel in to see 
                    the circus.

                                  ALEX
                    So you weren t in touch with Tracy, 
                    it was just a coincidence?

                                  ZOE
                    Yes.  I mean we re in this 
                      neighborhood, my kid wants pasta 
                    with no sauce and he s gotta pee--

      She shakes her head, laughing.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    You have kids?

      Alex hesitates.  A simple question but never a simple answer.

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah.  A daughter.

                                  ZOE
                    So you know.

      He doesn t flinch.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Anyway, Tracy looked so different.  
                    I mean in high school-- that girl 
                    was a bombshell.  And smart.  Now 
                    with the black everything... I was 
                    shocked.  

                                  ALEX
                    What upset her so much?

      Zoe thinks about it.

                                  ZOE
                    I asked about her Mom.  She said 
                    they weren t speaking.  She begged 
                    me not to tell her where she was.  

      Olivo listens from a few feet away, arms crossed.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    We talked for half an hour.  I told 
                    her-- come home.  The bus is 50 
                    dollars.  I ll meet you on Sunday 
                    night.  You can ride back with us.  
                    I even wrote down what time it 
                    left.

                                  ALEX
                    7:47 PM.                                                                                    53.



                                  ZOE
                    Yes.  She said she d think about 
                    it, but she had some loose ends to 
                    tie up first.  

                                  ALEX
                    What kind of  loose ends? 

                                  ZOE
                    I don t know.  Maybe it was none of 
                    my business, but I wasn t thinking 
                    like a teacher, you know? 

                                  ALEX
                    You were thinking like a parent.  

                                  ZOE
                    I should have done more.

                                  ALEX
                    You tried.  That s all you can do.

      She s truly broken up.  Alex puts a hand on her shoulder but 
      there s nothing more he can say.  Olivo watches, begrudgingly 
        impressed... Alex coaxing and comforting with a skill that 
      she lacks.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      THE CORKBOARD

      it s Tracy s life, in full-- the people she knew, the places 
      she went, where she was born and where she died.  Alex steps 
      forward and attaches the school photo.  

      INT. LINDA S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                    No.  It has to be more than that.

                                    CANDACE
                    Tracy became Goth Girl in Chicago.  
                    But if she was going home, maybe 
                    she needed time to change back.

                                  TYLER
                    Yeah.  She bought the nice blouse.

                                  ALEX
                    She did.  But a loose end isn t a 
                    piece of clothing.  It s a person.                                                                                    54.



      Alex takes the whole board in.  And we follow all we ve 
      learned as he narrates--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Her father dies, she gets half a 
                    tattoo, she has a falling out with 
                    her family and runs away to 
                    Chicago.  She has no idea who she 
                    is.  No idea who she wants to be.  
                    That one anchor in her life-- gone.

      Alex is looking at the picture of Vivian, the card that says 
      PURSE STOLEN FEB 07.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    She goes to the Art Institute one 
                    day.  A young woman s there, with a 
                    different look, a purse left on a 
                    bench... she steals it.  The name, 
                    the look, a face for the world.  
                    I ll be her.  I ll get a job-- 

      He moves on-- but then stops.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Wait a second.
                          (to Tyler)
                    Clay.  The guy in the apartment 
                    building.  He said they were cool, 
                    right?

                                  TYLER
                    Yeah...

                                  ALEX
                    But he said six months ago she 
                    changed.  Dyed hair, the nails--

                                  TYLER
                    Right.  So?

      Alex turns to everyone.  Using the board to illustrate:

                                  ALEX
                    But Vivian had her purse stolen two 
                    years before that.  Tracy became 
                    Vivian-- she became Goth Girl then.  

                                  LINDA
                    So why did Clay tell us it happened 
                    six months ago?

                                  WALTER
                    Because he s lying.

      Alex is already out the door--


                                      END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    55.



                                            ACT SIX



      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

      Alex and Olivo approach.  As Olivo pulls open the front door, 
      Alex grabs it.  Olivo turns back towards him.

                                  ALEX
                    Are we okay here?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Sure.  We re on the same side, I 
                    know that.  It s not personal.

                                  ALEX
                    That s the thing, Grace.  For us it 
                    is personal.

      She gets it.  They head inside.

      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Olivo knocks on Clay s door.  Alex stands behind.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Mr. Manning?  Chicago Police.

      No answer.  She knocks again-- CRASH!  Something s going on, 
      they look at each other, Olivo doesn t hesitate, she draws 
      her gun and kicks in the door and they are inside-- 

      INT. CLAY S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      A quick look around, starving student chic: hot plate, futon, 
      desk overflowing with books--

                                  ALEX
                    There!

      They look towards the window, it s open, CLATTERING on the 
      fire escape, Alex leans out and sees him nearing the ground--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Freeze!  Police!

      But Clay doesn t stop, and when Alex feels for a gun of 
      course he doesn t have one--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                          (to Olivo)
                    Call it in--

      As she takes a step back and gets on her phone Alex climbs 
      out onto the                                                                                    56.



      FIRE ESCAPE

      and hurries down after him, Clay jumps the last ten feet to 
      the ground and takes off running, Alex halfway down now--

      EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

      As Clay runs down the residential block towards the 
      commercial strip of 

      ASHLAND AVENUE

      and disappears around the corner as Alex reaches the end of 
      the block himself, dodging a car and the HONKING DRIVER--

      Clay takes a quick look back, winded now but fueled by 
      adrenaline, sees Alex gaining on him--

      He passes the diner where Tracy worked, the pharmacy where 
      she shopped, her haunts in reverse, Alex closing, weaving 
      past a girl on her cellphone, cutting across the street in a 
      slight break in traffic, heading for the 

      DIVISION EL STATION

      and Clay is bounding down the stairs to the platform, about 
      halfway down when Alex tackles him, the two of them tumbling 
      the ten steps to the bottom, Alex landing on top and pinning 
      him there.

                                  ALEX
                    Late for class?

      Olivo close behind, she reaches them-- behind her two SQUAD 
      CARS with gumballs flashing slam to a stop on the street--

                                  DET OLIVO
                    You probably shouldn t be doing 
                    that whole  Freeze Police  thing 
                      anymore...

                                  ALEX
                    I ll make a note of it.

                                  CLAY
                          (to Alex)
                    You re not a cop?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    No.  But I am.

      Olivo puts her knee in Clay s back and cuffs him.  As Clay 
      grimaces...

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    He said he didn t do it.  He said 
                    he barely knew me.  At first.                                                                                    57.



      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - (NEXT) MORNING

      Olivo and another DETECTIVE interrogate Clay.  He sits with 
      arms folded.  Alex watches from another room.

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    But even though the apartment was 
                    clean, denial only gets you so 
                    far...

      INT. FACULTY BUILDING - UNIVERSITY - DAY

      Two DETECTIVES coming out of the building carrying boxes of 
      evidence, including a worn SMALL BLACK SUITCASE:

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    When they found my bag in his 
                    campus locker...

      INT. FORENSIC LAB - CHICAGO PD - DAY

      They re going through his car.  A LAB TECH holds up a sliver 
      on a pair of tweezers... it looks black in the light...

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    ...and fragments of my nail polish 
                    on his clothes and in the passenger 
                    seat of his car...

      EXT. ACCESS ROAD GAS STATION - NIGHT

      Candace hands out flyers as people stop for gas, come in and 
      come out.  Walter watches from across the street.  It s rote 
      and robotic until a BUSINESSMAN stops...

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    ...and someone saw him.  At the gas 
                    station.  Just moments before he 
                    murdered me.   

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

      All of this has been presented to Clay.  

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    And now they re gonna fry the 
                    bastard.

      They ve got him... and he s smart enough to know it.  He 
      breaks down crying.  And as starts to talk, Tracy tells us 
      their story:

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    We met at Cafe Helene.  I was 
                    working.  He was studying.  Day 
                    after day... a smile becomes a 
                    word, a word becomes a 
                      conversation... he flattered me.  
                    He adored me.  He said he d never 
                    met anyone like me.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    58.

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And what did I see in him?  He was 
                    smart.  Caring.  Most Likely To 
                    Succeed.

      Olivo listens, unmoved.  She slides a sheet of paper and a 
      pen across to him.  

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I saw myself.

      And as Clay begins to write we:

                                                                            CUT TO:

       DOE MOMENT 

      our final one, where dreamy snippets become fleshed out 
      reality and we ll see the whole picture for the first time... 

      And we re back at the GAS STATION as Tracy sits in the 
      passenger seat, drumming her fingernails...

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                      Eventually I realized it.  I told 
                    him how I d seen an old friend and 
                    now I knew it was time for Vivian 
                    to say goodbye.  Not just to him, 
                    but to everyone.  He said he 
                      understood and I believed him.  I 
                    wanted to believe him.  

      And we pull back and see Tracy s face IN FULL for the first 
      time... so beautiful, as we d guessed...  And she smiles, as   
      Clay returns to the car...  

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But he lied.  Nothing I said 
                    mattered.  He wasn t taking me 
                    home.  We were together six 
                    months... but he knew from the 
                    beginning he would never let me go.

      They pull out of the gas station...

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    He took my life.  He took my name.

      And as they head to the access road she looks out the window, 
      not noticing that Clay is looking at her with longing and 
      lust and simmering rage that fuel the crime he is about to 
      commit...

                                                                              RESUME:

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT

      As Clay is cuffed and led away.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    59.



      EXT. CEMETERY - DAVENPORT - DAY

      The graveside ceremony for Tracy is underway.  A large crowd, 
      including Zoe and her family and many from the school.  She 
      was loved.  

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    My name is Tracy Benedict.

      Alex stands with a somber Candace, Walter, and Tyler.  
      Detective Olivo is there as well, along with a few COLLEAGUES 
      from the city.

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And these are the people who gave 
                    it back to me.

      LATER

      the funeral is over.  As the crowd starts to separate, Alex 
      has a moment with Olivo as they walk.

                                  ALEX
                    I heard you made him cry.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Not the first time.

                                  ALEX
                      Congratulations.  

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Thanks.

      It seems patched up between them.  Olivo looks over at 
      Candace, Tyler, Walter.

                                  DET OLIVO (CONT D)
                    Where s Linda?

                                  ALEX
                    She couldn t get away.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Oh.  So.  Are you and her--

                                  ALEX
                    --working together?  Yeah.

      ANGLE - CANDACE AND TYLER

      as they walk away.  Tyler notices Walter, speaking with a 
      couple of STRANGERS, action sequence gesturing...

                                  TYLER
                    What s he doing?

                                    CANDACE
                      Exaggerating his role.                                                                                    60.



      Tyler laughs.  Candace studies him.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    You look handsome.

                                  TYLER
                    Thanks.  This is my courtroom suit.

      He smiles, a little bashful.  Looks out at crowd.

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                      Courtrooms and funerals...

                                    CANDACE
                    Get used to it.

      ANGLE - GRAVESTONE

      as Sally stands by her daughter s marker.  Alex approaches.  
      She sees him.

                                  SALLY
                    I hear they caught the guy.

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah.  He confessed.

      She nods, accepting this.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I know you think she never forgave 
                    you.  But you should know there s a  
                    bus from the city that comes in a 
                    little before eight.  I think Tracy 
                    was planning to be on it.

      Sally s eyes widen at the unexpected news.

                                  SALLY
                    After all of this... sometimes I 
                    wonder if you know my daughter 
                    better than I do.

      Alex smiles and shakes his head.

                                  ALEX
                    She s yours.  Not mine.

      Sally nods.  And turns back to the marker.

                                  SALLY
                    When I sleep tonight, for the first 
                    time in a long time, I won t worry.  
                    I ll grieve, but I won t worry.  
                    Thank you for bringing my daughter 
                    back.

                                  ALEX
                    It wasn t just me.  A lot of people 
                    helped.                                                                                    61.



                                  SALLY
                    Are they here?  With you?  

                                  ALEX
                    They re everywhere.

      Alex smiles at her.  They part ways, it s time to go.  

      Alex rejoins the others and takes a final look back, leaving 
      Tracy behind, knowing she s home, at rest and at peace, a job 
      well done as we PULL AWAY.
