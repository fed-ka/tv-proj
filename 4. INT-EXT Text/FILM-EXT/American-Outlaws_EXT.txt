The Rangers plunge into thick woods. Branches slap at them,
but the sound of gunfire keeps them going. Captain Malcolm
is still in the lead, flanked by two young men who are
obviously brothers. The big, handsome one is COLE YOUNGER;
the skinny one with the lopsided hair is BOB YOUNGER.
They break through the other side of the woods, emerging
behind a rickety set of fence-post fortifications. Instantly
GUNFIRE tears apart the trees around them. The Captain's
horse goes down, and the Younger brothers dive and roll to
hide beneath the palisade.
The Captain, still alive, has fallen beyond the wooden
shield. Cole scrambles through the savage rifle fire, grabs
Captain Malcolm, and hauls him behind the fortification.
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
(bellowing)
Fall back into the woods! Out of
your saddles before you're shot out
of 'em!
The Rangers leap from their saddles as a new sound starts
-- a dull roar that grows and approaches and BBRRRRAPPPPP
as, unbelievably, trees EXPLODE INTO SPLINTERS and horses
and men go down in a heap!
COLE
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
BOB
Dammit, this stopped being fun
about two years ago!
Some men are crawling to the fortifications, others are
staying in the woods. The Captain pokes his head up to take
a look. With him WE SEE
At the top of which, about a hundred fifty yards off, is a
three man Gatling crew. Squads of Union soldiers are
beginning to make their way down the hillside. And just to
their right is an EIGHT INCH CANNON with a burning fuse --
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
DOWN!
BOOM! And with a whistle the cannonball TEARS THROUGH the
forest and EXPLODES just behind the Rangers. Some of the men
are screaming from injury and panic.
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
(CONT'D)
Cole! Bob! You boys okay?
COLE
Hell, take more than a cannon to
kill the Younger brothers, sir!
BOB
I think the cannon's doing a pretty
good job, Cole.
A full-blooded Indian, COMANCHE TOM, crawls up next to them.
COLE
Some Indian tracker you turned out
to be, Tom.
COMANCHE TOM
You pay me to find you Bluecoats.
There they are.
ANOTHER ROUND from the Gatling chews up the trees and
fencing, driving their heads down.
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
They're using the Gatling and the
cannon to cover their advance. We're
pinned unless we take them out!
Cole peers through the rails.
COLE
Those gunners are too far away...
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
Get me the James boy.
COMANCHE TOM
You want Jesse?
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
Not Jesse, the one who can shoot.
Comanche Tom rolls back to the edge of the woods.
COMANCHE TOM
FRANK!
Among the squatting men a single one STANDS UP. FRANK JAMES
is tall with a dark, thoughtful face. He looks sadder than
his 23 years should allow.
His hand is wrapped around a
longbarrel Enfield 30.
FRANK
Jesse.
The long rider behind him turns around. He's JESSE JAMES,
20. He's too damn good-looking and he's got your best
friend's eyes. There's a coiled energy to him, and right now
he seems more angry than afraid. Next to him is WEB MIMMS,
15, who is terrified and trying not to show it.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
Watch Web.
WEB
I don't need watchin'!
JESSE
Web, I bring you back dead and your
sister'll kill me. Now shut up and
lie there.
(then)
Careful, Frank. And make sure Bob
and Cole are okay.
Loose shots spitting up dirt and wood chips everywhere.
Frank crawls up, nods to the Youngers, peers through the
stacked wood. Another EXPLOSION from the cannon.
FRANK
Cannon or Gatling?
COLE
Both would be nice.
FRANK
Soon as I hit one, the other'll
know and beat us up.
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
Cannon.
Frank raises his head just high enough to poke the Enfield
over the stacked fenceposts. Everyone else is flinching from
the suppressing fire. Frank is perfectly still. Squinting,
aiming, perfectly centered ... BANG.
CUT TO:
As the Captain of the six man crew SNAPS BACK and hits the
ground dead. Before the others can react, two more grab
their throats and drop. The remaining soldiers bolt from the
cannon.
But the Gatling crew swings the gun around and the barrels
BLAZE.
CUT TO:
Frank and the others hit the dirt as the Gatling shreds the
fenceposts, fells trees, churns the ground, stitching a path
of destruction across the bulwarks and into the woods where
The Gatling rounds are everywhere. Rangers jerk as the
Gatling tears them apart. Jesse grabs Web to his chest and
swings around, shielding the boy with his own body. When the
fire pauses for a moment. Jesse looks down -- he's covered
in blood. He lets Web fall away. Blood bubbles up from where
the boy's chest used to be.
JESSE
Hell no...
Jesse's trying to stop the blood with his bare hands.
WEB
Aw, Jesse.
(crying)
I never even got to be with a girl.
Web dies.
Jesse sighs. He's seen too much death to cry anymore. He
stands up, pivots, and strides for the fencepost barrier.
Rifle fire is zipping through the air all around him, but he
keeps walking.
Frank, the Younger brothers, Comanche Tom and the Captain
are all still there. Captain Malcolm peers through the wall.
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
They're getting closer.
Jesse arrives, slaps Cole's shoulder. Cole grins grimly.
COLE
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
JESSE
What's going on?
FRANK
Every time I put my head up to hit
that Gatling, they try to shoot it
off.
JESSE
So we got a plan?
BOB
My plan of lying here pissing
myself seems to be working mighty
fine, thank you.
FRANK
I can hit those boys from here. We
just need a distraction.
JESSE
(smiling)
A distraction? Well, why the hell
didn't you just say so?
Jesse sprints back into the woods. Cole, Bob, and Frank
exchange looks.
BOB
He's smiling.
COLE
Never a good thing.
FRANK
This ought to be interesting.
ANOTHER ROAR from the Gatling pushes their heads down, but
as that sound fades, another blends in, growing louder and
louder, the SOUND OF HOOFBEATS
ANGLE ON
The men at the fortification, turning to face the woods,
their faces stunned as JESSE JAMES ON HORSEBACK AT FULL
GALLOP EXPLODES from the woods, heading straight at his own
men and at the last second LEAPS OVER THE BARRIER, and as he
does Jesse leans back in the saddle to let the wind strip
off his longrider coat, revealing for the first time his
GUNS -- two Colts at the hip, a crossed bandolier on his
chest with two cross-holstered Colts at the shoulders, and
two Colts in the small of his back.
And for that one second as Jesse and the horse are in
mid-air and the longrider coat trails behind him like
leather wings and his guns gleam blue in the sunlight, Jesse
James is the Angel of Death.
The horse hits the ground running. The Union troops are in
shock as Jesse draws both his hip Colts and starts firing.
JESSE
Come on, ya Yankee bastards!
His GUNS BLAZING, Jesse rides straight at the Bluecoats.
Five, six are down before they can even react. They start
firing back, but they can't draw a bead. Two more are down.
Jesse's making every bullet count.
ANGLE ON
The Gatling gun as the crew swings it around and FIRES,
hundred of rounds tearing straight at Jesse
ANGLE ON
Jesse who incredibly cuts the horse hard left using just
his knees, still shooting as the Gatling volley goes wide,
actually killing two of the Union soldiers behind Jesse.
But then the arc of fire takes Jesse's horse in the rump.
The horse falls, but Jesse dives off, still firing, killing
another two soldiers. Then he hits the ground, rolls, and is
up and running, dropping the spent Colts and drawing the two
shoulder guns in one smooth motion, never interrupting his
shooting.
Frank sees the Gatling swing away from him. He stands and --
-- BANG as the Gatling triggerman drops, BANG as the
ammo-feeder goes down, and BANG as the third man falls
before the echo of the first shot clears.
Cole is the first one on his feet.
COLE
WAAAHHHHOOOO!! We're coming Jesse!
CAPTAIN MALCOLM
Charge!
With a ragged cheer the RANGERS ERUPT FROM THE FOREST, some
actually on horseback, firing at the exposed Union troops.
Soldiers are swarming Jesse, but he's moving, turning, an
untouchable blur in the chaos. As he drops two more empty
Colts and reaches for the last two at his back, a SOLDIER
just an arm's length away BRINGS UP A RIFLE.
JESSE
Oh, you do not!
Jesse grabs the rifle barrel and drives the butt straight
back into the soldier's nose. The Union boy falls, releasing
the gun. Jesse swings the rifle in a smooth arc, bashing
another soldier in the jaw, and then spins it effortlessly
into his opposite hand and FIRES it point blank into another
Union soldier.
ANGLE ON
The Rangers PLOWING INTO the Union soldiers. Rattled, the
Union troops are beginning to break and fall back.
ANGLE ON
Jesse as another nearby soldier draws a revolver. Jesse
snags his hand, twists it, wrapping the man's arm backward
around Jesse's waist. With the other man still gripping the
weapon, Jesse FANS THE HAMMER as he turns, shooting six more
Union soldiers as they try to rush him. With a final yank,
Jesse pulls the Colt from the man and crashes it down on his
skull.
ANGLE ON
the Union soldiers in full retreat.
The few remaining Bluecoats break and run as Jesse reaches
the Gatling. Suddenly a FIGURE LEAPS UP from behind the
Gatling and FIRES his rifle. A bloody streak tears Jesse's
cheek and he stumbles onto his back. With a cry, the figure
jumps forward and buries his bayonet in Jesse's chest!
Jesse gasps, then, puzzled, looks down. The bayonet has
lodged right in the "X" of the ammo belts on his chest,
stopped by the bullets and leather. Jesse kicks. As the
Union soldier is knocked back, Jesse smoothly snap-kicks to
his feet and draws both remaining Colts. He pulls up short.
It's a fifteen year old boy, Web Mimms in a blue uniform.
There's a deadly pause.
JESSE
You ain't even been with a girl,
have you?
The boy shakes his head. Jesse waves him off with the guns.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Git.
The boy scurries off. Jesse turns and lopes down the hill.
Instantly he's surrounded by cheering Missouri Rangers.
The Rangers move past Jesse. Jesse suddenly realizes Frank
is there. They fall into step together.
JESSE
Distracting enough for you?
FRANK
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
JESSE
So you're saying I could have done
more to attract their attention.
FRANK
Mm-hmm.
JESSE
Such as?
FRANK
You could have worn one of those
big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday
hats.
JESSE
That would have made an impression.
FRANK
I figure.
JESSE
See, that's your problem, Frank. By
the time you finish figuring out
stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
FRANK
No, Jesse, your problem is you're
always doing stuff before I'm
finished figuring it out.
Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom RIDE UP on their recovered
horses. Cole jumps down and picks up Jesse in a bear hug.
COLE
Wait'll we get back to Missouri,
start telling those gals about how
little Jesse James charged the whole
Union Army by himself!
COMANCHE TOM
You ride like a Comanche.
BOB
You can ride like that?
COMANCHE TOM
I said like a Comanche, not this
Comanche.
Cole mounts up, reaches down a hand to Jesse.
COLE
Ride with me, cousin?
JESSE
I could use the walk.
COLE
Suit yourself. We'll have some
horses waiting for you at the road.
(then)
Let's ride, Rangers!
Cole slaps leather and the Rangers canter off. As they
disappear we hear:
BOB
(low)
Now, I would just sound stupid
saying something like that...
Jesse and Frank watch them go, then start walking again.
JESSE
(finally)
Web's dead.
FRANK
I reckoned.
JESSE
Hell of a war.
FRANK
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea
at the time.
The James brothers, the Youngers, and the other Rangers
ride down a dirt road toward a ragtag column of Confederate
soldiers. The grey uniforms are ghostlike in the twilight.
The men are obviously broken, dispirited. The column
stretches down the road and around a bend as far as the eye
can see.
Jesse and the other Rangers ride into the midst of the
Confederates who part and flow around the horsemen like a
slow-moving river.
For a moment, nobody speaks while the whole eerie
procession glides past.
COLE
Where you boys going?
JESSE
There's Yankees back there. Lot's
of 'em.
One grizzled Confederate VETERAN, his arm in a bloody
sling, looks up at Jesse.
VETERAN
War's over, son. General Lee
surrendered yesterday at Appomattox.
The soldiers move on. The Rangers stare into the middle
distance of despair. Cole rubs his hands across his face.
FRANK
Yesterday.
BOB
Well, somebody better go tell THE
DAMN YANKEES!
COLE
What do we do now?
Jesse seems to be the only one with a clear head.
JESSE
Home. We go home. We ride like hell
to get there, and we kill anything
or anyone that comes between us and
our homes. And when we get there we
stay there and God help any fool who
tries to get me to leave my farm
again.
BOB
(pause)
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Jesse jerks his reins, and the last remaining survivors of
the Missouri Rangers trot off into the sunset.
MONTAGE
-- Jesse, Frank, the Youngers and Comanche Tom riding hard
down country roads, past burned out farms.
THE RIDERS
Are struggling through a downpour in a pitch black night,
one of the horses slipping, going down.
BLAZING SUN
On a dusty road, the Youngers sharing a horse now,
everybody just trying to keep moving.
Jesse, Frank, Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom are looking down
on the frontier town of Liberty, Missouri.
FRANK
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
JESSE
All this time in the saddle... We
get to the farm, I'm going to shoot
this damn horse just on principle.
COLE
Never thought that pissant town
would look so pretty.
BOB
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is
pretty.
JESSE
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
COLE
Planting corn. Harvesting corn.
Year after year.
BOB
Corn gonna shoot at me?
FRANK
Nope.
BOB
Then I love it.
They start to ride down into town.
COLE
Tom, why don't you stop at our
spread before you head on out to the
reservation? Figure we might have
some work for you, if you want.
COMANCHE TOM
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and
get drunk in a dirt shack, or work
for you...
COLE
Well?
COMANCHE TOM
I'm thinking...
Cole throws a playful punch at Comanche Tom.
The gang is riding into the main stretch of town. They're
grinning, happy to be home, until --
JESSE
We got problems.
DOZENS OF UNION SOLDIERS are walking along the boardwalk,
lingering near the saloon, all suddenly staring at the
riders.
COLE
What the --
FRANK
Must be a garrison in town. We're
in occupied territory, boys.
Cole is returning stares.
JESSE
Hands off your hip, Cole.
COLE
You're not scared, are you?
JESSE
Pick your fights, cousin. You
taught me that.
BOB
It gets worse.
There in the center of town, is a brand new scaffold. Three
bodies, fresh ones, are hanging from the nooses.
FRANK
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie
Higgins, Dave Laller ...
BOB
... Will Perry ...
COLE
They rode with Quantrill's Rangers.
The riders stop at the scaffold, take off their hats.
JESSE
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the
only casualty this town's got.
FRANK
We better go to Doc's, see what's
going on here.
COLE
I'm cutting them down.
Cole starts to dismount. Jesse grabs his arm. The Union
Soldiers have started to form a crowd
JESSE
Not now.
COLE
What is wrong with you?
JESSE
(low)
In case we have to kill these
sonofabitches, I don't want them to
see us coming.
Cole thinks, nods. They ride away from the scaffold.
BOB
Cole, I want to get to the farm,
make sure Little Jim and the girls
are okay.
FRANK
Stop by our spread after that, tell
our Ma we're all right. We'll go to
Doc Mimms.
The Youngers and Comanche Tom split off, start to trot away.
COMANCHE TOM
I think I may just go on to the
reservation.
BOB
Tom, I'm this close to coming with
you...
Jesse and Frank ride toward a handsome white two-story
frame house that stands in a grove of elm trees.
ANOTHER ANGLE
They dismount and walk up to the porch. A FARM HAND in a
cowboy hat is nailing a rail onto the porch.
JESSE
Scuse me, we're here for the Doctor.
The farm hand turns and pulls off his hat -- her hat. She's
a chestnut-haired beauty in her late teens, ZERELDA MIMMS.
ZEE
Jesse! Frank!
She hugs both of them enthusiastically. Jesse is obviously,
immediately smitten.
JESSE
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
ZEE
You were little Jesse James when
you left.
JESSE
But you got big!
Zee arches an eyebrow.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
I mean, you aged --
Zee arches both eyebrows.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
I mean, I mean, in a good way you
got big and older.
Zee tilts her head. Jesse's mouth moves, but nothing comes
out, until
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Frank, don't you have something to
say?
FRANK
You're doing just fine.
JESSE
(pulling it together)
Zee, we got to talk to you and your
father.
DOC MIMMS, a grey-haired man wearing rimless spectacles,
steps out of the doorway.
DOC MIMMS
Frank, Jesse.
(looking)
Where's Web?
ANGLE ON
A LONG SHOT of the Mimms house. We can see, but not hear,
Jesse talking. A beat, then we hear Zee CRY OUT.
Doc Mimms
staggers, SLUMPS DOWN in the door frame. Jesse and Frank
rush to help him.
DISSOLVE TO:
We see Frank and Jesse mount up. Zee is at the door seeing
them off.
FRANK
We'll be back on Saturday with Cole
and Bob, give you a hand with the
repairs.
ZEE
Thank you. For everything.
Especially that story you told my
father.
Jesse is about to object, but Zee raises a hand.
ZEE
(CONT'D)
I'm going to go cry now, so I don't
have time for your lies. But I'll
see you Saturday.
Zee kisses her fingertips and extends them to the boys,
then disappears into the house.
CLOSE ON:
Frank shaking his head as they ride away.
FRANK
That Zerelda turned into a hell of
a woman, eh --
WIDEN TO REVEAL Jesse's not next to him. Frank turns.
Jesse's still staring at the door.
Frank rides back, takes
Jesse's horse by the reins.
As Frank turns Jesse's horse
and leads it away, Jesse's head keeps pivoting, fixed on the
door. After a moment, Jesse turns to look forward, taking
his reins.
The brothers ride away slowly.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
"Big and older"?
JESSE
You can shut up now.
FRANK
You are a charmer.
JESSE
I swear I'll shoot you in your
sleep.
FRANK
Next time try "fat and haggard."
Jesse pulls down his hat and groans into it.
Jesse and Frank ride up. Out of the farmhouse bursts MA
JAMES, a big, rugged frontier woman who is absolutely
hysterical.
MA
My boys! My boys!
She hauls Jesse and Frank clean out of their saddles.
MA
(CONT'D)
My boys are alive!
FRANK
(strangling)
Not if you don't ease up a bit,
Ma...
She looks at both at arm's length.
MA
Did you kill Yankees?
JESSE
A fair number, Ma.
MA
Say your prayers?
FRANK
Every night, Ma.
MA
Good. Now get inside and wash up
for dinner.
We can hear the laughter from inside the lit house. Night
falls and
DISSOLVE TO:
Like a time-lapse film we see the surrounding trees have
filled out, the stone fence is repaired, the shabby paint
redone in sparkling white. Jesse and Cole, shirtless, are
driving a post into a hole. Frank STEPS OUT of the house and
joins them.
JESSE
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
COLE
She got two of them.
FRANK
I think one of 'em's glass.
COLE
Which one, right or left?
FRANK
The brown one.
JESSE
(to Cole)
You talk big for a man who screwed
another man back in Atlanta.
Frank laughs as Cole raises the shovel to strike Jesse.
FRANK
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at
Bunty's...
COLE
Sadie was not a man!
JESSE
She had a moustache.
COLE
She was European!
JESSE
All right, calm down. I'll agree
Sadie was a woman --
Jesse and Frank swallow their laughs.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
-- if you stop saying things about
my Zee.
FRANK
Your Zee? Hmm.
(quoting)
"From women's eyes this doctrine I
derive: they sparkle still the right
Promethean fire; They are the books,
the arts, the academes, that show,
contain, and nourish all the world."
COLE
I have no idea what you just said,
but it sounded real nice.
FRANK
Shakespeare.
(pause)
He's European.
COLE
Ah.
JESSE
You want to write that down for me
so I can say it to Zee?
The post finally drops straight into the hole. Jesse and
Cole shrug into shirts and grab a pitcher of lemonade.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Thanks for the help.
COLE
After all you did on our farm?
(sips, then)
You miss it, don't you Jesse?
JESSE
The war? What, are you crazy?
(beat)
There are things I miss about it.
COLE
It was exciting.
JESSE
But it was a whole lot of killing.
Why should we miss that?
COLE
Because we were good at it?
Hell,
we were great at it. Jesse, don't
tell anyone I said this, because
everybody knows I'm the toughest man
in this town, but you are one
terrifying sonofabitch with those
guns.
JESSE
(regretful, but not)
Yeah.
Frank looks at Jesse thoughtfully. Then all three notice
ANGLE ON
A BUGGY that stops at the edge of the property. Ma STEPS
OUT onto the porch next to Frank to meet:
A man in a suit, ROLLIN PARKER, and three riders who
dismount and flank Parker: two DETECTIVES and a big Scot
with a beard and no moustache, ALAN PINKERTON. Pinkerton is
wearing a suit and a gun in a high waistband. All four
advance to the house.
PARKER
Howdy, folks. How are you this
afternoon?
COLE
"Howdy"?
JESSE
Easterners.
MA
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
PARKER
I am Rollin H. Parker, personal
emissary of Mr. Thaddeus Rains,
president of the Rock Island and
Pacific Railroad. These two
gentlemen are Pinkerton detectives,
working for Mr. Thaddeus Rains,
president of the Rock Island and
Pacific Railroad, and this gentleman
here is the famous Alan Pinkerton,
founder of the Secret Service and
now working under contract to Mr.
Thaddeus Rains.
JESSE
Would that be Thaddeus Rains,
president of the Rock Island and
Pacific Railroad?
FRANK
You know him?
JESSE
Heard of him.
PARKER
(trying to regain
control)
As you have no doubt heard from
your neighbors, our railroad is
moving west.
JESSE
That makes sense, as east would put
you underwater.
Pinkerton coughs a laugh. Parker glares at him and
continues.
PARKER
... moving west, opening the
frontier for folks such as yourself.
Your acreage here is on the proposed
right of way.
Parker produces a piece of paper. Ma takes it.
PARKER
(CONT'D)
I'm here for your signature on this
land sales contract. I'm authorized
to pay you two dollars an acre.
MA
Two dollars?
PARKER
That's right. That's the price
authorized by the railroad's board,
and approved by the Department of
the Interior of the Government of
the United States of America.
MA
This land ain't for sale.
Pinkerton steps forward.
PINKERTON
Ma'am, I can understand how you
might feel that way -- you've made a
lovely home here. But it's really
not up to me or you. Are you
familiar with the legal concept of
the Right of Eminent Domain?
FRANK
Yeah, I am. What about it?
Parker is surprised. Pinkerton has become interested in
these farmers.
PINKERTON
Well, this land is about to be
condemned.
PARKER
I'm doing you folks a favor --
COLE
Said the skinner to the mule.
PARKER
-- with a price of two dollars an
acre for this one time only offer.
After today the price goes down. So
if I were you, I'd just sign the
contract, and I'll be on my way.
Frank takes the contract from Ma and hands it back to
Parker.
FRANK
Good day, Mr. Parker You can tell
Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where
the sun don't shine.
(to the boys)
Shakespeare.
JESSE/COLE
Ah.
Parker flushes with anger. Pinkerton and his men rest their
hands on their guns.
PINKERTON
I don't think you understand. You
don't have a choice.
CLICK CLICK and we see Jesse's drawn and cocked two Colts
from out of thin air. Frank has pulled his rifle from the
doorway. Parker and the detectives are furious, but
Pinkerton seems no more than curious.
PARKER
(to Ma)
Ma'am. You have to look in your
heart and do what you know is right
here.
MA
Let me ask the Lord.
Ma bows her head for a moment. She then nods and looks up.
MA
(CONT'D)
The Lord says we can bury 'em out
back in the orchard, nobody'll ever
find them.
JESSE
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting
mood today.
FRANK
Why don't we just let them go for
today, Ma. We'll bury them out back
next time.
MA
Oh all right.
Parker, and the detectives are stepping backward to the
buggy.
PARKER
You people are making a serious
mistake!
Pinkerton himself has lingered, taking in the group.
PINKERTON
(nodding)
Nicely played.
Parker, Pinkerton and the detectives RIDE OFF. The group at
the James house watches them go, then Cole turns to Jesse.
COLE
Where the hell did you get those
guns?
OFF JESSE'S SHRUG WE
DISSOLVE TO:
Soldiers flank the gallows, which stand at the bottom of
the stairs to City Hall. A small drum corps beats a stark
rhythm.
Parker is watching this like a sideshow. Pinkerton is next
to him, scanning the crowd of locals which is getting larger
and surlier by the minute.
PARKER
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all
in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will
be very pleased with this news.
Nothing like a hanging to motivate
the populace to relocate.
PINKERTON
It's not my job to relax. I've put
men facing out both ways down Main
Street, so nobody can ride in
shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up
on the water tower just in case.
Pinkerton WAVES to a FIGURE in a suit atop the water tower.
CUT TO:
We see it is FRANK JAMES in the suit, who WAVES BACK and
then kneels and sights down his long rifle. Tucked away
behind him, out of sight from the street, is a
bound-and-gagged PINKERTON SNIPER in his underwear.
CUT TO:
Cole, his face swollen from a beating, is marched up the
stairs of the gallows toward the waiting hangman.
LONG SHOT
of the gallows, detectives and soldiers down the street on
both sides, guns ready. The position is completely
unassailable. Cole is at the platform. His hands are tied in
front of him. The noose is placed on his neck.
BACK TO
The gallows. Parker leans forward in anticipation. A UNION
LIEUTENANT approaches with the black hood. Cole spits in his
face. The CROWD ROARS. The Lieutenant angrily motions to the
HANGMAN, who grabs the lever --
The drums STOP --
But the drumming doesn't.
The drum corps look at each other, confused. The Army men
and the Pinkertons squint in concentration. There's
definitely some sort of rhythmic DRUMMING, coming closer...
The CROWD, sensing something, easing back from the
gallows...
The drumming gets LOUDER ...
REVEAL Fifty-odd CATTLE suddenly STAMPEDING from down the
street, their hooves creating the drumming!
REACTION SHOTS as the Pinkertons and Army men start to
scatter, the cattle surging around them --
ANGLE ON Parker and Alan Pinkerton running for cover,
Pinkerton half-turned to watch the action.
PINKERTON
Brilliant...
Pinkerton suddenly spots something confusing. We FOLLOW his
stare to see --
ANGLE ON
a HORSE in the middle of the cattle, cutting through the
steer, towards the gallows.
THE HANGMAN REACHES FOR THE LEVER AGAIN, BUT JUST AS HE
DOES -
Jesse -- masked -- appears from the side of the horse,
where he's been hanging on Indian-style. He gets a leg up on
the horse's back and LEAPS --
SLAMMING into the Hangman, bringing him down!
The cattle pass the gallows, revealing that the tight ranks
of the Army and Pinkertons are now spread out --
SMASH! From the nearby GENERAL STORE, the other masked
rescuers CRASH through the big front window on horseback and
ride into the Army men, FIRING AWAY.
TOTAL CHAOS! The Army men and Pinkertons fight towards the
gallows. As Jesse untangles himself from the Hangman, the
Union Lieutenant reaches for the lever but BANG drops as
Frank opens fire.
Frank starts picking off soldiers. The detectives and
remaining soldiers are completely disoriented.
Jesse flashes a knife and the noose drops away from Cole's
neck. Facing Cole, he cuts the rope on Cole's wrists --
Cole instantly draws Jesse's guns from his waist holster,
spin-reverses them and SHOOTS two Union soldiers climbing
the stairs behind Jesse's back.
Jesse and Cole exchange a
look, then Jesse steps away --
As Bob rides by he TOSSES JESSE'S GUNBELT into the air.
Jesse draws both guns from the belt as it flies by, spins
and starts shooting.
The soldiers have totally broken ranks. One riderless horse
led by Comanche Tom pulls up by the scaffold. Jesse LEAPS ON
and Cole jumps on behind him. Jesse puts the spurs to it and
the horse SURGES into a gap in the crowd.
Allen Pinkerton steps past the panicking troops, squarely
in the path of the charging horse. He draws his gun and
FIRES. The bullet PLOWS into Jesse just as the terrified
horse lurches forward, TRAMPLING Pinkerton.
Cole holds Jesse up and the riders take off down the
street. We see Frank has disappeared from the water tower.
The soldiers fire at the fleeing liberators. One of the
detectives runs over to the injured Alan Pinkerton.
DETECTIVE
Sir, are you all right?
(shout)
Somebody get a doctor!
WE SEE one window upstairs with a light on.
A lavishly appointed carriage rolls up to the front of the
nicest hotel in town. Rollin Parker and his retinue of
Pinkerton detectives scurry to the door.
The DOOR OPENS. Out steps THADDEUS RAINS, wearing an
elegant suit he bought in London last year and a scowl he
picked up in Boston three decades ago. The scowl fits him
better.
PARKER
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a
pleasure to have you join us in the
field.
RAINS
And it is my pleasure to be here.
PARKER
Really!
RAINS
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have
to leave my board room to come to
this godforsaken piece of dirt to
discover why in the name of all that
is holy you cannot seem to evict a
few simple farmers from their
PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I
may build the GREATEST railroad that
this country has ever seen!
PARKER
I can completely understand your
distress, sir.
Rains sighs. As he speaks, he checks a heavy, gold, ornate
and ever-present POCKETWATCH on a GOLD CHAIN.
RAINS
Parker, tell me what's going on so
I can return as quickly as possible
to Boston and my whores and cigars,
not necessarily in that order.
PARKER
Two weeks ago, we managed to
arrange to have the Army hang one of
the local farmers.
RAINS
Good.
PARKER
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of
local thugs managed to rescue him
from the gallows. Not only has this
inspired resistance from the other
farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan
Pinkerton was seriously injured
during the incident.
RAINS
Leaving you in charge of operations
until he recovers.
PARKER
(puffing with pride)
Yes sir.
RAINS
Just perfect.
PARKER
A further impediment is that the
Army garrison has been ordered to
move on from Liberty. We will no
longer have that particular stick
with which to threaten the farmers.
RAINS
You see the Army leaving and you
see the loss of a tool. I see a
power void to be filled. As we have
the most power, we may move with
impunity.
PARKER
I see. I'll get together four
patrols of our detectives for action
tonight.
RAINS
I'll teach these podunks what
happens when they challenge the
righteousness of progress.
Zee is on the porch. Jesse COMES THROUGH the door, moving
gingerly. Zee immediately moves to support him.
ZEE
You shouldn't be up.
JESSE
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm
sick of it.
ZEE
You're sick of my company?
JESSE
No! I mean, of course not. No.
ZEE
Teasing you is completely unfair.
JESSE
What you do to me is unfair. The
teasing, I mean.
ZEE
I shouldn't tease a hero.
JESSE
What?
ZEE
Everybody in the county knows it
was you who rescued Cole. We're all
so proud of you, Jesse. And not a
single farm's been sold to the
railroad since. You're everybody's
hero.
JESSE
I wasn't the only one risking my
neck that day.
ZEE
So you're saying I should leave you
alone and go spend time with Jimmy
Younger?
JESSE
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
They look at each other warmly. Frank DRIVES UP in a
carriage.
FRANK
You ready to stop loafing around
with this young lady and get back to
farming?
JESSE
What do you think?
FRANK
Would you get in the carriage?
Until Ma has you home so she can
fuss over you herself, she's gonna
make me miserable.
Doc Mimms COMES OUT onto the porch.
JESSE
What do you say, sir?
DOC MIMMS
Go on. You're pretty much all
healed up.
Jesse and Zee exchange glances. Zee withdraws demurely into
the house. Jesse straightens up and hops easily into the
carriage.
FRANK
You're looking a bit more spry now
that somebody --
JESSE
(to Frank)
Shut up.
(to Doc Mimms)
Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh,
this evening, I could come by?
DOC MIMMS
You know you're welcome any time!
JESSE
(unusually awkward)
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could
come by, and then take Zee out. Some
place near. With other folk. Near.
Here.
(beat)
But out.
DOC MIMMS
(bemused)
It's fine by me, Jesse.
FRANK
Don't worry, sir, I'll make sure
they're always properly chaperoned.
Jesse slooooowly turns to glare at Frank.
DOC MIMMS
(grinning)
Why, that hadn't even occurred to
me, Frank. I am deeply in your debt.
FRANK
Army's leaving town, so Cole can
stop hiding up in the woods and come
back to his farm. Everybody's
getting together at the Younger
place for a to-do.
Frank tips his hat, and the carriage MOVES OFF.
Dozens of people are milling about happily in the lantern
light of a Western party. Some are dancing to the small
banjo-led band. A small knot of men are comparing war
stories. Cole Younger is wandering among them, people
clapping his shoulder, shaking his hand.
Jesse -- formally accompanying Zee -- and Frank arrive at
the edge of the light. Immediately the entire group bursts
into applause and crowds Jesse. Cole cuts through and bear
hugs Jesse, making him wince.
COLE
Here's Liberty's favorite son!
(quietly)
I'll never forget what you did,
cousin.
BOB
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
ZEE
Why thank you, Bob.
BOB
I'm especially pleased you came
with Jesse.
(off her look)
Seeing as right now there's a
gaggle of girls hoping to dance with
Jesse who are just going to have to
settle for the many charms of Bob
Younger.
ANGLE ON
A group of obviously disappointed, beautiful young women.
Bob runs a hand through his hair.
JESSE
You have no shame.
BOB
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
The party starts up again, and everyone is caught up in the
good times.
ANGLE ON
Jesse SWINGING Zee into a group of dancers. They join in
the Two-Step, and Jesse's as smooth as silk.
Jesse, carrying a lantern, and Zee are walking. We can hear
the party still going just a little ways away. They reach a
tree at the hilltop with a beautiful view of the stars and
the river. They sit down, their backs against the tree.
JESSE
I used to come to this tree when I
was a kid and imagine what my life
would be like when I got older.
ZEE
You didn't want to farm?
JESSE
I was thinking more along the lines
of being a river pirate.
ZEE
A river pirate.
JESSE
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
ZEE
Thank God you grew out of that.
(pause)
You did grow out of that, didn't
you?
JESSE
Mostly. It would be an all right
life, for a bachelor.
ZEE
You planning on being a bachelor
your whole life, Jesse James?
JESSE
Not if I find the right girl.
ZEE
And what's this right girl like?
JESSE
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes
me think she's two steps ahead of
me. And big buck teeth.
ZEE
Where will you find such a girl?
JESSE
Honestly, you'd do if only you had
the buck teeth.
Zee fakes a monstrous overbite.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
(dreamy)
Finally.
The two move a little closer. Eye contact.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No,
ah... "From women's eyes this
doctrine I derive, they sparkle
still like ... shiny... sparkling
rocks..."
ZEE
Sparkling rocks?
JESSE
Little ones.
ZEE
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare
poems you're trying to quote?
JESSE
Yep.
ZEE
Were you planning on kissing me
when you finished quoting?
JESSE
I've been planning on kissin' you
for a very long time.
They kiss. It's everything it should be.
BOOM!
Jesse and Zee are startled by a flash of light and sound.
They turn to look back --
The partygoers are RUNNING from the YARD to the BARN, which
is ON FIRE in several different places. As the Younger
brothers and Frank get close, they see a squad of masked
riders disappearing down the road. Some of the men SHOOT at
the riders, but the distance is too great.
Jim makes a run for the BARN, but Bob grabs him.
COLE
BASTARDS! Come back here and face
me!
FRANK
Get buckets!
Some of the crowd starts to form a bucket line to the well.
Jesse and Zee RUN UP. Frank turns to him.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
JESSE
Ma.
Frank and Jesse bolt for their horses, swing into the
saddles and GALLOP OFF.
From a bit down the road, looking just fine. Jesse and
Frank reign in as relief rushes across their faces --
AN EXPLOSION tears the house apart like a pile of
matchsticks! Jesse and Frank urge their horses into a full
gallop.
Jesse and Frank leap from their mounts, trying to get close
to the house. The flames are too strong.
JESSE
Ma! Ma!
Jesse's ventured so close his coat catches fire. Frank
tears it from him and stamps it out. Jesse ignores him,
still pacing back and forth in front of the inferno.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Ma! Please!
MA (O.S.) (O.S.)
(weakly)
Boys?
The brothers turn and nearly drop from shock. Ma is
stumbling toward them, half her hair singed off, brutally
BURNED.
FRANK
Jesus mercy --
They reach her just as she collapses. Jesse is cradling
her, Frank with his arms around both of them.
MA
Riders --
JESSE
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you
to Doc Mimms.
MA
Take care of each other, boys. You
say your prayers.
Jesse is openly crying. Frank has tears silently streaming
down his face.
JESSE
Doc Mimms will --
MA
Shush.
Ma's eyes turn up, and she half-smiles.
MA
(CONT'D)
Well look at that. The Good Lord's
a bit shorter than I reckoned.
Ma gently stops breathing.
ANGLE ON
The boys holding Ma, framed by the roaring flames of their
home. Jesse leans his head back and lets out a HOWL OF RAGE
AND PAIN AND HATE that goes on and on and on...
DISSOLVE TO:
Frank and Jesse are staring at the smoking ruins of their
lives. Other townsfolk are milling nearby, including Zee and
the Youngers.
FRANK
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make
a decent life someplace else.
JESSE
Don't care.
FRANK
Didn't think you would.
(turning away)
I'm going to go make the coffin.
JESSE
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't
be enough by the time I'm through.
Frank is gone.
COLE
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy
Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
BOB
The sheriff says it was a gang of
drunk Kansas boys.
COLE
I say we ride into town and kill us
some Pinkertons and railroad men.
JIM
I like that.
JESSE
No.
They stare at him.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
This isn't a feud, this is war.
They've got more men than we do. We
kill detectives, they can replace
'em in a day.
COLE
(snapping)
So what do we do, General Lee?
JESSE
Just like in the war. Harass their
supply lines. We kill the railroad's
men, they won't care.
BOB
But if we take their money and
supplies...
JESSE
Exactly.
JIM
That's a great plan, Jesse!
Cole nods grudgingly.
BOB
I'll get us a few more men, and
Comanche Tom'll ride with us.
JIM
Where do we hit first, Jesse?
COLE
I'll pick the first job! I mean...
I know a girl down at the bank. See
if she can't get a list of towns
where the railroad keeps its money.
JESSE
Perfect, Cole.
COLE
Let's ride.
The Youngers mount up. Jesse walks to the ruined house,
pulls a big iron trunk from the wreckage. He KICKS it open,
reaches in, and pulls out his gun belts. Zee appears behind
him in what remains of the doorway.
ZEE
I am so sorry, Jesse.
JESSE
Frank and me have to go away for a
while.
Zee considers this, puts her head in close to Jesse's.
ZEE
You and I, we've started...
something, you know?
(Jesse nods)
I don't know what'll happen if you
do this.
JESSE
Me neither.
ZEE
Let the law --
JESSE
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus
Rains. Only justice does.
ZEE
Whose justice? Yours or God's?
(no answer)
When will you stop?
JESSE
When my name makes them cry in
their sleep. When I've brought them
to ashes.
Jesse kisses her gently, turns and walks to where the
Youngers are standing. Zee can barely conceal her anger and
heartbreak.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT of a Midwestern bank on a quiet street.
Frank James, Bob and Jim Younger, Clell Miller, Loni
Packwood, Comanche Tom and several new GANG MEMBERS wait
along both sides of the street in this medium sized
mid-western town. Some are standing next to their horses,
some mounted.
ANOTHER ANGLE
An OLD MAN with a cane is walking shakily towards the bank.
Frank jerks his head and Jim intercepts him.
JIM
Hold on there, sir. Bank's closed
today.
OLD MAN
Wha?
JIM
Bank holiday! Bank's closed!
Jim tries to steer the old man away. The old man starts
batting at him with the cane.
OLD MAN
Get off me!
JIM
Ow! Ow!
Frank sighs.
The old man is still smacking Jim with the cane. Bob
crosses to help.
BOB
Sir, it's a bank holiday --
SMACK SMACK and now the old man's laying the cane on both
Bob and Jim.
JIM
Ow!
BOB
Ow ow!
Frank hangs his head.
Comanche Tom walks over to where the old man is still
SMACKING Jim and Bob.
OLD MAN
I know it ain't no durned bank
holiday!
COMANCHE TOM
You're right, sir.
OLD MAN
Then why can't I go in there?
COMANCHE TOM
On account of we're robbing it.
OLD MAN
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
COMANCHE TOM
It's a secret.
OLD MAN
Fine. I'll just wait here.
COMANCHE TOM
I'd appreciate that.
The old man settles against the wall. Comanche Tom moves
back to his horse. Bob and Jim walk off, glaring at the old
man.
Jesse and Cole RUN FROM the bank with full saddlebags.
Everybody MOUNTS UP and starts riding down main street.
FRANK
How'd it go in there?
JESSE
Fine. How'd it go out here?
FRANK
We're gonna have to talk...
BANG! The gang flinches as a chunk of wood splinters from a
post. They turn to see the Sherriff running out in front of
them, raising his rifle --
The entire Gang draws their guns. Jesse raises a hand.
JESSE
Sir, you can do this the smart way,
or the stupid way. Only one way ends
with you still breathin'.
The Sherriff takes in the Gang's firepower. He lowers the
rifle.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
(to the Gang)
Just 'cause we're robbing a bank,
no reason not to be civil about it.
The Gang turns and RIDES OFF hard.
The DEPUTY walks up to the Sherriff a beat later.
SHERRIFF
Where the hell were you?
DEPUTY
I had you covered.
(beat)
From back there.
SHERRIFF
Shit.
DISSOLVE TO:
A bonfire burns in the middle of a rough camp in the woods.
The Gang members are sitting around, relaxing and drinking
coffee. All eyes are on Jesse and Cole as they finish
counting the money.
JESSE
I got seven thousand.
COLE
I got three.
BOB
Ten thousand dollars! That's almost
a thousand apiece!
The men HOOT AND HOLLER.
LONI
My luck is changing at last!
Cole holds up a pile of papers.
COLE
These are deeds and mortgages of
farms the bank was holding for the
railroad.
BOB
Better pass them over here before
something happens to 'em.
Cole goes to hand the papers to Bob and "accidentally"
drops them in the fire. The men CHEER again.
JESSE
All right, settle down. All this
money ain't ours.
BOB
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's.
That's why we had to go to all that
trouble of stealing it.
(to Frank)
You explain it to him.
JESSE
We oughta take some of this, give
it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot
of people hurting up there.
CLELL
None of them risked their necks for
this.
FRANK
Now, let's think about this. We
create some good will with the folks
hereabouts, make it easier to dodge
the law.
JESSE
See, Frank's being smart about this.
COLE
Just because he reads all those
books and knows all those big words
doesn't make him smart.
BOB
Uhh, yeah it does.
COLE
You stay out of this, Bob.
JIM
I think Jesse's got a good idea --
COLE
You stay out of this too, Jim.
(to Jesse)
Who put you in charge of this gang,
anyway, Jesse? I did mighty fine
leading us during the War.
JESSE
And I planned getting you off the
hangman's deck --
FRANK
And that's why you both lead the
gang. Two of you went into that bank
together, right?
Jesse and Cole nod, still watching each other.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
Two heads are better than one. All
Jesse was doing was making a
suggestion.
Jesse nods, his face giving nothing up.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
So we're waiting to hear what you
think of the suggestion. As the
other leader of the gang.
Cole considers this.
COLE
I reckon it's the smart thing to do.
The other Gang members grumble. Cole whirls on them.
COLE
(CONT'D)
Hey! We decide something, that's
it! We're in this for the long haul,
and this idea of me and Jesse's will
help give us more places to hide out
without worrying about some farmer
with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in
our sleep. We've got to think --
FRANK
Strategically.
COLE
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
CLELL
This ain't no war.
The Gang is taken aback by this blatant contradiction. Then
a smile spreads across Clell's face.
CLELL
(CONT'D)
Nobody paid me no thousand dollars
to fight in the War!
The Gang LAUGHS, and the tension is broken. Jesse and Cole
slap each other's shoulders, and everyone starts counting
their money and talking all at once.
Half finished railroad tracks run alongside a few sheds and
an office building.
ANGLE ON
The TRAIN TRACKS as the James-Younger Gang rides at full
gallop. A rapid series of SEQUENTIAL EXPLOSIONS follows
them, destroying the track for hundreds of yards.
The entire work camp is DESTROYED. SMOKE still hangs over
the twisted wreckage, a few wagons smolder, it looks like
Omaha Beach at D-DAY plus 20.
Thaddeus Rains is surveying
the damage with Parker.
PARKER
They exchanged fire with the
Pinkerton Guards, killing several of
them. Then they raided the payroll
office and blew the tracks for half
a mile.
RAINS
How much did they get from the safe?
PARKER
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins
and currency. And the delay from the
miles of destroyed track --
RAINS
I'll kill them for blowing up my
railway!
PARKER
To be precise, they didn't blow up
the tracks.
RAINS
THEN WHO DID?!
PARKER
We did.
Rains stares at him. Parker swallows.
PARKER
(CONT'D)
... I mean, our men. Our own
workers planted the dynamite.
(beat)
They were under duress.
Rains controls his cerebral hemorrhage through sheer force
of will. He checks his pocket watch, then says through
gritted teeth:
RAINS
Where the hell is Pinkerton?
The SOUND OF HORSES makes them turn.
ANGLE ON
A fancy carriage that pulls up. WE SEE the ground beneath
the carriage. A boot hits the ground. Then another. Then the
tip of a cane.
REVEAL Alan Pinkerton now moving toward Rains and Parker,
limping from when Jesse's horse trampled him. He has a
newspaper folded up under one arm.
RAINS
(CONT'D)
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got
the payroll, and this damage will
set construction back two months at
least.
PINKERTON
(surveying)
Not to mention my men who lost
their lives.
PARKER
Your men knew the risks.
RAINS
What is going on here, man?
PINKERTON
My professional opinion is that you
have managed to piss off the wrong
bunch of farm boys this time.
PARKER
They had to be dealt with!
PINKERTON
By burning down their homes?
RAINS
You wouldn't have done that?
PINKERTON
Oh no, I would have done that. But
I would have made sure I killed
them, too.
RAINS
I want them arrested and hanged!
PINKERTON
Would a jury around here convict
their own? I think not. We're
beginning an interesting game here,
Mr. Rains.
RAINS
This is no game.
PINKERTON
I'm afraid our adversaries don't
agree.
He hands Rains the paper. Rains' eyes bug out. He begins to
read aloud.
RAINS
(reading)
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad
depot was robbed two nights ago just
outside St. Louis, Missouri. The
brave and daring James-Younger Gang
was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton
detectives, but the city lawmen were
no match for the guns of the West."
PINKERTON
It is a nice piece of writing.
RAINS
"The gang made off with thirty-five
thousand dollars and also destroyed
the Thaxton Switch construction,
meaning that for a few months honest
farmers will be able to sleep
without fearing the railroad is
coming to steal their land!"
(he slams the paper
into Parker's chest)
Who wrote this!? I'll see him
hanged every Tuesday for a month!
PINKERTON
Oh, that's the best part.
He points Rains to the bottom of the article.
RAINS
"The foregoing article was sent to
the newspaper. It was reputedly
written by the outlaw --
(exploding)
Jesse James himself!"
Rains crushes the paper in his hands, raging as he surveys
his destroyed rail tracks.
CUT TO:
A freight train is coming. We can see "Rock Island and
Pacific Railroad" written across the side.
The train stops juuuuust in time. The front of the engine
is inches away from the wagon.
Comanche Tom and Jim Younger climb on top of the wagon,
kick over some barrels. They're empty, without even a top or
bottom.
The Gang is riding hard. Cole and Jesse look over their
shoulders, nod to each other, and WHISTLE.
The men bring their horses down to an easy pace.
JIM
I never thought that posse was
gonna give up.
FRANK
They were admirably persistent.
COLE
Jesse, we got to have a word.
JESSE
Sure, cousin.
COLE
All the posters and newspapers are
calling this bunch the
"James-Younger Gang."
JESSE
Yep.
COLE
Why aren't we the "Younger-James
Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger
brothers and only two James brothers
here.
JIM
I kinda like the sound of the
James-Younger Gang.
COLE
(bristling)
Whose side you on?
BOB
No, Jimmy has a point. The
Younger-James Gang could be
confusing.
COLE
How?
BOB
Say we bust into a bank. We yell
"We're the Younger-James Gang!"
People are gonna be thinking, "The
younger James Gang? Is there an
older James Gang? How come we never
heard of the older James gang?" So
people are trying to figure that out
instead of raising their arms.
JESSE
Can't argue with that.
Cole rolls his eyes.
COLE
I think you boys are missing the
point here...
They continue to argue as they ride off.
JIM
How about "James-Younger" for the
bank jobs and "Younger-James" for
the train robberies?
BOB
See, that's even more confusing,
people'll think there's two gangs...
Comanche Tom RIDES UP to the building marked Marshall's
Office.
A MARSHALL and a dozen PINKERTON DETECTIVES are sitting
around the porch. Tom leaps off his horse.
COMANCHE TOM
You 'um big lawman?
MARSHALL
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
COMANCHE TOM
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
MARSHALL
The District Marshall
MARSHALL (CONT'D)
Of St. Louis?
COMANCHE TOM
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in
Carville that badman Jesse James
riding toward Rising Sun, above
Great River, near Eagle Rock.
MARSHALL
East? East above the river heading
for the Eagle Pass?
COMANCHE TOM
Ho-yah!
The Marshall turns to his men.
MARSHALL
I want every man in town! We can
cut off Jesse James before he
crosses out of my territory! Let's
go!
The posse quickly mounts up. The Marshall tosses Comanche
Tom a coin.
MARSHALL
(CONT'D)
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't
get too drunk!
COMANCHE TOM
Me get heap firewater --
The posse RIDES OFF.
COMANCHE TOM
(CONT'D)
-- you cretins.
Comanche Tom flips the coin over his shoulder. From around
the corner THUNDERS the James Gang. They ride up to the
building marked "Bank" right next to the Marshall's office.
The Gang dismounts, runs in.
An improbably short time later, the Gang members run back
out with full saddlebags and mount up. Comanche Tom RIDES
OFF with them.
FRANK
Nice performance, Tom.
COMANCHE TOM
I feel dirty.
A populous town with the fanciest SALOON we've seen yet.
Out on a sidewalk, Jesse stands alone at the edge of the
building. He's holding an envelope.
HIS POV reveals the address: "Miss Zerelda Mimms, Liberty,
Missouri."
BACK TO SHOT
as Jesse reaches up to the street lantern and lights the
envelope on fire. He drops it to the ground and watches it
smolder.
Bob Younger walks up, holding a "Wanted" poster.
BOB
Finally.
Jesse looks, grins. The sketch is a dead ringer for Bob.
BOB
(CONT'D)
The things a fella has to do to get
a little respect around here...
JESSE
You are a fine figure of a man.
BOB
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.
(off his look)
It's Cole.
JESSE
He's been full of vinegar lately.
BOB
He's planning a job.
JESSE
What?
BOB
Listen, he's my brother and I don't
want to start trouble...
JESSE
Tell me.
The James Gang rides up to the bank. A WATER TOWER can be
seen behind the building opposite the bank.
Jesse, Cole and Frank dismount and move swiftly to the bank
doors. Comanche Tom, Jim Younger, Clell Miller and Loni
Packwood dismount and take defensive positions. The few
other Gang members stay on their horses, looking sharp.
ANGLE ON
Cole holds up at the door, produces his shotgun. Frank and
Jesse draw six guns. On Cole's lead, they KICK OPEN THE
DOORS AND RUSH IN.
Loni is whistling away, rubbing his lucky rabbit's foot. He
squints up at the sun, turns, then stops. He slowly turns
back...
HIS POV reveals a dozen men APPEARING at the edge of the
opposite rooftop, aiming rifles...
Loni lets his rabbit's foot drop...
The FIRST GUNSHOTS PLOW INTO LONI! As he falls back, we see
the rabbit's foot hit the dusty ground...
The Gang leaps for cover as a HAIL OF BULLETS begins to
tear up the bank face around them.
The Gang is scrambling for cover. Loni's body lies in the
street, his rabbit's foot lying in a pool of his blood. The
Gang is returning fire, hiding behind water troughs, dead
horses, barely staying alive. The ROAR OF GUNFIRE is
deafening.
COMANCHE TOM
Head for the end of the street!
JIM
Look!
At both ends of the street, WAGONS ROLL into position, each
manned by two armed Pinkertons. The Gang is trapped.
Jesse sticks his head out the door.
JESSE
Get inside, you --
Gunfire chews up the doorframe. Jesse pulls back inside.
Jesse comes CRASHING through a window! He rolls to a stop
next to one of the horses, grabs a saddlebag, then -- to the
disbelief of the Gang -- he pivots and CRASHES right back
into the Bank!
WE PAN across the trapped Gang, still under fire, to the
front of the next door Saloon, and then WE ZIP
Where the Pinkerton gunmen are shooting at the Gang. Some
of the gunmen look curiously as the windows to the building
two doors down from the bank BLOW OUT.
As the two Pinkerton detectives at the wagon barricade turn
in shock as Jesse James LEAPS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR of a
building he can't possibly be in, lands on the wagon, rolls
off and DASHES INTO a blacksmith shop across the street.
They suddenly notice a HISS. They stand, look in the wagon.
Jesse left a burning stick of dynamite in the wagon.
ANGLE ON
the wagon EXPLODING into matchsticks.
The Pinkertons firing on the gang notice SMOKE rising from
below them. They look down ...
REVEAL bellowing FLAMES and SMOKE enveloping the entire row
of buildings below them.
BACK TO
The roof as a PINKERTON COMMANDER runs to ledge and looks
at the rising flames himself.
A HUGE EXPLOSION is heard O.C. A large SHADOW creeps over
the snipers. They turn and look up --
-- at the Water Tower TOPPLING towards them!
The Pinkertons dive out of the way as the tower SMASHES
onto the roof, unleashing a TIDAL WAVE of water!
UPSHOT of the sniper's ledge as the Pinkertons leap off,
followed by a WALL OF WATER --
WIDEN to see the water POURING into the building from above
--
Cowboys FLY out the windows, followed by TORRENTS of water
--
One Pinkerton SWEPT UP and carried off the roof, BOUNCES
off a second floor balcony and lands in a puddle on the dirt
street below.
FOLLOW the water rushing across the dirt street to the feet
of --
Jim, Tom and the Gang staring in disbelief at the total
destruction Jesse has wrought.
Jesse rides out from a stable leading a team of horses. He
reaches the bank.
JESSE
No time to gawk, boys, we got
somewhere else to be!
Frank and Cole rush out from the bank. The Gang leaps onto
the horses and put the spurs to them hard.
ANGLE ON
the Gang galloping past the shattered wagon barricade,
heading for the edge of town.
Pinkerton riflemen run out of the bank and from behind the
other barricade. One SHARPSHOOTER with a rifle drops to one
knee, lines up...
HIS POV shows Jesse in his sights. He tightens on the
trigger, and just as he pulls --
-- Jim Younger rides into the line of fire! With a CRACK
the bullet hits Jim square in the back. He slumps forward on
his horse. Comanche Tom leaps from his horse onto Jim's and
urges it on.
ANGLE ON
The James Gang disappearing past the edge of town. The
Pinkertons stand stunned amongst the ruin of their ambush.
Alan Pinkerton himself walks up, shaking his head.
The Gang rides up onto a wooded hill where huge rocks jut
from the earth. They all dismount, Jesse and Cole supporting
Jim's limp form as they pull him from the saddle. Jim is
drenched in blood.
JESSE
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
COLE
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in
Liberty!
CLELL
That's a long ride, Cole. We won't
be back 'til morning.
JESSE
Then you better get going!
Cole and Jesse are united again in their grief over Jim.
COLE
Bob, rip up some bandages.
JESSE
Pass me some whisky.
Jim's eyes flutter open for the first time.
JIM
... too young for whisky...
JESSE
This time we'll make an exception.
JIM
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My
girl, you know, from that time...
JESSE
You're gonna tell her when you're
resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
COLE
Jim, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
JIM
Best time of my life.
(weakly)
I was famous, y'know...
Jim dies. Cole cradles the body, begins rocking. Comanche
Tom puts a hand on Bob's shoulder as Bob slumps against a
rock.
Jesse stands, walks away heavily.
Sunset is heavy in the sky. Jesse stares off at it. His
anguish is palpable. Frank comes over.
JESSE
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it
look fun, made it look like an
adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
FRANK
Jim was old enough...
JESSE
(snorts)
He was a boy riding with the most
famous outlaws in the West. How was
he supposed to say no to that?
FRANK
Railroad burned him out too. You
couldn't have stopped him.
JESSE
You're a piss-poor liar for the
smartest man I know.
FRANK
Yeah.
JESSE
A war against the railroad. What
the hell were we thinking?
FRANK
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea
at the time.
Jesse remembers the first time Frank said that. He crosses
BACK TO
the Gang.
ANGLE ON
the Gang -- what's left of them -- waiting by the horses.
The unspoken knowledge of whose fault this is hangs in the
air.
Cole is covered in Jim's blood.
COLE
We'll make them pay for this.
JESSE
I'm out.
COLE
WHAT?! We follow you for a year,
and now that our blood's been
spilled, you're gonna quit?!
JESSE
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Cole can't answer.
CLELL
We can't exactly go back to our
lives, Jesse.
JESSE
I'm not telling you what to do. You
want to keep on following Cole, fine
by me.
BOB
Frank?
Frank nods. He's leaving too.
COLE
Go ahead. Ride on. But don't come
back when you figure out you can't
farm with a six-gun.
Bob embraces Frank. Jesse goes to shake hands with Cole,
but the guilt and rage make his once-best friend
unapproachable. Jesse smiles sadly and walks away.
Zee is letting a dog out. She looks up, freezes. Entranced,
she walks out onto the porch.
ANGLE ON
A figure appearing out of the early morning fog. It's
Jesse, riding slow. He reins his horse in at the porch,
dismounts. He stands staring at Zee.
JESSE
Zee.
ZEE
Jesse. What are you thinking? There
are bounty hunters and lawmen all
over this county!
JESSE
I had to see you. I'm getting
married.
Zee is shocked. Jesse looks serious.
ZEE
I don't understand.
JESSE
She's the most wonderful woman in
the world. Can't get her out of my
mind.
ZEE
That's... wonderful. It's just... I
thought...
JESSE
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the
biggest... buck teeth in all of
Missouri.
It takes Zee a second. Before she can process it all, Jesse
drops to one knee.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
I've quit my outlaw ways. Come live
in my home and in my heart.
Zee takes the hat off Jesse's head, tosses it into the yard
and smiles. Jesse stands up and they kiss.
DISSOLVE TO:
Victorian wooden houses with tin roofs and palm trees line
the street.
Jesse and Zee ride in the back of the open carriage. They
can't take their eyes off each other.
ZEE
I would never have imagined us in a
place like this.
JESSE
That's why I picked it. We can
start a whole new life down here.
ZEE
Are you going to be happy here, Mr.
James? Without all that excitement?
JESSE
I've got you. You keep me busy. I
figure we'll get over to the
hotel... get checked in, cleaned
up... then I'd like to do something
I've been thinking about for a long
time.
ZEE
Now wait a minute. There are
certain things that have to wait
until after the wedding.
Jesse leans forward to the DRIVER.
JESSE
Driver, change of plans. Take us to
the nearest church.
DRIVER
What religion?
JESSE
Whichever one has God in it,
that'll do fine.
The BELLS RING as Jesse and Zee walk out the front door arm
in arm.
The Pastor and his wife appear in the doorway,
waving. Jesse and Zee hop in a waiting carriage.
DISSOLVE TO:
A deserted Keys beach -- coconut palms and Australian
pines. Clear water like glass stretching off forever.
Jesse and Zee are having a picnic on the white sand. Both
are in the latest in beach attire. He's in a one-piece that
goes from his neck to his knees. Zee's in what is basically
a dress with long pantaloons.
Zee is reading. Jesse is stretched out on the sand.
ZEE
Hmm.
JESSE
"Hmm" what?
ZEE
(reading)
"But the life of the James Gang
wasn't all robbing and shooting and
killing, for these young Missouri
bucks had a taste for the ladies...
especially the handsome and
charismatic Jesse James."
Jesse sits up.
JESSE
I beg your pardon?
ZEE
(showing him the
cover)
"Blazing Guns of the West. True
Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime
in the hotel lobby.
JESSE
Let me see that.
ZEE
Oh, I'm not finished.
(reading)
"When he sauntered into a saloon,
his spurs jangling and his pockets
full of gold, the ladies flocked
around him like flies to a candied
apple."
(looking at him)
As I said. Hmm.
JESSE
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go
believing one of them silly dime
novels, would you?
ZEE
Jesse, have you ever noticed that
when you're trying to charm your way
out of trouble, your accent gets all
farm boy?
JESSE
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
ZEE
Stop it. This is just sad.
JESSE
Swimming. Swimming is good.
Jesse jumps up and OUT OF FRAME. A second later, he reaches
down and PULLS a chuckling Zee up out of the sand.
Jesse chases Zee out into the surf. They splash around
until the water gets shoulder-deep, then both submerge. They
reappear, locked in a kiss. CLOSE ON Zee's face as they
break the kiss and embrace. She's in heaven. She opens her
eyes, facing the beach. Something passes over her face.
ANGLE ON
the beach, where fifty Pinkerton detectives with rifles are
lined up like a firing squad.
BACK TO
Zee's face. She squeezes Jesse tighter.
ZEE
Don't turn around.
JESSE
What?
ZEE
If you don't see it, it's not
real...
Jesse turns around to see --
A familiar figure walking along the sand. When the figure
reaches the center of the line of detectives, he turns to
the couple and --
PINKERTON
Jesse James, you are under arrest!
Jesse takes one longing gaze at the open ocean. He heads
for shore.
DISSOLVE TO:
An establishing shot of the Florida fort being lashed by
rain.
Two guards are leading Jesse, who is in heavy arm irons,
toward a prison car at the end of a waiting train.
Pinkerton, Thaddeus Rains, and Parker walk up.
RAINS
This is him.
PARKER
I remember you.
JESSE
You're Parker. I remember you, too.
You killed my Ma.
Parker is set back by Jesse's voice. To cover his fear --
PARKER
How did you know?
RAINS
Not such a menace now, is he,
Pinkerton?
PINKERTON
If you feel that way, I could
always take off the irons.
Rains glares at Pinkerton, then turns back to Jesse.
RAINS
You stole thousands. You cost me
tens of millions of dollars, months
of lost construction. I wish I could
hang you every single morning for a
century.
Rains checks his Pocketwatch, spots Jesse eyeing it.
RAINS
(CONT'D)
You like that? Solid gold, my
father had it made when he started
this railroad. He gave it to me when
I took over, I'll give it to my son
when he runs this company, and he'll
give it to his son -- The right type
of men will always run this country,
Jesse James, and little men like you
will always suffer. You have stopped
nothing.
JESSE
Made you think twice about burning
folks' homes down now, didn't I?
Jesse winks.
With that Parker reaches back and SUCKER PUNCHES Jesse.
Rains gloats as Jesse gets his breath back.
RAINS
We'll speak again in Washington,
you insect.
JESSE
You're coming on the same train?
Rains involuntarily looks behind Jesse. Jesse cranes his
head and spots a CLUB CAR at the front of the train, several
cars away from his prison car. The other cars are packed
with Pinkerton detectives.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Well, tell you what. I'm going to
have to pay you a visit.
RAINS
Big words.
JESSE
It's a promise.
Everyone is a little shaken by the steel in Jesse's voice.
The guards DRAG JESSE OFF.
The prison train highballs through the wooded, rolling
hills. We see the engine, the coal car, a detective car,
then the private salon car, two more cars of guards, and
then the prison car.
Jesse pops open the door to his car. He's improvised a
gunbelt like his old one, holding six Colts. He's still
holding the chain from his restraints. Now that they're no
longer wrapped around Jesse, we see they're at least a few
yards long.
And Jesse JUMPS OFF THE ROOF and --
CLANK as the chains -- fastened to the roof -- go taut and
Jesse is at window level and he's FIRING AND FIRING into the
car!
Jesse is running along the side of the car, supported by
the chain! Still shooting, he reaches the end, KICKS UP and
is on the roof again.
ANGLE ON
one Detective, barely alive, stumbling through the door,
opening the door to the next
Jesse looks down and sees heavily armed Pinkertons coming
out of the doorway.
JESSE
Shit.
But there's no turning back and he jumps to the top of the
Jesse's running and the Pinkertons start SHOOTING THROUGH
the roof. Jesse miraculously is untouched, almost to the
CLUB CAR...
Jesse JUMPS onto the club car, but pulls up short as
detectives appear ahead of him. He turns to see other
detectives climbing up behind him. He's trapped.
BUT WE HEAR A LOW WHISTLE AND
The engine EXPLODES! Sparks fly as the twisted engine
GRINDS onto the tracks!
The momentum carries everyone off their feet! Some
detectives are torn from the train. Jesse slides across the
roof of the Club Car --
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON a smoking CANNON sitting on the tracks. WIDEN TO
REVEAL Frank and Cole on horseback shading their eyes. Zee
is daintily blowing out a fuse lighter.
FRANK
Nice shot.
ZEE
Thank you. Now go get my husband.
The two men start to gallop toward the train.
Jesse, Pinkerton, and the detectives look down the track
and see...
Frank and Cole riding toward them. From the woods ride
Comanche Tom and Bob Younger, folding into perfect
formation. The four THUNDER toward the train.
Frank draws a gun and FIRES.
TWO DOZEN RIDERS pour out of the woods, all firing at the
Pinkerton! The Pinkertons return fire, taking shelter in the
train cars as the riders strafe the train.
Jesse swings over the edge of the train, looks through the
window. Rains is gone. He turns and starts running back
along the top of the train.
Pinkerton, Rains and Parker tumble out of the door and run
for the woods.
Jesse LEAPS DOWN from the top of the train onto Pinkerton!
They wrestle, separate. Pinkerton stands, reaching for his
gunbelt.
Empty.
With almost a resigned sigh, he looks up. Jesse's pointing
the gun at Pinkerton's head.
PINKERTON
Do it.
Jesse FIRES.
ANGLE ON
Pinkerton, stunned to realize he's still alive. He turns to
see Parker, fall to the ground, his own gun half-drawn,
Jesse turns the gun on Rains.
JESSE
That was for my Ma. Now this is for
everybody else.
PINKERTON
He's too important, James.
They'll
set the army on you. You and your
wife.
Jesse stares at Rains, Rains stares back, the tension
building...Jesse's about to shoot...and says:
JESSE
That is a nice watch you got there.
Rains looks down at the fob, back up. The tension isn't
broken.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
I tell you what, I'll buy that
watch from you, for the fair market
price approved by the Department of
the Interior: one dollar.
Rains hesitates. Jesse thumbs the hammer back
JESSE
(CONT'D)
If I were you, I'd sell. After
this, the price goes...down.
Rains tosses the Watch to Jesse as Jesse simultaneously
FLIPS Rains a dollar coin with his free hand. Jesse holds up
the Watch.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Now every time you go to look at
this watch and it's not there,
you'll remember: You can be stopped.
Pass that down to your son, instead.
Jesse thumbs the hammer forwards, lowers the gun. Rains
falls to his knees, numb from the tension.
Frank rides up. Jesse empties Pinkerton's gun and hands it
to him. Pinkerton holds him for a second.
PINKERTON
(low)
Tennessee.
Jesse doesn't understand.
PINKERTON
(CONT'D)
The railroad has no business in
Tennessee. Therefore I have no
interest in the state of Tennessee.
JESSE
Thanks.
PINKERTON
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse
James. But chasing you takes up too
much of my time.
JESSE
Fair enough.
Zee RIDES UP. Jesse SWINGS UP onto her horse, and then they
RIDE OFF with Frank.
We PULL UP AND AWAY, centering on Pinkerton, Rains, and
revealing the smoking, burning wreckage of the train.
Most of the Gang is mounted. Frank, Cole and Bob are
standing there, watching.
ANGLE ON
Jesse and Zee riding up on one horse.
ZEE
You get arrested again, I'll kill
you.
JESSE
Yes ma'am.
ZEE
I can't believe I had to blow up a
train for you.
JESSE
You are a hell of a woman.
ZEE
Don't swear.
JESSE
Yes ma'am.
They reach the Gang. Jesse SWINGS OFF his horse, gets one
of Cole's BEAR HUGS.
COLE
Missed you, cousin.
JESSE
Missed you too, cousin.
Jesse notices Cole is oddly emotional, but can't quite
figure out what's going on.
COLE
You know, you gettin' caught, right
after leaving us, some people
thought --
JESSE
Pff. All we been through, the
thought never crossed my mind.
The two clasp hands.
BOB
Things changed when you quit the
gang. For example, I'm now the one
who says "Let's ride."
COLE
He's not bad at it.
BOB
It's tougher than it looks.
JESSE
Where'd you get all these riders?
COLE
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out
your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
BOB
So what's the plan?
Jesse looks at Zerelda and Frank.
JESSE
I think my wife and I might go down
Tennessee way, buy a farm.
(pause)
Goodbye, boys.
The Youngers smile sadly, but NOD. As the Younger brothers
SADDLE UP, Comanche Tom leans down from the saddle and
shakes Jesse's hand.
COMANCHE TOM
You stay out of trouble, Jesse.
Nobody has as much luck as you used
up today.
ANGLE ON
Jesse getting back on his horse with Zee. Frank stands
there and watches them.
FRANK
I'll meet you down there in a few
weeks.
JESSE
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate
the distraction back there.
FRANK
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Jesse and Frank grin.
BOB
Let's ride!
Jesse flips the reins and he and Zee RIDE OFF, the GANG
with the Youngers RIDES OFF in the opposite direction.
Frank watches them ride away. WE HEAR faintly:
ZEE
Tennessee?
JESSE
I'll explain on the way.
Then it's Frank alone on the hill. WE CIRCLE around behind
him, come around, see he's AGED a little, CIRCLE AGAIN and
now he's AGED MORE, we come around one more time and...
...we COMPLETE THE CIRCLE and see young Frank James is now
an older FRANK JAMES. Still lean, a few wrinkles, a little
grey in the hair, dressed in expensive turn-of-the-century
western clothes. A young man who looks remarkably like
Jesse, JIMMY JAMES, 16 years old, is waiting patiently. The
two are looking down on the town of Liberty, Missouri, which
is now swollen five sizes larger. The Wild West is
disappearing under roads and telegraph wire.
JIMMY
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
FRANK
Yeah, Jimmy?
JIMMY
(genially chiding)
...every time you tell that story,
you stop there. That's not how it
ended. I was five when my dad got
shot.
FRANK
I know. But that's how it should
have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding
off into a new life, growing old
together, happy.
They start to walk back to the edge of town.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
Allow a man his version of the
past. When you get to be my age,
you've got enough painful memories,
you're allowed to soften a few of
the edges up.
JIMMY
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
FRANK
(chuckling)
That he was.
JIMMY
They're making him a hero now.
FRANK
Saved a lot of folk from the
railroad.
JIMMY
But he killed a lot of men, too.
FRANK
Can't argue that.
JIMMY
So what was he?
FRANK
I think... he was just a real
interestin' fella to have around.
Frank chuckles again at the memories, claps his hand on
Jimmy's shoulder.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
Come on, your Ma's probably holding
dinner for us. Once saw the woman
blow up a train, don't want to tick
her off...
Jimmy grins and the pair walk down the hill. We stay ON
THEIR BACKS as they continue talking.
JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.)
Uncle Frank?
FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.)
Yeah Jimmy?
JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.)
How much of that story is true?
FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.)
Everything but the boring parts.
