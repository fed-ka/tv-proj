      A dark shadowy vault containing a number of ancient tombs, 
      graced with ornately carved sculptures of their noble 
      occupants. A shadow falls across a black tomb - carved with 
    the outline of a mighty Knight in full armour, a sword lain 
      across his body like a cross. Suddenly, in the darkness we 
    see a woman, it s NIMUEH...

    She stands over the tomb and runs her hands over it, 
      whispering a terrifying spell.  

                                  NIMUEH
                    Gehyreme, wan cniht, awac! 

    As she utters the words her eyes burn into the stone casing. 
      Suddenly, a crack rips across the lid.

                                  NIMUEH

      CRASH! A hand clad in a black gauntlet smashes through the 
    top of the tomb and reaches out towards the witch... A dark 
      smile crosses her face...

                                                                            CUT TO:



      ARTHUR is knelt on an elaborately decorated woolsack before 
      UTHER. The Prince is dressed in ceremonial robes, MERLIN 
      stands proudly to one side. A STEWARD holds a cushion 
      carrying a coronet and a gold rod. It s the Prince s 
      investiture. All around there are DIGNITARIESpresent, 
      including GAIUS and MORGANA. UTHER speaks quietly but 
      formally to his son as he takes the rod and places it in 
      ARTHUR s hand...

                    Do you promise to exercise mercy 
                    and justice in your deeds and

                    protection of this kingdom and it s 
                    peoples. 

      They both smile. UTHER places the crown upon his son s head, 
    he turns, addressing the room as well as ARTHUR, following 
    the words of the ceremony.

                                  UTHER

      MERLIN grins proudly to one side, next to him stands GWEN.

                    You re proud of him really. Even

      GWEN laughs as ARTHUR soaks up the adulation. 

    But the moment is interrupted by the sound of smashing glass. 
      UTHER and ARTHUR turn to see...

      A KNIGHT on horseback rides an armouredsteed at full tilt 
      through the giant windows at the far end of the Great Hall. 

      Glass showers over the assembled GUESTS as they scramble out 
    of the way. His face is masked beneath his visor. His armour
    is an ominous black. He advances slowly, inexorably toward 
      UTHER... 

                                  UTHER
                    What in the Devil s name...?

      Panicked GUESTS get out of the way as the horseman continues 
    his relentless path toward the King...The Knights put their 
      hands to their swords in expectation of trouble. 

    The BLACK KNIGHT stops before UTHER and ARTHUR and throws 
      down a huge metal gauntlet. A stunned UTHER stares at it...

      ARTHUR reacts, goes to pick up the gauntlet but before he 
      reaches it, a young knight, SIR OWAIN, swoops and plucks the 
      glove from the ground and holds it proudly aloft.

                                  OWAIN
                    I, Sir Owain, accept your 
                    challenge.

      A beat. The BLACK KNIGHT continues to focus on UTHER and 
      ARTHUR, his expression is inhuman, unblinking, finally he 
      turns toward SIR OWAIN.

                    Single combat. Noon tomorrow. To 
                    the death.

      UTHER s white as a sheet, fixated by the crest on the 
      KNIGHT s helmet. GAIUS too stares intently at the KNIGHT, a 
      flicker of recognition in his eyes.

      GAIUS is preparing some routine remedies at his workbench. 
      MERLIN watches, but his thoughts are still consumed by the 
      evening s events.

                                  MERLIN
                    So you don t think he s from round 
                    here?

                                  GAIUS
                    That would seem likely.

                                  MERLIN
                    But then what s he doing here? 

      GAIUS turns to face him.

                                  GAIUS
                    Merlin, your faith in my all-seeing 
                    knowledge is both touching and

                    Okay, I m going.

    He goes to his room. GAIUS continues with his preparations. A 
      second later MERLIN pops out of his room again.

      troubled by the night s events than he s letting on.

    She is cautiously standing a few steps back from the window,

      ARTHUR too stands at the window looking at the BLACK KNIGHT, 
    he looks concerned.  There s a knock at the door. MORGANA 
      enters.

                                  MORGANA
                    So fight in his place. Much as it

                                  GAIUS
                    But how do you explain ...?

                    Dead men do not return.  Is that 
                    all?

      GAIUS bows and leaves.  UTHER sits alone in the empty room. 
      Despite his denial, UTHER is a troubled man.

                                                                            CUT TO:



    The slow beat of a distant drum.  OWAIN is standing in the 
      centre of the room. In contrast to the Black Knight, he 
      fidgets about as MERLIN helps him on with his armour.In 
      daylight he looks even more of a boy than he did the previous 
      night. ARTHUR tries to focus him.

                    Owain, you ve never fought in 
                    mortal combat before, it s 
                    different... it s not like the 
                    training I ve given you.      MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   9.

                            a buckle)
                    Yeah, I know...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Listen to me. The problem is we ve 
                    never seen him fight. You have to 
                    quickly get the measure of him. 

                                  OWAIN
                          (bright, innocent)
                    But I have the same advantage - 
                    he s never seen mefight.

                          (unconvinced)
                    True.

                                  OWAIN
                    You ve watched me.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Yes... 

                                  OWAIN
                    And?

                                  ARTHUR
                    And I know no one braver.

      OWAIN smiles at MERLIN. MERLIN throws a glance at ARTHUR.  He 
    can sense his concern.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Remember, all it takes to kill a 
                    man is one well aimed blow.  

      OWAIN thrusts his sword at an imaginary target. In a few 
      years he will make a good Knight, but he s still very much a 
      colt, a lightweight.

      GWEN enters. OWAIN smiles.

                    The Lady Morgana asked me to give 
                    you this token.

    She holds up a ribbon. OWAIN is slightly overwhelmed, he 
      looks at ARTHUR.

                                  GWEN
                    She wishes you to wear it for luck.

                                  OWAIN
                    You can thank her and tell her I 
                    shall wear it with pride, but...

      Suddenly, the door they came through slams closed and the

                    We re too late... I think someone 
                    has already broken out.

    We see the top of the tomb has been smashed open with great 
      force. Debris is lying across the floor...

      GAIUS bends down to peer inside, the inside of the tomb is 
      empty.

                                  MERLIN
                    You were right. 

                                  GAIUS
                    I wish I wasn t.

                                  MERLIN
                    If Arthur fights that thing, he ll 
                    die.

                                  GAIUS
                    He is Camelot s greatest warrior. 
                    If anyone can defeat it, he can.

                                  MERLIN
                    But you said yourself, no mortal 
                    weapon can kill it. Which means we 
                    have to find a way to defeat the 
                    wraith ourselves. 

                                  GAIUS
                    How do you propose to do that?

    He runs up the stairs to his room...

                                  MERLIN
                    If no mortal sword will kill it...

    He disappears into him room and comes back with his magic 
      book.

                                  MERLIN
                    Then I will have to. With mortal 
                    magic. 

                                  GAIUS
                    Merlin, it s too dangerous...

                                  MERLIN

      GAIUS watches him turning the pages and quietly leaves the 
      room. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A troubled UTHER is pacing the room when GAIUS enters. UTHER 
      stops and stares at him in trepidation, anticipating bad 
      news.

                                  GAIUS
                    Good evening, Sire.

                                  GAIUS
                    There is something of great urgency 
                    I must discuss with you.

                                  UTHER
                    Then spit it out, man.

      UTHER face ices over.

                                  GAIUS
                    I believe he has been conjured from 
                    the dead. 

      UTHER is quiet for a moment, then resumes his pacing, his 
      mind whirring.

                                  UTHER
                    How is this possible?

                                  GAIUS
                    I believe he is a wraith.

                                  UTHER
                    A spirit?

                          (gently)
                    Nevertheless it was you he blamed. 

      GAIUS hesitates. He knows he must tread carefully.

                                  GAIUS
                    You cannot allow Arthur to fight. 
                    No weapon forged by man can kill a 
                    wraith. It will stop at nothing 
                    until it has accomplished what it 
                    came for. Arthur cannot win, he 
                    will die.

                                  UTHER
                    He will not listen to me.

                                  GAIUS
                    Then you must tell him who the 
                    knight is...

                                  UTHER
                    No.

                                  GAIUS
                    You cannot hide the truth forever.

                          (angered)
                    I am the King!  You will not bid me 
                    what to do!

                          (calm)
                    That is your choice, sire; you tell 
                    him or let him go to his death.

                                  UTHER
                          (threatening)
                    No one but you and I will ever know 
                    that secret.

                                  GAIUS
                    The boy is of age, he should know.

                                  UTHER
                    Never.  
                          (hedraws a dagger)
                    You made an oath, and I warn you 
                    not to break it. 

      They two men stand face to face for a moment. GAIUS is first 
    to drop.

                    Leave me.

      GAIUS leaves the room. UTHER is clearly shaken by what he s 
      just heard. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



    The dead of night. The BLACK KNIGHT stands impassive, framed 
      against the towers of Camelot. 

      MERLIN emerges from the shadows. Keeping to the shadow of the 
      wall he slips along until the KNIGHT is in sight. The BLACK 
      KNIGHT remains impassive, apparently oblivious to MERLIN s 
      presence. 

      MERLIN holds his hand out in front of himself and starts to 
      incant a spell.

      MERLIN s eyes flash and a flame appears from nowhere. The 
      fire races across the ground, encircles the knight and 
      engulfs him in a ball of flames.  

      MERLIN waits, it looks like his magic has worked. But when 
    the flames die down the BLACK KNIGHT is still standing, 
      completely impassive.

      MERLIN stares at him in complete astonishment.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      ARTHUR is preparing for the fight, rehearsing moves with his 
      sword in slow motion, replaying and adjusting the angle of 
    his wrist or the arc of each swing.  He s a coiled spring, as 
      anxious as we ve seen him.  MERLIN comes rushing in, frantic. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Merlin... you know that

                    You have to pull out!  

      ARTHUR stops what he s doing and turns to look at him.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Why does everybody think that?

                                  MERLIN

                    one wants you to die for some 
                    stupid challenge.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I am not a coward.

                                  MERLIN
                    I know that.  I ve stood there and 
                    watched you overcome every fear

                    But you are more than that ... you 
                    are not merely a warrior, you are a 
                    prince.  A future king. You have 
                    proved your courage, but you must 
                    prove your wisdom ...

                    stands there in total silence.

    He throws the door open for MERLIN.

      UTHER sits in the empty council chamber, a haunted figure.  
      There s a rattle at the window, he reacts, looks toward the 
      sound, clearly expecting the wraith to appear at any 
      moment...

    He turns back and is shocked to see someone standing in his 
      room: NIMUEH.  He stares at her fearfully, as if he s seen a

                                  NIMUEH
                    I did as you asked! I used the 
                    skills you so despise to give your 
                    barren wife the son you craved. 

                                  UTHER
                    Never speak of her that way! My 
                    wife was worth a thousand of you. 
                    And you took her from me.

                    She died giving birth to your son!  
                    It was not my choice. That is the 
                    law of magic.  To create a life

                    No, you re wrong. If I had foreseen 
                    her death, and the terrible 
                      retribution you would seek... I 
                    would never have granted your wish.

    The room is dark. MERLIN is looking through a book, 
      dissatisfied with what he s found.  He begins searching the 
      shelves again, he hears a noise, stops and listens. He waits, 
    he clearly shouldn t be there. He starts rummaging again... 

    He knocks a book over, bends to pick it up and sees a pair of 
      feet beside him. His eyes dart upward to see...

      GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH glaring at him.

                                  MERLIN
                    D youknow why I m here?

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    It may surprise you, Merlin, but my 
                    knowledge of your life is not 
                    universal.

                                  MERLIN
                    It s to do with Arthur, his life is 
                    in danger.  He will die unless I 
                    can make a weapon that can kill the 
                    dead. 

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    So what do you come to ask of me?

      MERLIN bends down on one knee, places the wrapped sword on 
    the ground and unrolls it ...  

    We see the finished sword for the first time.  Even in its 
      raw, un-enchantedstate it has a simple beauty. 

      MERLIN reaches down to pick it up, but it disappears before 
    his eyes ...  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   34.


      Instinctively, he looks down into the cavern and sees the 
      sword hovering in the air before the GREAT DRAGON.

                                  MERLIN
                    Will you burnish it to save Arthur?

    The GREAT DRAGON considers this ...


                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    That is your destiny, young 
                    warlock, not mine. 

                                  MERLIN
                    But if Arthur fights the wraith and 
                    dies Camelot will have no heir. I 
                    will have no destiny.

    The DRAGON considers this.

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    A weapon forged with my assistance 
                    will have great power. 

                                  MERLIN
                    I know...

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                          (interrupting him)
                    You do not know. You can only 
                    guess. You have not seen what I 
                    have seen. If you had perhaps you 
                    would not ask this of me.

                                  MERLIN
                    What do you mean?

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    In the wrong hands this sword could 
                    do great evil. It must be wielded 
                    by Arthur and him alone.

                                  MERLIN
                      I understand.

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    You must do more than understand. 
                    You must promise.

      MERLIN nods.

                                  MERLIN
                    I promise.

    The GREAT DRAGON exhales an almighty blast of fire ... The 
      sword is temporarily lost within the inferno.  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   35.


      When the flames recede we see the shining sword - the light 
      flashes off it, almost blinding MERLIN.  He turns his head 
      away ...

    And when he looks up again, he sees the sword has been 
      returned to him.  It is lying on the cloth blanket.  MERLIN 
    is captivated - it has a simple but majestic presence.  

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    Heed my words ...

      MERLIN stops and turns to the GREAT DRAGON ...

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    The sword was forged for Arthur and 
                    him alone.

      NIGHT 3. FR.

      UTHER standing at the window, looking out at...

    The ominous unyielding figure of the BLACK KNIGHT standing 
      before the gates of Camelot.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      ARTHUR is also standing at his window looking out through the 
      curtains, he s unable to sleep.  He hears GAIUS s voice 
      outside his door.

                                  GAIUS (O.S.)
                    I ve brought you something that 
                    might help you sleep.

      GAIUS enters carrying a small phial.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I m fine.  I don t need it

                                  GAIUS
                          (he removes the cap from 
                          the phial)
                    Here.  It ll relax you, it ll take 
                    the edge off your nerves.

      ARTHUR finally concedes and downs the liquid with a grimace.

                    Why don t you sit down for a 
                    moment?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Mind you... if you forget the 
                    taste... the effects are...

    He plonkshimself down on his bed, already succumbing to the 
      sedation...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Quite enjoyable.

                    Lie back.  

      ARTHUR rests his head on his pillow.

                                  GAIUS
                    How reyou feeling?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Mmm...

      GAIUS looks at ARTHUR a moment, waiting for him to drift off.  
      Satisfied that ARTHUR s asleep, he turns and walks quietly to 
    the door. He gently removes the key from the doorlock....

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MORGANA is at her dressing table.  She looks sick, she hasn t 
      slept.  GWEN enters with her breakfast and lays it before 
      her.

                    I m not hungry.

                    I can t.

    We hear the drum beat start, MORGANA looks to the window.

                          (shrugs - lifeless)

                    Arthur will win. He will live to be

                    Merlin is looking out for him. He 
                    won t let him die.

      MORGANA smiles at GWEN s sweet faith in Merlin but obviously 
      doesn t share it.

    The drum beats continue while a drugged ARTHUR sleeps, 
      oblivious to the preparations for the fight that are going on 
      outside.  

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A windowless room somewhere in the depths of the castle. The 
      slow beat of the familiar drum continues outside as MERLIN 
      readies Arthur's armour and finally unwraps the new sword 
      from its blanket.  It shimmers in the early morning light.  
    He holds it in his hand.  Suddenly, the door opens and MERLIN 
      turns expecting to see ARTHUR, instead it s UTHER that 
      enters.

                                  UTHER
                    That s a fine blade. 

                                  MERLIN
                    It s for Arthur.

                                  UTHER
                    He won t be needing it today.

      MERLIN looks confused.

                          (realising that the sword 
                          is for Arthur only)
                    But, Sire...

                                  UTHER
                    Prepare me for battle.

                                  MERLIN
                    But Arthur should be the one...

                                  UTHER
                    No, the grievance is with me, the 
                    fight is mine.

                                  MERLIN
                    I do not have your armour.

      UTHER points to some armourplaced nearby.

                                  UTHER
                    This will do.  It s likely to make 
                    little difference.

      MERLIN straps on a breast plate.  UTHER seems in a trance - 
      he s a man on death row, coming to terms with his fate. 

                                  MERLIN
                    I ll get you your sword.

                                  UTHER
                    This one will be fine.

      MERLIN looks horrified.

                                  MERLIN
                    No, Sire... You don t understand... 
                    that one was made specifically for 
                    Arthur.

      UTHER examines it.  The sword appears to dazzle almost 
      unnaturally.

                                  UTHER
                    Who made it?

                                  MERLIN
                    Uh... Tom the Blacksmith.

                                  UTHER
                    It s worthy of a King.  

                                  MERLIN
                    You d be better off with a sword 
                    you trusted.

      UTHER slowly wields the sword...  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   39.


                                  UTHER
                    It has an almost perfect balance... 
                    Tom is not the Royal Swordsmith. 
                    I m surprised Arthur went to him.

                                  MERLIN
                    It was me.  

      UTHER looks at him.

                          (he shrugs)
                    I felt he needed a better sword.

                                  UTHER
                          (surprised - looking at 
                          Merlin anew)
                    You do show him incredible loyalty.

                                  MERLIN
                    It s my job, Sire.

                                  UTHER
                    But you go beyond the line duty.

                                  MERLIN
                    Well... you could say there is a 
                    bond between us.

                          (a beat)
                    Look after him, will you.

    He sets off for battle, taking the sword with him.

                                  GAIUS
                    Yes, it was remarkable ...

    He eyes the sword on the nearby table.

                                  GAIUS
                    Was that a new sword?

                    May I have a look?

      GAIUS examines the blade, looking at the runes.

                                  UTHER
                    I was interested in those markings.

                                  UTHER
                    Merlin gave it me.  It was forged 
                    for Arthur.

      GAIUS reacts, but the conversation is interrupted by ARTHUR s 
      entrance.  The prince doesn t look happy.

                                  GAIUS
                          (to Uther as her he 
                            withdraws from the room)
                    That should heal pretty quickly.  
                    I ll redress it tomorrow.

                                  UTHER
                    Thank you, Gaius.  Thank you for 
                      everything.

      GAIUS smiles and is gone.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (his anger surfacing)
                    You had Gaius drug me ... Iwas 
                    meant to fight him.

                                  UTHER
                    No ... You weren t.

                                  ARTHUR
                    The Knight s code ...

                                  UTHER
                            (passionate)
                    Be damned!  I believed you would 
                    die. I could not take that risk.  
                    You are too precious to me.  You 
                    are worth more to me than anything 
                    I know ... more than this entire 
                    Kingdom ... more than my own life. 

      ARTHUR is taken aback, it is the first time he has seen his 
      father like this. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    I ve always thought ... well ...

                                  UTHER
                    What?

                                  ARTHUR
                    That ... I was a disappointment to 
                    you.

                                  UTHER
                    That is my fault, not yours ... You 
                    are my only son.
                          (a smile)
                    And I would not wish for another.  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   44.


      ARTHUR is unsure how to react.

                                  ARTHUR
                    What I saw ... You fought pretty 
                    well.

                                  UTHER
                    Thank you.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (preparing to head off)
                    You should join us for training 
                    sometime.  Looked like you needed 
                    some help on your footwork.  

                                  UTHER
                    I ll give you some footwork.
                          (offering to land a kick)

      ARTHUR grins and moves swiftly away.  UTHER smiles, pleased 
      he s had this opportunity with his son. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      GAIUS and MERLIN are having supper.  GAIUS looks at MERLIN.  
      MERLIN tries to ignore him.

                                  GAIUS
                    You know why I m looking at you.

                                  MERLIN
                    No.

                                  GAIUS
                    Uther told me you gave him that 
                    sword today.

      MERLIN says nothing.

                                  GAIUS
                    It must be a sword of very great 
                    power to slay the dead. 
                          (a beat)
                    Did you enchant it?

                                  MERLIN
                    No... I didn t.

                                  GAIUS
                    Who did then?

      GAIUS gives him a look.  

                                  GAIUS
                    Shame, it saved the King s life,  
                    I d have been proud of you.  

                                  MERLIN
                    Well ... 

                                  GAIUS
                    Never mind.

      They share a look, MERLIN smiles.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      MERLIN is asleep.  The room rumbles with the sound of the 
      GREAT DRAGON s voice...

                                  GREAT DRAGON (V.O.)
                          (a hint of indignation in 
                          his tone)
                    Merlin! Merlin!

      MERLIN wakes and listens... he knows he s in trouble.  He 
      swings his legs out of bed and thinks for a moment, what is 
    he going to say?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      MERLIN returns the well worn route to the GREAT DRAGON, a 
      sense of dread.  

                                                                            CUT TO:



    He reaches the stone orifice and sees the GREAT DRAGON s face 
      loom toward it.  The GREAT DRAGON stares at him...

                                  GREAT DRAGON

                    I m sorry. Uther just took the

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    You have betrayed me. 

                                  MERLIN
                    He s the King. I couldn t stop him. 

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    You counted the promise you made to 
                    me for nothing. That is something 
                    you will regret.   

                                  MERLIN
                    I couldn t let him die...

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    You could. But yet you did not. And 
                    now he has the sword you begged 
                    from me. 

                                  MERLIN
                    I ll get it back... 

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    The sword is in the world. It 
                    cannot be unmade. But now a curse 
                    will forever lie upon it. 

                                  MERLIN
                    What do you mean?

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    The sword forged by Arthur is now 
                    destined to be used against him. It 
                    will bring about his doom. 

                                  MERLIN
                    What do you mean? Is Arthur going 
                    to die?

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    Everything dies, warlock, it is 
                    only the manner of death that is in 
                    question. Your actions have made 
                    that choice for Arthur. What s done 
                    cannot be undone.

    The GREAT DRAGON turns and is gone.  A worried MERLIN stands 
      there a moment, taking in what he s heard.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      MERLIN stares at the blade, shining in the early morning 
      light. He takes it from it s rack and wraps it in a bundle.
