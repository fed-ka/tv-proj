Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the
space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies
in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.
The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until
THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.
The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks
over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold
their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.
ANOTHER RATTLE.
It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as
the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow
and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans
in and peers through the bamboo slats.
WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.
Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his
face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of
A SERRATED METAL BLADE
protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously
protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted
eyes and whispers his last, desperate word...
MIDDLE-AGED MAN
Run!
SMASH CUT TO:
2.
The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.
Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure
outrunning the hurtling vehicles.
A GECKO
skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as
Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag. The
walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality.
Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables.
HENRI
Taillights in five minutes. What
we can't carry --
DANIEL
-- we burn. I know the drill.
Henri's eyes scan the rear view, on constant vigil. The
speedometer never brushes past 60. Daniel has his head
against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod.
DANIEL (V.O.)
We are hiding from the Mogadorians.
A brutal race that wiped out our
entire planet, Lorien.
Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the
bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat
scab that has formed over the wound.
6.
DANIEL (V.O.)
I got the first scar when I was
eight. I woke up screaming. We
lived in Vermont. The second was
on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in
Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was
the third.
His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.
The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant
farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony.
DANIEL (V.O.)
Because of the spell our Elders
cast, the Mogs can only kill us in
order. That's the reason I've
survived this long. But our enemy
is relentless.
Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over,
his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a
soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won.
DANIEL (V.O.)
Now their hunt has turned to me. I
am number 4.
CUT TO:
Daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes.
Henri slides into the booth, all business.
HENRI
Florida's clear. I sent a letter
to the school and there's nothing
in the papers.
DANIEL
I didn't even get a chance to say
goodbye.
Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table.
7.
HENRI
New IDs.
Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name.
DANIEL
Just when I think you can't get any
less original, you lower the bar.
HENRI
I'm not interested in originality.
I'm interested in untraceable.
There are 335,321 John Smiths in
the United States.
(Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.)
John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away.
Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.
A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the
buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches.
They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen.
JOHN
It's been so long since the last
scar.
HENRI
You got lulled into a false sense
of security. That's my fault.
John struggles to keep his temper in check.
JOHN
I liked Florida. I liked having
friends. I liked feeling normal.
Henri's face softens with paternal compassion.
HENRI
I wish that you could have a normal
life -- but you can't.
Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
frustration.
JOHN
Then why fake it? Why not just go
hole up in the wilderness.
HENRI
That's exactly what Number 3 did.
8.
John looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on
his iPhone and hands it to John.
HENRI
It's from an African news site. A
man and his son went missing two
nights ago. The locals think they
were taken by strange beasts.
John understands the implication.
JOHN
Piken.
HENRI
The Mogadorians are natural-born
hunters. Blending in is our best
protection.
JOHN
So we just keep moving from town to
town?
HENRI
Until I say otherwise -- yes.
John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice
softens but never loses its intensity.
JOHN
I want to be from someplace, Henri.
HENRI
You are.
JOHN
Lorien's your home, I don't even
remember it.
John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.
HENRI
Like it or not, it's your home too.
You have a responsibility to those
who died.
Henri and John climb in.
JOHN
I want a say in where we live.
(off Henri's face)
You already picked it, didn't you?
9.
Henri REVS the ENGINE to life.
HENRI
Cheer up, you're going to be living
in Paradise.
CUT TO:
A frigid sheet of RAIN POUNDS the sign that's planted on the
side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop:
WELCOME TO PARADISE, OHIO. POP. 5,243
The silver SUV streaks past, its wipers working overtime. It
kicks up a spray as it speeds down Main Street. The dinky
storefronts are garishly decorated for Halloween.
Henri pulls up in front of a small house. It sits by itself,
surrounded by trees. Water sluices off the weather-worn
garage in the yard behind it. A WOMAN steps out of a minivan
to greet them.
JOHN
She looks even perkier than the
realtor in Florida.
A warm smile graces her round face and she's clutching a
fruit basket. For the record, she is called ANNIE.
HENRI
What's your name?
JOHN
John Smith.
HENRI
Where are you from, John?
JOHN
Arizona.
HENRI
Why did you move to Paradise?
JOHN
Because you're an asshole.
John waits for a reaction but doesn't get one...
10.
JOHN
Because my dad needs peace and
quiet to research his book.
Henri nods and smiles wryly.
HENRI
This was a lot easier when you were
12.
The front door swings open and Annie proudly escorts Henri
and John inside.
ANNIE
Here we are. Home sweet home.
They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need
of a makeover. A grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the
end of the hall. Annie remains relentlessly optimistic.
ANNIE
First impressions?
HENRI
It's perfect.
Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins
turning on the lights.
JOHN
That's one word for it.
Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie
reads the strained dynamic.
ANNIE
I feel your pain. I have a
daughter his age. Apparently, I
ruin her life on a daily basis.
John steps back in, holding a sun-faded poster featuring NFL
great Bernie Kosar.
JOHN
This guy was covering a hole in my
wall.
Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance.
ANNIE
I told the handyman to patch that
before you arrived. I'm so sorry.
11.
Henri is all charm, gently leads her to the front door.
HENRI
Don't you worry about it.
She nods, grateful.
ANNIE
We'll knock it off the rent. Keep
the poster, Bernie Kosar brings
good luck here in the Buckeye
State.
CUT TO:
Henri is busy setting up his computer station. John dumps
the box on the floor.
JOHN
That's the last of them. I'm
hitting the sack.
HENRI
I need a new photo first.
John crosses and stands against the wall.
HENRI
Say Paradise.
John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot.
The camera is cabled to one of the laptops.
TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital
grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial
structure.
Henri turns to another laptop.
HENRI
I've imputed the new search words:
Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key.
Sunset High School. You think of
any others?
JOHN
Yeah, this place sucks.
12.
Henri swivels to face him.
HENRI
If there's a story or picture of
you on the internet, this program
will find it. Our enemy doesn't
know who you are -- I want to keep
it that way.
John nods, knows he's being a jerk.
JOHN
Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we
were jet skiing.
Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door.
Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE.
SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes.
Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently
signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of
an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek
crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door...
... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat.
Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds
his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is
relieved to see Henri.
HENRI
I found our intruder -- he's a
little small for a Mogadorian.
At that moment,
A BEAGLE
slips between Henri's legs. It cocks its head, studies
John's face, then pads forward and licks his cheek.
The dog greedily laps a bowl of milk.
JOHN
He's starving, doesn't have any
collar or tags.
HENRI
Must have been dumped.
13.
JOHN
You know, another pair of eyes and
ears watching the house wouldn't be
a bad thing.
Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles
the dog's head.
HENRI
What are you going to call him?
JOHN
Since I need all the luck I can get
-- how about Bernie Kosar?
CUT TO:
John enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of
school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a
plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in
front of him.
JOHN
Wow. You outdid yourself. What's
up?
Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.
JOHN
I already have a backpack.
HENRI
This one has five days of rations,
spare clothes, cash and a handheld
GPS. Keep it with you at all
times.
JOHN
Henri, come on.
HENRI
Game's changed. You're in the
crosshairs now. You have to be
ready to leave at a moment's
notice. With or without me.
John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He
pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out
the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of
hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out.
It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.
14.
Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he
passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a
locker. He reaches for the combination lock when
A BACKPACK
viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the
checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne,
who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to
react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.
VOICE (O.S.)
Welcome to Paradise, irony not
included.
John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a
battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an
Army surplus jacket. This is SAM GOODE -- genius by birth,
slacker by choice. He nods after Mark.
SAM
His name's Mark Jayne.
Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's
three years into the best four
years of his life.
John begins retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps.
SAM
Do yourself a favor -- stay off his
radar.
JOHN
Didn't know I was on it.
SAM
You were talking to Sarah Harte.
JOHN
She was talking to me.
SAM
Mark and Sarah have been exclusive
since Freshmen year.
17.
John looks down the hall and sees Mark wrap his arm around
Sarah's shoulder.
SAM
If there's another guy in her
airspace, he shoots them down. You
got a warning shot.
John piles the books into his locker.
JOHN
Maybe I'll fire back next time.
SAM
Look, you're new, so let me tell
you how things work in this
misnamed backwater. Football
players are gods -- the rest of us
are mere mortals. If you want to
survive, keep your head down and
don't make waves.
JOHN
You sound like my dad.
SAM
Obviously a wise man.
(BEAT)
I'm Sam by the way.
Sam extends his hand. John doesn't take it.
JOHN
Thanks for the download.
As he SLAMS his locker shut...
CUT TO:
John emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage. Some
of his classmates are on the court, passing and dribbling.
COACH
Okay, half court, three on three.
Girls have this basket, boys have
that one.
CUT TO:
Two simultaneous games are in progress. John sits on the
sidelines waiting his turn. He avoids eye contact with Sarah
who is sitting in the shadow of the basket. However, he does
notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her.
COACH
New kid, you're up. Show me what
you've got.
John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his
way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A
blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball.
Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice.
THE SHOT
goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard
with such force that it
SHATTERS.
Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards
rain down. All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his
momentary lapse. TEENS HOOT. The Coach BLOWS his whistle.
COACH
Enough! Hit the showers.
(TO JOHN)
LeBron, grab a broom.
As the gym empties, John looks over and catches Sarah
watching him. OFF this silent exchange...
CUT TO:
THE INTRICATELY CARVED BOX
is clutched in Henri's hands. He heads down the hall and
stops in front of the grandfather clock. Its tarnished
pendulum sways. He unlocks the glass panel and slots the Box
out of sight behind the clock's brass face.
19.
Satisfied with the hiding place, he locks the front and takes
the key. When he turns back, he finds
BERNIE KOSAR.
The dog is studying him with his head cocked.
HENRI
Let's keep this our little secret.
OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes...
CUT TO:
John joins the line. He sees Sarah sitting by herself,
inspecting a photographic contact sheet. His view is blocked
by Sam. John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty.
SAM
First day here and you're already
destroying school property. So
much for not making waves.
John moves past him and grabs a tray. He's flushed and his
face is now hot and red.
JOHN
It was an accident.
SAM
I hear the real spectator sport was
Mark and Sarah's blowout.
John wipes his brow, distracted.
SAM
Dude, you okay?
JOHN
Fine.
At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, KEVIN, cut in front
of them. Annoyed, John taps Mark on the shoulder.
MARK
You got a problem?
JOHN
Line starts back there.
MARK
Football players get priority.
20.
JOHN
Where's that posted?
MARK
Unwritten rule.
(RE: SAM)
I'm surprised your boyfriend didn't
tell you.
Sam puts his hands up and backs away. Mark smirks at John.
MARK
If you don't know your place around
here, things can get rough.
John holds his ground.
JOHN
In that case, I guess I better ask
you where I should sit. I was
thinking about grabbing that chair
next to your girlfriend.
In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into
John's chest, knocking him to the floor.
MARK
You want to talk trash? Let's see
you back it up.
John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of
pain. He looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see
LIGHT
blooming from his palms! He quickly balls them into fists,
extinguishing the light from view.
MARK
Get up!
SILENCE has fallen. Still clenching his fists, John rises
and stumbles out into the hall. OFF Sarah's concern as she
watches him exit...
CUT TO:
Henri steps inside and sees the dog is BARKING at --
THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK.
A shaft of white light blooms from within. The shadow of the
swaying pendulum cuts across Henri's face. As he sprints for
the door...
CUT TO:
Disoriented, John staggers down the hall. Sam catches up.
SAM
Dude, hold up!
John leans against the wall, keeping his hands out of sight.
SAM
You look like crap. I'll get the
nurse.
But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction.
CUT TO:
Strips of negatives hang on drying lines. John bursts in and
SLAMS the door. He slips off his backpack, opens his hands.
TIGHT ON HIS EYES -- the brilliant light from his palms
shrinks his irises to pinpricks.
The luminescence is crisp, mercury-glass bright and grows
stronger every second. Suddenly, the door opens. John spins
in shock. A figure strides through the blinding glare,
gently takes his hands and folds them into fists.
IT'S HENRI.
John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face.
JOHN
Henri, what's happening to me?
22.
HENRI
Calm down. You're going to be
okay.
John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands.
JOHN
On what planet is this okay?
HENRI
Yours.
(BEAT)
I need to get you out of here.
John steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat.
His hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets. Henri
leads him quickly down the hall.
CUT TO:
John fearfully studies his hands which have returned to
normal, then looks over at Henri who seems oddly calm.
JOHN
Okay, start talking. What the
hell's going on?
HENRI
Your first Legacy is starting to
manifest.
JOHN
Legacy?
HENRI
An extraordinary ability. Yours is
called Lumen. They start a lot
sooner on Lorien. I was beginning
to fear yours would never emerge.
JOHN
You knew this was going to happen?
Why didn't you say anything?
HENRI
I didn't want to worry you. You
were already under enough pressure.
(SINCERE)
I'm sorry.
John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious.
23.
JOHN
What else have you been hiding from
me?
CUT TO:
The curtains are drawn. Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch
while John and Henri sit at the table, staring at the Box.
HENRI
This couldn't be opened until your
first Legacy appeared. Ready?
John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his
right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid.
John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the
petals fanned across the opposite side.
THE DISCS
momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John
and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box
miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across
the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections
that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami.
JOHN
Whoa.
PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold.
Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup,
creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric
symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his
neck -- the symbols are an exact match.
HENRI
Open it.
John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat
assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks.
They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty.
JOHN
What are they?
HENRI
Crystals from Lorien's core.
They'll guide us in your training.
John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away.
24.
HENRI
Place your hand over them.
John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut-
sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to
spin and project
A SWIRLING HOLOGRAPHIC GALAXY.
HENRI
Our solar system.
Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution
and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless.
HENRI
That's what Lorien looked like
thousands of years ago. We had all
the problems that Earth has today.
The planet was dying until our
people made a collective decision
to change and slowly Lorien began
to heal itself -- that's when the
Legacies started.
John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his
eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land
masses become a lush emerald green.
HENRI
Only a select few developed these
abilities. They became known as
the Garde.
JOHN
That's what I am?
HENRI
Like your parents and grandparents.
John considers this new information.
JOHN
The other children in the ship...
Henri finishes John's thought.
HENRI
They're Garde as well. Once you've
mastered your Legacies, we'll find
them and face the Mogadorians
together.
John looks at Henri, curious.
25.
JOHN
What Legacy do you have?
HENRI
I don't have any and never will.
I'm your Cepan -- a teacher. My
job is not just to protect you but
to train you.
(BEAT)
Give me your hand.
Henri takes one of John's hands and pulls a cigarette lighter
from his pocket. John flinches, unsure.
HENRI
Trust me.
Henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under John's
outstretched palm.
HENRI
You feel that?
Amazingly, the flame harmlessly licks the skin. But when
Henri moves the lighter further up John's arm --
JOHN
Ouch.
John jerks his hand away. Henri kills the flame, shrugs.
HENRI
When we're done, your entire body
will be shielded against fire.
John rubs his singed wrist.
HENRI
You'll get other Legacies too.
JOHN
Flying would be cool.
HENRI
You don't get to pick them off a
menu.
KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. As John spins to the door, the
shimmering galaxy fades and the crystal drops to the floor.
HENRI
Mogs don't knock.
26.
Henri steps to his computer bank and examines a laptop
featuring live feeds from a dozen surveillance cameras he's
installed around the property.
HENRI
It's a girl.
John looks over his shoulder and reacts with surprise.
Bernie Kosar waits expectantly as Henri pours Doggie Chow
into a bowl. John steps in.
HENRI
Everything okay?
JOHN
She was returning my backpack.
He dumps it by the door.
HENRI
I think you should stay home from
school for a couple of days.
JOHN
I'm fine.
HENRI
Just to be safe.
CUT TO:
John lies on his bed, staring at his luminescent palms,
conflicted by his emotions.
28.
Moonlight cuts across Bernie Kosar who is SNORING peacefully
at the end of the bed. John tosses and turns. He finally
sits up, unable to sleep.
Nursing a mug of black coffee, Henri diligently scans the
laptop screens. He's clearly never gone to bed. He looks up
as John enters wearing track gear.
JOHN
I'm going for a run.
Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly.
JOHN
Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up.
CUT TO:
START MONTAGE:
Sam is at his locker. He glances over at John's, hoping
he'll show. Disappointed, he joins the crisscrossing throng.
CUT TO:
John practices turning his Lumen Legacy off and on.
Henri watches as John's palms glow. 
John focuses intently,
causing them to flare with sudden brilliance. Momentarily
blinded, John jerks back and topples off his chair.
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON ONE OF THE GLOVES. It's now fingerless and on
John's hand. He weaves through the preclass crowd and is
about to head into the chemistry lab when he sees
30.
SARAH
disappearing into a room at the end. He's torn, then makes a
decision and does something he shouldn't -- he strides down
the hall after her.
END MONTAGE.
Sarah is alone, tacking photographs to a large board that's
lying flat on the carpet. She hears the door CLICK, turns
and coolly regards John.
SARAH
I think you have the wrong room.
She rises, walks past him and begins searching the photos
scattered on the layout table in the middle of the space.
JOHN
Wanted to apologize.
SARAH
Does the apology come with an
explanation?
He turns to go, has his hand on the door when --
SARAH
Wait.
He looks back. Her face softens.
SARAH
How about we delete Monday and
start over?
She steps forward and extends her hand.
SARAH
I'm Sarah.
JOHN
John.
TIGHT ON THEIR HANDS as they shake. She checks out his
fingerless gloves, amused.
SARAH
Nice gloves.
She crosses to the board, reaches down to lift it when John
steps behind her.
31.
He effortlessly picks it up and hooks it onto the wall. They
stand back. John stares at the collage of high school images
that captures a life he'll never know.
JOHN
You know all these people?
She nods.
SARAH
Curse of a small town. I've been
around them my whole life.
(pointing to photo)
Kim Thomas. She peed in her bed at
a sleepover when we were seven.
(POINTING)
Neil Bailey. President of the
Debate Club. Plays five
instruments. Doesn't know he's gay
yet.
(POINTING)
Mrs. Ross. AP English. She's been
here so long, she taught my mom and
my four brothers. I'm the baby of
the family in case you were
wondering.
Her curious eyes scour his face.
SARAH
So what's your story?
JOHN
Not very interesting.
SARAH
Determined to keep the mystery
alive, aren't you?
His finger arrows in on a photograph of Sarah. It's a candid
and she's taking a shot with her trademark Nikon.
JOHN
You first.
SARAH
Okay. Recovering cheerleader.
Wannabe vegetarian but I still love
burgers. Dreams of being a
photojournalist.
(BEAT)
I've never actually admitted that
last one to anybody before.
32.
JOHN
Your secret's safe with me.
She studies him, sensing a kindred spirit.
SARAH
You ever feel you don't belong in
your own life?
JOHN
Every single day.
SARAH
Wow. That almost sounded like a
straight answer.
They look at each other. There's a charged silence. The
moment is broken when --
MARK (O.S.)
What's he doing in here?
John and Sarah spin to find Mark. Sarah is flustered.
SARAH
I thought you were on two-a-days.
MARK
Coach wants me to rest my arm
before the scouts come. You didn't
answer my question?
SARAH
John was helping me move some
boards.
John turns to Sarah.
JOHN
I'm going to take off.
Mark doesn't take his eyes off John and blocks his way.
MARK
Seriously, Sarah, what's up with
this guy?
SARAH
I don't have time for this, Mark.
MARK
But you had time to go to his house
the other night.
Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission.
33.
SARAH
You were following me?
MARK
Just trying to figure out what's
going on with you.
Sarah's shock turns to anger.
SARAH
You've crossed so many lines I
can't even speak to you right now.
She hustles out of the room. Mark glares at John.
MARK
This isn't over.
OFF John, unmoved by the threat...
CUT TO:
A drawer flies across THE FRAME. The place has been totally
trashed. Floorboards have been ripped up. Sofas shredded.
Nothing has been spared. CAMERA DRIFTS OVER the debris to...
The mattress has been dissected and its guts lie scattered.
A TEEN GIRL.
kneels in front of John's old desk searching the drawers.
She wears a biker jacket, combat boots and has a striking
don't-fuck-with-me face. Frustrated in her search, she
flings the desk against the wall. It splinters on impact.
TIGHT ON THE STOVE -- a hand twists on the burners. Raw gas
HISSES. The Teen Girl makes one final scan, then heads for
the door.
Sam catches John at the lockers.
SAM
Nice freakout the other day.
JOHN
Wasn't feeling well.
They twist their combination locks. Sam swings open his
door, there's a HISSING POP and
A RED INK PACK EXPLODES.
It's the kind banks use to foil heists. In a shocking
instant, Sam and the contents of his locker are splattered.
It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray.
JOHN
has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the
ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray misses his
face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER
echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse.
TIGHT ON John's hands as he balls them and an angry glow
flickers through his gloves.
MARK
(to John, taunting)
Told you it wasn't over.
Behind them, Sam's laid-back persona cracks. He frantically
clears his locker, looking for something. He finally pulls
out a photo which drips with ink, reels at the jocks.
SAM
Assholes.
John looks back at Sam. Mark seizes his chance and launches
a sucker-punch at John. But John sees it out of the corner
of his eye and in a blur of motion whips up his hand and
35.
CATCHES MARK'S FIST.
John squeezes it vice-tight. Mark grimaces in agony. His
buddies back into the CROWD OF TEENS that has gathered. John
leans in close.
JOHN
That sensation you're feeling --
remember it.
With a quick push, John shoves Mark back against the lockers.
Mark DENTS a door and slides to the floor, his eyes flaring
with lacerated pride.
JOHN
Show's over.
The crowd disperses. Mark gets to his feet and exits with
his friends, but shoots John one final wounded glare...
CUT TO:
Red, ink-stained water Hitchcocks down the drain. John
wrings out his black T-shirt. He sees Sam's reflection in
the mirror. Sam puts some clothes on the bench.
SAM
I raided lost and found.
He holds up a puke-green sweater decorated with red snowmen.
John turns back to the sink.
SAM
I know. Nobody loses anything
cool.
He sits and begins to change.
SAM
Dude, the way you thrashed Mark
back there. Awesome move.
John acknowledges that with a nod. Whip-dries his shirt.
Sam plucks up the photo. The ink is now dried and cracked.
JOHN
Who's in the picture?
Sam stares at it, nostalgic.
SAM
My dad. My real dad. I took it
the summer before he split.
(MORE)
36.
SAM (CONT'D)
He dragged me and my mom all over
the Yucatan. He was looking for
evidence of ancient astronauts.
All I got was Montezuma's Revenge.
JOHN
(DEADPAN)
Sounds like a fun vacation.
SAM
I know. Insane. He called himself
an anthropologist even though he
only made it through one semester
of college.
He rises and tosses the ruined picture into the trash.
SAM
Always thought he'd come back one
day -- who was I kidding. The
guy's a joke.
As the BELL RINGS...
CUT TO:
John climbs in.
HENRI
Wasn't that your friend from the
other night?
JOHN
Her name's Sarah.
(ANNOYED)
I didn't ask for a ride home.
HENRI
Principal called. Said there was
an incident.
38.
John stares out the window, guilty.
JOHN
A guy was messing with me. I took
care of it. Problem solved.
HENRI
You're stronger and faster because
of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't
use that advantage to settle petty
scores.
JOHN
It was no big deal. Don't blow it
out of proportion.
HENRI
You can't risk everything over
wounded pride.
JOHN
I wasn't looking for a fight. It
just happened. Get off my back.
Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it.
ANGLE ON PRINTOUT: It's from the Florida Keynoter website
and features a photo of the charred stilt house.
John's gut churns as he stares at the image.
HENRI
Article says it was arson.
JOHN
We were clean. There's no way the
Mogs can track us here.
Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off.
HENRI
They can track us anywhere. I
think it's time you saw what you're
really up against.
CUT TO:
Sunlight razors across workbenches cluttered with rusty
tools. Henri and John stand in the middle of the space.
THE BOX
39.
is open on the floor between them. John lifts his hand and
holds it over the crystals.
ONE RISES.
It's white and as thick as two fingers. It floats in front
of John's face. He tentatively reaches out. When he grips
it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally WIPING OUT THE
FRAME and transporting him into
A VISCERAL MEMORY.
A statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore,
towers in the middle of the chamber. His noble face is
illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight.
FOOTSTEPS ECHO!
Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and
straight into the path of
TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS.
The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles. Swords drawn,
they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat
by a crystal-handled dagger.
MAGENTA LIGHT
40.
spurts from the wound. The Soldier's body fractures like
glass and DISINTEGRATES in a shower of embers as he drops to
the floor. The other Mogadorian spins and trades SPARKING
sword strokes with
A CLOAKED FIGURE.
It's a violent battle of wills which ends when the Cloaked
Figure kicks up the dead Soldier's sword and impales it into
the Mogadorian's chest. The Soldier EVISCERATES in a cloud
of HISSING cinders.
Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps
towards him and pulls back his hood.
IT'S HENRI.
He looks younger, the years of hiding have aged him. John's
grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck
and places it over Young John's head.
GRANDFATHER
This is your Cepan. Go with him.
YOUNG JOHN
No!
HENRI
Your life is my life now. I will
always protect you.
GRANDFATHER
(TO HENRI)
He must survive.
A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri spots
A MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him
like a curse.
GRANDFATHER
They are already hunting you! Go!
Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs
young John and charges up. As the Commander breaks cover,
Henri hurls the dagger.
THE COMMANDER
dives out of its path but ROARS as the blade SPARK-RIPS
across his right cheek like a hot poker.
41.
TIGHT ON JOHN screaming...
JOHN
Nooooooooooo!
He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has
left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is
too overwhelmed and runs out.
An annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters.
The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the
shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron.
JOHN
You work here?
SAM
Not by choice.
(pointing to sign)
Ed's my stepdad. He's under the
delusion that if people eat enough
candy apples and kettle corn,
they'll suddenly have the urge to
buy sporting goods.
John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter.
SAM
I put those on special tonight for
any wannabe Jason Voorhees.
Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned with
the words Future Supervillain.
44.
SAM
Screw this. Let me lock up. I'll
hang with you.
He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.
JOHN
What about your stepdad?
SAM
He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's
already hammered by now. I'll
probably find him passed out on the
doorstep. Every night is trick r
treat at my house.
Freaky shadows crisscross as John uses his luminescent palms
to navigate his way through the labyrinth of trees.
Sam scrambles blindly through the darkness.
JOHN (O.S.)
SARAH!
Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to
head towards it when
TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS
trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the
area is flooded with preternatural white light. He can hear
the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and
CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS.
JOCK (O.S.)
You're blinding me! Stop!
Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.
WHAT HE SEES: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a
luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles.
JOHN
Where's Sarah? Tell me!!
JOCK
Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that
damn flashlight!
John rips off the Jock's goggles, then pile-slides him 15
feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed.
CAMERA STAYS ON SAM. OFF his stunned reaction...
CUT TO:
50.
Rain HAMMERS. Bernie is asleep on a blanket. John creeps
into the darkness, soaked to the bone, when --
54.
HENRI
I heard on the police scanner that
eight boys were beaten up in the
woods tonight.
Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee. Bernie
wakes. John pulls off his hood. Henri looks at the cuts and
bruises on John's face.
JOHN
They won't talk.
HENRI
That was a stupid thing to do.
What were you thinking?
JOHN
They attacked me. If I hadn't
defended myself, I'd be in the ER
right now. Would that have been
the better choice?
(STEPPING FORWARD)
You've got to start trusting me!
Emotionally charged, John points his finger at Henri,
accidentally causing the mug to telekinetically
EXPLODE.
Coffee and shards splatter across the floor. Henri looks at
John, stunned. John shrugs sheepishly.
JOHN
I was getting to that. I got a new
Legacy.
Henri absorbs that revelation.
HENRI
Telekinesis. That's a big step.
Must have been triggered by the
fight.
John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze.
HENRI
I need to teach you how to control
these abilities. We'll start
working on that tomorrow.
The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive
WHINE OF AN ALARM. They cross to the bank of computers.
Henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard.
55.
JOHN
What is it?
Henri pulls up a website.
HENRI
We got a hit on one of the search
words.
(SCANNING)
It's a paranormal blog. They Walk
Among Us!
ANGLE ON COMPUTER: A video buffers into motion. It's
handheld and jerky. It WHIP-PANS over some sand and joins a
group of Teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf. He's
holding his ankle and light seeps between his fingers.
John's chest pounds with fear as he realizes...
JOHN
That's Sand Dollar Beach.
HENRI
Looks like a cell phone camera.
There's enough for the Mogs to ID
your face.
JOHN
Can you take it down?
Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands.
HENRI
Working on it.
JOHN
I'm sorry, Henri.
HENRI
This isn't your fault. There's
still nothing to trace us here.
Henri glances up from his screen.
HENRI
This could take all night. Get
some sleep.
CUT TO:
John dumps his hoodie on the floor and slumps on his bed. He
pulls his phone out of his jeans and sees a new text message
from Sam. He CLICKS it open.
56.
PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as he scans the message with alarm.
He sits bolt-upright, gripped with dread. He checks the
message again.
TIGHT ON PHONE: I SAW WHAT U DID IN THE WOODS. NEED 2 TALK.
2NITE. MY GARAGE.
JOHN hits delete and clenches the phone in his palm. A bad
night just got worse.
Henri is illuminated by the dirty glow on the computers.
His fingers work the keys with expert precision. He's so
focused on the task that he doesn't notice
JOHN
blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the surveillance camera
screens and disappear into the woods.
CUT TO:
John slides into view. It takes a second for his eyes to
adjust. A pickup sits under a white tarp. There's no sign
of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him.
SAM
I've narrowed it down to three
possibilities: you're a genetic
experiment, you're a freak of
nature, or you're an
extraterrestrial.
JOHN
I don't know what you think
happened tonight...
Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face.
SAM
Your hands lit up like a firefly on
crack, you tossed those football
players around like crash test
dummies, and you took off faster
than an Olympic runner.
(MORE)
57.
SAM (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
Did I leave anything out?
John silently reels.
JOHN
What do you want from me?
SAM
I just want to know who you are.
John looks at Sam, realizes he's not going to give up. He
hesitates, then finally surrenders...
JOHN
I'm a survivor from a planet called
Lorien.
Sam absorbs this confession with awe.
SAM
Your dad... he's from there too?
JOHN
Henri's not my dad. He's my
Guardian. If he found out you knew
about us, we'd be gone by morning.
(PLEADING)
I don't want to leave Paradise.
SAM
I won't tell anyone.
John nods, grateful.
SAM
There's something I want to show
you.
CUT TO:
The tarp is whipped off the pickup truck. It's an old Ford.
Sam and John stand before it.
SAM
The cops found it abandoned in the
middle of Route 20, just south of
White Sands, New Mexico. It was my
dad's. He went missing six years
ago. He was on one of his crazy
fact-finding trips. He believed we
weren't alone in the universe.
Sam rubs his hand across the hood, wondering.
58.
SAM
Mom figured he was having an affair
and took off. All these years I
thought she was right. Now you're
here.
JOHN
That doesn't prove anything.
SAM
It proves he wasn't crazy. I'm
starting to think that he didn't
bail on us... that maybe something
else happened out there -- that he
was taken.
The moment is broken by the SLAM of the front door and the
sound of ANGRY FOOTSTEPS. Sam instantly tenses.
SAM
Guess the bar closed.
ED (O.S.)
Sam! Where are you?
His speech is slurred and aggressive.
ED (O.S.)
You think I wouldn't hear you
locked up early!
John looks at Sam, shocked and concerned.
JOHN
You going to be okay?
SAM
If he finds you here, it'll be
worse.
(BEAT)
Go.
Sam crosses to the door leading into the main house and heads
inside. SHOUTS erupt almost immediately. John flinches,
wanting to intervene, but finally turns, hustles under the
garage door and slips into the night...
CUT TO:
Henri is hammering at the keyboard of one of his computers.
John enters with two mugs of coffee.
59.
JOHN
You look wiped.
Henri turns and smiles playfully.
HENRI
I wasn't the only who was up last
night.
John nervously hands Henri one of the cups and lies...
JOHN
Sarah texted me. I went over to
her house.
Henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers.
HENRI
I've tried every trick I know, but
I can't crack that blog's firewall.
JOHN
There must be a way.
HENRI
We need to find where the site's
located and take it offline
manually. The URL source has been
run through a labyrinth of servers,
it could take weeks to track down.
JOHN
I want to help.
Henri takes a gulp of coffee and stands.
HENRI
You can. Get changed.
CUT TO:
START MONTAGE:
The walls are now adorned with Thanksgiving banners. John
and Sam head past the lockers. Mark and the Jocks move out
of their way, acknowledging the new high school dynamic.
Using his telekinesis, John strains to lift a tennis ball.
It momentarily RATTLES, then stops. Henri is not impressed.
John helps Sam with a dusty box. It's stuffed with Sam's
dad's old papers and books. We CATCH tantalizing glimpses of
images: Stonehenge, Machu Picchu, the Rings of Saturn...
It's a Vandy student hangout. CAMERA DRIFTS over a row of
computer terminals and FINDS the Teen Girl who torched the
stilt house. She's studying her computer screen intently.
REVERSE TO REVEAL: She is watching the cell phone footage of
John on the They Walk Among Us blog.
Under Henri's watchful gaze, John focuses on a tennis ball.
It RISES. John grins in triumph, causing the ball to drop
and bounce on the floor. Strike two.
Mark silently stews when he sees Sarah and John sitting
together at a table.
CLOSE ON A LAPTOP scrolling with endless lines of URL
addresses. REVERSE TO REVEAL Henri studying the screen.
Waiting. Watching.
61.
The trees are now bare. John stands 20 feet from Henri and
nods. Henri flicks the switch of an automated tennis ball
server. John's face is a mask of concentration as the yellow
balls fly towards him. He holds up his hand and the balls
STOP IN MIDAIR.
It's like they've hit an invisible wall two feet from his
hand. They hang there. John sees a smile sneak onto Henri's
face and momentarily loses focus, causing the wall to
collapse and the balls to drop into the mud.
END MONTAGE.
CUT TO:
Bernie looks like a drowned rat. He's sitting in the tub
being scrubbed by John and Sarah.
SARAH
I don't see any family pictures
around. I guess the photo aversion
is hereditary.
He greets the observation with a shrug. She carries on.
SARAH
Your mom... grandparents. Is there
anyone else in your life?
JOHN
They died.
SARAH
I'm sorry.
JOHN
It was a long time ago. It's just
me and my dad now.
John uses a nail brush to clean the beagle's ears.
62.
SARAH
I get the feeling he doesn't like
me very much.
JOHN
It takes him a while to warm up to
people.
Sarah considers this.
SARAH
Thanksgiving's tomorrow. Why don't
you bring your dad and celebrate
with us?
JOHN
I don't know. Are there going to
be a lot of people?
SARAH
A tsunami of relatives. But don't
worry, I'll shield you from the
wave. Besides, I want everyone to
meet you.
She playfully splashes him. Their faces inch closer. They
begin making out hot and heavy until Henri suddenly walks in.
HENRI
I've found the --
Caught in the act, the teens lurch away from each other.
JOHN
Just giving Bernie a quick bath.
HENRI
You're clearly putting a lot of
effort into it.
SARAH
I better hit the road.
(TO JOHN)
See you tomorrow. Twoish.
(GRABBING BACKPACK)
Bye, Mr. Smith.
OFF John as she hustles out...
Henri sits in front of his computers. John enters with
Bernie, who is wrapped in a beach towel. He begins drying
the dog in front of the fire. Henri breaks the silence.
63.
HENRI
I finally tracked the location of
that blog. It's a house in Warsaw,
Indiana. About four hours from
here. I'm heading up there
tomorrow.
JOHN
Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving.
I told her we'd be there.
HENRI
Send my regrets.
JOHN
You shouldn't go alone. It could
be dangerous.
HENRI
I won't risk taking you. I'll
leave early and be back by five.
John looks up and sees Henri sitting in solitude.
JOHN
Don't you ever get lonely?
Surprised by the question, Henri swivels to face him.
HENRI
How could I? I have you.
JOHN
You know what I mean. All these
years, there's never been anyone.
HENRI
We aren't like humans. Once we
fall in love, it's for life. The
pain of separation is unbearable.
Henri's face clouds with melancholy and he abruptly gets up.
As he heads into the kitchen John studies him with new eyes.
Steam billows as Henri washes up. He keeps his back to John
when he enters. John waits then softly asks...
JOHN
What was her name?
Henri slots a plate onto the draining board.
64.
HENRI
Anastasia.
JOHN
You left her to save me.
HENRI
You're not responsible for what
happened to her -- they are.
He slowly turns and regards John with deep paternal concern.
HENRI
I looked at her the way you look at
Sarah.
(BEAT)
She can't come with us when we
leave -- and we always have to
leave, you know that.
John nods, not wanting to deal with that reality.
HENRI
I was hoping to protect you from
that pain.
JOHN
You can't protect me from
everything.
OFF Henri's sad smile of acknowledgement...
CUT TO:
It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch
of counter space is filled with platters of food.
John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF
RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving
feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag.
John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration --
things he's never known in his own life. Sarah steps over.
She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress.
65.
SARAH
Come on, we're on gravy-boat duty.
The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an
elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last
turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John.
SARAH
You look dazed.
JOHN
Just taking it all in.
She crosses.
SARAH
I'm glad you came.
They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming
bowl of mashed potatoes.
ANNIE
Don't mind me.
She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera.
ANNIE
Let's get a picture of you two
lovebirds.
Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye.
SARAH
Mom. No. John really doesn't like
having his --
JOHN
It's okay. Let her take it.
The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around
her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPES
OUT THE FRAME...
CUT TO:
Red candles flicker. Sarah's DAD is expertly carving the
turkey. Everybody is at the table. John sits next to Sarah.
She holds his hand under the table. It's Hallmark worthy
until the carriage clock on the mantel CHIMES.
IT'S SIX O'CLOCK.
66.
John looks at his phone. No messages. His brow creases with
concern. He turns to Sarah, whispers.
JOHN
I need to check in with Henri.
He exits.
The food is getting cold. Everybody is waiting for John.
Sarah catches her mother's disapproving look.
SARAH
I'll see what's taking him so long.
Sam is behind the wheel.
JOHN
Thanks. I owe you.
SAM
Anything to get out of Thanksgiving
at my house.
He offers John a weary smile.
SAM
I checked out that blog on the way
over. Saw the video. What was the
deal with your ankle?
John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars.
JOHN
Death scars.
SAM
They kind of look like the symbols
in my dad's research.
(THINKING)
You guys don't --
JOHN
Abduct people? No.
Irritated, he covers them back up.
SAM
How about the ones you said were
hunting you?
JOHN
They're capable of anything.
(URGENT)
We need to get to Warsaw -- now.
68.
Suddenly, John's cell phone RINGS. He snatches it up, but is
disappointed to see the name SARAH flashing on the LCD. He
hits ignore and the truck hurtles into the dark.
CUT TO:
The teens sit in silence.
JOHN
Number 417. Henri tracked the URL
to that house.
Sam scans the street.
SAM
I don't see his SUV anywhere.
JOHN
He would have parked it across
town.
Sam opens the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver.
SAM
Stole it from Ed.
(BEAT)
Let's move.
John yanks Sam's arm away from the door handle.
JOHN
I called you because I needed a
ride, not a sidekick. If I could
have run here, I would have.
(BEAT)
Go home. I'll call you when I get
back.
OFF Sam as John climbs out alone...
With a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up
the packet on the table and is pissed to discover it's empty.
He crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door.
TIGHT ON LOCK as the dead bolt turns by itself and the door
swings open. John cautiously crosses the threshold. He
holds up his right hand, dims his palm to a dull-blue glow.
He retrieves Henri's dagger and tentatively heads into...
Everything is filmed with dust. It's freezing and John's
BREATH FOGS in the hazy aura his palm casts. The naked
floorboards CREAK. Fear bites as John scans the lifeless
gloom, not sure where to start.
TIGHT ON HIS SHOE as it brushes a mousetrap. SNAP!
71.
His breath catches in his throat. He turns off his hand.
His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the
noise. But nothing does. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he
notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door
that leads down into...
The ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends. The space is
illuminated by a single naked bulb. The sound of DRIPPING
WATER hammers the silence. John scans the rabbit warren of
rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner.
JOHN
Henri!
He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG
MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John
turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops
the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The
man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind.
THE BAT
whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who
ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused, Bret
lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in
his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs.
BRET
knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto
the cement, out cold. It's over in a violent blur. John
sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal
shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically unlocks
the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag.
Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings.
HENRI
You shouldn't be here.
JOHN
Your life is my life, remember?
Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze.
HENRI
I talked my way in. Thought the
big guy was buying it.
He rubs a wound on his neck.
72.
HENRI
I was asking him about the video
when the other one shot me from
behind... some sort of animal
tranq.
(DISPIRITED)
I'm getting rusty.
Suddenly, John's phone VIBRATES. It's a message from Sam --
GET OUT NOW!
JOHN
We have to leave!
John helps Henri up, they race for the stairs when Bret's
hand grabs John's ankle, tripping him to the floor.
JOHN
Henri!
Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for
good. John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just as
SAM AND FRANK
head down them into view. Frank holds the revolver against
Sam's neck. Their shadows crisscross under the swaying bulb.
FRANK
Stay planted or I'll blow your
friend's head off.
Henri looks at John in shock.
JOHN
(RE: SAM)
He came to help.
John and Henri put up their hands. John focuses on the gun,
but as the light bulb sweeps past, he causes it to EXPLODE.
THE ROOM PLUNGES INTO DARKNESS.
Henri body-slams Frank, sending the revolver skittering. But
as he wrenches Sam to safety,
THE KEYS
to the pickup fly out of Sam's pocket and slide under the
stairs. John flashes on his palm, casting everything in
eerie blue light.
On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon. It's
almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by
an invisible force.
73.
Sam looks over at John, impressed.
FRANK
(FREAKING OUT)
You're the one from the video!
You're the one they're after.
With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against
the ceiling.
JOHN
Tell me what you know!
Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big
man's face. It's like a blinding interrogation lamp.
JOHN
Start talking!
FRANK
I don't know what they're called.
The one in the red coat said he'd
kill me if I didn't do what he
wanted.
This revelation stuns Henri.
HENRI
The Mogadorians... they've been
here?
Frank nods in terror.
FRANK
He told me to call if anyone came
asking about the video.
Sweat beads John's face from the mental exertion.
JOHN
Did you?
FRANK
(RE: HENRI)
They wanted me to hold your friend
until they got here.
Henri urgently retrieves Sam's gun and his dagger.
HENRI
We need to go! Now!
John releases Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale
and is knocked out. At that moment, a razor-thin line of
dust drops from the floorboards above.
74.
SOMEONE IS UPSTAIRS.
John immediately extinguishes his palm. The trio stands
frozen, necks craned up, ears pricked as the floorboards
CREAK above them. They are definitely not alone.
FOUR MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS stalk through the house. Their long
black coats SILENTLY sweep. One sniffs the air like a
bloodhound and motions towards the basement door...
BLAAAAM! -- the door is shredded off its hinges and flies
down the stairs. The Mogadorian patrol storms through the
cloud of splinters. Frank and Bret lie where they fell, but
there's no sign of John, Henri or Sam.
Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small
blacked-out window. He punches out the glass with his fist
and catches sight of Sam clambering over the back fence!
John, Henri and Sam pile in.
JOHN
Sam, get us out of here!
Sam reaches into his jeans, then frantically checks his
pockets.
SAM
I must have dropped the keys!
Henri keeps his cool, looks at John.
HENRI
Start the engine.
JOHN
I can't.
Henri's calm eyes never leave him.
HENRI
Yes, you can.
John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes.
The engine TURNS OVER but doesn't start. Sam looks up the
street, panicked, as
A MOGADORIAN
75.
climbs out of a black SUV and storms towards them.
SAM
Hurry up!
John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog
unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he
lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of
the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in
the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair.
As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri
sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck.
VRRRROOMMM!
The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the
hood, magenta light spurting from his wound. John turns to
Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS...
JOHN
DRIVE!
Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The
Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck
bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away.
CUT TO:
CAMERA TRACKS the swish of a familiar red coat as its owner
slowly descends the stairs, PANS UP PAST his right hand,
which methodically twists two meditation balls, TO REVEAL
THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
He's the one who slaughtered Number 3 in Africa. His men
part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who
are chained to chairs. A Soldier stands behind each one.
Frank looks at the Commander in terror.
FRANK
I called you like I said. It's not
my fault they got away!
The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the
window. We get our first good look at his face. A gnarled
scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same
Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin
is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
Where did they go?
76.
His accent is thick and his voice is unnerving.
FRANK
How should I know? The kid had me
pinned to the ceiling.
The Commander turns to Bret.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
Where did they go?
Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the
Soldiers. They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank
open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the
Commander holds one of the meditation balls.
DOZENS OF TINY RAZOR-BLADES
suddenly flower open across its surface and viciously spin.
With cold-blooded calm, the Commander drops the ball into
Frank's mouth. OFF its terrible DRILL-LIKE WHIR...
CUT TO:
John turns to Sam.
JOHN
We'll meet you back at the house.
HENRI
We're not going back to Paradise.
(TO SAM)
Thank you for your help, but you'll
never see us again.
Henri climbs out. Sam looks at John, confused.
SAM
Is he serious?
John nods, numb.
SAM
What am I supposed to tell people?
77.
JOHN
Nothing. Forget about us. We
never existed.
(BEAT)
Goodbye, Sam.
OFF Sam as John climbs out...
CUT TO:
John silently stews. BIKERS smoke at the edge of the grimy
pool which is drained for the winter and rattles with frozen
leaves. Henri steps out of the motel office with a key.
Henri lets John inside, chains the door and draws the sun-
bleached curtains.
HENRI
We leave at nightfall.
JOHN
Henri, this is insane. They still
don't know where we live.
Henri seethes.
HENRI
It's only a matter of time. They
know our faces. They saw Sam. How
long has he known?
JOHN
Since Halloween.
Henri is floored and hurt by the admission.
HENRI
I trusted you and you lied to me!
John bows his head, can't meet Henri's gaze.
JOHN
Only because I knew how you'd react
and I didn't want to leave
Paradise.
Henri paces, tries to quell his emotions.
78.
HENRI
Now we don't have a choice. The
Mogs are using humans to trap us.
From this point on -- no more
towns. No more schools. We're
going off the grid until we find
the others.
JOHN
No.
His tone is defiant.
HENRI
This isn't a discussion.
In a flash of pent-up anger, John holds up his hand and
telekinetically sweeps Henri off his feet and pins him
against the wall. Henri looks at him, stunned.
JOHN
I'm not leaving without saying
goodbye to Sarah.
Henri fixes him with a steel-edged stare.
HENRI
Let. Me. Down.
Spent, John releases Henri who slides to the floor, shaken.
The dynamics of their relationship forever changed. Henri
finally stands.
HENRI
Give me your phone and IDs.
John hands him his cell phone and wallet. Henri opens the
back of the phone and pulls out the SIM card. SNAP!
HENRI
John Smith dies today.
CUT TO:
A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER methodically catalogs the grim,
blood-soaked nightmare. He's in a full body suit and
booties. The flashgun mounted to his camera whitewashes the
space as a UNIFORM COP appears on the stairs.
UNIFORM COP
The Chief wants to send the morgue
boys in and seal this tomb.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Hope they haven't had lunch yet.
These guys were gutted from the
inside out.
He steps over to Frank's body which has been splayed open.
As he flashes off some shots, the
TEEN GIRL
appears in the corner of his viewfinder. She's kneeling by
Frank's severed head which has rolled a short distance from
the body. The Photographer pulls the camera away from his
eye and looks at the Teen Girl, confused.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Who the hell are you?
She ignores him. He glances at the only window which is 20
feet away on the other side of the room.
PHOTOGRAPHER
How'd you get in?
The Girl continues examining Frank's wounds. Totally
unnerved, the Photographer shouts up the stairs.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Hey, we've got a live one down
here.
When he spins back, the Girl is gone, vanished into thin air.
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON A DIRT DEVIL as it snorts up beads of broken glass.
REVEAL SAM cleaning the evidence of the previous night's
adventure. Cardboard covers the missing passenger window.
John stands under the steaming spray. Eyes screwed shut.
Naked and lost. TWO LOUD KNOCKS at the door.
HENRI (O.S.)
(THROUGH DOOR)
Taillights in five.
The FEMALE CLERK stares at the TV mounted on the wall. She's
watching a local news report about the Warsaw house murders.
Henri enters. The window RATTLES as a motorcycle speeds past
and he slides his key onto the counter.
CUT TO:
81.
Henri steps in and is annoyed to hear the SHOWER still
running. He strides to the bathroom door.
HENRI
John?
No answer. He KNOCKS. Still nothing.
Henri shoulder-rams the door open. He whips back the shower
curtain and stares at the empty tub.
JOHN IS GONE.
OFF Henri's grim concern...
MUSIC THROBS. John works his way through the throng of
partying TEENS. He passes a RED-HAIRED TEEN BOY recording
the event on a FlipVideo camera. A hand grips John's
shoulder. John turns to find Mark Jayne.
MARK
You weren't invited.
JOHN
Where's Sarah?
MARK
She doesn't want to see you.
John shoves him aside and heads for the sweeping stairs...
It's been transformed into a major makeout den. Candles line
the windowsills and ring the edge of the pool table. TEENAGE
COUPLES grope in the flickering half-light.
JOCK
Everybody upstairs! Kevin's going
for the beer bong record!
The Teens immediately bolt for the stairs. In the giddy
exodus, one of them accidentally brushes
A CANDLE
onto the white shag rug.
John heads down the burgundy hall which is lined with family
portraits. He glances in the rooms as he passes.
Sarah and her friend, EMILY, sit on the bed with Mark's two
dogs, Abby and Dozer. A wedge of light cuts across them as
the door opens and John steps in.
SARAH
John!
83.
She leaps up and hugs him. John waits as Emily exits.
JOHN
I'm sorry about last night.
She pulls away, her relief turning to anger.
SARAH
No. Not good enough. Sam said you
were never coming back. What are
you doing here?
JOHN
I couldn't leave without seeing you
one last time.
She looks at him, crushed.
SARAH
So it's true. What's going on?
What kind of trouble are you and
your dad in?
JOHN
We're going to be fine.
SARAH
Damnit! Whatever it is, I'll
understand -- just tell me the
truth.
JOHN
The truth is I'm not who you think
I am. You need to forget about me.
Okay?
SARAH
Why are you acting like this?
JOHN
Because it's the only way to keep
you safe.
SARAH
Safe from what?
He turns away, shields her from his torment.
JOHN
Goodbye, Sarah.
He doesn't look back as he walks out the door. CAMERA STAYS
ON SARAH as she sinks onto the bed and the dogs comfort her.
84.
Party-goers pack the hall and kitchen watching Kevin consume
an impossible amount of beer through a funnel and hose.
TEENS
Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drained and numb, John heads the other way and fails to
notice the smoke seeping from under the basement door.
It's total chaos. Smoke and FLAMES plume up from the
basement. Terrified Teens scramble. John thrashes through
the crowd, SHOUTING --
JOHN
Sarah!
FLAMES sprint up the walls and clouds of black smoke spew
from the sectional sofa. Immune to the heat, John heads into
the front hall and finds
THE STAIRCASE
is fully engulfed. Fearless, he clambers up the flaming
steps. His jeans and shirt catch fire. He's almost reached
the top when the staircase BREAKS AWAY behind him and
DISINTEGRATES in a cloud of embers.
It's a raging conflagration. The family portraits blister on
the walls. John beelines towards Dozer's PLAINTIVE WAIL
which reverberates over the UGLY ROAR of the fire.
Sarah is crouched by the heavy oak bed that dominates the
corner of the room, COUGHING, eyes burning from the smoke and
heat. Dozer is cowered underneath, HOWLING. Sarah
desperately tries to move the bed but it won't budge.
CRAAAACK!
The door rips off its hinges. Through the smoky half-light,
Sarah watches as John strides into the room, heroically
backlit by flame.
SARAH
John!
(FRANTIC)
Dozer's under the bed. He's too
scared to come out!
John strides forward, grips the bed with one hand and
effortlessly hoists it. Sarah looks at him, amazed, then
scrambles forward and gently scoops Dozer into her arms.
John puts the bed back down.
JOHN
Don't let go of him. I promise I
won't let go of you.
86.
As he lifts them...
The trio heads into the hall just as an 8-foot section of the
floor collapses in front of them. Unfazed, John sprints
forward and bridges the hole.
ANGLE ON SARAH as she stares at the burning chasm in terror
and grips Dozer tighter.
John touches down on the other side and doesn't slow as he
powers down the hall, which is a SHRIEKING tunnel of fire.
A BURNING BEAM
breaks free and swings down in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS,
but watches in stunned amazement as John sweeps it out of the
way with a telekinetic flick of his hand.
John and Sarah walk in SILENCE, dappled in moonlight. He
catches her staring at him.
JOHN
Please don't look at me like that.
SARAH
I'm sorry. I'm still trying to
process everything I saw and I keep
coming to the same conclusion --
what you did isn't possible.
JOHN
It is for me.
SARAH
Who are you?
(off his hesitation)
For once please tell me the truth.
It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do.
JOHN
My name isn't John. I don't have a
name, just a number. 4. In fact,
my whole life can be reduced to
numbers: like 15 million -- that's
how many light years it takes to
get from my planet to Earth. 38 --
that's how many towns I've lived
in. Or 3,671 -- that's how many
days I've been running from an
enemy that wants me dead. I lied
to you, Sarah, because I lie to
everyone. That's how I stay alive.
Tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul.
JOHN
I shouldn't be telling you any of
this. It's dangerous.
Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree. She steps
towards him and brushes her hand down his cheek.
88.
SARAH
I don't care. I just want to be
with you.
JOHN
I want that too. But if I stay you
could get hurt. I have to leave to
keep you safe.
Sarah absorbs the bitter reality, reaches for his hand.
SARAH
There's something I want to give
you first.
CUT TO:
A PHOTOGRAPH OF SARAH AND JOHN
sharpens INTO FOCUS. It's the one Annie took of them at
Thanksgiving. John and Sarah stand in the eerie red glow.
She gently tongs the image into a bath of fixing solution.
SARAH
So you'll always remember me.
With exquisite tenderness they kiss. John's palms shimmer.
The intensity of the luminescence builds with their rising
passion. They sink to the floor and the light crescendos in
an ethereal flash that BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME.
CUT TO:
Mark climbs in the back. He looks around nervously as the
vehicle starts off.
MARK
Where are we going? Is this about
the fire? It was an accident.
89.
Only now do we REVERSE TO REVEAL
THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
sitting in the back. His face is masked in shadow.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
We're hunting for one of the guests
at your party.
He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo
footage of John's rescue of Sarah. It's posted on YouTube.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
Do you know this boy?
MARK
Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't
invite him.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
He's a fugitive. We've been
tracking him for some time.
Mark smirks, vindicated.
MARK
I'll help you find him.
He points to Sarah's image on the screen.
MARK
He's not at Sarah's, I already
checked. And one of my dad's
deputies drove by his house --
nada.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
He poses a great threat to us.
Where else could he be?
Mark pulls out his cell phone.
MARK
I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe
you guys can trace it?
The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men
in the front. He looks back at Mark.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
Tell me everything you know about
John Smith.
CUT TO:
90.
Sam is at the kitchen counter, watching the YouTube video on
his laptop, when headlights bleed through the blinds.
The crystal pendant glints against John's chest as he grabs a
Paradise High sweatshirt from a supply closet and yanks it
on. Sarah's phone suddenly RINGS, startling them.
SARAH
(INTO PHONE)
Hello.
She listens, then hands John the phone.
SARAH
It's Henri.
INTERCUT WITH:
91.
Henri careens through the night with Bernie and Sam.
HENRI
(INTO PHONE)
Where are you?
JOHN
High school.
HENRI
Get out now!
At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the
headlights of an SUV flash across the window. Fear registers
in John's eyes as he realizes...
JOHN
Too late... they're here.
One of John's hands holds Sarah's while the other lights
their way as they hurtle down the passage. They've almost
reached the doors when they suddenly fly open and
A FIGURE
92.
struts into view. We RECOGNIZE her as the mysterious Teen
Girl. She swings up an awesome hand-cannon and FIRES right
at them. THE BLAST scorches the air between John and Sarah
but takes out the
MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
who was stalking up the hall behind them! John watches in
shock as the Mogadorian keels over and SHATTERS into embers.
John swings back to the Teen Girl as she strides forward.
SHE IS NUMBER 6.
SIX
You oughta keep your heroics off
the internet.
JOHN
Who the hell are you?
SIX
Number 6. Where's your Cepan?
JOHN
On his way. Where's yours?
SIX
Dead. The Mogs got her four months
ago. We had been tracking them.
She heads past. John and Sarah follow after her.
JOHN
Tracking them?
SIX
We discovered they plan to attack
Earth. The only thing standing in
their way is the six of us.
The revelation hits John like a wrecking ball.
SIX
You know what that means?
John nods with new purpose.
JOHN
The war starts tonight.
SIX
First we have to get out of here
alive and find the others.
Six leads them past the impressive trophy case.
93.
JOHN
What are we up against?
SIX
There's a commander, a bunch of
soldiers and two Piken. They'll
have all the main entrances
covered.
SARAH
The gym, there's a tunnel under the
stage.
JOHN
It'll take us out to the stadium.
Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six
grabs John and Sarah by their arms and yanks them back
against the wall.
They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers
prowls straight past. He stops for a moment, then turns the
corner. Sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and
sees there's no reflection.
SARAH
We're invisible.
John realizes, turns to Six.
JOHN
You got any other Legacies?
SIX
I can control the elements. You?
JOHN
Lumen and telekinesis.
More FOOTSTEPS. John turns and watches in horror as the
Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps
into view. The Commander is holding
MARK.
He is ashen with fear. Sarah has to catch herself from
screaming. John makes a move, but Six holds him in place.
SIX
Stay put. They want to draw you
out.
JOHN
He's not dying because of me!
94.
ANGLE ON THE SOLDIERS AND MARK. They're heading past the
trophy case when JOHN'S VOICE booms out of nowhere.
JOHN (O.S.)
Mark! Linoleum! Now!
Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy
case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and
trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens
against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail.
John, Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his
feet and they take off running. They dash around the next
corner and find
HENRI, SAM AND BERNIE
sprinting towards them, followed by two Mogadorians! Six
raises her hand-cannon, BLOWS one of the Mogs away, while
John safely leads everybody into...
SIX
(TO JOHN)
Barricade the doors!
John telekinetically uproots a trio of bookcases that fly
across the space and block the door. Sarah turns to Mark who
is totally shell-shocked.
SARAH
What are you doing with them?
MARK
They said they were FBI. That John
was a fugitive. What the hell's
going on?
SIX
You've stumbled into a war. So
shut up and keep your head down.
HENRI
I see age hasn't mellowed your
attitude, 6.
Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked.
MARK
I didn't know they were trying to
kill you.
(genuine, to John)
I'm sorry.
95.
JOHN
This isn't your fault -- it's mine.
He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie
begins to GROWL.
SAM
What is it, boy?
Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes...
HENRI
He's telling us to run!
They take off a second before
A PIKEN
PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and
paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks back
and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground.
JOHN
Bernie!
He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself
at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's
hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken
tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens --
BERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH.
He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features
become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in
a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking
ALIEN CREATURE.
John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns.
HENRI
Bernie's a Chimera. He came with
us from Lorien.
JOHN
Guess I wasn't the only one keeping
secrets.
HENRI
Somebody had to watch you when I
wasn't around.
They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle.
96.
John and Henri catch up to the others.
SARAH
The gym's this way.
A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of
lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The
paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE.
JOHN
sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that
use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One
FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off
its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES.
John spins back and SCREAMS --
JOHN
Go! Go! Go!
They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to
fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the
fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a
projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by
napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on
THE SPRINKLER HEADS
that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing
the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the
corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find
SIX IS WAITING.
BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range.
Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting
hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder.
SIX
Keep moving!
Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees
something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze.
IT'S THE SECOND PIKEN!
It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward.
Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one
hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to
ICE!
97.
In a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an
icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles
to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip-
slides after John and Six, who disappear into...
CRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off
the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids
to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes
scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen.
The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off
its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing
something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans
that are stored below.
REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes.
Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken
pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare
right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on.
Henri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops,
panicked and afraid.
SARAH
Where's John?
HENRI
Right behind us.
He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when
A MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for
Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes
the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right
ERUPTS!
Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are
still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they
steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug.
The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of
sight. It's over in a violent blink.
John and Six sneak through the shadows. She steps to the
door, but it won't budge.
98.
SIX
They've blocked it. Use your
telekinesis.
JOHN
We're not leaving without my
friends.
SIX
Don't you mean the girl?
John ignores the jibe and turns back. Six grabs his arm.
SIX
I broke the Elders' spell to find
you. The Mogs can kill me now. We
have to go.
JOHN
We stay and fight.
OFF his determination...
Henri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark
hide in the one opposite. Henri pulls a selection of weapons
from the backpack. He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark.
HENRI
You know how to use one of these?
MARK
My dad's the sheriff.
He slides two across the floor. The door opens. They swing
up to fire but find -- John and Six.
JOHN
Save it for the Mogs. Let's go!
Bernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which
COLLAPSE like dominos. Gashed and exhausted, the battling
duo SHATTER-SMASHES into
THE SHOWER STALLS.
Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the
slick tiles. As it struggles to right itself, Bernie seizes
the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster's neck.
THE PIKEN
99.
desperately thrashes. Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's
side. Ignoring the pain, Bernie doesn't let go until his foe
finally jerks to stillness. As Bernie sinks to the floor, he
MORPHS back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding...
John leads the group past the bleachers and points to the
side of the stage.
JOHN
The door's over here. The tunnel
leads out to the stadium.
Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and
whips the chain free. The doors fly open,
TWO MOGADORIANS
spring out of the dark. One tackles Henri while the other
blindsides John. Henri struggles until
BOOOOOM!
The BLAST cinders the Mog's head clean off. Henri looks over
and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks.
The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony
and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing
SIX.
She sheathes her dagger and helps John up.
SIX
Saving your life. My new hobby.
Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and
Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! -- three Mogadorian
knives razor the air. One impales Six in the shoulder. She
slumps at John's feet. Henri opens FIRE on the
THE COMMANDER AND TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS
who storm towards them. John SCREAMS to Sam and Mark.
JOHN
(RE: SIX)
Get her down the tunnel!
They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel.
Sarah glances back at John and follows after them. Henri
takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and
100.
THE WOODEN FLOOR OPENS LIKE A ZIPPER!
The Commander and the other Soldier are sent flying as the
planks rip free of their nails. John and Henri charge into
the tunnel. The doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher
stand rolls forward to seal the entrance.
Sarah is in the lead. Sam and Mark follow, holding the
wounded Six. They've almost reached the end when
A MOGADORIAN
lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's
hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark looks
at him in shock as they race through the embers. Sam shrugs.
SAM
I play a lot of Xbox.
