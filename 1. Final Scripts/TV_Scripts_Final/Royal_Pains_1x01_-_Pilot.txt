A FAST AND FURIOUS pick-up game is underway.  Blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians, and whites all blend together seamlessly.  
Out here, the only color anyone sees is orange.  

For most of these guys, the SHOWBOAT DRIBBLES, PICK-POCKET 
STEALS, and HALF-COURT JUMPERS are effortless.  Pure fun.

Battling valiantly to compete with them is HANK LAWSON, 31.

The crowd ERUPTS with hollers of appreciation and derision. A  
few spectators pull fresh beers from THEIR ICE COOLER.  This 
is gonna be a good show.

Hank gets up slowly, a bit dazed, and heads back down court 
with the ball.  The black kid guards him, and Hank is clearly

Suddenly, Hank sees the black kid STUMBLING, trying to catch 
his breath.  Odd.  And then the kid simply DROPS LIKE A ROCK.  

HANK (CONT D)

Hank drops beside him.  A crowd immediately forms.

HANK (CONT D)
Hey man, are you OK?!ROYAL PAINS - PILOT - GOLDENROD REVISED - 9/19/08 2 


The kid is flat on his back. Hank gently shakes his 
shoulders.  Nothing.  He puts two fingers to his throat and 
examines his head and neck.

HANK (CONT D)

They all deploy.  The onlookers are skeptical about those 
final 2 requests.  Hank begins performing RAPID CHEST 
COMPRESSIONS.  One-man CPR.

Ballplayers 2 and 3 rush back with their respective bounties. 
Hank continues rapid compressions.

HANK (CONT D)

We see SHOTS OF HANK catheterizing Gardner:

- Hank quickly shaves and preps the groin.  

- Hank puts the needle through the skin and pulls back on the 
syringe.  Blood is aspirated.

- Hank takes the wire and puts it through the needle.   

- Hank puts the introducer over the wire into the groin and 
withdraws the wire.  Blood pumps out of the introducer.

He holds her firmly by the waist.

HANK
After a long day of life and death, 
there s nothing more reassuring 
than the sight of the world s most 
beautiful girl.   

NIKKI

If I had a nickel...

Hank leans towards her again.

(CONT D) NIKKI
Settle down, Dr. Desperate.  I know 
that look in your eyes, and it 
usually leads to skipping a meal.

Hank flashes a guilty grin.  And the negotiation begins.

INT. HALLWAY -- BROOKLYN HEIGHTS MERCY HOSPITAL -- DAY10A10A

Hank stands outside two glass doors, FROSTED OPAQUE.  He 
paces back and forth, in nervous anticipation.

Suddenly, the doors FLASH TRANSPARENT.  And Hank sees an ARMY 
OF HOSPITAL BUREAUCRATS seated at a long boardroom table, all 
facing him.  The firing squad awaits.

INT. BOARD ROOM -- BROOKLYN HEIGHTS MERCY HOSPITAL -- DAY1111

The bureaucrats are all taking and reviewing notes.  Dr. Park 
chairs the meeting.  Hank defends himself, choosing his words 
carefully.

HANK
I recognized Mr. Gardner s level of 
blockage, I knew it had to be 
relieved, and I was confident he 
would be successfully angioplastied 
and survive...barring any bad luck.

Well, bad luck rained and poured,

was only on the rise.

PARK
If I were you, I d find a good 
lawyer and a great place to hide 
for the next 25 years.  Maybe by 
then, you ll be completely 
forgotten.  And you can come back

As Hank spirals gradually into depression, his apartment 
clutters with shit, sprouting a virtual landfill around him.

He kicks his legs up on the coffee table, pops open a beer, 
and digs into some take-out Chinese cartons.  He throws a DVD 
into the player.  A big, broad, laugh-out-loud comedy.  He 
smells his shirt -- smells fine for now.

Hank and Evan pull up to a line of white-gloved valets.  
Behind them looms a BREATHTAKING CASTLE with sweeping, 
perfectly-manicured grounds.

ACT THREE

FADE IN:

INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- BORIS S CASTLE -- NIGHT2626

Hank and Evan part ways, ready to divide and conquer.  Hank 
circulates, taking in the scene.  

In one corner, he sees Jay-Z and Howard Stern kicking it.  In 
another corner, he notices A DAPPER MAN, 60s, aggressively 
hitting on a girl too young to even be his daughter.   

The ladies start to notice Hank, wondering who he must be.

END MONTAGE

Hank looks and, of course, sees Evan SURROUNDED by beauties.  
Hanging on his every word, utterly enchanted.  Kissing his 
hand.  Hank bows from across the room in amused admiration.    ROYAL PAINS - PILOT - GOLDENROD REVISED - 9/19/08 27 


And just as the fun starts to peak, Hank hears GASPING AND 
SHRIEKING coming from a nearby room.  He instinctively 
follows the noise into --

Where a girl is writhing on the floor with nausea.  She has 
VOMIT in her hair, and she s mumbling incoherently.

A few people stand around frozen.  No idea what to do.  So 
they just watch the train wreck.  Just as Hank is about to 
step forward and intervene, the DAPPER MAN moves in first.

HANK
Just a concerned observer.

SILVER
I observe nausea, photosensitivity, 
disorientation, and a few other 
tell-tale symptoms of opioid

HANK
The same symptoms you are.  Plus a

pupils and SLUDGE toxidrome.

For the first time, Silver cares enough to actually EXAMINE 
APRIL CLOSELY.  And he turns WHITE.

calmly turns to April s friend, the male model.

Silver begrudgingly finds and hands Hank a pre-filled 
SYRINGE.  Hank rips his belt from his pants, and ties it 
around April s right arm, raising a prominent vein.

He injects her and within mere seconds, her color starts 
clearing and her secretions diminish, restoring much of her 
stunning natural beauty.

Hank looks up to find his host, BORIS.  Early 40s, 
immaculately groomed and dressed, and trailed closely by his 
KEY SERVANT.

The servant is efficiently ushering people out of the room, 
closing the door behind them.  

Boris shoots Silver a sharp look of disappointment, and then 
the servant ushers Silver out, too.

appears.  Ready to serve.

And now he can practically hear Tucker smiling.

TUCKER
Done and done.  Later, man.

Hank hangs up just as the two men lead him through two glass 
doors, into a room with A LONG INDOOR LAP POOL.  Hank knocks 
on one of the doors, timidly announcing himself.

We see a BADLY DAMAGED TORSO -- scars, burns, welts, etc. -- 
emerge from the pool dripping wet.  It belongs to BORIS.  

His key servant steps to him promptly, holding an Egyptian

EVAN

Hank rolls his eyes.  The door FLIES OPEN, revealing DR.

Hank and he chuckles bitterly -- he should ve known.

As Silver walks away, Evan trash-talks him from behind.

Hank restrains Evan, and re-directs his attention to the WIDE
