A WHITE BABY GIRL, covered in blood and placenta, is pulled
from between the legs of Troy's WIFE, DARLENE. THE NURSE
holds the SCREAMING BABY aloft, proud and happy.
VIG (V.O.)
(deep southern accent)
Congratulations, you got yourself
a rag head, my man.
"Proud To Be An American" BLASTS on as
Troy, wearing a checked Arab headdress is paraded on
shoulders. He holds up a Coke can in one hand and a Bud can
in the other, like torches.
TROY
(screaming the song)
And I'm proud I to be an American,
where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who
died, who gave that right to me.
And I'd gladly stand up; next to
you and defend her still today.
Cause there ain't no doubt I love
this land, God bless the U S A --
Soldiers scream and go nuts.
Beer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths.
"I Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man" by Public Enemy blasts.
WALTER WOGOMAN, 19, quiet, tall, Southern operates two
parallel boom boxes like a DJ.
A Soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top of
another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee. Vig wearing
a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a
series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements.
Soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at Troy. He
whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes.
Soldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as the
music blasts.
Two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols
at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal.
TROY
Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Vig screams into Troy's face at point blank range.
VIG
Rahhhhhhhhh.
TROY
Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Goddamn it, where the fuck did
this beer come from we gotta take
more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow.
In the half-light of dozens of TV monitors playing Iraqi news
from around the world, Archie Gates madly humps CATHY DAITCH
on a lawn chair which is slamming into the monitors.
CATHY DAITCH
You are a trained warrior, trained
warrior, trained warrior, Jesus
Christ, Colonel!
TV monitors crash to the floor as she climaxes. Archie lays
on the floor catching his breath, stares at a sideways
monitor of soldiers celebrating; she stands, dresses.
CATHY DAITCH
(breathless)
What's Bill got?
ARCHIE GATES
Just the celebration story.
CATHY DAITCH
That's it?
ARCHIE GATES
That's it --
ARCHIE GATES
How about you? Did you find
anything?
CATHY DAITCH
It could be another bullshit lead
but I need you to help me find a
guy who might have something on
the gold --
ARCHIE GATES
Who's the guy?
CATHY DAITCH
Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company
B--
ARCHIE GATES
Barlow.
CATHY DAITCH
Got a map out of a prisoner's head.
ARCHIE GATES
Out of a prisoner's head?
CATHY DAITCH
Or his ear, or his ass, or his
dick, and they got like a fifty
page full-color mini atlas of
Saddam's bunkers --
ARCHIE GATES
Out of a guy's dick?
The door explodes open and two MPs grab Archie, pants around
his ankles, and drag him from the truck.
SPLASH -- rubbing alcohol is poured over Vig's extended hand
by DOC ELGIN, 25, stocky, black, no nonsense.
TROY
You've washed your hands like a
thousand times, Conrad.
VIG
Lord knows what vermin live in the
butt of a dune koon.
DOC
Why do you let this cracker follow
you around?
TROY
He's a good kid.
DOC
He's a wall-eyed cracker.
TROY
He's got no high school, man, he's
from a group home in Jackson --
DOC
I don't give a shit if he's from
Johannesburg. I don't want to hear
dune koon or sand nigger from him
or anybody.
VIG
Captain uses those terms.
TROY
The point is, Conrad, 'towel head'
and 'camel jockey' are perfectly
good substitutes.
DOC
Exactly.
VIG
I'm sorry, man, it's a little
confusing is all.
DOC
What can I do for your headache?
Doc Elgin opens a case full of pill bottles.
TROY
Got any Vicadan?
DOC
All gone. How about Caffergot?
TROY
Excellent. Let's translate my
Iraqi ass map.
Troy pops the pills, Doc pulls a document from a folder and
opens it as he hovers over a table with Troy and Vig.
TROY
Van Meter's at the big pow wow?
DOC
We're cool for at least three
hours, but keep Walter on the door.
Walter stands by the door wearing night vision goggles.
TROY
Would you take those fucking
things off?
WALTER
I never got to use night vision.
TROY
They don't work during the day and
stand outside the tent.
Doc unfolds a big aerial-photo map of the Iraqi desert, next
to the rumpled ass map.
DOC
These are definitely Saddam's
bunkers near Karbala.
TROY
What's inside?
DOC
According to Intelligence --
Picasso, Armani, Rolex, Mercedes,
Sony you name it --
Kuwait was
Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam
sacked it.
VIG
Man, get an awesome stereo system
with like ten BOS speakers
--
TROY
Silver Lexus convertible.
DOC
Lexus doesn't make a convertible.
TROY
Yes, they do.
DOC
Infiniti has one coming.
TROY
You're wrong.
DOC
You can't get a car home from here
anyway.
TROY
If I get enough Rolexes I could
buy one when I got home.
VIG
One gold Rolex, I get a very fine
split level outside Jackson.
TROY
My one problem, see, is the risk
here --
DOC
What risk? We already did the
risk. I signed up last year to
bank some computer training--
TROY
Tell me about it.
DOC
Next thing I know I'm sitting here
waiting to get hit by a Scud. I
put my life on the line for what
purpose I'm not sure, and now the
good Lord puts this map in my
path --
TROY
He could put a land mine in your
path if we try to find this
place --
DOC
You're safe with me.
TROY
Cuz you have a galactic plutonium
forcefield.
DOC
I don't talk about it. But I do
have a ring of Jesus fire.
TROY
You have a ring of Jesus fire.
DOC
I was fire baptized.
VIG
I was baptized in water.
DOC
I'm fire baptized.
TROY
I don't even know what water
baptism means.
DOC
For those who understand, no
explanation is necessary; for
those who don't, no explanation
will suffice. You can benefit from
my Jesus ring if you do right by
me, you got that?
TROY
OK.
CUT TO
POV WALTER'S NIGHT VISION --
BLURRY IMAGE OF ARCHIE WALKING right up to Walter.
WALTER
This tent is restricted --
ARCHIE GATES
Get the fuck out of my way.
WALTER
May day, may day --
CUT TO
Troy and Doc scramble to put the maps under the table.
ARCHIE GATES
Good afternoon.
He walks up to them.
ARCHIE GATES
Would this be the proctology tent?
DOC
Yes, sir, I mean, no, sir.
ARCHIE GATES
Then maybe it's the urology tent.
TROY
Captain's at a staff meeting.
ARCHIE GATES
That's OK, I'm not looking for a
proctologist or a urologist I'm
looking for Sargeant Barlow.
Archie fixes his gaze on Troy, walks up, reaches under the
table, and takes the map, smells his fingers.
ARCHIE GATES
You're on the path to truth when
you smell shit, isn't that what
they say?
VIG
I don't recognize you, sir. Are
you in this division?
DOC
He's not in this division. He's
Special Forces.
Troy and Vig are impressed.
DOC
He's the guy taking Bill Smithson
around.
ARCHIE GATES
And you would be the Three Wise
Men, right, Mappy, Slappy, and
Pappy --
He points in order to Doc, Vig, and Troy, who picks up his
family photo button.
ARCHIE GATES
That leaves Cappy outside.
CUT TO
Walter, outside the tent, practices blocking positions.
WALTER
Damn. Freeze. Do not pass. Hold
it, freeze. Stop. Freeze.
CUT TO
VIG
His name is Walter.
ARCHIE GATES
Did you good soldiers present this
map to Captain Van Meter?
TROY
Not yet.
ARCHIE GATES
Then I'll take it to him.
Troy stands and grabs the map.
TROY
We'll take it to him. Sir.
ARCHIE GATES
It won't do either of us any good
then, will it?
TROY
He's our commander, sir. We'd have
to tell him you took it.
Both Troy and Archie hold the map, staring at each other.
Everyone is tense.
ARCHIE GATES
It could be nothing but a sandy
love letter from one Eye-raqi to
another --
TROY
It's a series of bunkers near
Karbala.
ARCHIE GATES
Maybe.
TROY
Not maybe, definitely. Recon
photos match the map.
ARCHIE GATES
May I look at the goddamn map?
Troy lets go. Archie holds the map up to the light. He then
pours some of Doc's rubbing alcohol on the map, and holds it
to the light again. He puts the map on the table, turns the
light off and clicks on an infra-red flashlight he pulls out.
A completely different map appears in green markings.
VIG
Dag.
ARCHIE GATES
That's what makes Rangers badass,
we get the best flashlights.
They stare at the new map in the infrared glow, captivated.
ARCHIE GATES
Still looks like a series of three
bunkers in three villages. A bit
farther to the west.
DOC
Seventy-five klicks north.
ARCHIE GATES
More like 65.
TROY
Much closer to Karbala.
ARCHIE GATES
Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not
a big deal. Of course --
He turns the overhead light back on.
ARCHIE GATES
-- there could be nothing inside
but starving Arabs and stolen
watches, but I think it's worth
checking out, even if I have to do
it with clueless reservists like
you.
They look at him.
ARCHIE GATES
I mean, I could take the map, but
you could talk, it starts to
become a pain in the ass for me,
so we'll do the gold together.
DOC
What gold?
ARCHIE GATES
You don't even know what's inside
these bunkers, do you?
VIG
Rolexes.
ARCHIE GATES
Rolexes are swell, but I'm talking
about Kuwaiti bullion.
VIG
You mean the little cubes you put
in hot water for soup?
ARCHIE GATES
No. Not the little cubes you put
in hot water for soup.
TROY
Gold bricks.
ARCHIE GATES
5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's
market.
VIG
For one gold brick?
ARCHIE GATES
I'm sure Mr. Hussein has divided
his bricks. into many different
hiding places, but just one hiding
place should be easy to take, and
that would be enough to get us out
of our day jobs. Unless the three
kings are in love with their day
jobs.
Dolly: Troy, Doc, Vig stare at Archie.
SILENT - Troy kneels at a disassembled photocopier, tools and
parts all around him, opens a bag of toner, which spills
black dust all over his white shirt
SILENT - Doc is a red cap. He lifts suitcases from the trunk
of a black Mercedes while a rich white father (mother and two
small children behind) tells him to be careful.
Slow motion, a bullet pierces flesh, makes a cavity --
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
Makes a cavity of dead tissue that
closes down in a convulsive motion
typical of all gunshot wounds. The
cavity fills up with bile and
bacteria and you're fucked.
Bile fluid fills the cavity.
BACK TO THE SCENE
ARCHIE GATES
But other than a wound that
blinds, paralyzes, or castrates,
the worst wound I've ever seen is
something called tension pneumo
thorax --
DOC
I heard something about that --
VIG
Tension pneumo what?
ARCHIE GATES
A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill
you, but makes a little hole in
the lung, so every time you
breathe, a little air leaks into
the chest cavity, which starts to
fill up like a balloon. And that
balloon starts to push your organs
to the side, crushing your lung,
your liver, your heart. Your own
breathing kills you, one breath at
a time -- kinda like a job you
can't stand or a bad lie you once
told.
DOC
That's not fatal, they can stop it.
ARCHIE GATES
If you know how to make another
little hole in the chest to let
the air out, just like you would
with an overinflated tire.
They look at Archie, scared by this.
TROY
Can we play the Beach Boys when we
go in?
DOC
The goddamn Beach Boys.
TROY
I'm not ashamed of liking the
Beach Boys. It calms me down.
Better than Mozart.
ARCHIE GATES
Bach.
Five IRAQI SOLDIERS look disoriented and scared as they hold
their hands up in the air.
ARCHIE GATES
Do not panic.
Step outside --
Archie runs down the narrow stairs of the bunker, followed by
Troy and Doc.
Doc lashes an Iraqi's hands behind his back and cuffs him.
Troy shoots the door lock with his pistol.
Then backs up and
gives it a running shoulder. The door doesn't budge.
TROY
Shit.
He holds his shoulder in pain.
Archie kicks the door
repeatedly.
Troy joins him, it finally flies open.
TROY
Freeze.
Troy is embraced by an Iraqi soldier, about 25.
FRIENDLY IRAQI
I am love United States of
Freedom. I am hate Saddam.
Troy tries some karate moves, jerking his elbows to dislodge
the Iraqi from the bear hug --
TROY
Ya -- ya -- ha --
Doc points his pistol in the Iraqi's face.
DOC
Let him go.
The Iraqi throws his hands in the air.
FRIENDLY IRAQI
No problem, my friend.
Archie goes to a series of WOODEN CRATES the size of file
cabinets, where Doc helps Archie take off his back pack.
Archie pulls out a bolt cutter and a pneumatic saw, both
attached to a small air tank - and opens the crate, which is
filled with hundreds of Kuwaiti passports.
FRIENDLY IRAQI
You look for the chemical weapon?
TROY
No. We look for the gold.
They use the power tools to open the second crate -- also
filled with hundreds of passports.
ARCHIE GATES
Where's the gold?
FRIENDLY IRAQI
They move the gold.
Archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the Iraqi,
who says nothing.
DOC
Kill him.
ARCHIE GATES
Not yet.
TROY
Kill him now.
They point their guns. It's a show. Archie holds the map.
ARCHIE GATES
Where?
FRIENDLY IRAQI
(points to map)
This bunker. I'll take you.
Archie runs down a narrow cement corridor, pistol held at
arm's length, white document in the other hand; followed by
Troy and Doc, pistols drawn.
An IRAQI SOLDIER steps into the corridor at the far end, sees
Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back. Archie and
Troy run right past the scared Iraqi. Doc comes third,
slamming the Iraqi face down and cuffing him.
Archie kicks a door open and goes in, followed by Troy.
Archie and Troy burst in, pointing their guns aggressively.
TROY
Freeze.
A large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new
appliances: blenders, cuisinarts, CD players, small TVs. A
huge portrait of Saddam Hussein covers one wall.
A television plays a rerun of 'Happy Days' in Arabic.
Another TV: CNN's first reports of the Rodney King beating.
An IRAQI CAPTAIN sits in a chair in front of the TVs.
TWO IRAQIS sit loading rifles. Two others sit at a radio.
They all jump to their feet when Archie bursts in, except for
the officer watching 'Happy Days' and CNN..
ARCHIE GATES
By order of the cease-fire signed
in Safwan, March 3, the United
States Marines hereby confiscate
all material stolen by Iraq from
the Emirate of Kuwait --
One of the rifle-loading Iraqis tries to run. Troy heads him
off with his pistol --
TROY
Down.
The other rifle-loader stands looking scared.
IRAQI RIFLE-LOADER
Isnam panan fatwa aznir --
WHIP PAN TO Doc, who turns the shortwave radio off, pushes
the TWO IRAQIS to the ground. One goes peacefully, the other
resists; Doc smacks him in the side of the head with his
pistol, which fires accidentally. Everyone grabs their heads
and ducks -- except Archie.
ARCHIE GATES
Never hit anyone with your pistol,
Doc.
DOC
Sorry about that.
Archie is offered a cuisinart by the Iraqi Captain.
IRAQI CAPTAIN
For wife.
ARCHIE GATES
I've been divorced three times.
Troy has one rifle Iraqi on the ground, but the second is on
his knees, putting a CD into a mini-stereo.
RIFLE IRAQI #2
Newest and best.
TROY
No, newest and best has better
noise reduction.
The Iraqi looks puzzled.
TROY
Less distortion. Get down on the
floor, OK?
He pushes the man face down, cuffs his hands. Olivia Newton-
John's "I Wanna Get Physical" PLAYS.
TROY
This is bad music, understand?
It's bad for you.
DOC (O.S.)
Hey --
WHIP PAN TO the resistant Iraqi struggles to break away and
Doc punches him in the head twice, the Iraqi starts crying.
ARCHIE GATES
(to Iraqi Captain)
Where's the gold, Captain? Tell us
so we don't have to kill you.
TROY
There's another room over here.
PAN TO Troy pointing to a narrow door in a corner of the
room. Archie kicks it open.
A bound, naked SHIITE MAN IN GLASSES, clean shaven, sits on
the floor in a five foot square shallow metal box, four
inches deep, filled with water. There is an electric cable
going into the water. The naked Shiite in glasses shakes.
Troy watches Archie walk over and yank the cable out.
IRAQI SARGEANT
I am just do my job, buddy.
Archie pauses, then gives the Sargeant a backhand that sends
him flying to the corner. Archie steps on the man's wrist,
takes the pistol out of his hand. Troy watches.
Archie turns and sees TEN SHIITES across the room: 3 MEN, 3
WOMEN, 4 CHILDREN. The men and women are bound and GAGGED.
Archie steps toward the Shiites, but the INTERROGATOR, 35,
also a captain, steps in his way.
INTERROGATOR
These Shiite. Iraq problem. United
States is out now.
Archie stares at the INTERROGATOR with contempt.
INTERROGATOR
We take them outside, so it don't
bother you, OK, sir? Kata fanam.
The disarmed Iraqi Sargeant NODS and opens a small rear door
and pushes the Shiites out. Archie walks back to the main
room and points his pistol in the Captain's face.
ARCHIE GATES
Take us to the basement.
Archie runs down several narrow sets of cement stairs,
followed by the Interrogator, the other Iraqi Captain, Troy,
and Doc. (SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH)
IRAQI CAPTAIN
It's my ass, donkey dick, Saddam
will shoot me dead.
INTERROGATOR
Saddam worries more about the
Shiite than the gold.
Troy and Doc disarm TWO GUARDS outside a door in the basement.
Archie goes through the door, followed by the Iraqi
Interrogator and Captain.
Bright white cement, many overhead lights and a high ceiling.
empty but for 15 brand new, jumbo-sized Louis Vuitton
suitcases standing neatly in a row in the center of the room.
Archie stands looking at the suitcases with Troy and Doc.
Several of the big Vuitton suitcases are laid on their sides
by Archie, Troy and Doc.
The Iraqi Captain paces frantically punching and kicking the
walls and talking (SUBTITLED in ENGLISH).
IRAQI CAPTAIN
It's Saddam's gold.
INTERROGATOR
Shut up, he signed the treaty.
The suitcases are quickly unzipped. One suitcase is full of
gleaming antique silverware. One suitcase is full of jewelry.
Archie opens one full of hundreds of gold Cartier watches.
Troy and Doc slip a handful of jewelry into their pockets.
The Iraqi Captain goes nuts, throwing himself on Doc's back,
choking Doc, who flails about. Troy punches the Iraqi in the
head and rips him off Doc.
Archie puts his pistol in the man's face.
ARCHIE GATES
Listen to me: we leave you alone
to kill your Shiites, but
everything you took from Kuwait,
that belongs to us now, understand?
He turns to Doc.
ARCHIE GATES
Put it back.
DOC
Why?
ARCHIE GATES
Stick to the plan. The plan is for
gold.
Doc and Troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of jewelry.
Archie opens another Vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside -
it's full of Kuwaiti passports.
When Doc opens the next suitcase, he freezes. Archie looks
over and freezes. Troy closes cuffs behind the Captain's back
and looks over his shoulder -- wide-eyed.
The very large Vuitton suitcase is filled with five-kilo
bricks of gold. They all stare. Troy picks one up.
TROY
Is this five kilos?
Archie holds another brick.
ARCHIE GATES
Yeah, that's five kilos.
TROY
Five, six, seven, eight, there's
sixty bricks in this suitcase.
DOC
Times 50K each --
TROY
Three million dollars.
Archie opens another large Vuitton suitcase, and it is also
filled with sixty bars. Troy opens another suitcase, there's
another sixty bars. Doc opens another, another sixty bars.
They frantically check all of the suitcases. The handcuffed
Captain is crying.
ARCHIE GATES
Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each.
That's thirty million dollars.
Archie, Doc and Troy look at each other in shock.
With effort, Doc and Troy help Archie pick up the heavy,
jumbo-sized suitcase sideways, like a table top.
TROY
I'm gonna get a fleet of Lexus
convertibles in different colors.
DOC
I told you Lexus doesn't make a
convertible.
TROY
I'll bet you a Lexus they do.
DOC
OK, you're on for a Lexus, but it
won't be a convertible.
Suddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to the
floor; one lands on Troy's foot. He jumps in pain.
TROY
Shit.
Archie, Troy, and Doc hoist another suitcase sideways and the
bricks rip through and fall to the floor --
ARCHIE GATES
They didn't get it here in these
bags.
DOC
The tensilary strength goes to 200
pounds.
TROY
The what?
DOC
Tensilary strength, it's what the
suitcase can hold.
ARCHIE GATES
Why would you know that?
TROY
He works at an airport.
DOC
60 bars, 13 pounds each is like --
800 pounds. The smaller Vuittons
handle 65.
ARCHIE GATES
You got any more luggage here?
The Interrogator looks at him.
120 small, round, Vuitton overnight bags, laid out and
opened, cover the entire floor of the basement.
Troy and Doc finish putting 5 bars in each bag. Archie paces,
sweating, speedy like he's on cocaine.
ARCHIE GATES
It's crazy to take it all, we're
not prepared for it. It's crazy
not to take it all, how can we
leave it?
Troy and Doc look nervous.
TROY
What's the shipping plan?
ARCHIE GATES
I told you that's handled.
TROY
How is it handled? You have to
tell us now.
DOC
Yeah, tell us now.
ARCHIE GATES
(pacing)
I've got a friend, he's in French
Special Forces. He's gonna put it
in barrels filled with oil and
bury it. In a few weeks, he'll
drive it to Yanbu --
TROY
Where's Yanbu?
ARCHIE GATES
It's a port in Saudi.
SILENT FANTASY
Havichon talks to an EGYPTIAN MAN in Lacoste sportswear
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

to Perpignan, where a French boat
will take it to Baltimore --
BACK TO THE SCENE
TROY
I don't know about getting them to
Baltimore, but these hat boxes
ain't gonna fit in the Humvee.
ARCHIE GATES
We need a trailer.
TROY
OK, I'll call U-Haul in Karbala to
see what they have on the lot
today.
ARCHIE GATES
See what you can get, Barlow.
Troy runs up the stairs.
Archie, Doc, the Interrogator run up carrying Vuitton cases.
They hurry past the huge poster of Saddam, the TVs playing
'Happy Days' and Rodney King, the many shelves of stereos,
etc., and past the soldiers lying face down, handcuffed.
Iraqi Soldiers 6 & 7 carry suitcases up the narrow stairs.
as it bounces along fast. Archie is in pain while Doc pours
disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left
arm, and wraps it. Vig looks terrified as he drives.
Troy, driving alone, speeds the truck as fast as it will go,
bouncing along the road.
TROY
We were home free, you stupid son
of a bitch.
WIDE AERIAL SHOT
the truck is 60 yards behind the Humvee
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
What's the tank doing?
POV
through Doc's jiggling binoculars of the tank turning.
DOC (O.S.)
Lining us up --
BACK TO THE SCENE
Vig pushes the Humvee's accelerator to the floor.
The Shiite Man In Glasses and his Little Girl cling to the
Humvee as they sit on top of the Vuitton hat cases with eight
other Shiites, including TWO FIVE YEAR OLDS, A BOY AND GIRL.
A SHIITE MOTHER, FATHER, AND TWO CHILDREN pray at a crude
table when the ceiling collapses.
Flying debris smashes the windshield. Troy instinctively
jerks the wheel and the truck flips onto its side and slides
across the sand.
Chaos. People choking and vomiting. GAS LANTERNS SWING. The
tunnel is 6 feet tall. Buckets are passed, filled with oiled
rags that people use to wipe their faces. Archie takes a
dripping rag and wipes his eyes, nose, mouth.
VIG
We have to go back. We can't leave
him there.
Vig's mutilated right eye is bleeding.
ARCHIE GATES
We have to wait until it clears.
VIG
You made the choice and we lost
Troy --
ARCHIE GATES
I had no choice.
VIG
You had a choice.
ARCHIE GATES
I had no fucking choice.
He screams at Vig, who looks scared.
ARCHIE GATES
I can't walk away from a crime
like that and take the gold and
live my life like nothing
happened, and if you can, then I
hope you die right now.
Vig starts crying. Doc hands a bandage to Archie, who puts it
over Vig's wounded eye socket.
VIG
What about Troy? What choice does
he have now?
PAN ACROSS the Man In Glasses wipes his daughter's face.
Troy is led, naked, down the corridor by two soldiers.
Troy is thrown onto the floor of a cluttered cement bathroom
with two crude toilets. His clothes are thrown on top of him.
IRAQI SOLDIER
Get dress.
TROY
OK.
IRAQI SOLDIER
Get dress.
TROY
I said OK.
The door is slammed. Stolen blenders, radios, CDs, stacks of
new Levis litter the floor. Troy kicks all the crap angrily
and hundreds of cell phones tumble from a box.
Troy looks at the pile of cell phones, picks one up, tries it
for a dial tone, drops it, tries another, until he gets one
that gives him a tone and dials.
OPERATOR (O.S.)
Jalam nafad.
Troy looks stunned.
TROY
(into the cell phone)
Um. Do you speak English?
OPERATOR (O.S.)
(British accent)
Yes.
TROY
(into cell phone)
Can you -- I need --
He frantically pushes stuff on the floor to block the door.
OPERATOR (O.S.)
What number, please.
TROY
Operation Desert Storm.
OPERATOR (O.S.)
I'm sorry?
TROY
The big army in the desert, come
on, it's an emergency.
OPERATOR (O.S.)
I don't have that number.
TROY
Maybe you could -- hello?
The phone is dead.
TROY
Fuck.
He throws it to the ground, tries another, no dial tone,
throws it, tries another, no dial tone, throws it.
TROY
Come on, come on, come on.
He tries another, chucks it, another, gets a dial tone,
dials, and waits. Troy dials a number.
He waits while the PHONE RINGS.
Darlene, Troy's wife, tired from the pregnancy, picks up the
RINGING TELEPHONE. She has a crying baby in her arm.
INTERCUT with bunker:
DARLENE
(Southern accent)
Hello?
TROY
Honey, it's me.
DARLENE
Troy?
TROY
It's me, honey.
DARLENE
My God, the baby's crying.
TROY
I can hear her.
DARLENE
That's our little Krystal.
TROY
How's she doing?
DARLENE
She hasn't been sleeping good, and
Mamma had to go back to work, so
I'm real, real tired, baby.
TROY
I wish I was there to help, gooney-
bird.
DARLENE
Oh, gooney-bird, when are you
coming home?
TROY
I'm working on that right now,
baby.
DARLENE
I saw an ad for a computer job.
You want me to call and set up an
interview for my war hero?
TROY
Listen, honey --
DARLENE
What date are you coming home?
TROY
They haven't given us an exact
date yet. Listen --
DARLENE
I'm henpecking you.
TROY
No, you're not.
DARLENE
I'm lonely and tired and most of
all, I miss you.
TROY
I miss you, too.
FIRE and CONCRETE EXPLODE into one wall of the bathroom.
DARLENE
What was that?
TROY
The wall just exploded.
DARLENE
I thought the war was over, honey.
TROY
It is and it isn't, babe. Can you
do me a favor and call the C.O. on
base?
DARLENE
You want me to call the C.O.?
TROY
Tell him I'm stuck in a bunker
near 223 north outside Karbala --
DARLENE
What do you mean 'stuck'? I
thought the war was over.
TROY
I'm gonna be fine, honey, I don't
want you to worry, I tried to do
something for the family,
and I
want you to know --
DARLENE
Know what?
Another MORTAR SMASHES through the wall, covers Troy in dust.
TROY
That I love you.
DARLENE
What's happening, Troy?
TROY
Tell Krystal --
Soldiers push at the door, trying to open it.
DARLENE
Troy?
TROY
Tell Krystal I'm a rich man and if
things work out she'll be taken
care of no matter what --
DARLENE
What are you talking about?
The door is kicked open and soldiers enter.
TROY
Gotta go, gooney-bird, I love you--
The soldiers punch Troy in the face, drag him from the room.
DARLENE
Troy?
She waits for a moment, tears in her eyes, and hangs up.
A MORTAR ROCKS THE ROOM; soldiers frantically exit.
'CNN' is left playing in the empty room with Bill Smithson's
report from the previous day. "I Just Want to Celebrate"
PLAYS:
BILL SMITHSON
Spirits are high and the music is
soaring as these young troops
celebrate --
Archie, Doc, Vig, and dozens of Shiites crouch as they walk
through the tunnel, single file.
Dissolve
They are still walking in the long tunnel.
A line of TEN CHILDREN with missing limbs and bandages stand
and watch Archie, Doc, and Vig enter. They make eye contact.
CLOSE UP: the hands of an Iraqi soldier carefully wrap a bare
wire around Troy's right ear.
INTERROGATOR
(heavy accent)
What is your rank, bro?
TROY
Master sargeant.
INTERROGATOR
Your company?
TROY
B Company, infantry, United States
Army.
The wire is wrapped under Troy's chin around his other ear.
INTERROGATOR
My main man. Tell me something,
OK? What is problem with Michael
Jackson?
TROY
What do you mean?
INTERROGATOR
The King of Pop. 'I'm bad, I'm
bad, you know it --'
TROY
Yeah, Michael Jackson.
INTERROGATOR
He is fahking the small boys, man.
TROY
What are you talking about?
INTERROGATOR
He come to Egypt with the small
boys. I see picture in newspaper,
always he is with the small boys
in the hotel window. Hello with
the white glove. I am King of Pop
in my hotel with the small boys.
No girls. Just the boys.
TROY
He likes kids.
INTERROGATOR
Yeah, he like to fahk them up the
ass.
TROY
Bullshit.
Troy is smashed in the face with a clipboard.
He looks
angry, and like he could cry at the same time.
INTERROGATOR
You are the blind bullshit, my
main man.
It is so obvious he
like the small boy so he all the
time travel with them.
TROY
Fine.
INTERROGATOR
And if it really true? You say --
TROY
I say it's sick.
INTERROGATOR
That's because you got a sick
country, bro, you got no respect
for the children. That's why you
bomb them over here, right?
TROY
I don't think so.
INTERROGATOR
Michael Jackson is Pop King of
sick fahking country.
TROY
Wrong.
Troy is smashed in the face with the clip board.
Blood drips
from his nose.
INTERROGATOR
Bullshit wrong, dude. A black man
make the skin white and the hair
straight. You know why?
TROY
No.
INTERROGATOR
Your sick fahking country make the
black man hate hisself, just like
you hate the Arab and the children
you bomb.
TROY
I don't hate children.
INTERROGATOR
Do they care, buddy?
TROY
Does who care?
INTERROGATOR
Do your army care about the Shiite
children? Do they come to help?
TROY
No, they're not coming.
The Interrogator signals someone O.S. and suddenly voltage
races through the wire, causing Troy to gnash his teeth
together so hard they chip. He writhes in pain.
INTERROGATOR
(in subtitles)
That seemed like too much volts.
You got to build it up slow.
A SECOND IRAQI gestures defensively at a console that is
connected to the wire around Troy's jaw.
A THIRD IRAQI
reaches forward and turns a dial.
The SECOND IRAQI murmurs
defensively and turns the dial back.
INTERROGATOR
Just figure it out.
The Interrogator turns back to Troy.
INTERROGATOR
Are they coming to help the Shiite?
TROY
No.
He is jolted again -- his face contorts, he bites his lip.
INTERROGATOR
Tell the truth, dudesky. Save us
the big bummer.
Troy starts to cry, represses it. His lip is bleeding.
INTERROGATOR
Does it hurt?
Troy says nothing.
INTERROGATOR
I ask you question, bro.
TROY
Yes, it hurts.
INTERROGATOR
You bomb my family. Do you know
that?
Troy starts shaking slightly.
INTERROGATOR
You blow up my home. The whole
street. My wife is crush by big
fahking block of concrete. She
lose her legs, bro, and she got
nice legs, too. Those legs cut off
now.
Emotion comes into the INTERROGATOR'S VOICE as he says this.
TROY
(whispers)
That's horrible.
INTERROGATOR
What?
TROY
(whispers)
I said, that's horrible.
INTERROGATOR
Oh, my God, buddy. I didn't even
told you the horrible part yet.
The other two guards listen sadly.
INTERROGATOR
My son was kill in his bed. Did
you heard that, dude?
TROY
Yes.
INTERROGATOR
He is one years old. He is
asleeping with his toy doll when.
the bomb come. You see that guy
over there?
He lose his daughter
same way: big USA bomb.
CLOSE UP the two guards -- one of them wipes away a tear.
FANTASY - CONCRETE AND PLASTER
falls onto the bed of a sleeping child.
BACK TO THE SCENE
TROY
I have a daughter.
INTERROGATOR
Very nice for you, bro. She is
safe in Ohio without the bombs and
concrete and all this shit--
FANTASY - DARLENE
pushes a baby carriage down an idyllic tree-lined sidewalk.
INTERROGATOR (OS)
How old is she?
TROY (OS)
Ten days old.
INTERROGATOR (OS)
What's her name?
BACK TO THE SCENE
TROY
Krystal.
INTERROGATOR
What makes you decide to tell me
about Krystal, my main man?
TROY
Because we're both fathers.
INTERROGATOR
I'm not a father no more, dude,
remember? My son is dead now.
TWO DOZEN PEOPLE are laying down, being treated by SHIITE
CLERICS in black who squeeze aloe onto facial blisters.
At the end of the hall, Archie grits his teeth in pain as a
CLERIC uses a turkey baster to shoot alcohol into his
infected wound. Archie SCREAMS in pain.
Doc paces, exhaling; he has white ointment on his face.
DOC
I'm OK. I'm cool. I'm a survivor.
A Shiite changes Vig's bloody bandage, while a DEAD BODY is
laid next to Vig and wrapped in cloths; two clerics chant.
VIG
Is that guy dead? Where you gonna
put him?
SHIITE CLERIC
A shrine.
VIG
What kind of shrine ya'll got?
SHIITE CLERIC
Shrine that wash 700 year of sin.
VIG
Hey, that's a pretty good shrine,
right, Doc?
Doc stares at Vig.
VIG
I'm sorry I hit you, man. I was
scared for Troy, I don't want
nothing to happen to him, he's my
friend. Doc? Come on, man, I know
you was comin' to help me --
Vig reaches out blindly for Doc's hand. Doc looks for a
moment at Vig's hand in the air, reaching, then takes it.
They remain silent for a moment, hands clasped.
VIG
Maybe we got kicked out of the
ring of Jesus fire, on account of
stealing.
DOC
That's not how it works.
VIG
How does it work?
DOC
I take care of what Jesus puts in
front of me. That's what we did
with the gold.
VIG
What about now?
DOC
I'm gonna see.
Archie walks up, his arm bandaged, and inspects Vig's face.
ARCHIE GATES
How you doing, Conrad?
VIG
I'm good to go, chief.
ARCHIE GATES
Let's check the suitcases.
Archie, Doc, and Vig check the Vuitton suitcases, opening
them, looking at the gold, shutting them.
PAN TO children in bandages watch Archie inventory the gold.
DOC
We're missing 28.
ARCHIE GATES
That leaves 92 suitcases, five
bars each --
They think.
ARCHIE GATES
23 million dollars. Not bad for a
disaster, provided we can find
Barlow, get back before dark and
not get busted.
He looks at Doc and Vig.
ARCHIE GATES
It was my choice today. So you can
head back if you want. I'll find
Barlow myself.
DOC
What about the gold?
ARCHIE GATES
Take what you can carry. Try to
find a vehicle. Bury what you have
outside camp. Be careful about it.
They look at Archie.
VIG
I want to find Troy.
Doc thinks.
DOC
I'm in.
ARCHIE GATES
OK, where does that leave us? We
don't have any water, we're
dehydrated. You got a radio here?
The Shiite Man In Glasses puts oils on his Little Girl's face.
ARCHIE GATES
How is she?
The Shiite Man In Glasses does not answer.
DOC
How -- is -- your -- little
girl?
Vig wears glasses over his eye bandage; he mimes the Girl.
VIG
Broken -- arms. Girl.
MAN IN GLASSES
She's traumatized, what the fuck
do you expect?
They look at him, surprised.
MAN IN GLASSES
I went to b-school at Bowling
Green.
VIG
What's b-school? Is that like
terrorist training?
DOC
Business school, Conrad.
MAN IN GLASSES
I came back to open a couple of
hotels near Karbala. I'm almost in
the black when Saddam starts this
stupid fucking war and you guys
bomb the shit out of my cafes. Now
we try to get rid of Saddam, Bush
leaves us twisting in the wind, Un-
be-fucking-lievable man.
ARCHIE GATES
You got a radio?
MAN IN GLASSES
No radio. No water.
He wipes bits of white foam from the corners of his mouth.
ARCHIE GATES
Where's Barlow?
MAN IN GLASSES
They got him, I saw it happen. And
they won't take him back to the
same place.
ARCHIE GATES
Where would they take him?
MAN IN GLASSES
Oasis Bunker. It's full of
Saddam's hard core guys.
DOC
Where's that?
MAN IN GLASSES
Like 17 - 18 klicks from here.
ARCHIE GATES
Take us there.
MAN IN GLASSES
We got no wheels.
ARCHIE GATES
We'll walk until we find some.
MAN IN GLASSES
Why don't you call in the Marines?
ARCHIE GATES
With what? We don't have a radio.
MAN IN GLASSES
OK, we'll find a vehicle. You
drive back to get the choppers,
they fly in to get your man.
Doc and Vig look at Archie.
ARCHIE GATES
We can't do that.
MAN IN GLASSES
Why not? You got a huge army here.
ARCHIE GATES
We're not supposed to be involved
with Shiites. We killed Iraqi
soldiers. We broke the peace-
accord.
MAN IN GLASSES
Tell them it happened when you
reclaimed the gold. Don't tell
them it was about us.
ARCHIE GATES
They'd find out, we'd go to jail.
MAN IN GLASSES
You know what I think? I think
maybe you're boosting the gold.
That's what I think.
Archie looks at him.
ARCHIE GATES
You're wrong.
MAN IN GLASSES
They got half a million men in the
desert, they send four guys to
pick up all this bullion? I don't
think so.
Archie looks at Vig and Doc.
ARCHIE GATES
We need to find our man. How much
do you want to take us there?
MAN IN GLASSES
Fifteen suitcases.
ARCHIE GATES
That's too much.
VIG
Give it to him. We've got a lot.
ARCHIE GATES
We're gonna need it to buy our way
back today, so we better spend it
wisely. I'll give you eight.
MAN IN GLASSES
You need some guns, right? You
lost your gear.
ARCHIE GATES
Yeah, we need some guns.
MAN IN GLASSES
You need some fighters, too. I
mean, you can try to take Oasis on
your own, but look at these
grunts --
Doc and Vig look pissed. Archie's arm is in pain.
ARCHIE GATES
Yeah, OK, we need some fighters.
MAN IN GLASSES
So that's worth more than eight
suitcases.
ARCHIE GATES
Ten.
MAN IN GLASSES
Fifteen.
Archie looks at him.
ARCHIE GATES
That's four million dollars.
MAN IN GLASSES
I think we need it more than you,
John Doe, don't you?
He extends his hand. They shake.
ARCHIE GATES
Archie Gates.
IMAM (MAN IN GLASSES)
Imam Katar. I'll give you back
five suitcases to get us over the
Iranian border.
ARCHIE GATES
What?
IMAM
We gotta get to a refugee camp or
we're dead. The camps are in Iran.
DOC
We can't go to the Iranian border.
IMAM
Then we don't have a deal.
VIG
Give me a fucking break, man.
DOC
We saved your life.
IMAM
And we saved yours.
ARCHIE GATES
We lost a man for you.
IMAM
What good is it if you leave us to
get wasted? The big army of
democracy beats the ugly dictator,
saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you
go to jail if you help us escape
the same dictator.
You saw what
happened to my wife. Look at my
daughter.
Archie looks around. He sees Imam's daughter, other bandaged
children looking at him. A few mothers.
ARCHIE GATES
Who's going?
IMAM
Everyone but the priests. That's
55.
VIG
Fuck it. We'll find this place on
our own.
IMAM
It's not on a map. You can look.
DOC
Somebody else will take us.
Doc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up
DOC
Who will take us to Oasis bunker?
Fifty Shiites turn and look at him silently. Doc dumps a
whole suitcase of gold bars. Imam translates.
IMAM
Jarat yalam fantam uraz.
People stare at the gold and say nothing.
IMAM
I don't think so.
VIG
This is a human life we're talking
about.
IMAM
(laughs)
Tell me about it.
His daughter looks at him and laughs -- until her laughter
becomes scary, hysterical and Imam tries to hold her still
and she won't stop as Archie, Doc, Vig watch.
CLOSE ON -- Head of a golf clubdriver: "Made in USA."
Interrogator holds the golf club near the head, paces.
INTERROGATOR
I only join Saddam Hussein army to
make good living for family, good
car, good house, and now my son is
dead.
TROY
I signed up for the extra cash,
too.
INTERROGATOR
We got a lot in common, dude. I
got training and guns from America.
TROY
Not from America.
INTERROGATOR
Oh, yeah, specialist guys come to
Iraq, train us when we fight Iran.
TROY
What did they train you in?
INTERROGATOR
Weapons, sabotage. Interrogation.
TROY
Great.
The Interrogator lights a Marlboro, exhales.
PUSH IN TO CLOSE UP on TROY'S FACE as the smoke envelopes him.
Darlene looks up and beams as Troy walks into the room, they
embrace on the bed.
INTERROGATOR (O.S.)
So what we get from this dirty
Iraq war you and me, huh?
FANTASY - TROY
holds the naked baby against his naked chest.
TROY
(whispers)
I don't know.
BACK TO SCENE
INTERROGATOR
(laughs)
You don't fahking know, right?! We
all scahmbag soldier who get
fahked, right?
TROY
Right.
Interrogator laughs and takes a practice golf swing.
TROY
So why are you doing this to me?
INTERROGATOR
It's my job, man, for Saddam, just
like your job when you bomb my
house.
TROY
It's not just a job, it still
matters what you do.
INTERROGATOR
Bullshit. It's all a job.
TROY
It still matters what you do, what
you're doing right now matters.
INTERROGATOR
Bullshit.
TROY
The art of war is not for killing
people, it's a stratagem to give
life to many with minimum
violence, minimum --
INTERROGATOR
Then why you bomb my fahking house
and kill my son? Can you think how
it feels inside your heart if I
bomb your daughter?
FANTASY - SLOW MOTION - A MISSILE
silently destroys Troy's suburban house.
BACK TO SCENE
TROY
Worse than death --
INTERROGATOR
It feels like this --
Holding the driver at the head, he raps the bridge of Troy's
nose.
TROY
Don't --
INTERROGATOR
Everyday, inside my heart --
He raps Troy's nose repeatedly to make his point.
INTERROGATOR
Like this, like this, like this --
He breaks Troy's nose with a crack.
A rug is pulled off the old stone floor, a panel is lifted.
Old pistols and rifles are pulled out.
Doc and Vig load and handle the old pistols.
ARCHIE GATES
Did we save anything from the
Humvee?
DOC
This bag.
Archie pulls two of the colored footballs from the beat up
pack. He looks at Doc as if to say "Great."
LATER
Archie's arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of
light blue plastic explosive around a football, presses small
nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a fuse in the
end of the ball. Another ball-bomb just like it has already
been constructed.
They pass through a cluttered room with six cots, down a
hallway, to a larger room where two more YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIERS
sit watching CNN. There is a defaced poster of Saddam, two
peacocks and three monkeys in the room, and the half-eaten
carcass of a zebra. The soldiers rise and half-bow to Archie.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
Food? You give food?
ARCHIE GATES
We don't have any food.
DOC
Where'd you get these animals from?
IMAM
(translates)
Kishan tramai jahal?
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
Kuwait Zoo. Nabal hazala fan taq.
IMAM
This is for you, my friend, to eat
if you are hungry.
The Iraqi Soldier offers a live monkey to Archie.
ARCHIE GATES
No, thank you.
IMAM
They're not barbarians, they're
starving.
DOC
I'm getting really dizzy, man.
Vig sticks out a WHITE TONGUE and nods.
ARCHIE GATES
We need water.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
Water all gone. No one have water.
ARCHIE GATES
Radio?
FRIENDLY IRAQI
No radio.
ARCHIE GATES
No radio, no water, but yes CNN.
The other Iraqis nod their heads and laugh nervously.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
George Bush get rid Saddam.
ARCHIE GATES
Not exactly.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
Congratulation!
He embraces Archie, who looks at Imam.
ARCHIE GATES
Would you explain to these
gentlemen that we need a vehicle
of some kind?
It is dark. With a click, several bare ceiling lights come
on. Archie, Doc, Vig, stare in amazement: It's an underground
garage filled with nine luxury cars: A ROLLS ROYCE, a JAGUAR,
a MERCEDES, an INFINITI CONVERTIBLE, FOUR CADILLACS, a WHITE
STRETCH LIMOUSINE. The friendly Iraqi smiles.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
From Kuwait.
Doc stops at the convertible.
DOC
Could I ask a question?
The Iraqi deserters look at him.
DOC
Does Lexus make this model?
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
No. Infiniti convertible only.
FRIENDLY IRAQI 2
No Lexus convertible.
DOC
Exactly what I said.
ARCHIE GATES
Listen. We use these cars to go
fight Saddam soldiers.
The Friendly Iraqi looks at Doc and laughs.
DOC
What's so funny?
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
Cannot take.
DOC
What do you mean, cannot take? We
kicked Saddam's ass. We definitely
take.
ARCHIE GATES
We are the United States military.
The Iraqi laughs.
IMAM
You're three guys with a bunch of
Shiites and no Humvee.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
Need money. Have no money. To eat.
To live. Kish falan azar yat imal
tanat.
IMAM
He says the Americans have many
tanks, many airplanes. We have
nothing.
The Iraqis do not look happy. Imam does simultaneous
translation as Archie holds forth.
ARCHIE GATES
We will rise up together.
IMAM
Jihala vamat.
ARCHIE GATES
Rise up together.
Doc and Vig look taken aback as Archie goes messianic.
ARCHIE GATES
Look at us. Working together. Many
races, many nations. Tell him, Doc.
DOC
We are united.
They raise their joined hands together.
ARCHIE GATES
United. George Bush wants YOU --
DOC
To stand up for yourself.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
George Bush.
ARCHIE GATES
He wants YOU --
DOC
You.
VIG
Praise Jesus.
ARCHIE GATES
Make the fight for freedom on your
own.
DOC
Oh, yes, you can.
VIG
Go, baby, go.
Archie walks around, looking into the eyes of each Iraqi
soldier, touching them on the shoulders.
ARCHIE GATES
Then America will follow.
IMAM
Jahal yaqat.
DOC
Jahal yaqat, brothers.
ARCHIE GATES
God bless America, and God bless
a free Iraq.
Iraqis burst into cheers.
ARCHIE GATES
What do you say now, my friend?
FRIENDLY IRAQI
Cannot give car.
ARCHIE GATES
Then I guess we'll have to buy
them.
VIG
Judas Priest will pump you, Doc --
DOC
I already had it with the Beach
Boys today.
VIG
One song.
Doc slams in a CD-- TRADITIONAL IRAQI FOLK WAILING PLAYS.
The Shiite riflemen in back smile as Vig scowls.
Archie drives. Imam sits in passenger seat with his daughter
on his lap. They listen to Iraqi music.
The Interrogator finishes putting tissue in Troy's bleeding
nose.
TROY
Your son wouldn't be dead if
Saddam didn't invade Kuwait.
FANTASY - IRAQI SOLDIERS
smash the windows of a Benneton store, then a Cartier store.
INTERROGATOR (O.S.)
I know.
TROY (O.S.)
I heard about some bad shit that
happened there.
FANTASY - IRAQI SOLDIERS
drag patients from their hospital beds and AN IRAQI SOLDIER
dives on top of a crying NURSE and starts to rape her while
a BABY is taken from an incubator, which is stolen.
BACK TO THE SCENE
TROY
Who's got the sick country?
INTERROGATOR
Maybe Saddam is very crazy, right?
And then you are crazy to bomb all
of Iraq.
TROY
Too much bombing is crazy, but not
saving Kuwait.
INTERROGATOR
You come here to save Kuwait
people?
TROY
Yes.
INTERROGATOR
Really?
(to the Second Iraqi)
Jahaza fan.
The Second Iraqi dips a bucket into an oil drum.
INTERROGATOR
Lots of people in trouble around
this world, my man. You don't
fight no fahking war for them.
TROY
You invaded another country. You
can't do that.
INTERROGATOR
Why not, dude?
TROY
It makes the world crazy. You got
to keep it stable.
INTERROGATOR
For what? Your pick up truck?
TROY
No, for stability. Stabilize the
region.
The Interrogator pulls a CD from Troy's pocket and jams it
into Troy's mouth.
INTERROGATOR
This is your fahking stability, my
main man.
The Interrogator uses the CD as a funnel to force-feed the
crude oil into Troy's mouth as he pours it from the bucket.
Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward
the bunker. A Shiite sits up front with him. Fifty yards from
the bunker, Vig turns sharply and drives in circles.
Archie, with Imam in the passenger seat, two Shiites in back,
speeds the Mercedes past the guards, around the right side,
to the back side of the bunker, skidding across the sand.
AERIAL VIEW
The Mercedes and the Rolls diverge around the bunker on
either side: Rolls on the left, Mercedes on the right.
Doc drives the Rolls around the left, to the bunker's rear.
A Shiite helps Vig wedge a piece of wood onto the gas pedal.
Vig suddenly grabs his hand in PAIN. The Shiite looks at him.
VIG
Splinter.
SHIITE
Come on.
Troy gags and spits, his front is covered in oil. The
Interrogator raises the bucket.
INTERROGATOR
Are you feeling stable enough for
more?
An EXPLOSION elsewhere in the bunker causes the lights to
flicker out.
Iraqi soldiers scurry in the darkness with flashlights. They
go to the rear door, pile up in the dark, pushing.
Chips of metal and plastic fly off as bullets hit the
chopper. Arabic chatter is heard over a crackling radio.
POV - FROM INSIDE THE CHOPPER
100 feet below -- Vig and six remaining Shiite riflemen are
running into the desert away from the chopper.
It is dimly lighted by a few mounted emergency lights.
Archie and Doc run down the empty stairs, through the big
main room -- it is empty. Archie goes down the right side,
kicks open a door --
It's the bathroom full of stolen stuff and cell phones --
Doc goes down the left side of the room -- kicks in a door --
a room full of Benneton sweaters in all colors.
Archie kicks in a door -- a room with shelves full of large
snow globes, thousands of them.
Doc kicks in a door -- a room cluttered with debris, but
there is another door at the far side of the room. He
approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.
Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency
light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi
torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the
emergency light with a screwdriver --
In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely
in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN
POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.
Archie turns to the Interrogator, who stands next to Troy.
INTERROGATOR
It's OK, buddy, we are just
talking now --
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Archie shoots the Interrogator in the
thigh. THE ONLY SOUND IS GUN SHOOTING, FLESH TEARING --
Blood thinly splatters across Troy's face as the Interrogator
grimaces and falls to the floor. The light flicks on a few
beats, then off a few beats.
Archie rips the wires from the table controls, goes to Troy,
unhinges the wire from his jaw.
The Interrogator writhes in pain on the ground. Archie takes
the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord
binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol.
Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears. He gets up, looks
down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into
the Interrogator's face.
The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back. Archie
watches, out of breath. Troy FIRES the gun just to the side
of the Interrogator's face, into the ground. The Interrogator
looks terrified, crying. Troy stares back, looks unhappy,
lowers the gun.
Troy and Archie look at each other for an intense moment.
ARCHIE GATES
Let's go.
Doc shoots the lock on the inner door and it finally opens.
He looks inside and sees, in a sunken room, 50 more Shiite
civilians huddled together. Archie rushes by with Troy.
ARCHIE GATES
Come on.
Archie and Troy run out of the bunker --
Archie and Troy run into Doc at the door, knocking him over.
They crouch inside the door; the chopper hovers low outside.
Archie's in great pain. He grimaces as he tightens the
bandage around his forearm. Troy is shaking uncontrollably.
Doc grabs Troy's shoulders firmly.
ARCHIE GATES
We're gonna get out of here alive,
just do what I say, do you hear me?
Troy nods. Archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in
C-4 from his small pack, and hands it to Doc.
Archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand.
ARCHIE GATES
Step, throw, one-two -- I'm gonna
give it a five second fuse. That
gives you two steps out the door.
PAN ACROSS Troy and Doc listen intently.
Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.
The three of them stand at the door, ready. Archie holds his
pistol ready. Doc holds the football, Troy holds the lighter.
ARCHIE GATES
Wait --
Troy flicks the lighter and with a shaking hand tries to
light the fuse. Archie steadies Troy's hand. The fuse is lit.
ARCHIE GATES
Go.
The chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the
plexiglas window and bounces off, not exploding. The pilots
look perplexed. The ball hits the ground and EXPLODES.
They run inside and take cover, catch their breath. Troy and
Doc look terrified.
ARCHIE GATES
OK.
Shorter fuse this time.
He pulls out the second ball, cuts another fuse, affixes it.
They wait at the door again, watching the chopper.
Troy lights the second fuse. They bolt out the door, Troy and
Archie FIRING pistols, Doc in the middle with the ball.
His breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to
the left side.
TROY'S POV
looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but
there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING
The POV turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing.
FLASHBACK TO THE OPENING SCENE, but with weird, MUFFLED
SOUND
SOLDIER #5
Take my picture.
VIG
Do you still want to sell pictures?
TROY
(distracted monotone)
For twenty.
SOLDIER #5
Twenty bucks?
VIG
War's been over five days, ain't
gonna be any more of this, Jim.
SOLDIER #5
Twenty dollars, man, what's the
meaning of life?
TROY
You're lucky you got to see
anybody shot in this war.
SOLDIER #5
Bobby, take my picture.
He holds the camera out.
SOLDIER #4
If he shot the guy, it's up to him.
SOLDIER #5
It's not like he shot a fucking
deer. It's the enemy.
VIG
It's Troy's enemy, yours for
twenty.
BACK TO THE SCENE - CLOSE UP
Troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide.
TROY'S POV
Archie and Imam step into frame. Archie looks down at Troy,
opens his waist pack, pulls out a sterile wrapped scalpel.
TROY'S POV TURNS TO THE SIDE --
FISH EYE LENS - The Jaguar pulls up in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.
Imam's Little Girl gets out of the passenger side, SLIGHTLY
SLOW MOTION, NO SOUND. Imam scolds her and gesticulates,
indicating she should be back with the others where it is
safe. The Little Girl embraces Imam and stares down at Troy
over her father's shoulder.
TWO DECODERS sit at a table wearing headphones. One writes
down: "BRER RABBIT AT 239 NORTH, DUMP THE REPORTER."
CLOSE UP A SNOW GLOBE is shaken and little green dollars
swirl inside the little world, settling upon an early desert
oasis, old buildings, palm trees, donkeys, Three Kings,
peasants carrying the baby Jesus, and a Mobil gas station.
WIDER TO REVEAL HUNDREDS OF SNOW GLOBES are pulled from the
shelves and put into old cloth bags.
POV THROUGH IRAQI GUN SIGHT -- cross hairs pan from Doc, to
Troy, to Imam, to Archie.
"I Get Around" CONTINUES. Troy excitedly gives instructions
to workers carrying out big rolls of carpet. He wears a short
sleeved white shirt and a dark tie. His wife gives his two
year old daughter to him as she holds a new baby and Troy
uses a respiratory inhaler.
CUT TO
Text over black: Doc Elgin applied to the U.S. Army Rangers,
but was denied. He then turned down Troy Barlow's offer to
partner in the carpet business and plans to join Archie
Gates' company.
