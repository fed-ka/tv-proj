      Through the morning swirl, we PICK UP CATHY pouring herself
      coffee from the machine, sipping its bitter brew. She
      carries her cup and an armload of files to her cubicle,
      passing JOE coming out of the D.A.'s office.

                                          CATHY
                            What's going on in there?

                            Looks serious. Marino says
                            to stick around until they're
                            done.

                                          CATHY
                            Why do I get the feeling I
                            better cancel lunch with my
                            father?

                                          JOE
                            Be happy to make it up to you
                            with dinner... ?

                                          CATHY
                            Sounds wonderful.

                                JOE

                            I'm sure dad would love to
                            have dinner with you
                            sometime.

      Joe gives her one of his looks... as EDIE passes with a
        newspaper.

      Behind them, the D.A.'s door opens. MARINO shakes hands
      with a delegation of weary-looking tough men in dark suits
      -- officials of a waterfront local.

                            Damn right. No corporation has

                            just because she feeds stray

                            spending a few days in the port
                            of New York, Chandler.

                            Those union guys are scared stiff.
                            It isn't just any mob. It's Mitch

                            five years ago?

      Marino hands Cathy a bulging folder.

                    Wait a sec. The guy Denton was
                      supposed to have beaten to death
                    with his own hands five years
                      ago... wasn't he a federal
                      investigator doing the same
                      thing?

      CRANE OPERATOR

      as a wordless message passes between them.



      CAMERA PANS across this ancient and cracking place to pick
      up VINCENT reading from an old leather-bound first edition
      of Kipling's "Captains Courageous" to an arthritic older
      man with failing eyesight, SAM DENTON, propped up in bed
      on several pillows. Sam's a gaunt, rawboned man with a face
      that looks as if it were carved in granite... as if infinite
      suffering has been met with dogged, unyielding spiritual
      strength.

        A young boy from the underworld, LUKE, 14, sits with them.
      Tough, intelligent good looks with the blood of several
      races mixed in with a defiant but vulnerable nature.

                                    VINCENT
                              (reading)
                    "He was fainting from seasickness,
                    and a roll of the ship tilted him
                    over the rail on to the smooth
                    lip of the turtle-back. Then a
                    low, gray mother-wave swung out
                    of the fog, tucked Harvey under
                    one arm, so to speak, and pulled
                    him off and away to leeward; the
                      great green closed over him "

        Vincent stops. Sam's eyes are closed in reverie.

                                    VINCENT
                              (continuing)
                      Sam... ?

      He gently puts his hand on Sam's arm. The old man coughs,
      opens his eyes. 

                                          VINCENT
                              (continuing)
                      Sam? Are you all right?

                            (weary smile)
                Gave you a scare, did I?

                      "Captains Courageous." I like
                    this book. Never did get around
                    to reading Kipling.

                                    VINCENT
                      Never to read Kipling is almost
                    as bad as never being young ...
                    or never dreaming of sailing your
                    own boat across uncharted seas
                    to mysterious lands.

                      What's wrong, Sam?

                      People always let you down.

      Vincent covers him up to let him sleep, turns off the light.

                                    VINCENT
                    You never let us down. I'll
                      always be here for you.

      Vincent leaves quietly with Luke.



      Vincent and Luke return home.

                    you tell me?

                                    LUKE
                              (grimaces)
                      I don't know. I'm fourteen years
                    old and everybody but you treats
                    me like a kid. I want to get out
                    of the tunnels for a while... have
                    some fun... do something
                      important.

                                    VINCENT
                      Maybe you'd like to come up to
                    the Brooklyn Bridge with me one
                      night?

                                    LUKE
                    The Brooklyn Bridge? Not exactly
                    my idea of a big night out. Now
                    if you said a ride in a Corvette
                    --


                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                     12.

                                    VINCENT
                              (smiles)
                    There are ways. That might be
                      possible.
                            (beat)
                    But we have to make a deal. Sam
                      helped us for a lot of years,
                      didn't he? Where do you think
                    we got so much of our food from?
                      Helping him isn't much to ask in
                      return, is it?

                                    LUKE
                            (nods)
                      I guess not.

                                    VINCENT
                    He needs our help, so we help him.
                      That's our way.

      They're interrupted by KIPPER running to meet them.

                                    KIPPER
                    Got a message for you, Vincent.
      He hands Vincent the written message. He reads it quickly.

                                    VINCENT
                      I have to go. We'll talk later, 
                   Luke.

                                    LUKE
                      Remember ... a Corvette!

        Vincent gives Luke an affectionate touch... hurries away.

                                    LUKE
                    One day I'm gonna go up top as
                      often as Vincent.

                           KIPPER
                    That right?

                                    LUKE
                      Nobody tells Vincent,  Stay off
                    the streets.  No one pushes him
                      around. No one tells him who to
                    hang around with or what to do.
                      That's for me --

      Luke stares down the tunnel after Vincent.




                                                                                                                                        13.



      Denton climbs the rickety stairs, stepping over loose
      boards. He knocks on Sam's door. The old man opens it,
      supporting himself on crutches.

                                          SAM
                            C'mon in, Luke. I was just --

      He stops, stares at Denton's crooked grin.

                                          DENTON
                            Hello, Sam. How are you?

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              16.

                                    SAM
                      What're you doing here?

                                    DENTON
                      Aren't you glad to see me? After
                    five years --

                                    SAM
                      I didn't ask you to come back.
                    What do you want now?

                                    DENTON
                    What kind of talk is that? I
                    heard the old ticker gave out on
                    you while I was in the cage. I
                    was worried. Can't I come in?

                                    SAM
                              (angry)
                      I don't want you here.

                                    DENTON
                    Easy, old man. The last guy who
                      talked to me like this --

                                    SAM
                              (nods slowly) 
                      You're a killer, all right.
                      Underneath that fancy suit --

                                    DENTON
                      Come on, Sam. You're my old man.
                      We've had enough wasted years
                      between us. Let me give you this
                      --


      He pulls out a roll of bills.

                                    SAM
                      Keep your blood money.

                                      DENTON
                      Have it your way. But I'm setting
                      myself up again in the old
                        neighborhood. I just thought we
                      could make up.

                                    SAM
                      How do you make up for all the
                      innocent people you've hurt and
                      killed? They should've kept you
                      locked up in prison.

       (CONTINUED)                                                             17.


        CONTINUED: (2)

                                    DENTON
                              (flaring)
                      The way you kept me locked up
                      for years?

        ANGLE TOP OF STAIRS

        where Luke has crept up to listen. He's startled by this
        confrontation.

      BACK TO SAM AND DENTON

                                    SAM
                      I tried to do the best I
                      could for you.

                                      DENTON
                      Sticking me down in those
                      tunnels like a rat?

                                    SAM
                      That's not the way it was! The
                      city was going to take you
                      away
                       - put you in some foster home
        Denton looks at him with a hard expression.

                                      DENTON
                      At least I would've breathed
                      fresh air every day.

      He storms away downstairs, past Luke pressed against the
        shadows. Sam hobbles out after Denton on his crutches.

                                    SAM
                      I did my best for you --

        There are tears in Sam's eyes. A pain and longing behind
        the rage that he cannot express. Luke stares at him in
        confusion as Sam's voice breaks:

                                   SAM
                              (continuing)
                     My son --



        Denton comes downstairs, angrily slams his fist against the
        stairwell, gains control of himself. He starts out into
        the street... has a thought... looks down the stairs into
        the basement. A bitter smile plays on his face. He decides
      to go down another flight.                                                                              18.



        Denton pushes open the door against piled rubble and old
        boxes. He knows what he's looking for as he pulls a rotting
        old furnace aside to reveal a hidden area of crumbling
        brick. He pulls several bricks away, uncovers a tunnel
        entrance.

        ANGLE - LUKE

        watching from the basement door, stunned by Denton's
        knowledge of the tunnel.



        Denton climbs through, clicks his lighter on to illuminate
        the way. He carefully heads down the tunnel, stops to cock
        his head at the distant CLANGING PIPES... nods to himself
      in recognition at the sound... moves on.

        LUKE

        far behind in the tunnel ... quickly finds a pipe, and a
        stone, taps out a message of warning to the underground.



        Vincent and FATHER are studying some plants and flowers.

                                      FATHER
                      I've always loved flowers. Except
                      for Aphrodite, there's nothing
                      lovelier in the world than a 
                      flower.

                                    VINCENT
                      You really believe they
                      have feelings... ?

                                      FATHER
                      Of course. We only think they
                      lack feelings because we don't
                      take
                      the time to watch and learn
                      from them --

        Kipper bursts in.

                                      KIPPER
                      Intruder! Luke just sent a
                      warning. There's an intruder in
                      the tunnels --

      On their alarm:                                                                              19.



        Denton's feet echo as he moves along the pipes... reaches an
        ancient heavy iron door. He hesitates, opens it, goes
        through.

      We SEE Luke following at a distance, deeply curious.



        Denton climbs down a rusty ladder set in the old brick.
      He looks around... frowns. This is unfamiliar. There's
      an old red-brown arch, filthy with decay... a deep black
        well. From the other side of the walls, there is a RUMBLE
      of drainage water. Denton gropes along the side of the
        well, looks down unhappily... decides to retrace his steps.

      As he reaches for the ladder again, there's a sudden GROWL
      from the darkness around him. He jumps back in fear.

                                      DENTON
                      Who's there...? 

      LUKE

        looks down from the top of the ladder, trying to see what's
        happening.

        DENTON

        stares at the shadow coming closer... looming over him.
        Then suddenly... he laughs.

                                      DENTON
                      Jesus! You scared the life outta
                      me!

        VINCENT

        emerges into the dim light. He's a powerful, intimidating
        figure. But Denton gets to his feet, unafraid, grinning.

                                      DENTON
                              (continuing)
                      Hello, Vincent. Don't you
                      recognize me? I've come home,
                      old friend. I've come home --

                                    VINCENT
                              (fierce)
                      Why are you here? You're not
                      welcome.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              20.

                                      DENTON
                      Don't get so excited. I couldn't
                      resist. Came back to see the old
                      man, thought I'd check out the
                      tunnels --

                                    VINCENT
                      So you could find me?

                                    DENTON
                      Why would I want to do that, old
                      friend?
                              (grins)
                      Just because you refused me
                      sanctuary down here five years
                      ago? Because you chained me to
                     a pipe in the cellar of a police
                     precinct house? Those are old
                     headlines. 

                                    VINCENT
                      What do you want?


        Denton shrugs, looks around at the cracks and ledges and
      round black mouths of passages.

                                      DENTON
                      Told you. I was curious... You
                      changed the tunnel entrances.
                      I got lost.

                                    VINCENT
                      We change them all the time...
                      to keep out scavengers.

                                      DENTON
                      Now you've hurt my feelings. Me,
                        a scavenger? Hey, remember how
                      afraid you were of the drainage
                      water going out to the harbor --

                                    VINCENT
                              (growling dangerously)
                      What I remember is that you
                      murdered a man... that you chose
                      to live by violence. I remember
                      that you ceased to be one of us
                      years ago.

                                      DENTON
                      What are you trying to do? Tell
                      me off? Why, you lousy freak --

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                        21.

                                    VINCENT
                      Leave the underground. Now. If
                      you come again, I can only
                        believe you intend us harm.

                                    DENTON
                              (sneers)
                        Come back here? You think I'd
                        want to hang around this hole?
                        Eight years I lived down here
                        and what did it get me -- ?

                                    VINCENT
                        You were a fool. You had a
                        chance for a better life -- if
                        you'd had the sense to see it.


                                      DENTON
                        Living like a rat? I got a chance
                        at a better life -- but I took
                        it! After I ran away from here, I
                        had to sweat blood to get work in
                        the stinking hold of a cargo
                        ship. Taking over the docks took
                          a little doing, you know. Some
                        pretty mean guys were in the way-
                        -

                                      VINCENT
                        And you had them killed

                                      DENTON
                              (taunting)
                        If you believe that... kill me.
                        You're a dangerous animal,
                        aren't you? Kill me now.

        Vincent's fangs draw back. But he turns away, opens a grill
        doorway.

                                    VINCENT
                        I'll show you the way out.
                        Don't ever come back.

                                      DENTON
                              (cynical smile)
                        I knew you couldn't hurt me. Same
                        old noble Vincent. The animal who
                        thinks he can walk like a man.

        Denton saunters out. On Vincent's barely restrained rage

                                                                  FADE OUT.

                                            ACT TWO


      FADE IN:


      CLOSE on bricks and mortar being used to block up a tunnel
        entrance... WIDENING to Vincent directing Kipper and several
      other kids at work.

                                    VINCENT
                        Block off all the entrances
                        around here. He mustn't be
                        allowed to find his way back
                        down.

                                    KIPPER
                        Be done in a couple of hours.


      As Kipper moves off to direct the building crew, Luke
      appears at Vincent s side, carrying the leather-
      bound "Captains courageous."


                                    LUKE
                        Thought I'd go up top and see
                        Mr. D. Maybe read to him a
                        bit.

                                    VINCENT
                        What's this? You're
                          volunteering?

                                    LUKE
                              (shrugs)
                        I like old Sam.

                                    VINCENT
                            (a smile)
                        He'll be happy to see you again.

      Luke turns, hesitates.

                                    LUKE
                              (intrigued)
                        I used to hear some of the
                        older kids talk about Mitch
                        Denton. How he really made it
                        big on the surface.

                                    VINCENT
                        He didn't make anything,
                        Luke. He broke and
                          destroyed human beings.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                          23.

                      I guess he must've done a lot of
                      rotten things. But he sure showed
                      everybody he was something special
                    and could do what he wanted.

                                    VINCENT
                              (forceful)
                    You don't know anything about him.
                      Denton was like a cancer in our
                      community --

                                    LUKE
                      I heard what he said to you. I
                    know what he meant. He was sick
                    of being nothing.

                                    VINCENT
                      Listen to me, Luke. If you'd seen
                    the things Denton has done --

                                    LUKE
                    I've seen enough things.
                              (bleak)
                    I've seen my moma bleed to death
                    like a pig 'cas some junkies slit
                    her. She was falling and trying
                    to stay on her feet... I watched
                    her die. I was crying.
                              (defiant)
                    Well, I ain't never gonna cry
                      again!

        Moist-eyed, he hurries away before Vincent can stop him.

                                    VINCENT
                    Luke!

      But the boy's gone. On Vincent's concern:



      Cathy's pleading with the union official, De Corsia, and
      several longshoremen, whom we should recognize from the cargo
      hatch earlier. JACK SWEENEY is the young longshoreman who
      tried to push Fraser to safety. McQUADE is a hard little
      bantam of a man. SHANKS a good-natured, hulking longshoreman.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                    If you could just give me one
                      piece of evidence linking Denton
                    to your friend's murder, we'd have
                      a start.

                                    DE CORSIA
                    Come on, guys. We can't help you
                      unless you help us. I know each
                    one of you puts in a few bucks
                    every day to Denton to keep
                      working --

                                    SWEENEY
                    Big help the union's been --
                              (bitter)
                      I told Fraser there'd be no use
                    talking to you. Keep quiet, we'll
                    all live longer.

                                    McQUADE
                      Denton killed Fraser and I don't
                    aim to be next. 

                                    CATHY
                           (exasperated)
                    Then why did you agree to meet
                    me now?

                                    SHANKS
                      Because Fraser was our friend.
                    He thought the union and the D.A.
                    could help.

                                    DE CORSIA
                              (sighs)
                    Our union investigators confirmed
                    the crane operator's story.
                      Mechanical malfunction.

                                    SWEENEY
                      Mechanical malfunction, my ass!
                    Who paid off those investigators?
                    I saw Cujo push Charlie Fraser
                    right under that generator.

                                    CATHY
                    Then give me a sworn statement --

                    And risk my family's lives? Sorry,

                      That's exactly what you have to

                    We already took a big chance

                    I'm sorry. We've done all we can.

      Cathy and De Corsia sadly watch the men file out.

                                    DE CORSIA
                    He's right. Took a lot of guts to
                    show their faces here.

                                    CATHY
                      I feel so helpless. If they'd

                    and baseball bats.

      On Cathy's helplessness:




      Luke comes up the stairs, carrying  Captains Courageous. 
      He s surprised to find Sam's door ajar ... pushes it wider.

                    It's me, Luke. I got your

      A hand suddenly lifts him bodily by the scruff of his neck.
        A SCAVENGER THIEF -- grungy, scarred, doped out of his mind.
      The SECOND SCAVENGER has Sam trembling at knifepoint,
      crutches kicked out from under him.

      The second scavenger's breathing hard, eyes lit up in
      orgasmic bliss as he fondles his knife. But he doesn't get
      any further. Mitch Denton bursts into the apartment, heaves
      the knife-wielder off his feet with maximum force... cannons
      him into the wall. The first scavenger throws the bedside
      lamp. Denton ducks. The lamp smashes. Luke scrambles to
      pull Sam free of the melee as Denton brings his knee into
      the scavenger's groin. SHOUTS of anguish. The scavengers
      run for their lives.

                                    DENTON

                    Sam -- you okay?

      Denton helps Luke get Sam upright in a chair.

                      I'm fine -- fine --

                      I was asleep when they broke in.

                                    DENTON
                      Lucky I came back.

                                    SAM
                    Why the hell did you?

                                    DENTON
                    Is it so terrible to want to see
                    my old man? I've been having a
                    yen to mend our fences. You
                      complaining?

                                    SAM
                      Can't complain about your timing.

                      I guess a small part of you's
                      still the old Mitch.

                                    DENTON
                      That's more like it, Sam.

      Luke senses danger. He backs off, raises his fists, body
      tense.

                      Don't come near me, man.

                      I wasn't going to.

                    kids ...

      He gazes curiously at Luke.



      Father paces restlessly, deeply disturbed by Vincent's
      report.

                                  FATHER
                      This is bad news. Denton is a
                      force of evil. Pure.
                        Intelligent. Vicious. At war
                      with the world and himself.

                                    VINCENT
                      What am I to do if he comes again?
                      He's a danger to us all. I tried
                      to reason with him --

                                  FATHER
                      Reason with that man? For
                      centuries, we've struggled to
                      break the chains that bind us to
                      evil. Buddha in India...
                      Confucious in China... Plato and
                      Aristotle in Greece... they lit
                      the beacon fires, gave us the dawn
                      of hope and knowledge and
                      reason... yet still, still we
                      confront the eternal evil. No,
                      Vincent. Don't try to reason with
                      a man like Mitchell Denton.
 
        Kipper enters, disturbed.

                                    FATHER
                              (continuing)
                    It's all right, Kipper. What is
                    it?

                                  KIPPER
                    I'm not sure, Father. One of the
                    runners just saw Luke near the
                    east steam tunnels.

                                    VINCENT
                             (a smile)
                    He's' got exactly five minutes to
                    get back in time for his lesson.

                    I don't think he's coming back
                    for his lesson. The runner saw
                    him with Mitch Denton.

                                    VINCENT
                      Denton --

                      That's what he said. Luke's
                      brought Denton back into the
                      tunnels --

    On Vincent's shock:


      CLOSE on the initials "M.D." inscribed in old brick...
      WIDENING to Denton showing them to Luke.

                                    LUKE
                      You're "M.D?" And I thought this
                    was my special place.

                                    DENTON
                    My special place, too. Had to
                      bloody a lot of noses to keep it
                    just for me.

                                    LUKE
                      Me, too.
                              (grins)
                    You still fight pretty good. The
                    way you handled those scavengers
                    -- that was great.

                                    DENTON
                      Maybe I'll teach you a few tricks
                      when you come up top again. How'd
                      you end up down here, anyway?
                      Run away from home?

                                    LUKE
                      I didn't run away from home. Home
                      ran away from me when my mom
                      became a dopey. Our place was
                      a real shooting gallery.

                    Sam was too ill to raise me
                      himself -- after mom died. I used
                    to hate him for that... until
                    a few years in the can gave me
                    time to think things over. I
                    don't hate him any more --
                            (hard)
                    But I hated every day I was down
                    here. The tunnels were meant for
                      freaks like Vincent --

                    Hey, don't call Vincent a freak.
                    He's my friend.

                                    DENTON
                    He's not a man -- not like you
                    and me --

      Something hard and ominously sharp grips Denton's neck. He
      freezes... as Vincent emerges from the shadows, holding
      Denton with his claw, able to rip his throat in a single
      movement.

                                    VINCENT
                    Luke? Are you all right?

                    Go to him.

      Luke takes off at a run. Denton swallows with difficulty,
      sweat breaking out all across his face.

      Vincent's claws dig into Denton's neck. Denton finds
      himself lifted almost off the ground.

                    Leave the boy
                      alone.

      He drops Denton free. Denton scrambles away, clutching his
      throat, hissing resentfully.

                                    DENTON
                      That's a good one. Like a son

      He scuttles away down the tunnel, leaving Vincent stricken
      with pain and rage.



      She finds Vincent waiting in the darkness.

                      day --

                                    VINCENT
                            (urgently)
                      Catherine, I need your help.
                      Luke's run away.  He's gone with
                      Mitch Denton.

                                    CATHY
                      Why would he go with Denton?

                                    VINCENT
                      There's a side to Luke that's
                      tough and hard. Denton is drawing it
                    out to get back at me. Can
                      you help ?

                                    CATHY
                    Of course. But it'll be tough.
                    I'll need a search warrant for
                      Denton's office and home ... all
                    the waterfront holes he might be
                      keeping Luke. God, I don't know if
                      I can get one --

                                    VINCENT
                      I've got to find Luke. If Denton
                      harms him --

                                    CATHY
                    He has no reason to harm him.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                            (rising anger)
                      I should have torn his throat out
                    when I had him in the tunnels.

                                    CATHY
                            (appalled)
                    Vincent --

                                    VINCENT
                    Do I shock, you, Catherine? You
                    know there's something inside me
                    that waits for my anger... feeds
                    on my rage... and strikes without
                      mercy.

                                    CATHY
                    No! You've only harmed others
                    when there's been danger --

                                    VINCENT
                    When I feel pain... emotional
                    pain. I feel that for Luke. If
                      Denton were here now, something
                    evil inside me would make me
                    destroy him --

                                    CATHY
                      You're wrong, Vincent. There's
                    no evil in you, not the smallest
                      trace. The emotion you feel for
                    Luke is the love any father feels
                    for a child he cares about.

                                    VINCENT
                    The more I feel for Luke, the more
                      I sense this terrible rage. How
                    can I hold it back? The only way
                    is to love Luke less --

                                    CATHY
                    You could never do that.

                                    VINCENT
                    No --

                                    CATHY
                    It's the price we pay for love.
                    You feel, you need, you hurt --

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                           35.

                      Therefore I must live with this
                    thing inside me -- this thing I
                      cannot control -- that makes me
                    want to kill --

      She sees the depths of Vincent's pain. As tears fill
      Cathy's eyes.



      Cathy hustles to keep up with the D.A. as he heads out to
      the elevators.

                                    MARINO
                      Don't want much, do you?!

                      Intensive surveillance for at
                      least twenty-four hours.
                      Including phone taps.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              38.

                      Excuse me, Miss Chandler. It s
                    the end of the day and I've got
                    the Mayor's reception on my mind.
                    But did I miss something? Like
                      reasonable cause... ?

                                    CATHY
                    So forget phone taps. But if we
                    pull out all the stops... put
                    as many people on Denton as we
                    can spare...

                                    MARINO
                      That's crazy. I'm already
                      understaffed. Until you get
                      something I can take to a judge
                    --

      Joe crosses their path in time to hear:

                                    CATHY
                    I've already got a longshoreman
                    who saw the guy who pushed Charlie
                      Fraser under the generator.

                                    JOE
                    Where is he? Where's his
                      statement?

                                    CATHY
                              (reluctantly)
                    He won't come forward yet.

                                    MARINO
                    You give me that longshoreman --
                    then you get your surveillance
                      order.

                                    CATHY
                              (distraught)
                    We can't wait. For God's sake

      She catches herself. Marino and Joe are staring at her.

                                    MARINO
                    Tell me, Chandler, why did you
                    want to work in the D.A.'s office?

                                    CATHY
                      Because I wanted to make a
                      difference. What's that got to
                    do--

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                    MARINO
                      That's fine and dandy. But if
                    you don't mind my saying so,
                      you've had kind of a rarefied
                      upbringing. This isn't Camelot.
                      I don't send knights into battle
                      against dragons. We're down and
                      dirty. That means a lot of sweat
                    and legwork so that we can
                      prosecute according to the law.
                      Evidence, Chandler. Evidence!

      Marino steps into the elevator. Discussion's over. As the
      doors close on him, Joe gives Cathy a sympathetic look.

                                    JOE
                      Better learn how to grow an extra
                      layer of skin.

                                    CATHY
                              (sharp)
                    You mean pretend I don't care?

                                    JOE
                    Low blow, Radcliffe.

                                    CATHY
                      I'm sorry, Joe 


                                      JOE
                              (softly)
                      We all know you care, Cathy.
                      Sometimes that just isn't
                      enough.

      On Cathy'S frustration:



      Cathy enters, finds Jack Sweeney in a back booth, brooding
      over a drink. She goes over.

                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                      41.





                                    CATHY
                    Buy you a drink?

                                    SWEENEY
                    Don't give up, do you?

      She slips into the booth.

                                    CATHY
                      I need a sworn statement that you
                    saw Denton's man push your friend
                    under the generator. 

                                    SWEENEY
                    You're crazy. Only way to smash
                    Denton is with a steel pipe in
                   a dark alley. Maybe one night
                   I'll do just that.

                                    CATHY
                      Denton will kill you and plead
                      self-defense. Help me fight him
                    in court with the D.A. and the
                    union behind you.

                                    SWEENEY
                    You know what you're asking?
                      You're asking me to --

                                    CATHY
                              (appealing)
                      Please, Mr. Sweeney. What if I
                    tell you a young boy's life is
                    at risk ?

                                    SWEENEY
                    My family's lives are already at
                      risk. In God's name, what do you
                    want from me?

                                    CATHY
                      Wrong question, Mr. Sweeney. What
                    do you want from yourself... ?
      On Cathy's appeal and Sweeney's anguish:                                                                              42.



      Luke uses a flashlight from his bag... creeps down past a
      door. The light and sounds of a security guard's TV.

                                    GUARD'S VOICE
                    Who's there?

      Luke snaps off his light... freezes.

                                    GUARD'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                    Hey, down there!

        FOOTSTEPS from above. Luke races down the stairs. The
      guard FIRES. CRACK! The bullet whacks into a wall. Luke
      gasps as slivers of brick cut the side of his face.



      Late. Edie looks in on Cathy, brooding at her desk.

                                    EDIE
                    Penny for them?

                                    CATHY
                    What... ? Oh. I don't know.
                      Nothing. Everything. My job.
                    The waterfront. A friend in
                      trouble. Sometimes, I feel as
                    if I'm no use to anybody.

                                    EDIE
                    Easy, girl. All part of life's
                    rich pageant.

                                    CATHY
                              (laughs)
                    Come on. Buy me a drink.

      She reaches for her coat... stops at the sight of Jack
      Sweeney. He smiles awkwardly.

                                    SWEENEY
                      I talked to my wife. Kids, too.
                    We all figure the same. It's time
                    to stop letting Mitch Denton walk
                    all over us.

                                    CATHY
                              (lighting up)
                    Mr. Sweeney, I could kiss you.
                    In fact, I think I will!

      She hugs him joyfully... as the phone rings. Edie picks up.

                                    EDIE
                      D.A.'s office... She's right here.
                              (to Cathy)
                    The hospital -- ?

                                    CATHY
                              (takes phone, puzzled)
                      Hello... ? Yes... What... ?
                              (beat)
                      ... I don't
                        understand...
                                (stunned)
                      ... oh, God, no... of course...
                      I'll be there right away...

        Edie and Sweeney stare at the shock on Cathy's face:



      The distraught Cathy rushes in. A NURSE moves to stop her.

                                    NURSE
                    You'll have to stay outside --

      Cathy runs to where the DOCTORS are working full-speed on
      Luke. She stops short, devastated by the sight of him.
      His head is bandaged. Plastic tubes feed oxygen into his
      nose. Needles feed a colorless potion into his arm. White
      discs like suction cups on his smashed and bloody chest.
      The rhythms of his heart blipping on a screen.

                                    NURSE
                      Please... The doctor has to give
                    his full attention to the boy.

                                    CATHY
                      How bad is it... ?

                                    NURSE
                    He's in critical condition. His
                      right lung isn't exiting air.
                      Either it's full of blood or its
                      collapsed --

                                    CATHY
                      Luke --

                                    NURSE
                    Is that his name? We didn't know.
                      Somebody carried him here. There
                      was just a note with your name
                    on it.

                                    CATHY
                    If I could see him for a moment
                    --


                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                           46.

                                    NURSE
                      That's impossible. There's been
                    brain injury. A ruptured artery.
                    If you'll just wait --
      Cathy stares back at Luke as the nurse tugs her away.



      CLOSE on Vincent as a CRY of pain bursts from him...
      WIDENING to Cathy, sadly gazing at him.

                                    CATHY
                      They'll be operating all night.

                                    VINCENT
                      He's dying --

                                    CATHY
                    We don't know that. You got him
                    to the hospital in time. Luke
                    could pull through.

                                    VINCENT
                    I let him down. I should have
                      protected him.

                                    CATHY
                      Don't blame yourself. You did
                      everything you could. When the
                      police find Denton  

        Vincent's eyes glitter with hatred.

                                    VINCENT
                      I know where Denton is. I sent
                      runners out.

                                    CATHY
                      Where... ?

                                    VINCENT
                      I can't tell you. Forgive me,
                      Catherine. I have to do this
                      alone.

                                    CATHY
                    What are you talking about? I've
                    got a witness. We can move against
                      Denton now --

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                    VINCENT
                    It's too late. This time he has
                    to die.

                                    CATHY
                    That won't help Luke. You're in
                    pain. Don't let your feelings
                    take over  -

                                    VINCENT
                      I loved Luke. If I were truly
                    his father, wouldn't I have the
                    same need -- ?

                                    CATHY
                              (appalled)
                     The need to punish ... not to kill.

                                    VINCENT
                    Do I repel you now, Catherine?
                    You find me very ugly -- like a
                      beast?

                                    CATHY
                      I love you, Vincent. Nothing can
                      change that. But what you're
                    doing is wrong. Very wrong.

                                    VINCENT
                      I keep seeing Luke broken in my
                    arms --
                            (eyes lost)
                    You said it yourself. "Love is
                    the same for all --"

      He turns into the darkness... and the full horror of what
      he intends to do hits Cathy.

      ON VINCENT - MOVING SHOTS

      as he travels through the shadows... different kinds of
      tunnels... moving faster... until he is hurtling at
      incredible speed. Steam begins to swirl around him. A
      warrior in the mists.



      Denton stares from the open door at the darkness and the
      glow of the city beyond the river. Behind him: old
      machinery in what might have been a generator room to
      provide electricity to light the bridge.

      Nat joins him.

                                    NAT
                    You scared of this guy? How do
                    you even know he'll come after
                    you?

                                    DENTON
                    The kid must be dead. He'll come.

                                    NAT
                    I still don't get it. Who is he?
                    What's he look like?

                                    DENTON
                    When he comes... you'll know him.

      On Denton's bleak look:



        Vincent lies on his stomach, gripping the roof of a subway
      car as it hurtles through the darkness.



      Cathy paces anxiously ... turns quickly as Father appears.

                                    CATHY
                      Thank God you came. Do you know
                    what he's gone to do?

                                    FATHER
                              (sadly)
                      I know. I tried to stop him, too.
                      There's a fire in Vincent that
                    has to burn itself out.

                                    CATHY
                    Do you know where he is? We have
                    to stop him.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              49.

                                    FATHER
                    You can't stop him. I've always
                    been afraid a time like this would
                    come. When that instinct to kill
                    would rise up from deep within
                      Vincent --

                                    CATHY
                    We have to stop him! One half
                    of Vincent is struggling against
                    the other.
                              (voice breaking)
                    If that instinct triumphs over
                    the man --

                                    FATHER
                    He will never allow himself to
                    go on living.

                                    CATHY
                    Tell me where he's gone!

                                  FATHER
                            (long beat)
                    To a bridge --



      On a high balcony overlooking a chamber filled with rusting
      equipment, Denton stands holding a pistol as Nat and Cujo
      run out of another chamber with guns.

                                    DENTON
                      Get down there!

      Nat and Cujo clatter downstairs.



      Vincent's cloak vanishes behind machinery, into the shadows
      as Nat and Cujo burst inside... crisscross the room with
      bullets. They stop firing. Silence--



      Denton nervously moves away from the stairs. He can just
      about see the door Nat and Cujo ran through. He hears a SCREAM.
      Then a SHOT. SNARLS. The SOUND of something human being ripped
      to shreds. And silence.


                                    DENTON
                     Nat... ? Cujo... ?



      Denton backs into:



      A kind of old office. Cramped. Broken furniture. A window
        overlooking the river. Denton nervously waits. He HEARS a
      SOUND from outside. Somebody coming up the stairs. He
      stands rigid, off to the side by the window, waiting, gun
        extended.



      CAMERA FRAMES the open door. Suddenly the FRAME is filled
      by the sweaty, distorted face of Denton as he readies to
      fire. The SOUND comes closer. Nat staggers inside, ripped
      and bleeding, steps into Denton's arms. Denton pushes him
      away in horror as:

      VINCENT

      explodes through the window, shattering glass, thrusting
      his gloved hand through to grab Denton. He's climbed up
      the outside wall. Denton SCREAMS as Vincent draws him out
      backwards through the window.



      CLOSE on Luke hooked up to the machines, head and body
        swathed in bandages. He could be dead. There's the sound
      of the curtains being drawn... then Vincent's hand ENTERS
      FRAME... hovers over Luke's face. We WIDEN to REVEAL
      Vincent. It's late, the ward is silent and dark.

      Luke's eyes flutter. He stares up at Vincent with a kind
      of wonder.

                                    VINCENT
                    Don't say anything. You're going
                    to be all right.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              53.

                            (a whisper)
                   I'm sorry --

                                    VINCENT
                    You fought for life, the doctors
                    said. I'm proud of you.

                            (with difficulty)
                      I never meant to hurt you... I
                      didn't want to be a nobody...

                                    VINCENT
                    You could never be that, Luke.

                                    LUKE
                      I guess I made a big mistake. A
                      whopper.
                            (eyes fluttering)
                      Vincent... ?

                              (almost asleep)
                      Still gonna get that Corvette.

      Vincent sees the slightest hint of a smile on Luke's
      sleeping face ... looks down. The boy's hand has taken his
      own. And as we PULL BACK SLOWLY from Vincent keeping a
      silent vigil:
