               Chef's car speeds up the mountain road.

               A small, single snowflake falls from the sky and lands on 
               the sign that reads 'Hell's Pass Hospital - 35 miles'

               OMINOUS MUSIC STING.


               The snow falls on this small, humble clinic.

                                     MS. CARTMAN (V.O.)
                         I want to have an abortion.


               Chef's car pulls up. Snow is falling heavily.

                                     CHEF
                         Come on children, we gotta find a 
                         doctor!

               Stan stops at the door.

                                     STAN
                         I can't do it, dude!

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all 
                         that bad.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, stop being a wuss.

               AMW has not set up a little trailer, but a huge complex with 
               a sign: AMERICA'S MOST WANTED: SOUTH PARK HEADQUARTERS


               We see Chef's car being buried by the heavy snowfall.


               Snow has started to fall in South Park.


               A tree has blown over on the power lines. They spark in the 
               falling snow.


               The snow has absolutely buried the hospital. The eerie 
               moonlight makes the place look like something out of 'The 
               Shining'


               The snow is piled high all around America's Most Wanted. 
               Everything is absolutely covered.


               Everyone is lying on the dimly lit floor, looking as if they 
               haven't eaten for weeks.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         C... Can't go on... S-So H-hungry...

                         We're all going to die in this 
                         horrible place.

                         We have to have energy to make it 
                         through the night... We have to eat.

                         How can we? How could we live with 
                         ourselves?

                                     JIMBO
                         There's only one answer... Eat Eric 
                         Roberts.

               Eric Roberts panics.

                                     MAYOR
                         Yes... Of course. Nobody gives a 
                         shit about Eric Roberts.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Eat Eric Roberts...

                                     ERIC ROBERTS
                         No!

               Everybody closes in on Eric Roberts.

                                     ERIC ROBERTS
                         No, PLEASE!!

                                         ACT III


               Kenny crawls out of a small duct, covered with sewage. The 
               horrible storm blows around him in all directions, Kenny can 
               barely see.

               The doctor's voice blasts over Kenny's walkie talkie.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Team B... Come in, Team B.

                                     KENNY

                                     DOCTOR
                         Listen, Team B, we've found another 
                         path to the generator. There's 
                         actually a nice, heated walkway to 
                         it, so you don't need to walk through 
                         all that sewage.

               Kenny looks down at his sewage covered body.

                                     KENNY

                         Oh... Well forget I said that then. 
                         Listen, team B, you should be seeing 
                         a large drift of snow with some metal 
                         sticking out of it just to your 
                         left...

                                     KENNY
                         Mph, mpmh mphmh mm.

               Kenny spots the snow covered backup generator.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Good heads towards it, Team A out.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What if Mephesto never wakes up and 
                         I never find out who my father is?

               Little Kenny bravely treads through the deep snow, just as 
               the shadow of a velocoraptor runs by with a cry.


               Everyone appears to be eating somberly. We see Eric Roberts's 
               nearly skeletal corpse, and next to it, the corpses of the 
               director and his assistant.

               The Mayor forks over some meat off of the assistant director.

                                     MAYOR
                         My God what a harrowing tale of human 
                         drama this is! All of us doing what 
                         we must to survive.

                                     JIMBO
                         It is amazing what people can do 
                         under stress. Just look at the 
                         pyramids nobody knows how they built 
                         those. Or who.

                         Who built the pyramids? Was it the 
                         Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? 
                         Samaritans?

                         Mrmp mmme mrph.


               Kenny connects the lines with his hands and we see him light 
               up like a Christmas tree.



               The sun begins to rise.

               All over South Park, we see snow slowly melting as the sun's 
               rays drift over the land.

               A few birds come out and start singing as the light shows us 
               the town of South Park, half buried in snow.


               Cartman, Stan and Kyle are on their knees in the snow.

                                     STAN
                         He was a good friend, and I'll miss 
                         him.

                                     KYLE
                         He was very brave... He risked his 
                         life so that Mephesto could live.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, and now he's a freezie-pop.

               Now we see that Kenny is standing in front of the boys, frozen 
               like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, do you think if we hit him 
                         with a shovel he'd shatter?

                                     KYLE
                         I dunno, let's find out.


               A shovel appears through the snow. Jimbo squeezes his way 
               out and takes a deep breath of the crisp, morning air.

               One by one, the townspeople all step out of the building and 
               look up at the warm sun.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, it's over... We're free!

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Yes. But at what cost, Mr. Garrison? 
                         At what cost?

               A guilty hush falls over everyone.

                                     JIMBO
                         Listen everybody, we did what we had 
                         to in there.

                                     MAYOR
                         But... How will we live with ourselves 
                         now?

                         at a time.

               The camera PULLS BACK up and over the snow capped mountains 
               as Aaron Neville sings 'Ave Maria'

                                     AARON NEVILLE

                         Roberts in a doggie bag, does anybody 
                         else want some?
