      And THE DOCTOR watches them go.  Smiling. 

      Then turns, goes back into the Tardis.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Well, fat lot of good, this is! 
                    Back of beyond.  Bloody Norway! 
                    I'll have to phone your father,
                    he's on the nursery run -
                          (to Doctor #2)
                    I was pregnant, remember?  Had a
                    little baby boy.  

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                      Brilliant, what did you call him?

                                      JACKIE
                    Doctor.

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                    Really?!

                                      JACKIE
                    No, you plum.  He's called Tony.

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                    Tony Tyler?  Okay.  Nice.

      But Rose now looks back at the Tardis (dialogue's taken
      them a good 20 feet away, good distance).  At the Doctor.

                                    ROSE
                    ...but hold on.  This is the
                    parallel universe, right?

                    You're back home.

                                      DONNA
                    And the walls of the world are
                    closing again, now the Reality
                    Bomb never happened.  It's a
                      dimensional retroclosure - see, I
                    really get that stuff now!

                                    ROSE
                    No, but I spent all that time,
                    trying to find you.  I'm not going
                    back now.

                    But you've got to.  Cos we saved
                    the universe at a cost, and the
                    cost, is him.
                          (ie, Doctor #2)
                    He destroyed the Daleks.  He
                    committed genocide.  He's too
                    dangerous to be left on his own.

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                    You made me.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Exactly.  You were born in battle. 
                    Full of blood and anger and revenge.
                          (to Rose)
                    Remind you of someone?  That's me,
                    when we first met.  And you made
                    me better.  Now you can do the
                    same for him.

                                    ROSE
                    ...but he's not you.

                                    THE DOCTOR

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                    I look like him.  Think like him.

                      everything, except...  I've only
                    got one heart.

                                    ROSE
                    Which means..?

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                    I'm part Human.  Specifically, the
                    ageing part.  I'll grow old.  And
                    never regenerate.  I've only got
                    one life, Rose Tyler.  I... could

      And kisses him!

      And that's all the original Doctor needs to see.
