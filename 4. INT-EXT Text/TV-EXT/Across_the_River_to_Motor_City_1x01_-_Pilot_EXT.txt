      CLOSE ON A sign which reads,  CITY of WINDSOR, DETROIT RIVER 
        RECLAMATION 

      We move off the sign to see a couple of large cranes and 
      heavy equipment.

      A TRUCK drives by and as it passes we CUT

      CLOSER, to a pile of sludgy dirt being dredged up. The silty 
      sand trickles down onto the exposed earth.

      A LONGSHOREMAN stops, and looks down to see

      HIS POV - out of the pile of sludge, we can make out details 
      of two bodies wrapped in canvas and chains. We see a skull, a 
      bony hand...weathered scraps of a polyester uniform, and a 
      couple of items that glint in the sun -- (a cigar tube and a 
      nametag.)

      From the Windsor side, we see the Ambassador Bridge in the 
      background. The office building looks lived-in -- from a 
      different time.

      On the ground floor is a TV STOREFRONT, hawking the latest in 
      Black & White sets. 



      Ben stands on the front porch of his daughter s house.

                                  BRETT
                    Getting cold, maybe you should come 
                    in.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Thanks for dinner. A man who cooks. 
                    Something else.

                                  BRETT
                    It s not all that uncommon these 
                    days, Ben.

                                  BENJAMIN 
                    You used to be able to see Mercury.

                                  BRETT
                    I m sorry?

      Ben points to the horizon.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Forty five minutes after sunset. 
                      Southwest, just over the horizon. 
                    Mercury.

                                  BRETT
                    He s the one who ran fast, right?

                                  BENJAMIN
                    The messenger. He had a special 
                    helmet. Made him invisible.  

                                  BRETT
                    Good trick.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    The helmet signifies hidden 
                    thoughts. Secrets.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Friend told me once.

      There s a beat.

                                  BRETT
                    You and Kathleen have to talk. 

                                  BENJAMIN
                    I know.


    A sunny, crisp June day.  Kathleen is dressed in a suit. So s 
      Brett. Kathleen takes her father s arm as they walk toward 
      the gravesite.

      Benjamin looks off toward the side, where a copse of trees 
      dot the cemetary landscape.

      BEN S POV -- He sees a WOMAN in a yellow dress darting 
      between the trees and the gravestones.

                                  NARR (V.O.)
                    In the movies, the Invisible Man 
                    lives in fear of just one thing.


      Ben is sitting down -- his family beside him. 

                                  NARR (V.O.)
                    Appearing again at the wrong time.

      There are no other mourners.  A priest stands in front of a 
      freshly dug hole, with a casket looming over it.

                                  PRIEST
                    In the name of the Father, the Son 
                    and the Holy Ghost...

      The sound drops out, and Ben s left staring at the casket.

                                  NARR (V.O.)
                    If you reappear too soon, you find 
                    yourself naked. Out there with no 
                    clothes, no cover at all.

      The CASKET looms large in our view, as we

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:


      As before, with the priest doing the service.

                                  PRIEST
                      ...through valley of the shadow of *
                    death, I shall fear no evil...

      The voice fades to a dull drone, and Ben looks up and notices

      IN THE DISTANCE

      By the cars -- two COPS (Lewis and Singh) wait. They re 
      taking pictures.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     48.


      TIME CUT TO

      The Casket is in the ground. Everyone s standing. Ben throws 
      the first clump of dirt down, then stands off to the side.

      Kathleen follows...Then Brett.

      Ben looks up, and feels the sun on his face.  The cemetary is 
      peaceful, and green.  He looks off and sees...

      BEN S POV--It s KATIE, dressed in that yellow dress -- as 
      beautiful as the day he last saw her.  Beside her is 
        HIMSELF...YOUNG BEN, Age thirty. They re holding hands.

      INSERT

      A hand reaches inside a pocket, and pulls out a SMALL RING 
      BOX.

      Ben stands above Katie s grave with the ring he never got a 
      chance to give her.

      He bends his broken, tired, old-man body down, and tries, as 
      gingerly as possible, to lay the ring box to rest in Katie s 
      grave.

      It s not a particularly graceful attempt. He s too old, and 
      too stiff.  He falters.

      Kathleen steps forward to try and steady him. Angrily, he 
      waves her off. Brett, gently, takes her shoulder and gets her 
      to step back.

      Ben tries again. The ring tumbles into the grave, landing on 
      top of the casket.

                                  BRETT
                    Let s give him some space.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     49.


      Brett and Kathleen walk away.  Ben stares down at the ring in 
      the grave. When Ben looks up again, he sees...

      An Old Man with a cane is talking to Brett and Kathleen. (OLD 
      DEL, 70s.)


      Ben catches up to Kathleen, Brett, and the Man.

                                  OLD DEL
                    Benjamin Ford, I presume.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    You look like hell.

                                  OLD DEL
                    I m thinking of getting a piercing. 
                    Chicks love that.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Why d you come, Del?

      As we get a good look at Old Del Murphy, we can see he s 
      withered -- with a face that seems to indicate a life lived 
      hard at every turn, and a voice that gives  gravelly  a new 
      measure.

      (NB: By the end of the scene, the audience should clue in 
      that OLD DEL, not Ben, has been narrating.) Kathleen reacts 
      to the name with shock.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    Del? Del Murphy?

                                  OLD DEL
                    Hey Sweetheart. You got big.

                                  BENJAMIN
                          (to Kathleen)
                    Give us a minute.

      Kathleen nods. They walk toward the car. 

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                    You really need that thing?

                                  OLD DEL
                    No. I m just lazy. 

      Del pulls out a pack of smokes and offers one to Ben.        "ATR"101- 08/29/06 - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY     50.


                                  BENJAMIN
                    What are you, high?

                                  OLD DEL
                    No. That stuff will kill you.
                          (beat)
                    Am I supposed to believe that s 
                    your real hair color?

      Ben doesn t answer,but he does crack a smile

                                  BENJAMIN
                          (beat)
                    You still looking for Mercury?

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT D)
                    Every night.

      Brett lifts up Hunter. Both old men look toward Ben s family.

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT D)
                    Del. 

                                  OLD DEL
                    Yeah.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    She can never know.

                                  OLD DEL
                    Yeah.
                          (re: the approaching cops)
                    What are you going to do about 
                    them?

                                  BENJAMIN
                    What do you think I m going to do?
                          (beat)
                    I m going to lie.

      From high above, we see Benjamin and Del, two frail old men 
      surrounded by the dead. Detectives Singh and Lewis shake 
      hands with Ben.
