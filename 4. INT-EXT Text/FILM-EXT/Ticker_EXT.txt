METROPOLITAN CITY - DOWNTOWN - LATE NIGHT
1
Hot summer night. The flesh district - hookers working the
sidewalks, stopping cars.
MIKE REILLY, 20s, paces a corner, restless, looking for
action ... wet hair, three-day beard, trenchcoat, sneakers,
heat-seeking weary eyes. He flashes a wad of bills in an
effort to get some attention... no one notices.
Across the street, BILL RICE, 50's, a ragged transient,
strolls over.
RICE
Know what the problem is, kid?
You're too
ugly to get propositioned.
REILLY
Look who's talking, old man.
RICE
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Rice starts away.
Reilly pauses, then trudges after him.
2
SIDESTREET - NIGHT
2
Rice and Reilly pull donuts and coffee out of a bag, talk
with their mouths full as they walk.
RICE
Next week we work the park.
REILLY
I gotta get back on top.
Get off the sleaze
detail.
RICE
You will, one day at a time.
I'll be old and
grey when it happens...
11/10/97
2.
They share a grin, pass a BAG LADY who wears a pie-tin crown,
holding her hand out to a PIMP getting into a Cadillac.
BAG LADY
A small gift, sir, for the Queen ...
The Pimp ignores her, screeches off. The Bag Lady pulls out
a pad, adds his license number to a list, glances up at Rice
and Reilly.
BAG LADY (cont.)
I keep a record, see? They don't
pay, I don't forget.
Rice fishes some change out of his pocket.
RICE
Here you go, your Highness.
BAG LADY
Thank you, officer.
She pushes her shopping cart away. Rice and Reilly look at
each other, crack up, surprised she knew he was a cop.
REILLY
So what'll you do? After they give you the
gold watch.
RICE
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't
work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing
pole, or something useful.
REILLY
You don't fish.
RICE
How hard can it be? The grand kids been
buggin' me about taking them camping.
11/10/97
3.
REILLY
You outta the city... that's a fish out of
water. What's with all this family talk
lately, anyway?
RICE
One of these days you're gonna get tired of
fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll
wish you had family.
REILLY
No thanks.
I got close but it never woulda
worked.
They stop beside a dirty, beat-up Studebaker parked in the
alley, climb in, Reilly behind the wheel.
3
INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER
3
Cluttered with debris - clothes, boxes, personal items.
Reilly jiggles the ignition - the engine coughs and sputters,
finally turns over.
RICE
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of
its misery?
REILLY
What are you talking about, it's purring like
a kitty.
RICE
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother
was going to fix it.
REILLY
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
RICE
What was it this time?
REILLY
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
11/10/97
4.
The White Van appears up ahead and turns into a seemingly
deserted building's garage.
Reilly and Rice exchange a glance as they wait to see lights
come on in the building. They don't.
Two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of the
building briefly, then disappear. They hear a brief heated
argument, that is cut short abruptly. Then silence.
REILLY (cont.)
C'mon, let's check it out.
RICE
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers
in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd
best call it in for some back-up.
REILLY
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Reilly jumps out and heads for the building.
Rice rolls his
eyes, follows.
4
CITY STREETS - DAY
9
The Studebaker coughs and smokes in and out of traffic.
10
LAKEFRONT STREET - DAY
10
A young, uniformed police OFFICER stops Reilly in front of a
cordoned-off section of the street.
11/10/97
12.
REILLY
(flashes badge)
Bomb Squad.
The Officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way,
Reilly hits the gas, rumbles through.
The Studebaker swings past a fire truck, an ambulance, and
two squads cars.
Two OFFICERS stand near a building with a worried BUSINESSMAN
and his CHAUFFEUR.
Reilly parks 50 yards from a limo stopped in the middle of
the street. A Bomb Squad van and sleek black Harley Davidson
parked beyond it.
Reilly hops out, heads cautiously for the limo
POOCH, 50s, a barrel-chested ex-football player is on his
hands and knees looking under the limo. Red rubber ball in
hand, Hawaiian shirt half-tucked in, he leads around an
equally scruffy Labrador Retriever, SCHNOZ.
POOCH
Smell anything, Schnoz?
Me, neither.
T.J., 20s, a country boy inspects the open trunk.
GLASS, 40s, clean-cut, straight-laced, easy-going smile,
brilliant leader of the team, steps lightly around the open
driver's door.
POOCH (contd) (cont.)
Schnoz, come here, boy.
T.J.
Shhh, I hear something....
Reilly stands off 25 feet.
Glass notices him.
GLASS
Who the heck're you?
11/10/97
13.
REILLY
You the Bomb Squad?
T.J.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
GLASS
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you
a statement in a few minutes if we're still
alive.
REILLY
(flashes badge)
Reilly, Vice. I-
T.J.
Quiet!
Glass and Pooch step lightly to the rear of the limo where
T.J. has discovered a shoebox wedged next to the spare tire.
T.J. leans down, puts his ear to it, nods.
T.J. (cont.)
Ticker.
Pooch lifts up Schnoz and holds him over the trunk.
Schnoz
sniffs the shoebox, whines.
POOCH
Schnoz says it's loaded.
Good boy,
Schnozzie.
Pooch lowers Schnoz back to the ground throws him the red
ball, and trots back to the van, climbs up inside and sits,
watching.
GLASS
Alright boys, look close.
Let's assess.
Glass, Pooch and T.J. take a beat just to look at the
shoebox. Then, Glass nods for Reilly to move away.
11/10/97
14.
Reilly takes a few steps back, watching as the team works
together - Glass in charge - a psychic connection between
them as they pass tools back and forth like surgeons.
POOCH
Whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"?
Glass puts on magnifying spectacles -- precise, organized, a
detail freak as he uses a wooden probe to test the box for
wires, sensors.
As the others watch, Glass rubs his fingertips
ritualistically and carefully eases the top off the box.
He reaches in...
Grabs something...
Slowly pulls it out ...
It's a Mickey Mouse alarm clock doll, a clump of unlit
firecrackers taped between Mickey's legs.
The Bomb Squaders whoop and howl - all except Pooch who pulls
out a pack of Tums, shoves half of it in his mouth.
GLASS
It's a "girl" !
They all crack up, hysterical.
Reilly stares in disbelief --
these guys are nuts!
11
MOMENTS LATER - AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN
11
In the b.g., the Officers finish getting a statement from the
Businessman as the still-worried Chauffeur inspects the limo.
T.J. and Pooch load their equipment into the van as Glass
fills out paperwork.
T.J.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to
play a trick like that.
11/10/97
15.
POOCH
No shit.
I better send Meg flowers just in
case.
T.J. and Pooch share a laugh as Reilly approaches...
REILLY
Who's in charge here?
Pooch points to Schnoz.
POOCH
He is!
REILLY
Look, it's important.
T.J.
Make an appointment.
REILLY
It's about this.
Reilly holds up the bracelet.
Glass takes it, frowns.
GLASS
Where did you get this?
REILLY
Off a girl's wrist.
A suspect...
T.J.
P.E.T.N ...
REILLY
What?
GLASS
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's
got strange taste in jewelry or she's into
serious demolition.
11/10/97
16.
REILLY
What do you mean?
Glass whips out a blasting cap from his utility belt, cuts
off a piece of the bracelet, plugs it in.
POOCH
Fire in the hole!
Glass tosses it into a sewer drain. A beat, then a small
EXPLOSION, smoke billows out of the gutter drain. The nearby
Officers jump, alarmed. The Bomb Squad guys laugh. Glass
waves to the Officers.
GLASS
Sorry about that.
(to Reilly)
That's an inch of the stuff, imagine
what the whole thing'd do.
REILLY
Thanks.
He grabs back the bracelet, turns to leave.
GLASS
Hey wait a minute-
Reilly jogs back to his Studebaker, climbs in and roars off
in a cloud of dirty smoke.
T.J.
Vice... Jesus.
POOCH
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his
hands on.
Pooch and T.J. share a laugh as Glass shakes his head, climbs
on his Harley. The others pile into the van.
Glass kicks-starts his hog and rumbles away, van following.
11/10/97
17.

ALLEY - DAY
15
Reilly's Studebaker is parked next to the machine shop
building.
16
SUNCREST MOTEL - DAY
18
Sleazy area. Briefcase in hand, Earring slips out and blends
into pedestrian traffic.
11/10/97
24.
19
BUSY STREET - DAY
19
Earring walks on, just a man with a briefcase.
20
ANOTHER STREET - DAY
20
Earring slows and passes a bus stop where a group of giggly
TEENAGE GIRLS are waiting.
He notices a raven-haired KNOCKOUT going into the pub up
ahead. He grins and follows her in.
21
BAR - DAY
Earring walks out and strolls off. He checks his watch,
picks up the pace. He disappears around a corner.
Cars pass.
People stroll by.
Nothing happens.
11/10/97
25.
An ordinary scene on an ordinary day.
The silence is
screaming.
Suddenly - the bar EXPLODES. A FIREBALL BURSTS OUT the front
window, showering the street with wood and BROKEN GLASS.
22
BAR - DAY - LATER
22
Chaotic aftermath of the bombing... sirens, flashing red
lights. Police hold back onlookers, Firemen clean up,
Paramedics carry corpses and moaning Victims out of the
charred, smoking ruins, into waiting ambulances.
A black-and-white tears up. Capt. Winters leaps out, pushes
through to a dirt-covered FIRE CHIEF.
FIRE CHIEF
Eight dead, so far.
Winters looks grim.
23
AT THE BARRICADE
23
Reilly SCREECHES up in his Studebaker, jumps out, pushes
through, flashes his badge, enters the police zone.
He stops as he sees a bloody FEMALE VICTIM being loaded into
an ambulance. Suddenly a voice snaps him out of it.
PLUCHINSKY
What're you doing here?
Reilly faces him.
PLUCHINSKY (cont.)
You're offsides. Beat it.
Reilly ignores them, starts towards the ruins.
Pluchinsky
shoves him back.
PLUCHINSKY (cont.)
I said get the fuck outta here.
11/10/97
26.
REILLY
You touch me again and--
PLUCHINSKY
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake
me for one of your partners, I'd like to make
retirement in one piece.
Pluchinsky starts to laugh as Reilly pops him once hard in
the face. Pluchinsky staggers backwards, grasping his
bleeding nose. Reilly is ready for more as Pluchinsky starts
at him. They exchange a few body shots before several cops
swarm in and pull them apart.
Winters hustles over.
WINTERS
What the hell's going on?
PLUCHINSKY
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose...
This fuck-up is
interfering with-
WINTERS
Reilly, what're you doing here?
REILLY
Sir...
WINTERS
I thought I told you--
GLASS (O.C.)
He's with us.
They all turn.
Glass and T.J. stand there, soot-smeared, wearing utility
belts.
GLASS (cont.)
We asked him to come.
11/10/97
27.
T.J.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on
this thing.
GLASS
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us
catch these guys that much sooner.
(to Reilly)
Coming?
Reilly looks at the Captain awkwardly.
WINTERS
Go ahead, kid.
Reilly marches after Glass and T.J., leaving Pluchinsky
fuming, holding closed his bloody nose.
PLUCHINSKY
I'm filing charges against that mother-
WINTERS
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up
your nose.
ANGLE - ON THE BOMB SQUAD
Reilly follows Glass and T.J., bewildered.
REILLY
What was-?
Why...?
GLASS
That cop who bought it... you didn't
tell us he was your partner.
T.J.
We've lost brothers too, we know
what that's like.
11/10/97
28.
GLASS
Let's get something straight. We're doing you
a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want
around explosives.
REILLY
What?
GLASS
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery.
You wanna work with us, you do it our way,
understand?
REILLY
Now wait just a fucking-
GLASS
Be cool around my men, they don't trust
strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's
unattractive.
Reilly glares, tongue-tied, as they walk past the Bomb Squad
van and Glass' Harley, enter the wreckage.
24
POLICE PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
31
Reilly goes to his Studebaker, climbs in.
32
ALLEY - AFTERNOON
33
The Studebaker rumbles up to the machine shop, parks in the
same haunting spot as the night before.
Glass and Reilly climb out of the car, flashlights in hand.
Reilly glances around, bad memories stirring up.
11/10/97
39.
REILLY
The place has already be combed. Forensics
pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
GLASS
Then let's go see what they missed.
Pulling out a tool kit, Glass quickly picks the door lock,
yanks open the door, ducks inside. Reilly follows.
34
MACHINE SHIP - GARAGE - AFTERNOON
35
Glass and Reilly search the area.
Glass moves on his knees,
aiming the flashlight.
GLASS
This is where the van was parked.
REILLY
Yep.
GLASS
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
REILLY
Look, it's a longshot...
GLASS
Bingo!
Glass pinches something with his tweezers, holds it up
triumphantly... a used match.
CLOSE UP - MATCH UNDER MICROSCOPE
A jungle of giant fibers teeming with strange molecules.
T.J. (O.C.)
No question, it was definitely the one used to
l-light the butt. Finger pressure suggests a
male, average build, height... no prints,
trace of nylon fiber... he wore a glove.
36
BOWLING ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON
37
The Studebaker and Harley swerve up to a run-down, windowless
bowling alley, park in a red zone.
Reilly and T.J, climb out of the clunker, Glass off his bike.
11/10/97
45.
T.J. checks his hair in the side mirror, sniffs his
underarms.
REILLY
T.J., what're you doing?
T.J.
My first undercover assignment.
I gotta look good, right?
Reilly and Glass exchange a grin, they drag T.J. inside.
38
40
Reilly runs out into the middle of the street.
At the end of the block, Earring is rushing for the corner.
Reilly draws his 9mm, aims thru the pedestrian--and fires.
Earring is blown off his feet...
He hits the pavement hard...
11/10/97
51.
41
STREET - MOMENTS LATER
42
Two squad cars have appeared, Officers cordon off the crime
scene.
Glass watches Reilly kneeling over Earring's body digging
through Earring's pockets, finding nothing but cash,
cigarettes and matches.
REILLY
(at Glass)
Nothing. Nothing traceable.
INT BAR
Pooch and T.J. have the device on the ground a few feet away
from the Earring's body. They delicately continue to take it
apart so it can be transported safely. Schnoz sits nearby,
watching. Pooch is on the phone with his wife...
POOCH
I don't know, honey. I'll see. No,
everything's fine, it was nothing.
As he says this, he lifts a chunk of C4 and sets it aside.
Pooch hangs up his phone.
EXT STREET
Pooch and TJ exit the bar, moving to Glass and Reilly.
11/10/97
55.
POOCH (cont.)
You guys hungry? The wife's got a heap of
lasagna leftover.
T.J.
(at Reilly)
What do ay say?
GLASS
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly.
C'mon.
Glass notes Reilly's hands.
GLASS (cont.)
Good meal would go a long way to steady your
system.
REILLY
Got work to do, don't we?
Pooch scribbles down an address on a scrap of paper from the
device's shopping bag, hands it to Reilly, offering a smile.
POOCH
In case you change your mind.
Reilly looks at it awkwardly, then walks away as a News van
arrives on the scene...
43
43
Reilly cruises into the bowels of downtown.
Makes a few
turns and parks.
In the shadows of a burned out building, Reilly observes
several JUNKIES getting a fix from their CONNECTION.
Reilly watches with scared, tempted eyes.
He looks at his hands... they're trembling... catches his
reflection in the rear view mirror. Checks Rice's watches on
his wrist, taps it. Still not ticking. Ashamed, he
screeches away.
11/10/97
56.
44
POOCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
47
Quiet, cozy, middle class. The Harley and the Bomb Squad van
are parked out front. Also the Studebaker.
48
POOCH'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
49
Sunrise breaking. Reilly and Glass have their heads under
the hood of the Studebaker, covered in grease, tools
everywhere. T.J. sits behind the wheel. Pooch and Schnoz
stumble out of the house to watch.
11/10/97
61.
REILLY
Okay, hit it.
T.J. guns the engine, the Studebaker purrs like a tiger.
GLASS
Alright!
T.J.
We've created a monster.
Glass glances at Pooch.
GLASS
Any word?
POOCH
Nothing.
Maybe they gave up, split town.
REILLY
Don't bet on it.
50
50
Bustling activity...
51
SUNCREST MOTEL - ROOM 138 - DAY
55
An army of cops and squad cars out front, Pluchinsky silently
directs a SWAT team to the door. Reilly and the Bomb Squad
watch from a distance as they break down the door.
11/10/97
66.
SHOUTING, mayhem as the team floods into the room.
Pluchinsky brings up the rear. After a beat, Pluchinsky re-
emerges, shaking his head.
AT THE FAR END OF THE MOTEL
Swan and Beard watch from behind a car. Beard gives Swan a
dirty look and they quietly move off around the corner.
AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN
Reilly and Glass are visibly disappointed.
As the others grumble about it, Reilly notices someone across
the street - the Bag Lady with the pie-tin crown, holding her
hand out to a MAN getting into his car. The Man ignores her,
screeches off. The Bag Lady scribbles down his license
number in her pad. Glass follows Reilly's stare.
GLASS
Ex-girlfriend?
REILLY
Be right back.
Reilly crosses the street, intercepts the Bag Lady as she's
pushing her cart away.
REILLY (cont.)
Excuse me... I'm looking for two men who were
staying at the hotel over there - one has a
beard, the other's tall, thin. You wouldn't
happen to have seen them, would you?
BAG LADY
No.
REILLY
No, of course not... well, thanks
anyway. Here you go, Your Highness.
He fishes some change out of his pocket, hands it over,
starts away.
11/10/97
67.
BAG LADY
On second thought, maybe I did.
He turns back. The Bag Lady flips through her pad, stabs an
entry with her finger.
BAG LADY
Lemme see... yeah, here it is, 11:18 this
morning. Very disrespectful. He used to
drive a van, but he got a new car. You want
the license number?
She tears off the page, holds it out.
REILLY
You're beautiful!
Reilly gives her a big kiss, races back to the Bomb Squad
who've been watching.
REILLY
We're back in business!
They all look at him like he's nuts.
56
POLICE STATION - DAY
57
Cops race to their cars. An armada of black-and-whites
scream out of the parking lot. Winters appears and jumps
into his Ford Sedan and tears out.
DISPATCHER (V.0)
... suspects driving a dark green
Ford Grenada, license number one
Two Eight Michael Vincent Edward ...
58
58
Squad cars roar up and down the streets.
Two cars are parked out in front of one house in particular.
59
60
Reilly idles in his Studebaker. T.J. and Pooch come out of
the parking lot in the Bomb Squad Van, Glass motors along
side Reilly. He guns the bike and takes the lead, followed
by Reilly, then the van.
They pull out into traffic and head towards the suburbs.
61
61
Beard drives, Swan rides shotgun.
A briefcase lies on the
seat between them.
As he makes a left, Beard notices the Bomb Squad Van coming
the other direction.
BEARD
We've got company.
Swan whirls, pulls a gun as Glass and Reilly pass them.
Reilly double-takes...
62
63
Reilly SKIDS to a dead stop. Glass, up ahead tries to
maneuver around slowing cars as...
The Grenada speeds down a street right in front of the Bomb
Squad Van.
Pooch cranks into a turn and gives chase. Reilly and Glass
are pinned in by other cars. They both finally squeeze out
of their jams in different directions...
11/10/97
70.
64
64
An excited T.J. jumps on the radio.
T.J.
Dispatch, this is Bomb Squad. Suspects
sighted on Fern Street, two blocks from HQ.
In pursuit.
DISPATCHER (O.C.)
Roger that.
All available units...
65
65
Beard speeds around another corner, the lumbering Van has
difficulty keeping up and loses sight of the Grenada for a
moment.
66
66
The Grenada speeds up, heading towards the Police Station up
ahead.
The Bomb Squad Van appears and speeds up.
ON THE SIDEWALK
Swan stands discreetly in a phone booth, watching as...
ON THE STREET
Beard steers towards a parked Squad Car next to the Station -
on collision course. At the last second, Beard dives from the
moving car, hits the pavements and rolls.
The Grenada CRASHES into the Squad Car... but no explosion.
The Bomb Squad Van SKIDS to a stop as two uniformed Officers
rush out of the Station.
Beard has rolled to his feet and is now sprinting off down
the street.
11/10/97
71.
Pooch and T.J. jump out of the Van (leaving a BARKING Schnoz
inside) and sprint towards the Grenada, guns drawn. Pooch is
quickly huffing and puffing. T.J. continues after Beard as
Pooch moves towards the Grenada. The uniforms follow T.J.
Glass on his Harley appears from behind the Van. At the far
end of the street the Studebaker rumbles into view, followed
by a Squad Car, lights flashing. Everyone closing in on
Beard.
T.J. aims and yells at Beard.
T.J.
Police, freeze!
Beard whirls around, SPRAYING automatic weapon FIRE at T.J.
and the Uniforms - they hit the pavement.
A few nearby Pedestrians SCREAM and drop to the ground.
Reilly jumps out of his Studebaker as Beard turns his FIRE on
him, BLOWING OUT his windshield.
Back at the Grenada, Pooch ducks for cover by the open
driver's door.
Glass runs his Harley behind a parked car.
The Squad Car behind Reilly SKIDS to a stop and as Beard
shifts his aim, T.J. and Reilly each PUMP TWO SHOTS into
Beard's torso.
Beard spins around, drops - dead silence on the street.
Relief all around. Everyone stands back up. T.J.'s jaw
drops at the sight of actually having hit the suspect with
his bullets.
AT THE GRENADA
Pooch exhales in relief, then hears BEEPING coming from the
front seat of the car. He looks in to see the briefcase
open, countdown ticking away.
11/10/97
72.
POOCH
Oh... damn.
KA-BOOOOOM!!!
The Grenada explodes in a massive FIRE-BALL, throwing nearby
Glass off his feet. Everyone else drops back to the ground,
covering their heads.
DOWN THE STREET - AT THE PHONE BOOTH
Swan grins and walks away down an alley.
We can hear the CRY of Schnoz, WAILING from the front seat of
Van.
67
POLICE STATION - REAR ENTRANCE - EARLY MORNING
69
An armored van screeches up. Doors fly open. Metro SWAT
Team jumps out with equipment, helmets, rush into the
building.
70
ALLEY - DAY
71
Hauntingly familiar. An unmarked police car pulls up and
stops behind the machine shop.
72
72
Harry sits behind the wheel.
Mary sits in the back,
handcuffed to Pluchinsky.
Pluchinsky unlocks the cuffs.
Mary's eyes flare
11/10/97
76.
PLUCHINSKY
Get out and go to the machine shop -
Mary steps out of the car. She glances around--then heads in
the opposite direction of the Machine Shop. Pluchinsky
curses. He starts to go after her, but realizes he'd better
clear the area. He peals out.
73
73
Undercover Men in various disguises track her from cars, and
on foot, communicating by hidden mics. A WINO eyes her
carefully, lifts a bottle to his mouth and whispers...
WINO
She's out of the bag.
Mary exits the alley onto the street, searching where to go.
She turns down the street and moves fast, eyes darting about.
74
74
The SWAT van is tucked into an alley...
INSIDE THE SWAT VAN
Winters, Benson and Team monitor the radio communication.
WINO (O.C.)
(on the radio)
Position Four. Turning on Elm.
75
75
Mary crosses the street, a Camero nearly clips her. She
makes it safely to the sidewalk and passes a TRUCK DRIVER
eating a hot dog. After she moves off...
TRUCK DRIVER
(speaks into sleave)
Six.
She's crossing to Main.
11/10/97
77.
Mary looks around quickly, blends into a crowd coming out of
a store and ducks inside.
TRUCK DRIVER (cont.)
She just went into a department store.
She's
out of sight.
76
INSIDE THE SWAT VAN
76
Winters grabs the mic...
WINTERS
Seal the building!
(to Benson)
Let's move.
The SWAT van RUMBLES to life.
77
78
Mary bursts out, runs like a spooked horse.
As she dashes to the mouth of the the alley, she runs smack
into the Camaro that almost hit her. It SCREECHES to a stop.
The passenger door flies open.
Mary leans down and looks in, flushes. It's Swan.
He
reaches over and yanks her inside, TEARS away.
The Truck Driver runs into the other end of the alley.
He starts to give chase as Swan tosses a small package out of
the car. The Truck Driver dives for cover as...
KA-BOOOOM!!!
A dumpster EXPLODES.
The Truck Driver jumps to
his feet...
11/10/97

From every direction, unmarked cars, squad units and the SWAT
Van converge on the area.
81
82
The Camaro tears down a one-way alley going the wrong way.
INTERCUT WITH TRANSMITTER COUNTDOWN - 6, 5, 4...
Undercover vehicles race after the Camero, seconds behind.
5, 4, 3 ...
They swerve into the alley.
Then just as Swan whooshes out, a charge EXPLODES a stack of
55 gallon drums. They fall down into the path of the
pursuers who crash into the FLAMING DRUMS.
The lead car EXPLODES...
83
83
Mary looks back in horror as she's whisked away.
84
GAS STATION - DAY
87
In the service bay, a MECHANIC raises the black Camaro on a
hydraulic lift, out of sight from the street.
11/10/97
81.
Out front, Swan pays an ATTENDANT, climbs into an orange U-
Haul truck with Mary, drives off.
A beat, a squad car and an unmarked speed past the Gas
Station.
88
STREETS - U-HAUL - MOVING
88
Swan brushes Mary's hair from her face.
SWAN
You hungry?
We could get something to eat.
Mary shakes her head, scared.
SWAN
What's the matter?
MARY
Nothing... just tired.
She forces a smile. Swan frowns suspiciously as he turns
down a service road, pulls into...
89
89
Swan pulls up to the loading dock of the warehouse.
INSIDE THE TRUCK CAB
MARY
Why are we stopping here?
SWAN
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the
supplies. Just two little boxes.
Mary turns white.
MARY
No...
No more killing.
SWAN
Stay here.
11/10/97
82.
MARY
Alex, please.
SWAN
Stay in the truck.
He gets out, disappears into the building.
Mary glances around desperately, sees a phone booth at the
corner. She looks back at the warehouse, the phone again,
terrified.
LOADING DOCK
Yanking her door open, Mary dashes to the booth, searches her
pockets. Empty. She dials zero... it rings and rings, then
finally...
OPERATOR (O.C.)
Operator.
MARY
Get me the police!
OPERATOR (O.C.)
Is this an emergency?
MARY
Yes! Please, hurry!
Mary's back is to the warehouse as she waits forever.
SERGEANT'S VOICE
Police, Sergeant Doyle speaking.
MARY
Please, I need help, my name is--
SERGEANT DOYLE'S VOICE
Whoa, slow down, lady. Now what's
that again?
11/10/97
83.
Suddenly Mary sees the reflection of a face in the phone
booth glass. She whirls - Swan is standing behind her!
SWAN
Who are you calling, sis?
MARY
What?
Nobody, I-
She tries to hang up.
Swan grabs the receiver.
MARY
Alex, please-
SWAN
Shut up!
(into phone)
Who is this?
SERGEANT DOYLE'S VOICE
Sergeant Doyle, Metro P.D. Look, what's going
on--?
Swan's eyes turn cold, SLAMS down the phone.
MARY
Help!
Swan grabs Mary, dragging her with him.
A pair of TEENAGE
BOYS on skateboards notice, veer over.
BOY
Hey--?
Swan whips out his Mac-11. The Boys skate for cover as Swan
drags Mary back to the U-Haul.
The open back door reveals a number of 55 gallon drums, some
boxes and two milk crates of C4. He SLAMS down the sliding
door, moves around front and shoves Mary inside.
11/10/97
84.

91
T.J. is in the passenger seat, Bev sits in the back with
Schnoz, Glass drives. Glass takes the mic.
GLASS
What's up?
INTERCUT WITH REILLY
REILLY
Where you guys at?
GLASS
Driving in circles, waiting for-
REILLY
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
GLASS
How do you know?
REILLY
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
GLASS
Should we head for the Interstate?
REILLY
Would you?
GLASS
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district,
behind Greyhound...
REILLY
Me, too.
11/10/97
86.
Reilly hangs up, fishtails around a corner, map blowing out
the window.
92
92
Patrol cars, unmarked and the SWAT Van criss-cross the
streets in confusion...
93
93
T.J. speeds by in the Bomb Squad van.
94
95
The Bomb Squad accelerates...
96
97
Winters is shocked at the sound of Reilly's voice.
WINTERS
(into mic)
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
REILLY (O.C.)
(on radio)
Fire me later. Close in and we got the
bastard.
WINTERS
Pull back.
You're only an observer.
98
98
Reilly throws down his mic, aims at the alley ahead and
speeds up, then cranks into the alley, SCREECHES to a stop.
99
99
The U-Haul barrels down the alley. Swan sees Reilly up ahead
get out of his car and aim his .357
Swan SLAMS on the brakes. Throws the vehicle into reverse.
Checks his mirror to see the Bomb Squad Van appear at the end
of the alley. He's completely pinned in.
Glass and T.J. jump out, they are in bullet-proof vest,
aiming shotguns, using the van as a shield. Bev jumps out
with Schnoz and slips behind the van entirely.
AT THE STUDEBAKER
Reilly's radio CRACKLES...
WINTERS (O.C.)
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly!
Do not engage. We're five minutes-
11/10/97
88.
REILLY
(into mic)
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Reilly throws done the mic, takes aim again.
THE U-HAUL
idles.
Swan's rage erupts.
He climbs out with Mary in tow.
ALLEY
Reilly aims carefully...
Swan keeps his Mac-11 to Mary's head. Reilly is frozen by the
move. Swan backs to the rear of the van. He slides up the
door, revealing the drums and explosives to the Bomb Squad.
He reaches in and grabs a remote control.
SIRENS are coming closer, only a block or two away...
AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN
Glass and T.J. drop their jaws.
They see Swan depress the
remote, arming the explosives.
T.J.
Jesus...
GLASS
Reilly!
He's loaded!
ALLEY
REILLY
(yelling)
Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit!
SWAN
I want out, right now.
Or the whole city
block is gone.
11/10/97
89.
GLASS
Reilly, he's got enough to do it.
Reilly leaves the cover of his car and scurries along the
side of the alley, escaping Swan's view.
Swan rages.
He moves around the van, pulling Mary along.
Swan SPRAYS a FLURRY of bullets over Reilly's head... Reilly
dives for cover as bullets rip the alley wall inches from his
face.
Swan whirls and SPRAYS the Bomb Squad Van, dropping T.J. with
a shot to the leg. Bev drops to his aid. Glass grimaces,
having been hit in the shoulder.
Reilly moves forward about to take the shot.
GLASS (cont.)
Reilly, don't. He's got a pressure switch.
He releases it, we're done for.
Swan turns back to Reilly, rams his Mac-11 to her throat.
SWAN
Drop it.
MARY
(to Reilly)
Take him!
Mary jerks away from Swan.
Reilly fast FIRES.
Swan takes Reilly's SHOTS in the chest. He smiles as he
starts to fall, his hand starts to open up to release the
detonator...
Mary dives onto Swan and grabs at the remote, clasping it in
her hands. Swan collapses, Mary on top of him.
11/10/97
90.
Reilly and Glass sprint at the U-Haul, reaching a trembling,
bleeding Mary.
She clinches her jaw, fighting the grief, holding on to the
remote.
Reilly reaches Mary first and puts his hands over her's - she
looks up into his eyes--distraught.
GLASS
Hold on to that thing tight.
Glass goes to the explosives and looks over the set-up.
GLASS (cont.)
Jesus Fucking H. Christ...
Reilly has never heard Glass swear before...
REILLY
Fuck factor?
GLASS
Off the scale.
REILLY
What do we do?
Glass turns to Mary.
GLASS
Can you hold it?
She nods.
Reilly releases her gently, joining Glass at the
van.
REILLY
Talk to me.
Let's assess.
GLASS
Right.
11/10/97
91.
Glass stares at the digital read-out on the device anchored
in one of the C4 crates. It reads: "1:30, 1:29..."
REILLY
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
GLASS
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we
got a hold of the remote.
(beat)
Okay... first, run your fingers along
the edges, feel for a sensor.
Reilly does it the way he saw Glass do it before.
GLASS
Good, now the other side.
REILLY
Nothing.
GLASS
Okay, let's go in.
1:18, 1:17, 1:16 ....
Reilly feels around, finally finds an access hole.
Reilly works the hole bigger.
GLASS (cont.)
Not enough time ... gotta go for the
blasting cap. Only one chance... hand
entry.
REILLY
Keep talking.
GLASS
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips.
Tell
me everything you feel.
11/10/97
92.
Reilly' hand disappears into the hole.
CLOSE-UP - INSIDE THE BOMB
His fingers snake through complex circuitry as he describes
each layer.
REILLY
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
GLASS
Don't touch that.
BACK TO SCENE
The red digital numbers keep counting down: 0:38, 0:37, 0:36
REILLY
More metal... sharp edge...
GLASS
Stay to your left.
Deeper, deeper.
AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN
The SWAT Van and a unit arrive, Winters and Benson jump out,
the SWAT Team is about to follow-
T.J.
Get outta here, Swan's down, but they're
chilling a device.
Winters looks to the action at the U-Haul, sees Reilly and
Glass busy at work. He nods at Benson.
0:30, 0:29, 0:28...
Finally Reilly' fingers touch a button object. We hear the
SWAT Van and the unit retreat at the end of the alley.
11/10/97
93.
REILLY
Something round, two wires ...
GLASS
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now
grab it by the base and pull it straight up.
No, Wait...
REILLY
What's wrong?
GLASS
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in
there, another cap maybe.
REILLY
Make up your mind, trigger.
0:19, 0:18, 0:17...
GLASS
Ease your thumb over to the right - feel
anything?
Reilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around...
REILLY
Yeah, another round thing.
GLASS
Okay, one of the caps turns it on,
the other shuts it down.
REILLY
Which one's which?
GLASS
I don't know.
REILLY
What... ?
11/10/97
94.
GLASS
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
REILLY
How the hell do you feel yellow?
GLASS
No excuses, just do it!
10... Reilly glares at Glass.
9... His face is dripping with sweat.
8... His fingers shift back to the first cap.
7... They close over it, ready to pull.
6... But then they stop.
5... Reilly frowns.
4... Glass stabs him with a look.
3... 2... Lightning-quick, Reilly' fingers fly back and yank
the second cap out of its base.
The counter stops.
0:01.
Reilly and Glass and stare at it, holding their breath,
hardly daring to believe it's true. They whoop and explode
with relief.
It's over... it's finally over.
GLASS (cont.)
Not bad, for a rookie.
REILLY
Thanks.
Reilly and Glass turn to Mary who has lost consciousness but
is still holding the remote tightly.
11/10/97
95.
Glass looks up to see T.J. and Bev peeking from around their
van.
GLASS
All clear, but we need an ambulance!
Bev jumps into the van to make the call as T.J. starts
limping towards the U-Haul. Schnoz yelps and drops from the
van and runs for the U-Haul.
Reilly cradles Mary in his lap as Glass kneels and removes
the remote - the red light stops flashing, then turns off.
T.J. arrives and looks down at Reilly and Mary, then at the
device in the U-Haul.
T.J.
Nice work.
