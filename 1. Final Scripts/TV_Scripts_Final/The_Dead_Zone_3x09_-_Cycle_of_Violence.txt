  11INT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - DAY

          In a completely empty living room, JOHNNY stands by
            REBECCA'S side as a real estate AGENT speaks for a YOUNG
          FATHER and PREGNANT YOUNG MOTHER who are accompanied by a
            FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

                                        AGENT
                        My clients are willing to pay
                        your price for the house if you're
                        willing to buy a home warranty,
                        and repaint the interior.

          Rebecca nods; then looks at the young wife --

                                        REBECCA
                        When are you due?

                                        YOUNG MOTHER
                        Nine weeks.  It's going to be a
                        girl. 

                                        REBECCA
                        My sister and I were just about
                        as far apart in age as your
                        daughters.  This will be a great
                        house for two girls.  What color
                        are you going to paint the girls'
                          bedrooms?

                                        YOUNG MOTHER
                          Sunflower yellow. 

                                        REBECCA
                        That will be lovely. 
                            Congratulations.

          They all smile; shake hands; the house is sold.

                                        REBECCA
                        Can I have a few minutes alone?

                                        AGENT
                        Sure.  We'll go for a walk.

          The family is excited to get into a new house; they step
          out, leaving Johnny and Rebecca alone.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - TEASER - 3/17/04 GREEN   2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        REBECCA
                        Seeing those buyers, I can't help
                          imagining Rachel in this house
                        with a husband and children...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're doing a great job, Rebecca. 
                        It's a hard thing to get through.

                                        REBECCA
                        It's good that a family is moving
                        in.  Make this a happy place again. 
                        But now that it's done, I just
                        feel kind of empty.

          Johnny wraps her in a comforting hug.

                                        REBECCA
                        Johnny?  You want to see a movie,
                        maybe?  A comedy?  Just something
                        silly?  Get a big bucket of
                          popcorn?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have another obligation.  But
                        you're welcome to join me. 

          Off his smile --


  22INT. LITTLE THEATER - SCHOOL - NIGHT

          The final song in an all-ages production with elementary,
            middle-school and high school students; flags and bunting
          are everywhere, and children are dressed as presidents. 
          J.J. is Lincoln; his pal ZEKE is Washington; a dozen or
          two others in patriotic costume sing the second verse of
          "America the Beautiful" enthusiastically.  The band is
          led by band teacher MR. TALBOT, dressed as Teddy Roosevelt.

                                        CHILDREN'S CHORUS
                          A thoroughfare for freedom beat
                        Across the wilderness / America!


          IN THE FIFTH ROW OF A PACKED HOUSE

          Rebecca is smiling from ear to ear; next to her, Johnny;
          behind them, WALT and SARAH; the room is full and everyone
          is having a great time.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - TEASER - 3/25/04 YEL-2   3.
                                                                  *

    2CONTINUED:2

                                        CHILDREN'S CHORUS
                          America!  God mend thine every
                        flaw / Confirm thy soul in self
                        control / Thy liberty in law


          THE AUDIENCE

          Gives a standing ovation; it's all family and friends. 
          Rebecca leans close to Johnny.

                                        REBECCA
                        Johnny, this has been so fun --

                                        JOHNNY
                                (teasing)
                        How about that Abe Lincoln, huh?

                                        REBECCA
                                (she turns to Sarah)
                        He's just darling! 

                                        WALT
                        And so presidential.

                                        REBECCA
                        You must be proud.

                                        SARAH
                        Thanks.  I'm glad you could come.

          Sarah and Johnny exchange a proud glance.  As Johnny and
          Rebecca exit, Sarah and Walt linger behind, watching them.

                                        SARAH
                        It's nice to see Johnny so happy.
                        Do you think ...

                                        WALT
                        Oh, yeah.

                                        SARAH
                                (smiling)
                          I wonder if they know?


          ON THE STAGE

            PRINCIPAL ROWIN, smart, committed, the kind of principal
          you wish your kids had, stands in the center of the stage --

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Thank you all for coming down

                        I'd like to invite you to meet
                        our stars in the lobby afterward --


  2A2AIN A BACKSTAGE TECH AREA

          used by a few high school kids, the tech crew: there are
          a couple light stands, a flat, and a soundboard, which is
          operated by DEREK, 15, a wiseacre dressed in black, who
          quips to the kid next to him --

                                        DEREK

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                          A special thank-you to Mr. Talbot
                        for bringing kids of every age
                          together in this all-city
                          production.  How about one more
                        round of applause for our talented
                        performers and musicians!


          THE AUDIENCE

            Applauds; people start getting out of their seats and
          head for the exit.


  33INT. LOBBY - A LITTLE LATER - NIGHT

          A genial post-show crowd of parents, teachers, and students
          (some still in costume) pour into the hallway, all passing
          through the same door; it's a happy crowd.  Johnny and
          Rebecca enter the lobby through the same door.  Johnny
          touches the door frame, triggering --


  44VISION: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          A terrified mob composed of different people (not the
          theater crowd) runs away from something, terrified.  A
          GUNSHOT rings out; the people SCREAM and duck.


          THE SHOOTER

          Remains standing.  His back is to Johnny, as he heads
          away down corridor.  As Johnny watches, the shooter
          disappears into a doorway and we hear BANG! ending the
          vision --


  55RESUME: INT. SCHOOL LOBBY - NIGHT

          Everyone is still happy and smiling, except Johnny, who
          looks nervously around for the source of the vision.

                        I don't know what triggered the
                        vision -- I was in a crowd when I
                        touched a doorway that hundreds
                        of people had passed through.

                        It was during a school day.  I
                        heard gunshots.  I went to the
                          hallway.  People were scared,
                        running away from something. 

                                        WALT
                        Did you see the shooter's face?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  He wore a sweatshirt with a
                        hood.  I saw him walk into the
                        room and heard a shot.  And then
                        my vision ended.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        These things you see -- they always
                        come true?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, unless something is done to
                        stop it, this shooting will happen.

                                        WALT
                        He's right.  We can't stand by
                        and let this happen.  We've got
                        to close the school.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        But that's just a temporary measure
                        until we can put new security
                          measures in place... guards, metal
                        detectors, whatever it takes to
                          guarantee the safety of these
                          students.  In the meantime, we've
                        got to find this shooter.

                        Any idea, John, who we should be
                        looking at?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't get a good look.  I'm
                        pretty sure it was a boy --

                                        WALT
                        That's not a lot to go on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  Rebecca, what do you
                        think?  You work with troubled
                        kids.  Anything we should be
                        looking for?

                                        REBECCA
                        We have a rare chance to save two
                        people: the victim, and the kid
                        who's going to shoot him.  By the
                        time a kid picks up a gun, he may
                        already be dead inside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There must be warning signs.

                                        REBECCA
                        Each kid is different, but there
                        are some things to look for. 
                        He'll probably have expressed
                        anger in other ways -- vandalism,
                        making threats, verbally or in
                          writing.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Some kids go so far as to post
                        their threats on a website.

                                        REBECCA
                        Yes.  A second element all these
                        kids have in common -- and this
                        sounds obvious -- he'll have easy
                        access to a gun.

                        We're already pulling any recent
                        missing gun reports -- but there's
                        a lot of firearms out there parents
                        just haven't secured properly.

                        Okay, we'll start by looking at
                          students who fit your profile.  I
                        can think of a few suspects.

                                        REBECCA
                        I can help -- but most kids who
                        fit the profile never act on their
                          threats.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        We have to start somewhere.  I
                        think a locker search is in order,
                        too -- metal detectors won't help
                        us if the gun is here already.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe something from the lockers
                        will help me identify this kid.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        In the meantime, we need to be
                          discrete about this. 

                                        WALT
                        Keep it low-key.  Just say there's
                        an unspecified threat against the
                        school and close it tomorrow.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        We don't want to cause a panic.
                          Tomorrow morning, first, we search
                          lockers; after that, interview
                        any student who seems like he
                        might do this kind of thing, and
                        talk to their parents.

          Off Johnny --


  77EXT. SCHOOL - DAWN - A ROW OF SAW HORSES

          block the driveway to the school; a large, handwritten
          sign says "SCHOOL CLOSED - FOR DETAILS CALL SCHOOL HOTLINE,

          reads the sign, and turns around.          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - ACT ONE - 3/19/04 PINK-2   8A.

          About every tenth locker is open; Roscoe, two other
          deputies and Principal Rowin search; Walt supervises, as
          Johnny and Rebecca arrive.

                        We pre-screened the contents --
                        these are the most likely
                          troublemakers.

                                        JOHNNY

                        then let you do your thing.

          Johnny walks over to Roscoe's locker, the one with the
          serial killer book inside; touches it, triggering:

          VICIOUS, LOUD OFFSCREEN ARGUING from his parents takes
          his attention away from his book; then he claps on
          headphones to drown them out, and continues to read.

                        him out, either.

                        Try this one.  We found a copy of

                        She stays on the list.

          Rowin is holding a yellow pad with several dozen names on
          it.  Of those, only two are crossed out.  Rebecca looks
          askance at the list.

          hear a DEAD ZONE WHOOSH; then he tries

                        No, but almost all have traumatic
                        events ahead of them.  It's tough
                        being that age.  I'm having a
                        hard time ruling anyone out.

                          Probably not.  We were given a
                        list of potential problem students,
                        and we'd prefer to clear his name.

          Rowin places "The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers"
          on the desk.  Max looks at it suspiciously.

          Walt escorts Charles and his father into the room, which
          is filled with every variety of outcast, from goth to
          nerd to moody loners; each student is accompanied by one

                        sense of humor gets you in trouble
                        sometimes.  Do you ever joke about
                        destroying school property?  Or
                        think about getting back at a

          a paper clip into a little Blair Witch-y shape; she's
          accompanied by her mother, a pert, professional secretary,

                          Anything?

          Rebecca shakes her head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  How about you?

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Not much.  Another student came
                        to our attention.  I was hoping
                        you could talk to him.  Name's
                        Colin.  Mr. Talbot's expecting
                        you.  In the auditorium.

          Rowin points them in the right direction.


  3030INT. LITTLE THEATER - DAY

          As Johnny and Rebecca enter the back of a music room, the
          band leader, Mr. Talbot, finishes a couple bars of a
            patriotic march, then stops mid-song --

                                        MR. TALBOT
                        Mr. Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi, we need to talk to one of
                        your students, Colin?

          COLIN TALAVERA, 15, a dark-skinned Puerto Rican kid, is
          visibly deflated to be singled out; he carries a trumpet
          as he walks glumly toward Johnny and Rebecca. 


  3131INT. LITTLE THEATER - IN BACK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
            (FORMERLY INT. CORRIDOR)

          The muffled sound of the band continues as Johnny and
          Rebecca listen to Colin --

                                        COLIN
                        The principal sent you after me,
                        didn't he?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, but he didn't say why.

                                        COLIN
                        It's not because of me.  It's
                        because of my older brother.  He
                        got into the gang stuff.  Drugs,
                        mostly.  My parents moved here so
                        I'd have a chance, and even here,
                          everyone thinks I'm a criminal or
                        something.  I'm not!

                                        JOHNNY
                          I believe you.  So how long have
                        you been playing trumpet?

                                        COLIN
                        Just started this year.

                                        JOHNNY
                        May I?

          Johnny touches the trumpet as if inspecting it.


  3232VISION: INT. SUBURBAN BEDROOM - DAY 

          Colin's bedroom is filled with reminders of his youth in
          New York -- sports pennants and rap posters -- but also a
          few Cleaves Mills school things.  He leans over a desk,
          intently studying "Malcolm X: On His Own Terms."  And the
          vision ends --          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - ACT ONE - 3/25/04 YEL-2   20A.

                                (Colin looks worried)
                        I think it should be required
                          reading.

                                        COLIN
                        Oh, yeah?  Cool.  Can I go back
                        now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure.  Thanks.

          Colin goes back into band class.  Johnny and Rebecca walk
          from the corridor toward the entry way --

                        Colin seems like a good kid.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All those kids we talked to --
                        they could turn into shooters. 
                        Or they could turn into doctors
                        and lawyers.  There's no telling.

                                        REBECCA
                        Until it's too late. 

          They approach the metal detector; there is a line of half
          a dozen students waiting to exit the building; and a much
          longer line on the other side, waiting to get in.  Johnny
          looks over and sees --


          THE METAL DETECTOR

          A security guard, McCLATCHY, late-twenties, trying a little
          too hard to achieve command presence, lets through two
          pretty girls, then stops Derek, who carries a backpack.

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        I need to look in the bag.

                                        DEREK
                                (re: girls)
                        You didn't look in their bags.

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        Son, you're not getting by until
                        I see what you're carrying.

            McClatchy blocks his way; three jocks, including Charles,
          stand behind him in line, watch, amused.  McClatchy tries
          to grab the backpack; Derek won't let go.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - ACT ONE - 3/17/04 GREEN   21A.


    33ACONTINUED:33A

                                        DEREK
                        I just want to know why you singled
                        me out and no one else.

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        I don't need a reason.  What do
                        you have in there, anyway?

                                        DEREK
                        None of your business.

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        Then you're not coming in.

          Derek grabs his backpack, then turns and leaves; Charles
          and the jocks exchange a glance, then chase him.


          JOHNNY

          turns to Rebecca --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll be right back.

          Johnny runs out through the metal detector, past McClatchy,
          and toward Derek and the three jocks.


  3434EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

          Johnny looks across the field where --


          DEREK

          runs.  Three JOCKS run after him.  Charles grabs his
            backpack, and plays Keep-Away with the two other jocks
          for a moment; when Derek tries to intercept, Charles trips
          Derek. 


          DEREK

          Finds his footing; then takes a swing at Charles.  Charles
          ducks the swing, then knocks Derek to the ground.


          ANOTHER BOY

          Piles on top of Derek, while --





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - ACT ONE - 3/17/04 GREEN   22.


    34CONTINUED:34

          CHARLES

          dumps out Derek's backpack.  It's typical teen stuff; and
          one noted-up copy of Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience."


          JOHNNY

          Catches up with them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Knock it off!  Get off of him! 
                        Now!

          Charles and the three jocks back off; Derek gets up, and
          cleans himself off.  Johnny helps him pick up his stuff.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you okay?

                                        DEREK
                        Yeah.  But that security guy was
                        being a Nazi.  He singled me out. 
                        For no reason.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wouldn't have found anything
                        in your backpack --

                                        DEREK
                        -- that's not the point.  The
                        point is, he has no right.  I
                        didn't do anything.

          Derek stops Johnny from picking up his stuff.

                                        DEREK
                        I got it.  I got it.  You've done
                        enough already.


            MCCLATCHY

          crosses to Johnny and Derek.

                                        MCCLATCHY
                                (to Derek)
                        You come with me.

                        He was making trouble.

                        You're coming with me.

          The guard escorts Derek toward the school.  The other
          kids scatter. 


          REBECCA

          Crosses to Johnny.


          DEREK

          turns around to shoot a glare at Charles; then he makes
          his hand into the shape of a gun, and fires a pretend
          bullet at the boy, smirking.

  3737INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE / WAITING ROOM - DAY

          Johnny and Rebecca sit in the principal's waiting room in
          time to witness (through the window) Derek being chewed
          out by Principal Rowin.  We don't hear what is said, but
          it's clear that Derek remains defiant.  The Principal
          confiscates "Civil Disobedience" and then releases Derek
          into the waiting room.  The boy plops into a seat, and
          slouches away from Johnny.

                        He did a great job, too.  They're
                        sending me home "to think about
                        the impact I have on my peers,
                        and how I can fit in better."

          Stalemate.  No one speaks; then --

                        I got kicked out of school, once.
                        Some friends and I put out an
                          unauthorized student newspaper.

                        Hey, I was fourteen.  They were
                        trying to institute mandatory
                        drug tests.  We fought it.  Your

                        it's pretty gutsy.

          Derek shrugs; of course.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why are they suspending you?

                        Supposedly for fighting.  But I
                        think the real reason is because
                        I'm questioning their rules, and
                        what I write about the school on
                        my 'blog.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll talk to Principal Rowin.

                                        DEREK
                        That's exactly what got me in
                        trouble in the first place -- you
                        talking to the principal.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know that.

          made his plea, and Rowin is responding --

                        If I don't suspend him it breeds
                        disrespect for authority.  A fight
                        is a fight.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There are plenty of kids who have
                        done much worse.

                        puts the others on notice.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Fine, I'll let him off with a
                          warning.  But if those bullets
                        fly, parents will blame me.

          Johnny and Rebecca walk down the same corridor where he
            initially had a vision of the shooting.  It's quiet now;
          the students are in class.  Johnny touches the door frame
          again; not getting a hit.

                        I hope so.

          On the reality side, Rebecca follows Johnny; on the vision

          GUNSHOT rings out; the people SCREAM and duck.

          THE SHOOTER

          Has his back to Johnny, and heads toward the end of the
          hall.  Johnny follows the shooter into --


  4242INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY (SPLIT REALITY)

          On the reality side, three teachers sit around reading
          junky magazines and drinking old coffee; among them is
          Mr. Talbot.  They look up as Johnny and Rebecca enter --

                                        MR. TALBOT
                        Is there some problem?

          Rebecca holds up a hand for them to be silent; Johnny is
          still in his vision --

          On the VISION side of the split reality, the furniture is
          slightly rearranged; the government overtime posters and
          teachers union pictures slightly different; but the room
          is substantially the same.  Sitting on chairs on the VISION
          side are three different teachers than the ones in reality.

          Johnny stands BEHIND the shooter in the vision as the
          gunman considers each of the three teachers, then 
            continues on his way toward the door on the opposite side
          of the room, pausing only to shoot at a --

          COFFEE POT

          which explodes, ending the vision.

          The three teachers watch with curiosity, as Johnny touches
          the coffee pot, then turns to leave, smiling at the
            concerned teachers but saying nothing.  One of the teachers
          looks at his cup of coffee, then sets it down, afraid to
          drink.

          Johnny and Rebecca walk down the hallway.  Rebecca can

          Several doors on the hallway open and students rush out,
          filled with fear, herding past Johnny and Rebecca.  They
          continue into --

          rushes toward the doors, but the passageway is narrowed
          because one door is chained, and the other forces students
          through the metal detector, causing a back-up.  A kid
          with glasses tries to get out but a mass of humanity
          smashes into him; the boy falls.


          ON THE GROUND

          the boy is trampled; his glasses smashed. 


          AT THE CHECKPOINT

          the mass of students smashes through, the metal detector
          CHIRPING repeatedly as they rush out.  Walt passes them,

          be plastic explosive, and finally, a note.  It says, "BOOM. 
          There Go Our Rights."  The bomb squad cop relaxes, opens
          the closet, and pulls out the note.

          Rowin waits impatiently, as if Johnny is his employee.
          Johnny, slightly insulted, nonetheless touches the locker,
          triggering a Dead Zone WHOOSH.

          But we do not see what vision Johnny had.

                        Thank you all for coming tonight. 
                          I suppose I should explain how we
                        got to the place we are now.  You
                        all know Johnny Smith?  Would you
                        stand up please, Johnny?


          IN THE AUDIENCE

          A reluctant Johnny doesn't stand, only barely acknowledges
          Rowin.

                        As you probably know, Mr. Smith
                        has certain abilities that have
                        allowed him to predict incidents
                        which have indeed come to pass. 
                        Monday, he saw that a shooting is
                        going to take place -- here at
                        our school.  But thanks to his
                          warning, we can take precautions
                        to avert this tragedy.

          close to Johnny and divides his attention between Principal
          Rowin and Johnny --

                        taken precautions.  We started
                        today with a visible increase in
                          security.  But that is not enough. 
                        An incident today, involving a
                          terroristic threat in the north
                        wing...
                                (off the crowd murmurs)
                        -- no one was hurt -- but the
                          incident persuaded me to institute
                        a new policy.  Please pass the
                          pamphlets down the rows --


          IN THE AUDIENCE

          Assistants hand out pamphlets labeled "Zero Tolerance:
          Peace and Education"; the illustration is a line drawing
          of a happy student in front of a happy teacher.


          ON THE STAGE

          A white board rolls out behind Rowin; the header says,
          "Zero Tolerance: Harmony Through Enforcement."  Beneath
          that are hand-written rules -- lots of them.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        We're proud to introduce a new
                          zero-tolerance policy.  I think
                        you'll find it reassuring.  I'm
                        going to go over some of the
                          highlights.  Any infraction is
                        grounds for a one-day-suspension;
                        three infractions, expulsion.


          IN THE AUDIENCE

          Johnny sees Kolchak staring him down; gets uncomfortable;
          stands to leave.

  4747INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Derek is lurking by the auditorium door as Johnny and
          Rebecca walk out.  He sees them, and heads for the door.
          Johnny and Rebecca watch him pass --


            MCCLATCHY AND A JUNIOR GUARD

          stare Derek down as he passes then lets himself out.

  4848EXT. METAL DETECTOR - SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY

          A long line of students waits to get into the school. 
          It's cold outside; they're uncomfortable; in front of the
          main door to school, the only one that's open, is a metal
            detector, and several security guards.


          JOHNNY AND REBECCA

          Walk alongside the long line of students, up to the metal
            detector.  As they get there, MCCLATCHY dumps out the
          contents of a pretty girl's pink backpack.  He thrusts a
          cylindrical metal detecting wand into the backpack; then
          pulls it out and runs it along the girl's front and back,
          before letting her go inside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're supposed to meet with

                        You'll have to wait in line with
                          everyone else.

                        I don't set the policy.

          Colin is the next student in line --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Colin --

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        No talking.  I.D.?

          Colin shows a school I.D.  MCCLATCHY checks Colin's name
          against a long computer print-out.

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        Sorry.  You're on the list.

            McClatchy points to Colin's name on the list. 

                                        COLIN
                        You suck.

            McClatchy gestures to two other guards to watch the check
          point; he starts to frisk Colin.

            Principal Rowin walks out through the metal detector
          (setting off chimes) and greets Johnny and Rebecca --

                        You know when you pointed out how
                          enforcing the rules unevenly in
                        the case of Derek Fitz would be
                        unfair?

                        You were right.  It was unfair to
                        single him out.  To be truly fair,
                        I had no choice but to suspend
                          everyone who refused to be
                          searched.

          IN THE LINE BEHIND THEM

          The kids break formation, and swarm; YELLING indicates a
          fight has broken out.  Johnny, Rebecca and Principal Rowin
          rush to the scene of the fight --


          THE FIGHT

          pits Colin vs. Mcclatchy; they're surrounded by a chorus
          of students.  McClatchy is bigger and tougher than Colin,
          and has the upper hand, jamming his knee in Colin's throat.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Break it up!

          They ignore him; McClatchy continues to pound on the boy
          when a BOTTLE flies out of the crowd, SMASHING into
          McClatchy's head, sending SHARDS to the ground.

          Colin takes advantage of the distraction to stand up, and
          run; before he can run very far, two other security guards
          have caught him.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Who threw that?  Who threw that
                        bottle? 


          ON THE FACES OF STUDENTS

          None of them talking.

  4949NEAR THE METAL DETECTOR

          Colin, suffering a black eye and the remnants of a bloody
          nose, is held firmly between two beefy Security Guards; a
          crowd of students stands back, watching curiously. 

            McClatchy sits on the steps, rubbing the back of his head. 
          He's hurt, but not that badly.  As Johnny and Rebecca
          watch, Principal Rowin kneels next to the guard --

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Thank god it's not serious.  Why
                        did you resort to force?

                                        MCCLATCHY
                                (wanna-be cop)
                        He failed to comply with my verbal
                          instruction and resisted letting
                        me search his bag.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        You did the right thing.


          STUDENTS

          them are Derek and Lenora.


          ROWIN

          turns and faces the crowd; Johnny and Rebecca stand behind
          him.  They stop booing when Rowin glares at them --

          Still no answer.  Rowin paces back and forth, then abruptly
          tosses the bottle cap to Johnny, who instinctively catches
          it, triggering --


  5050VISION - REWIND

          The glass shards on the ground reassemble in mid-air into
            a bottle, which un-bounces off of McClatchy's head and
          flies backwards into the crowd, to a person unknown; the
          wall of kids blocks Johnny's view.  The entire vision
          rewinds until it FREEZES as --


          FIXED ARRAY VISION - MCCLATCHY FRISKING COLIN

          Vision Johnny walks close to them; then the vision
            unfreezes as McClatchy frisks Colin.  McClatchy leans
          close to Colin's ear, and whispers something only Johnny
          can overhear --

                                        MCCLATCHY
                        You must of done something.  You
                        people can't help yourselves.

                        Go to hell.

          Unseen by anyone but Johnny, the security guard jabs an
          elbow, hard, into Colin.  Colin reacts by raising his arm
            defensively; McClatchy hits back, hard, jumping on the
          boy.  The action freezes --


          JOHNNY

            continues into the frozen crowd, passing several students

    50CONTINUED:50

          The action un-freezes, and Johnny sees the fight from
          exactly Derek's perspective:

          Colin doubles over and falls to the ground; MCCLATCHY
          leaps on him and pins him down, jamming his knee in the
          boy's throat.  Colin can't breathe.


          DEREK

          sees what is about to happen, and hurls the bottle.  The

                        I saw what happened.  The guard
                        was out of line.

                        If it hadn't been for that bottle
                        Colin might have been injured far
                        worse -- that guard should be
                        fired.

                        That's for me to decide.  Who
                        threw the bottle?  Mr. Smith?

          Standing in the crowd, hears this.  Becomes worried.

          Johnny and Rebecca walk away.

          They pass Derek; Johnny catches the boy's glance; they
          both know that Johnny just did Derek a solid.

  5353EXT. SKATEBOARD PARK - DAY

          Johnny and Rebecca get out of Johnny's car in a seedy
          part of town; and walk toward a skate park.

                                        REBECCA
                        Why are we here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want to talk to Derek.

                                        REBECCA
                                (ahead of him)
                        He threw the bottle?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He pulled the locker stunt, too.
                        He reminds me a lot of myself at
                        that age.

                                        REBECCA
                        How do you know Derek's here?
                        Because of your gift?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because I've lived in Cleaves
                        Mills all my life.

          They look ahead into --

          THE PARK

          Where a dozen or two kids hang out, smoking, skateboarding,
          reading comic books.  Johnny and Rebecca walk past
          suspicious teens, all of whom stop whatever they're doing
          or saying as they pass.  Johnny approaches a kid --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm trying to find Derek Fitz.

          The kid tosses a glance toward a structure in the park;
          Johnny and Rebecca walk toward it where they see --


          DEREK

          Sitting on a bench by himself, reading a new copy of "Civil
            Disobedience."  He looks up. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - ACT THREE - 3/19/04 PINK-2   42.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.

                                        DEREK
                        Can't you just leave me alone? 
                        Every time you get near me, bad
                        things happen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just wanted to talk to you. 
                        See if you could help us before
                        things got out of hand.

                                        DEREK
                        Little late for that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Derek -- I know how you feel. 
                        But now is not the time to bait
                        the principal.

                                        DEREK
                        If no one stands up, then they've
                        won, haven't they?

                                        JOHNNY
                        If someone shoots up the school,
                        we've all lost. 

                                        REBECCA
                        We're here because we're worried
                        about you.

                                        DEREK
                        You think I'm it.  You think I'm
                          a psycho.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No --

                                        DEREK
                        You'd say the same thing if you
                        did as if you didn't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... that's not what I think...
                        We just wanted to...

                                        DEREK
                        ...just wanted to get me busted?

          Derek points behind Johnny.


          ON THE ROAD

          Walt's patrol car pulls up and parks; he gets out.


          IN THE PARK

          The skaters scatter away from Johnny and Rebecca, who
          walk toward the street while Walt walks toward them. 
          When Johnny turns around, Derek is gone.  He looks and
          sees him running.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait!

                                        REBECCA
                        That generated a lot of love and
                        trust.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And goodwill.

          They meet up with Walt.

                                        WALT
                        Was that Derek Fitz?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes.

                                        WALT
                        I've got a warrant for him.

    53CONTINUED: (3)53

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, he's angry; he's a smart
                        ass; but he's not your shooter. 

                                        WALT
                        Don't be so sure, Johnny.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


  5454INT. PRINCIPAL ROWIN'S OFFICE - DAY

          CLOSE ON A VIDEO SCREEN

          From a high, motionless perspective, security camera video
          catches the fight between Colin and McClatchy.  Then, in
          the foreground, near the security camera, Derek is clearly
          visible, winding up his arm, then throwing a glass bottle.


          JOHNNY, WALT, REBECCA AND PRINCIPAL ROWIN

          watch the video together; then Rowin snaps it off.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Even if you could guarantee me he
                        would never shoot anyone, I don't
                        want a kid like that in my school.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw the fight.  That guard was
                        using excessive force.  That kid
                        was defending himself.  Derek was
                        just trying to help him.

                                        REBECCA
                        Derek's not a bad kid.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        That's not my opinion.  If he's
                        willing to hurt someone who is
                        armed and in uniform -- imagine
                        what else he's capable of.  I'm
                        talking to the prosecutor's office
                        about pressing criminal charges.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's overkill -- Walt?

                                        WALT
                        If the guard wants to press
                          charges, my hands are tied, Johnny.

                        I have to arrest him.

          Johnny and Rebecca stand to leave.

  55A55AEXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          Yup that's it alright.


  5656INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Johnny is in the kitchen downing four extra-strength
          tylenol when the door bell rings.


  56A56AAT THE FRONT DOOR

          Johnny opens the door, revealing Derek.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Derek?  What are you doing here? 
                        They're looking all over for you.

                                        DEREK
                        I need to talk to you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure, come in.

          Johnny checks to see if anybody is watching as Derek steps
          inside.


  56B56BBACK IN THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Derek is wolfing down a sandwhich as Johnny gets him a
          drink.

                                        DEREK
                        Thanks man, I was starving.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They got you throwing the bottle
                        on one of the surveillance cameras.

                                        DEREK
                        I was afraid of that.

                        You were trying to defend Colin. 
                        I can vouch for you.  Why don't
                        we call your folks and...

                        I can't go home.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why not?

                                        DEREK
                        I just can't... My Dad will
                          freak... I wish I could wind back
                        the clock three days.  I just
                        want to go back to class.  I like
                        school, even if sometimes I hate
                        it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay... You can stay here for the
                          afternoon while I sort things
                        out... You said you had something
                        you wanted to talk about?

          Derek searches for the right words.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay man, whatever we talk
                        about stays between us.

                        Look, I don't know what the future
                        holds.  Last week I was an A-minus-
                        student with good prospects.  Now
                        I'm expelled.  A fugitive.  I'd
                        like to know for sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Trust me, you're the same kid you
                        were last week -- you're not going
                        to shoot up the school.

          Off Johnny --


  5757INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          Rebecca and Johnny walk the hall; classes are in session
          so the hall is empty except for them, and a distant
          MCCLATCHY.  Johnny touches various lockers as they walk
          toward the T-intersection where the display case is --

                                        JOHNNY
                        He came out of the teacher's
                        lounge; then walked down this
                        way.  He was looking for someone.

          Johnny touches the display case at the T-intersection --


  5858VISION - INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (SPLIT REALITY)

          Rebecca watching in reality, while Johnny, still touching
          the case in the vision, turns to see:


          THE SHOOTER

          As he's emerging from the teacher's lounge.  Johnny gets
          a good look at him now: he's fifteen, he's not high or
          drunk, he's not crazy.  In fact, his face is filled with
          the calm that accompanies determination and a sense of
          mission.

          Johnny watches the shooter fire another shot into the air
          to clear the hallway, then aims right at Johnny as he
          passes, pumping three bullets into the display case,
          shattering it. 

          The shooter continues on, heading into:


          AN OPENING

          At the end of the hall.  The shooter goes through, and
          enters a room; but Johnny is abruptly stopped in mid-
          stride, and the vision ends.          DEAD ZONE: CYCLE OF VIOLENCE - ACT THREE - 3/19/04 BLUE-2   47A-48.


  5959RESUME - INT. CORRIDOR

          Johnny holds a hand to his face; where there had been a
          corridor in his vision, is now a wall.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There was another wing.  Right
                        here.

          Johnny pounds on the wall.  It's solid.  No door. 

                                        REBECCA
                        Maybe it was another hallway.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  This is the only hall with a
                        trophy case.

          Johnny is stumped.  Rebecca notices something over Johnny's
            shoulder. 

                                        REBECCA
                        Johnny, look...


          IN THE CASE

          is a conceptual architectural drawing labeled "PROPOSED
          NORTH WING;" and blueprints, showing where it will go,
          with a red dot labeled "YOU ARE HERE."

                                        JOHNNY
                        They haven't built it yet.
                                (pointing to blueprints)
                        See?  We're standing right there.
                        The addition would be there.

          Johnny looks at the case, wondering.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's it... That's why the
                          corridor in the vision isn't there
                        now...

                                        REBECCA
                        What do you mean?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The shooting... it's not going to
                        happen for years.

          The SCHOOL BELL rings.  Students pour out into the halls;
          they look dispirited and dejected.  They see Johnny, and
          we can feel the tension in their near silence, their fear
          of him, of his predictions, is palpable.

          Johnny, Rebecca, Principal Rowin.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        What do you mean we don't need
                        the extra security?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The shooting isn't going to happen
                        for years.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        I don't understand.  How do you
                        know?

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's a plan to build a new
                        wing.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Sure, there's a plan.  But we
                        haven't raised the money yet. 
                          Construction is five years off --
                        at best.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But one day it will be built; and
                        the shooter is going to find his
                        victim in that that wing.  I saw
                        it...  You can get rid of the
                        metal detectors, the security,
                        all of it.  There's more than
                        enough time to find this kid and
                        help him before he hurts anyone.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Even if you're right -- this time --
                        now that's in place, this extra
                          security is necessary.

                                        REBECCA
                        Your students are terrified. 
                        Your school is a fortress.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Every kid who passes through the
                        doors of my school could be the
                        gunman.  Or worse, one of his
                          victims.

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        I can't take chances.  Especially
                        since everyone in Cleaves Mills

                        But your security measures are
                        causing more trouble than they're
                          stopping.

                                        REBECCA
                        If you don't deal with the root
                        cause of this violence, all the
                        metal detectors in the world won't
                        stop this kind of thing from
                        happening. 

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN
                        Give me the name of the kid who's
                        going to shoot up my school in
                        the future -- that's a root cause
                        I can do something about.

          Off Johnny and Rebecca --


  6161INT. PRINCIPAL'S OUTER OFFICE (FORMERLY CORRIDOR)

          Johnny and Rebecca leave Rowin's inner office, pausing to
          talk in hushed tones before heading out into the hallway.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Even if I saw his face, he won't
                        look anything like the shooter I
                        saw.  He's a little kid now.

                        He'd be what, nine or ten now?

                        -- there were lots of elementary
                        school kids at that show.  The

  6262INT. LITTLE THEATER - DAY

          Johnny and Rebecca enter the Holiday Rehearsal for the
          All-City Band; many of the same kids sing under the
            direction of Mr. Talbot, among them Zeke and J.J.  They're
          in street clothes, singing "I Like All Kinds of People"
          from the children's musical "Howdy, Neighbor!" --

                                        CHILDREN'S CHORUS
                        I like all kinds of people, etc.

          As they sing, Johnny walks over to Talbot.  Johnny whispers
          something, then gestures to J.J. and three of his friends. 
          The song ends.

                                        MR. TALBOT

                        Mr. Smith would like to talk to
                        you.

          The four boys follow Johnny to the wings of the stage,
          while the rest of the chorus continues to rehearse.


            BACKSTAGE

          Johnny kneels down to be at the level of the four boys.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, guys.  Sounds pretty good.

          so is Zeke, which triggers --

          The auditorium match-move-morphs into --


  6464INT. GEORGE J. MITCHELL MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Where a few kids are cowering.  Some instruments and music
          stands let us know where we are; Teen Zeke levels the gun
          straight at Johnny; Johnny whips around to see --


          MR. TALBOT

          Teen Zeke's actual target.

          focuses his full attention on:


          MR. TALBOT

            Cowering, obviously Zeke's only target all along.  Teen
          Zeke aims the gun at Talbot.

                        else again...

          Teen Zeke pulls the trigger, the gunshot sounding like a
          THUNDER CLAP.


          MR. TALBOT

          Realizes he's going to die; sees the barrel flash; then
          FREEZES.  The band room MORPHS back into the Little
          Theater, and Future Mr. Talbot becomes Present Day Mr.
          Talbot as the VISION ENDS.


  6565RESUME - INT. LITTLE THEATER - DAY

          Johnny takes his hand off of Zeke.  He stares at Mr.
          Talbot; then he whispers to Rebecca, who looks at Talbot,
          then at Zeke, then at Talbot again.  Talbot stares back
          with the fear of a man who's waiting to be caught.

          worried, even as he continues to conduct.  Johnny pulls
          out his phone.

  6666INT. PRINCIPAL ROWIN'S OFFICE - DAY - LATER

          Walt sits close enough to Talbot to keep him from escaping;
          next to them is Johnny; across the desk is Rowin.  Police
          reports and mugshots of Talbot, and a WANTED FLYER from
            Minnesota lay on the desk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess there's some things even
                        a metal detector can't keep out.

                                        MR. TALBOT
                                (eyes down)
                          I thought if I could just start
                        over some place new... some place
                        where they didn't know what I'd
                        done... it would be different...
                        I could keep it under control.

          He looks to Johnny for confirmation; Johnny shakes his
          head -- Talbot won't be able to control it.

                        that's all in my past.

                        In Minnesota you did some pretty
                        awful things.  That's not going

                                (to Johnny)
                        If you don't need him anymore,
                        I'd like to get him behind bars
                        now.  As far away from our kids
                        as possible.

          Walt pulls Talbot out of his chair and takes him away.

                        I love them.  I want to play sort

          Zeke looks at Johnny Smith and smiles, never knowing the
            suffering he narrowly avoided, nor what he might have
          done as a result.

          Derek, bookbag in hand, arrives at the back of the line
          at the checkpoint where McClatchy and Security Guard Two
          keep watch.  Derek keeps his head down, hoping McClatchy
          doesn't see him as Guard Two searches his bag.

          Guard Two waves him on, and Derek starts to go through
          the metal detector, but then --

          Derek keeps walking, hoping McClatchy isn't talking to
          him, but before he gets through the metal detector.

                                        MCCLATCHY

          Derek stops, his face to camera, his back still to
          McClatchy.  We can see the exasperation on Derek's face.

          Hearing McClatchey's tone the other guard goes on high

          Guard Two moves to grab Derek.  Derek backs away, holding
          out his hands to show he means no harm.

          The other kids around scatter like frightened deer,
          spooking the guard even more.  Derek is focused on Guard
          Two and doesn't see McClatchy unbutton his holster.

          he clutches the entry wound.  As the phone slips from his
          hand...

          As Johnny heads for the front door and metal detector. 
          In the distance he can see the standoff developing.

  7979INT. AT THE METAL DETECTOR (SEE ADDENDUM PAGES 63 & 64
          FOR ALTERNATE VERSIONS OF SCENE 79)

          With Rowin and Rebecca just behind him, Johnny arrives to
          find McClatchy drawing on Derek, and Derek about to reach
          into his jacket -- Johnny yells above the din --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Guard!  Put down the gun!

            McClatchy turns and faces Johnny, this time not shooting
          Derek, then --

          BAM!!  A shot rings out.  Johnny and McClatchy turn to
          see

          Guard Two suddenly has his gun up, the shot already fired. 
          The damage done. 

                                        GUARD TWO
                        He had a gun.

          Derek looks down at his stomach, a stunned look on his
          face as crimson spreads from where he clutches the entry
          wound.

                                        DEREK
                                (quiet surprise)
                        He shot me? ... It was just a
                        phone.

          As the phone slips from his hand, Johnny and Rebecca rush
          to Derek's side as he collapses.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Derek.  Derek!

          Johnny kneels and takes Derek's hand as the boy dies.
          Rebecca kneels next to them.

            Principal Rowin sees what has happened, then --

                                        PRINCIPAL ROWIN

                        Call nine one one.

            McClatchy and the Guards stare in shock, then --

          We move up see the entire tableau: surrounded by all the
          security equipment and good intentions in the world, Derek
          lies dead in front of his school, as we --

          find McClatchy drawing on Derek, and Derek about to reach
          into his jacket -- Johnny yells above the din --

                        Guard!  Don't shoot!

            McClatchy turns and faces Johnny, this time not shooting
          Derek.  Derek raises his empty hands, then --

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not a gun...

          Johnny walks carefully over to a terrified Derek, who
          keeps his hands up.

          Johnny carefully pulls the phone out of Derek's coat and
          shows everyone.  The guards lower their guns.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...it's a phone.  He was trying
                        to call you, Mr. Rowin... They
                        were going to shoot him...

          The guards look ashamed at their mistake...

                        I just want to go to school...

            Principal Rowin looks horrified by what almost just
            happened.

          Derek, terrified as he realizes he was nearly shot,
