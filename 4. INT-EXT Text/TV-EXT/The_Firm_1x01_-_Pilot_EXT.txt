      The man clutches a BRIEFCASE as he blows past the people 
      around him.  At top speed, he approaches the:


      It s crowded.  Visitors snap photos.  A GUIDE leads some 
      TEENAGERS on a tour.  As the man leaps down the steps, he 
      COLLIDES with the Guide, sending both men flying.  A few 
      pages from the briefcase scatter.

      The man scrambles to his knees.  And now, the CAMERA ZOOMS IN 
      for our CLOSE introduction to: MITCHELL McDEERE, thirty-five.  
      He s sweating, intense, afraid.

      ANGLE MITCH S POV: in the distance, we can see TWO MEN IN 
      DARK SUITS following.  He should abandon his briefcase, but 
      he doesn t.  At great risk, he takes precious seconds to 
      snatch up the pages.  Then, moving quickly:


      Mitch races down the grass along the large reflecting pool.  
      The Two Men are close behind.  And then, Mitch sees a THIRD 
      MAN approaching from the FRONT.

      Mitch stops cold.  He has nowhere to go.  Finally, with no 
      other option, he goes ACROSS THE REFLECTING POOL.  He wades 
      across, knee-deep in the icy water.  The Three Men don t 
      follow.  Instead, they circle around the perimeter.                                                                                       2.



      We FIND Mitch as he reaches a nearby street.  Without 
      stopping, he spots a PICK-UP TRUCK as it passes.  Mitch hurls 
      himself into the open bed of the truck, landing inside with a 
      thud.  The truck drives on, allowing Mitch to get away.  OFF 
      the Three Men, watching him go, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      On the cut, Mitch enters an old-school PHONE BOOTH.  He s 
      soaked from the knees down.  He throws a few COINS in the 
      slot and dials quickly.  We INTERCUT:


      ABBY McDEERE, early-thirties, answers.  She s in a great 
      mood.  She walks toward the school, dressed for work.

                                  ABBY
                    Abby McDeere.

                                  MITCH
                    Abby--

                                  ABBY
                    Mitch?  Hey.  What number are you 
                    calling me from?

                                  MITCH
                    I m at pay-phone.  I can t explain, 
                    where are you--

                                  ABBY
                    I was gonna call you.  Don t 
                    forget, I have those parent-teacher 
                      conferences tonight--

                  ABBY (CONT D)MITCH
      I won t be home until nine--You re still at school?

                                  MITCH
                    Abby.  Listen to me.  Code Red.  
                    You need to get out of there.  We 
                    are in a Code Red--

                                  ABBY
                    What?  Why?

                                  MITCH
                    We can t talk now.  They could be 
                      listening.                                                                                      3.


                                  ABBY
                    Who s listening?  What are you 
                    talking about--

                                  MITCH
                    Baby, please.  I ll explain later, 
                      I promise.  But right now, I need 
                    you to lose your phone and follow 
                    the emergency plan.  You remember 
                    what we said?

                                  ABBY
                    Yes.  You want me to go--

                                  MITCH
                    Don t say it.  Just go.

                                  ABBY
                    Will you be there?

                                  MITCH
                    As soon as I can.  I have to meet 
                    someone first.  Someone who might 
                    know the truth. 

      Abby scans the area.  Is someone watching her?  How much time 
      does she have?

                                  ABBY
                    Mitch.

                                  MITCH
                    I know.  Abby... it s happening 
                    again.

      Abby absorbs his words.  After a terrified beat, we RESUME 
      FULL ON MITCH.  He hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  
      Resolved, he LOOKS UP TO SEE the:


      The enormous hotel looms over the phone booth.  The CAMERA 
      pans up to the 18th FLOOR.  As Mitch walks toward the hotel, 
      still dripping wet, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      We open on Boston in late DECEMBER.  The film s iconic PIANO 
      SCORE plays as we begin a quick Boston MONTAGE:

      * A Salvation Army SANTA CLAUS rings his bell.
      * STUDENTS brave the cold in Harvard Square.
      * A HOMELESS MAN in a RED SOX jersey begs for change.

      The CAMERA FINDS a SNOW PLOW decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.  
      Slowly, the massive machine rolls past the:


      OFF the brick facade and towering windows, we PRE-LAP:

                                  JUDGE HUFF (O.S.)
                    Counsel, your appearances please?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Mitch exits the courthouse, headed home.  Kevin Hanophy exits 
      right behind him:

                                  KEVIN
                    Hey, Mitch...
                          (catching up)
                    Kevin Hanophy.

                                  MITCH
                          (still moving)
                    Of the IRS...

                                  KEVIN
                    Nah, it s the holidays.  For the 
                    next two weeks, the only thing I 
                    represent is peace on earth and 
                    good football for all.

      OFF Mitch and Kevin as they walk, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      On the cut, the doors open.  A line of THIRD GRADERS walk 
      excitedly to a YELLOW BUS.  And suddenly:

      We RACK FOCUS to a NEW ANGLE.  Now, we are watching the kids 
      from ABOVE.  Instantly, we INTERCUT TO:                                                                                      9.



        A terrifying sight: an UNKNOWN MAN, dressed in black, watches 
      the schoolyard.  He scans the area with a high-powered RIFLE.  
      After a beat, he looks down at the PHOTO in his hand: it s a 
      PICTURE OF ABBY.


      Mitch and Kevin on the move.  They walk on the sidewalk, 
      alongside a row of parked cars at the curb:

                                  KEVIN
                    So, any big plans for New Year s?

                                  MITCH
                    Not really.  Abby and I like to 
                    keep it simple.  A little Szechuan 
                    Beef from Wong Boys, maybe a glass 
                    of champagne.

                                  KEVIN
                    I didn t realize you and your wife 
                    were senior citizens.                                                                                    10.


                                  MITCH
                    Doesn t sound like much, but... 
                    it s kinda become a tradit--

      BAM!  He doesn t finish.  Suddenly, the PARKED CAR beside 
      them EXPLODES!

      Glass shatters.  Metal twists and burns.  The blast rockets 
      them into the air.  As they fall to the ground:

      ANGLE MITCH: all SOUND IS MUFFLED NOW.  His face and torso 
      are cut, his clothes are torn.  Trying to focus, he crawls 
      toward Kevin, who isn t moving.

      Suddenly, a VAN screeches to a stop.  In the blur, Mitch 
      watches the door slide OPEN.  TWO FBI AGENTS leap out:

                                  FBI AGENT
                    Mr. McDeere, FBI--

      But Mitch can t hear.  For a tense beat, he s not sure who 
      these men are.  Finally, they grab him and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A small but beautiful home in Northern Virginia, just outside 
      Washington D.C.

      We PICK UP Mitch in his driveway.  As he approaches his car, 
      he spots an old PLYMOUTH with tinted windows parked opposite 
      the house.  The car screams  Government Vehicle.   Mitch 
      walks toward it with a smile:

                                  MITCH
                    You miss me, Louis.  It s okay, you 
                    can admit it.

      And now, Louis Coleman exits the Plymouth.  His Marshal s 
      badge is on his belt.

                                    COLEMAN
                    Nice place.  How s Abby?  Claire 
                    causing trouble on her birthday?

                                  MITCH
                    Always.

      The two men shake hands.

                                  MITCH (CONT D)
                    We re not in the Program anymore, 
                    Louis.  I hate to break it to you, 
                    but I think it s time you start 
                    seeing other victims.

                                    COLEMAN
                    You left the Program.  That doesn t 
                    mean you re out of danger.

      An awkward beat.  They ve had this discussion before.  
      Coleman never wanted Mitch to leave Witness Protection.

                                  MITCH
                    Let s not do this again.

                                    COLEMAN
                    Come on, Mitch.  You really think 
                    you re safe?  You re not.  I told 
                    you, Joey Morolto--

                                  MITCH
                    Joey Morolto is dead.  He died
                    in prison six months ago.  It s 
                    over, Louis.

                                    COLEMAN
                    Why, because you say it is?                                                                                    21.


                                  MITCH
                    Look around, man.  It s been more 
                    than ten years.  I don t see anyone 
                    out here but you and me.

                                    COLEMAN
                    I m a Federal Marshal.  With all 
                    due respect, I m worried about a 
                    lot more than what you can see.

      Coleman takes an ENVELOPE from his jacket pocket.  He removes 
      a PHOTO and hands it to Mitch.

                                    COLEMAN (CONT D)
                    Your kid s not the only one who had 
                      a birthday this week.  You know who 
                    that is?

      ANGLE THE PHOTO: we SEE a polished YOUNG MAN in his mid-
      twenties, wearing a black suit.  The man is shaking hands 
      with an older man who looks like a Gangster.

                                  MITCH
                    No.

                                    COLEMAN
                    Joey Morolto Junior.

                                  MITCH
                          (thrown)
                    I didn t know the old man had a 
                    kid.

                                    COLEMAN
                    That s because he was only fifteen 
                    when his father went to prison.
                          (a beat)
                    Junior turned twenty-five this 
                    week.  And as a birthday gift, they 
                    made him boss of the Family.

                                  MITCH
                    Then I m sure he has a lot more to 
                    worry about than me.

                                    COLEMAN
                    I don t know.  If it were me, the 
                    guy who sent my Dad to prison for 
                    life?... he d be right at the top 
                    of my list.

                                  MITCH
                          (calmly)
                    I gotta go.  I have an Arraignment.                                                                                    22.


                                    COLEMAN
                    Fathers and sons, Mitch.  Trust
                    me, when you mess with that bond, 
                    anything can happen.

      But Mitch is gone, moving back to his car.  He gives Coleman 
      a quick wave.  OFF him, we go:

      CLOSE ON: an ASHTRAY filled to the brim with CIGARETTE BUTTS 
      smeared with bright pink LIPSTICK.  A woman s hand moves into 
      frame and tamps out another.  Her bright pink nails match the 
      lipstick.  Then REVEAL:


      On the cut, Ray exits his car outside the shabby public 
      school.  The building itself looks exhausted: a worn brick 
      structure with a huge black-top yard in front.  A ten-foot 
      tall chain-link FENCE surrounds the lot.  A sign attached 
      says: Calvin Coolidge Middle School, No Visitors Without 
        Authorization. 

      Undaunted, Ray walks to a DOOR in the fence and enters.  He 
      strides across the empty yard, arriving at the center where 
      police have taped off a small CRIME SCENE.  Nathan Williams  
      blood has been washed away, but still stains the pavement.

      Suddenly, we SMASH TO A FLASHBACK.  In quick flashes, Ray 
      envisions the killing just as Anthony described.  The two 
      boys fight in the empty yard.  As Nathan falls, we:

      RESUME on Ray.  He takes out his digital CAMERA as:

                                  MANUEL (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.  Hey.  You can t do 
                    that.  

      Ray turns to see MANUEL REYES, the school SECURITY GUARD 
        approaching.  Manuel, forties, wears a uniform.  He s tough 
      but not athletic; the type who shaved off his beloved Fu-
      Manchu years ago in an effort to clean up his act.

                                  MANUEL (CONT D)
                    No reporters, man.  I m supposed to 
                    send all you guys to the office.

                                  RAY
                          (going with it)
                      Seriously?  I just need one good 
                    shot.  The story s gotta be in by 
                    five.                                                                                    40.


                                  MANUEL
                    Can t help you, Chief.  As it is, 
                    I m lucky I still have a job after 
                    what happened.

                                  RAY
                    Yeah, okay, sure, no problem.
                          (extends his hand)
                    Ray McDeere.

                                  MANUEL
                    Manny Reyes.

      Manuel shakes his hand.  As he does, the CUFF of his shirt 
      rises to expose a small TATTOO in the web of his thumb and 
      forefinger.  The NUMBER 63.  Ray knows it instantly.

                                  RAY
                      Sixty-three.

      Manuel pulls his hand back.

                                  MANUEL
                    Year I was born.

                                  RAY
                    They believe that?  The school.  I 
                    mean, I assume that s what you told 
                    them to get this job, but we both 
                    know it isn t true.

      Manuel just stares.

                                  RAY (CONT D)
                    The six-three.  It s a police 
                    precinct up in Riverside Heights.  
                    It s also the street gang that
                    runs that area.
                          (off his look)
                    I did time inside at Brushy 
                    Mountain.  I knew a lot of good 
                    people with that tattoo.

      A tense beat.

                                  MANUEL
                    I left that behind a long time ago.  
                    What d you go in for?

                                  RAY
                      Manslaughter.

      Silence.  The two men hold a look.  Manuel s thrown, but he 
      doesn t flinch.  Instead, he deadpans:                                                                                    41.


                                  MANUEL
                    Did the guy deserve it?

                                  RAY
                    Hell yes.  Doesn t mean I don t 
                    regret it.  But shit happens when 
                    you re young and stupid.

      That finally softens Manuel.

                                  MANUEL
                    I heard that.  So... you re not a 
                    reporter?

                                  RAY
                    Private investigator for the 
                    defense.  Any chance you could tell 
                    me what happened?

                                  MANUEL
                    Cops said not to talk about it.
                          (then, admitting)
                    Truth is, I didn t see it go down.  
                    I was over at the food truck getting 
                    some coffee.  When I turned around, 
                    they were already running.

                                  RAY
                    Who was running?

                                  MANUEL
                    Both of them.  Anthony Heywood, the 
                    one they arrested, and Dougie Breen.  

                                  RAY
                    Two kids.  You re sure?

                                  MANUEL
                    Course I m sure.  I see the same 
                    kids every day.  I turned around in 
                    time to see Nathan fall.  Those two 
                    took off like a shot.

      A stunned beat.  Ray looks over to the FOOD TRUCK.  As he 
      envisions what happened, we SMASH TO A FLASHBACK.  Ray sees  
      Manuel turn back to the yard.  At that moment, Nathan goes 
      down and TWO BOYS bolt away.  Then RESUME on Ray.

                                  RAY
                    Thanks.

      OFF Ray, and this new account, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    42.



      Claire s BIRTHDAY PARTY underway.  Claire takes a birthday 
      GIFT from a young GIRL.  She then runs to FIND ABBY, who is 
      sitting at table nearby.  A stack of presents is forming:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Mom!  This one s from Julia Heeney.

                                  ABBY
                    Julia, got it.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (hushed, happy)
                    They came, Mom.  Everyone I invited.  
                    This is huge.

      And Claire s off again, rejoining the other girls in the 
      yard.  It s a beautiful, suburban party.  Abby looks around 
      at the tables with food, the lights, the banner wishing her 
      daughter a  HAPPY 10TH BIRTHDAY  and for the first time in 
      awhile, she feels... calm.  After a beat, she notices that 
      Mitch isn t in the yard.  OFF her:


      Mitch steps out of the house.  He looks down the block toward 
      the car, but it s too far away to see clearly.                                                                                    60.


      After a beat, he takes a step or two in the car s direction 
      when:

      The engine STARTS.  Mitch freezes.  Instead of moving toward 
      Mitch, the car backs calmly into a driveway and pulls away in 
      the opposite direction.

      What just happened?  Was someone watching the house?  Was it 
      just Louis?  Is there really a threat or did he imagine the 
      danger?  As Mitch stands a few steps outside the house:

                                  ABBY (O.S.)
                    Hey, everything okay?

      Mitch turns to SEE Abby at their front door.

                                  MITCH
                    Yeah... it s fine.

                                  ABBY
                    Well, come on.  We re all ready to 
                    sing.

      And Abby disappears, back inside.  OFF Mitch, the SOUND OF 
      TWO DOZEN GIRLS singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY takes us to:


      Mitch and Abby deliver the glowing cake to Claire.  She s 
      surrounded by friends, glowing herself, happier than ever.

      The CAMERA PUSHES CLOSE on Mitch, taking in the moment.  His 
      family s come so far since Memphis.  All those years running 
      from the past... what a feeling to finally stop running.  As 
      Claire blows out the candles and the group cheers, we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      QUICK SHOTS establish the restaurant, on the corner of a 
      rundown block in Washington D.C.  A young MOTHER exits and 
      runs to catch the city bus at the corner.  A few KIDS on 
      their way to school pass a HOMELESS MAN outside.


      The MAN strides away.  As he goes, his jacket brushes aside 
      and we SEE A NINE-MILLIMETER HANDGUN in his belt.  OFF him, 
      moving quickly now, we:

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT SIX                                                                                    82.


                                      ACT SEVEN

      FADE IN:


      The CAMERA FLOATS DOWN on a small row-house, in a lower-
      middle class section of D.C.  It s not much, but the house is 
        well-cared-for.  On the steps outside, a makeshift memorial 
      of candles and flowers has formed around a school PHOTO of 
      Nathan Williams.

      The CAMERA FINDS a POLICE SQUAD CAR as it pulls to the curb.  
      TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS exit and approach the front door.  As 
      they RING the doorbell, we INTERCUT TO:


      Mitch s CAR pulls to a stop in front of the mid-sized, brick 
      building.  A sign out front tells us that this is a facility 
      for LONG TERM, ACUTE CARE.                                                                                  107.


                                  MITCH
                          (to Abby, as he exits)
                    I ll be right back.

                                  ABBY
                    The service starts in twenty 
                    minutes.

      Mitch nods, then heads for the lobby as we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      On the cut, Mitch and Abby exit their car, arriving at the 
      FUNERAL SERVICE for Nathan Williams.                                                                                  108.


      All around them, people exit their cars and walk onto the 
      grass toward the gathering by the grave-side.  STUDENTS and 
      TEACHERS are there, along with FAMILY MEMBERS and FRIENDS 
      from the neighborhood.  Nathan was truly loved.

      Mitch takes Abby s hand.  With some trepidation, they 
      approach the group.  As they walk, they spot Richard and 
      Karen Williams, standing with their family.

      When Karen sees Mitch, her face hardens.  She steps away from 
      the others to confront Mitch and Abby as they arrive:

                                  KAREN
                          (quietly)
                    You re not welcome here.

      But then, she feels a HAND on her shoulder.  Williams stands 
      behind her:

                                    RICHARD
                    I asked them to come.

      Karen doesn t understand.  She doesn t know about how her 
      husband was saved -- and she never will.  But she doesn t 
      argue.  Instead, without more, she rejoins her family.

      Mitch and Williams hold one last look.  Then, Williams goes 
      as well, taking his place among the others.  As he returns, 
      his EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER rushes to his side.  She clings 
      to his leg for support, holding her father.  It s clear how 
      much she needs him now.

      As the MINISTER begins, the CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE on Mitch 
      and Abby.  It s a moving moment.  Until... suddenly, we hear 
      an unexpected sound...

      A CLICKING NOISE.  Then another.  And soon we realize we are 
      hearing the SHUTTER SNAP of a DIGITAL CAMERA.  And we REVEAL:

      OUR UNKNOWN MAN -- the same man we saw outside the McDeere 
      house with a gun -- at the edge of the cemetery.  He s taking 
      PHOTOS with a long lens. 

      ANGLE THE DIGITAL CAMERA POV: we see Mitch and Abby through 
      the CAMERA, unaware of the danger in the distance.  OFF their 
      faces, and a building sense of dread, we finally go:

      CLOSE ON:

      A beautiful FOUNTAIN PEN as it artfully glides along a sheet 
      of high-grade paper.  As it moves, we SEE A NAME take shape:

                                  ANDREW BECKETT, ESQ.                                                                                  109.


      A HAND comes into view.  It takes hold of an old, WOODEN 
      STAMP sitting on the desk nearby.  The hand presses the stamp 
      into a RED INKPAD and returns to the paper.

      ANGLE THE PAPER: which we now recognize to be a legal 
      document.  At the top of the document, the hand PRESSES THE 
      STAMP DOWN, marking it with a single red word:

                                            PRIVILEGED

      And now we WIDEN TO REVEAL:
