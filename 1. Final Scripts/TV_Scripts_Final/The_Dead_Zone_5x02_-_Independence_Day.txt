          FADE IN:

          CLOSE ON a weathered light box rotating uneasily atop a
          rusty pole; HAPPY B-DAY AMERICA spelled out in crooked
          letters.  SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal the...


  11EXT. TOMMY'S DINER - DAY - ESTABLISHING

          The quintessential American truck stop.  A scorching July
          sun assaults the dusty parking lot.  We FIND Bruce's Nissan
          Murano.

                                        DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
                        Happy fourth, friends and
                        neighbors.  Two hundred thirty
                        and the old girl's still kickin'...


  22INT. TOMMY'S DINER - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON A RADIO

          An ancient solid-state transistor; crappy speakers...

                                        DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
                        This is Jammin' Jack, keepin' you
                        hoppin' and boppin' to the music
                        that helped make us the land of
                        the free, home of the brave and
                        birthplace of the five dollar
                        cup'a coffee!  It's one o'clock
                        and it's time to be good... Johnny
                        B. Goode.  This is Chuck Berry!

          A HAND SWITCHES THE RADIO OFF just as the music is about
          to kick in.  We PICK UP a young, attractive WAITRESS (25),
          MOVING through the hustle and bustle of the lunch crowd,
            balancing full plates above her head...

          FINDING JOHNNY and BRUCE in a corner booth.  Presenting
          Bruce with a ridiculously oversized burger.

                                        WAITRESS
                        Double bacon chili cheeseburger
                        and fries for tall, dark, and
                          handsome.

          Sliding a diminutive salad over to Johnny.

                                        WAITRESS
                        Garden salad, dressing on the
                        side for blondie.  So, where you
                        boys headed?

                          Harborfest.

                                        BRUCE
                        Biggest fireworks display on the
                        East Coast.

                                        WAITRESS
                                (smiling at Johnny)
                        Sounds like fun.  Maybe I'll head
                        over with one of my girlfriends
                        after work.

          She lingers a beat, then realizing he's not taking the
          bait, sets the check down on the table.

                                        WAITRESS
                                (dejected)
                        You can pay at the counter.

          She walks away.  Johnny dives into his salad under Bruce's
          incredulous gaze, finally...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        BRUCE
                        What?  She was totally into you.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (oblivious)
                        She was?

          Bruce shakes his head.

                                        BRUCE
                        Y'know, you might be able to see
                          everything, but sometimes you are
                        completely blind.  Come to think,
                        she reminds me of a girl I used
                        to date in high school.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah?

                                        BRUCE
                                (remembers fondly)
                        Marsha Harris.  Man, that poor
                        girl was crazy about me.  Took
                        her to the Junior prom.
                                  (confident)
                        A night she never forgot.

          They both reach for the napkin dispenser at the same

          moment; their hands connecting.  We hear a WHOOSH!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that right?

          Johnny can't help but smile.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's so funny?

          A decisive beat.  Johnny relents, the opportunity ripe...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was just wondering which part
                        of the prom you think Marsha
                          remembers most?  Your Mom drivin'
                        you guys around in the family
                        station wagon or you comin' up
                        short on the good-night kiss?

          Johnny enjoys the moment.  Bruce is mortified.  He sets
          down the burger, rising to his feet. 

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll get the check.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You barely took a bite.

                                        BRUCE
                        Lost my appetite.

          Bruce walks off.  Johnny is left holding his fork...


  33EXT. TOMMY'S DINER - MOMENTS LATER - MOVING WITH BRUCE

          as he stomps through the parking lot; Johnny trails a
          half step behind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come on...  I was only kidding. 
                        So you were a late bloomer.  I
                        missed my prom with the flu. 
                        Sarah still hasn't forgiven me.

          Bruce stops in his tracks, spinning on Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's not about the prom, it's
                        about you and me.  You think it's
                        hard being a psychic?  Try being
                          a psychic's best friend.  That's
                        hard.

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        I mean, it'd be nice to spend
                        just one day without you peeking
                        inside my head.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Alright.

          Bruce's scowl ebbs.

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're off limits for the next 24
                        hours, you've got my word.

          Johnny offers his hand. 

          Bruce hesitates, then shakes.  Something O.S. draws his
          concern...

                                        BRUCE
                        You can't be serious!!

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's wrong?


          REVERSE ON THE MURANO

          a large dent in the front fender; fresh white paint
          imbedded in the metal.


          RESUME ON BRUCE

          He scans the lot; the perpetrator long gone.

                                        BRUCE
                        Some jerk smashes into my car and
                        he doesn't leave note or anything. 
                        What is wrong with people today?

          Johnny steps to the fender, surveying the damage.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not so bad.

          CLOSE ON THE FENDER

          Johnny floats his palm across the damage... WHOOSH! 


  44INT. MURANO - VISION

          The car has been CRASHED, the windshield shattered. 
          Observer Johnny, steps up to the open passenger window,
          as he glances over to SEE Bruce crushed down in the driver
          seat, still gripping the broken steering wheel; his gaze
          locked ahead.  There's a SURREAL quality to everything,
          like TIME HAS SLOWED DOWN and SOUND ECHOES.

          Bruce slowly turns to him... a trickle of blood escapes
          the corner of his mouth.  Two similar streams materialize
          from his nostrils.  His eyes flicker as he eases back in
          the seat, taking a final strained breath as he passes
          away...

          Observer Johnny looks to his right, spotting an EXIT SIGN
          that reads, "BAYVILLE ROAD EXIT"... 


  55RESUME - EXT. PARKING LOT - ON JOHNNY

          Johnny flashes out, rattled to the core by the vision. 
          Bruce is still checking out his bumper.

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't see any other damage.
                                (checks his watch)
                        Oh, dude, we are seriously behind
                          schedule.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce I just had a vision...

          Bruce reacts, both hands going up; halting Johnny in his
          tracks.

                                        BRUCE
                        If it's about me, or my car, I
                        don't want to hear it.  You gave

                        But...

                        But nothing.  Deal's a deal.

          Johnny hesitates, trapped.  Then...

                          Alright, but I'm driving.

          Bruce shoots Johnny an incredulous stare.  Johnny is
            resolute; his hand outstretched.

                                        BRUCE
                        As long as we get on the road.

          He tosses Johnny his keys and moves to get in the passenger
          seat. 

          Johnny palms the keys, gripping them tight.  No vision. 
          He reacts with disappointment. 

          Bruce looks back from beside the passenger side door...

                                        BRUCE
                        You comin'?

  88INT. MURANO - CONTINUOUS - ON BRUCE

          watching with frustration as endless vehicles eclipse
          them.  Shifting his attention to Johnny at the controls.

                                        BRUCE
                        Dude, you think we can try and
                        make it before July fourth of
                        next year?

          Johnny's preoccupied with the Teaser Vision; lost in his
          own thoughts.  Bruce watches him, annoyed.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (snapping back)

                                        BRUCE
                        It'd be nice if we get to the
                        harbor today.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm doing the speed limit.

          Bruce reaches for the radio, fiddling with the controls...

                        That's what he said.

                        That might be a problem.

          Bruce stares out the window in disgust.

                        Could this day get any worse?

          Johnny considers the question, then...

                        Listen, I really need to tell you

                          Whatever it is, I'm sure you'll
                        set it right.  Just let it die.

                        Bad as it gets.

          Bruce tries to let it register.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.  I had to tell you.

          A beat.

                        How does it happen?

                        I don't know.  I've been touching
                        the inside of the car, but I just
                        keep seeing the same thing over
                        and over.

                        Don't worry.  We'll figure this
                        out.  In the vision you were
                          driving, so we'll just make sure
                        you don't get behind the wheel.

                                        BRUCE
                        Right.  I just need to stay calm. 
                        Keep cool.

          We PAN OVER to the dash mounted clock... 1:20PM.

                        better turn the engine off.

          Johnny kills the motor, simultaneously stifling the flow
          of cold air into the cabin.  Another beat of silence. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we should get some fresh
                        air.  Stretch our legs.

          Bruce stares off.  Preoccupied.  Annoyed.

          Johnny reaches for the door handle, then remembers and
          takes the car keys with him.

                        Just in case.

          He shoots Bruce a comforting smile and gets out...

                        She's right over there in our
                        camper.  It'd be a real honor.

                        Of course he'll go.  Johnny Smith
                        never disappoints a fan.

                          Awesome!

          Off Johnny's look at Bruce...

                                (to Bruce)
                        You coming?

          Bruce has locked his eyes on the woman in the bikini
          sunbathing on her car's hood.

                        Think I'll check out the
                          neighborhood.  Use my time
                          productively.  What I got left.

          He walks away.

                        Your friend seemed kind'a fried.

          NIKKI GRIFFITH (25) abundantly pregnant; lounges on a
          futon, perusing a magazine.  Wearing a tie-dyed maternity
          dress, a daisy crown riding atop her head.  The RV's
          furnishings are decidedly retro, right down to the shag
          carpet.  She looks up as...

          The side door opens to reveal Brian...

                                        BRIAN
                        Baby, are you dressed?  I got
                          somebody you need to meet.

          Nikki has her back to the door as she's slipping into a
          loose fitting shirt.

                                        NIKKI
                        Brian, I'm trying to...

          Johnny enters behind a beaming Brian.

                                        BRIAN
                        Can you believe it?  It's really

                        We're way into the whole spiritual
                        nature of the cosmos thing.  Man
                        versus Nature.

          Johnny nods, but isn't sure what this guy's talking about.

                                        NIKKI
                        You probably already knew that...
                        being you.  Hey, why don't you
                        sit down?  We got plenty of room.

          Johnny hesitates, looking back; searching futilely for an

          Johnny sits across from the young couple.  They stare
          back at him, mesmerized.  An awkward scenario as they
          launch rapid-fire inquiries....

                                        NIKKI
                        So, do you see your visions in

          They smile at each other as they are clearly loving this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not exactly like that...

                        Can you tell how something's gonna'
                        turn out?  Like if there's going
                        to be a happy ending?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Happy ending?

          Brian and Nikki share a conspiratorial look.

                                        BRIAN
                        We don't mean to be rude or
                          anything, but would you mind?

          Nikki lifts her baggy t-shirt exposing her very ripe belly. 
          Johnny's taken aback by such a personal gesture.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gee, I don't know...

                                        NIKKI

                        Nikki gets these feeling sometimes. 
                        Like when something bad is going
                        to happen.

                        It would sure make us feel better.

          Johnny hesitates, but the look on their faces is too much
          for him to ignore.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess I could give it a try.

          The young husband and wife take each other's hand, then...


          CLOSE ON NIKKI'S STOMACH

          Johnny's fingers hover over her belly.  Gentle contact...
          WHOOSH! 


  1515MATCH, MOVE, PAN...

          Nikki screams in tremendous pain, a blood curdling shriek. 
          Sweat pours down her ashen face.  Her breathing strained
          and uneven. Intense labor underway... still in the RV,
          still stuck in traffic.

                                        NIKKI
                                (excruciating pain)
                        There's something wrong!  There's

                        The shoulder is too narrow for a

                        Hey!  Watch the leather!

          Johnny scans the sea of traffic.  Something in the distance
            connects.  Bingo!  Johnny jumps down.

                        To find somebody who can help.

          He takes off through the parked cars.  SHOT HOLDS on Bruce.

          TRACKING through traffic.  Traversing a maze of immobile
          vehicles and random MOTORISTS, until he reaches a...


          POLICE CRUISER - HIGHWAY PATROL

          landlocked by the traffic; another victim of the
          congestion.  Johnny rounds the driver's side -- the car
          is empty.  As he peers in through the window...

                                        MASSEY (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

          Johnny TURNS to face...


          OFFICER J. MASSEY

          a man in his early thirties, crewcut; substantial physique
            straining against the confines of his police uniform.

                          Officer, thank God you're here. 
                        There's a woman.  She's going to
                        need medical attention.

                        She's going to have a baby.  I
                        don't think we have much time.

                                        MASSEY
                        You a doctor?

                        Uh, no, I'm not.

                                        MASSEY
                        Then what are we talking about?

                        If you could just get on your
                        radio and call in a helicopter...

                          A helicopter?  Alright, I've heard
                        enough.  You should go back to

                        It could be a matter of life and
                        death.

          Massey considers the look in Johnny's eyes and slips behind
          the wheel of his cruiser.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

          He picks up the handset.  (NOTE: THERE SHOULD BE A LABEL
            SOMEWHERE THAT READS "UNIT 557".)

          Johnny leans into the car, resting the palm of his hand
          on the doorframe.  A blast of STATIC erupts from the
          speakers... WHOOSH!


  1919EXT. DIRT ROAD - MORNING - VISION

          Johnny has taken Officer Massey's place, wearing his
          uniform.  Speaking into the same handset; standing
            alongside his parked cruiser.  Just ahead... an old farm
          pickup; askew in a ditch. 

                                        OFFICER JOHNNY

                        Copy dispatch.

          Officer Johnny drops the radio, replacing it with his
          service 9mm.  He approaches the truck with caution, the
          powerful pistol leading the way...


          JOHNNY'S POV - INSIDE OF THE CAB

          A beam of light dances across the tattered upholstery. 
          Drops of blood stain the fabric.  Shards of shattered
          glass everywhere.  Otherwise empty.


          BACK TO OFFICER JOHNNY

          heading back to his cruiser, holstering his weapon.  Back
          to the radio...

            FOOTSTEPS from behind draw Johnny's attention.  He TURNS...
          A pipe swings through the air... our world goes BLACK! 


  2020RESUME SCENE

          Johnny flashes out of the vision to more static.

                                        MASSEY
                        I'll let you know when I make

                        you return to your vehicle.

          On Johnny, considering what he just saw.

          The police officer raises an eyebrow, studying him
          curiously.

                                        MASSEY
                        There something else on your mind?

          Off Johnny's hesitation, a long conflicted beat...

          through the gridlock and motorists.  The festive mood has
          ebbed, replaced by long, frustrated faces.  The oppressive
          combination of boredom, helplessness, and sweltering heat
          taking a toll.

          As a HAND reaches in and kills the radio...


          NEW ANGLE

          Johnny and Bruce lean on the Murano's fender.   Both down
          to undershirts.  Hot, sweaty and uncomfortable.

                                        BRUCE
                        What did the cop say when you*
                        told him about the vision?*

                                        JOHNNY
                        He looked at me like I was nuts. *
                        Can't really blame him.  Why should
                        he believe a total stranger?

                        later, right now we got bigger
                          problems.  I've asked around and

                        Me?

          Bruce reacts; the pressure and heat getting to him.

                                        BRUCE
                        I can't believe this!  My last

                        Look, it's hot and it's
                          uncomfortable, but you are not
                        gonna' die today.  Not if I can

                        Y'ever wonder if bad things happen
                        for a reason?  Like maybe there's
                        a plan for each of us and when we
                        mess with it, it throws the whole
                        thing off balance.

  2323EXT. CEMETERY - DAY - VISION

          Lush rolling hills, a sprawling expanse dotted with
          headstones.  Observer Johnny stands alongside a MIDDLE
          AGED COUPLE, the woman sobs; her husband doing his best
          to comfort her.

          She kneels down at a grave marker, laying out a bouquet
          of flowers.  Addressing the stone through tears...

                                        MOURNING WOMAN
                        It doesn't make sense.  He was
                        only eighteen.  Nobody should die

  2424BACK TO JOHNNY

          Bruce is watching him as he flashes out of the vision.

          JAKE

          hovers by the Jeep, flanked by his friends; all staring
          at Johnny.

                        Hey, mister!  Little help!


          JOHNNY

          stares back at Jake.  Bruce can tell there's something
          wrong.

                                        BRUCE
                        What now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That kid is going to die today. 
                        I just saw his parents standing
                        over his grave.

                        How?

                        I don't know.  But I'm starting
                        think we both should have stayed
                        in the car.

          With that he launches the football back.

          Jake leaps for a perfect catch.  Lateraling the ball to
          an unsuspecting friend.  The football skims off his
          friend's fingertips, skittering end over end...

          SLAMMING off the windshield of the white pickup.

          Grim wobbles from the cab; clearly intoxicated.  He picks
          the football up off the pavement.

                                        JAKE
                        Sorry about that.

                                        GRIM
                        This belong t'you?

                                        JAKE
                        Yeah.  Can I have it back?

                                        HANK
                        Give the kid his football.

                        Sure thing, little brother.

          He pulls a significant hunting knife from his belt sheath,
          driving it mercilessly into the pigskin.  HISS!  He tosses
          the deflated ball back to Jake.

                                        GRIM
                        Here ya' go.

                                (angry)
                        What's your problem?

          Jake steps towards the big man holding the hunting knife.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, no.

          He rushes in, intercepting Jake before he can reach Grim.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whoa!  Take it easy!

                        Guy just stabbed my football to
                        death!

                                        GRIM

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not worth it, Jake.  He's
                        looking for a fight.

                        Who are you?  How'd you know my
                        name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walk away and I'll explain. 
                        Please?  Just walk away.

          Jake hesitates, his anger waning.  Grim watches them go;
          popping open a new brew.

                                        GRIM
                        That's right!  Go have yourself a

                        Don't you think you've had enough
                        to drink?

          Grim turns to face him.

                                        GRIM
                        What's it to you, bro?

                        Hear that, little brother?  My
                        new friend thinks I've had too
                        much to drink.

                                        HANK
                        He's right.

          He regards Bruce with a look.

                                        HANK
                        It's okay, I'll keep an eye on
                        him.

          Bruce starts away, when something catches his eye...

                                        BRUCE

          BACK TO BRUCE

          anger burning in his eyes.  Approaching Hank.

                        You sideswiped my car back at the
                        truck stop.

          Before Hank can respond, Grim intercedes.

                                        GRIM
                        Your beef is with me.  I was

                        Hell I am.

          Grim pushes Bruce; hard.  Bruce gathers himself, puffs
          his chest and charges...

          Johnny leads Jake to the Jeep, looking back; shocked...

          Bruce reacts.

                        John, look out!

          Johnny turns... right into Grim's left hook.  As it catches
          his chin... WHOOSH! 


  2727VISION

          Grim, battered and bruised, stands over Hank's bloodied
          body; lying unconscious on a gurney, his face caked in
          blood; wearing the same plaid shirt.  His body is loaded
          into the back of an ambulance.  The doors slam shut to
          reveal Observer Johnny watching... WHOOSH!

                        are going to get hurt.  Some of
                        them are going to die.

          This brings Massey to a stop.

          HIS SNEAKER

          smeared with a black substance; slick motor oil.


          JOHNNY

          leans down curiously, wiping some of the oil onto his
          bare finger... WHOOSH! 


  3030MATCH, MOVE, MORPH...

          Johnny stands, now clad in an orange prison jumpsuit; Maine
          State Penitentiary stenciled across the chest.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT TWO - 6/6/05 - PINK 33.


    30CONTINUED:30

          He gasps for air, sweating profusely; concealed in a
          thicket of tall grass and heavy brush.  Moonlight the
          only illumination.  A beat of silence, then bloodhounds
          BAY in the distance; on his scent.  Johnny reacts, darting
          off into the night...


  3131FLASH! 

          Fugitive Johnny runs through an open field at dawn,
          repeatedly checking back over his shoulder.  He reaches a
          post and rail fence, pausing to catch his breath...


          JOHNNY'S POV 

          just beyond the fence, an old working farm.  A beat up
          truck parked alongside a barn...


  3232FLASH! 


          FARM TRUCK

          the driver's door open.  Johnny works beneath the dash,
          fiddling with the exposed wiring.  A beat.  The engine
          RUMBLES to life.  Johnny sits upright, sporting a
          triumphant smile, until... 

                                        FARMER (O.S.)
                        Don't move!

          Johnny reacts, going for the door handle...


          NEW ANGLE

          a pudgy FARMER levels an antiquated shotgun and fires. 
          BANG! 


          JOHNNY

          gets the door shut as the window explodes and races off. 
          The Farmer chases his truck for a few steps, then trails
          off; exhausted.


  3333INT. FARM TRUCK - VISION - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny drives frantically, pedal pinned.  He slowly looks
          down, grimacing in pain...

          HIS HAND

          comes away from his side, revealing a smear of blood. 
          He's been shot.  FLASH! 


  3434EXT. HIGHWAY - VISION - DAY

          Observer Johnny, still in his prison orange, stands amidst
          a sea of gridlocked cars; present day.  WHOOSH! 


  3535RESUME SCENE ON JOHNNY

          floored by the vision.  He takes off after Massey...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait!

          Again, Massey stops and turns.

                                        MASSEY
                        What now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The traffic jam.  They're looking
                        for an escaped convict.  That's
                        why the road is shut down.  I'm
                        right, aren't I?

          Massey's expression changes.  He considers Johnny, then...

                                        MASSEY
                        His name's Marvin Felps.  He broke
                        out of the State Penitentiary
                        late last night.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How dangerous is he?

                                        MASSEY
                        Extremely.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's here.

                                        MASSEY
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Felps... he's here with us.

          Off Massey's reaction...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:


  3636THE SUN

          burning brightly in a perfect, cloudless sky.  Beating
          down; mercilessly.

                        feel. 


          A DASHBOARD

          the vinyl baking away; discarded crayons melting in the
          heat; oozing off the dash...

          Someone slams the car door shut just as the music starts.


  3737EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce WALK quickly past the parked car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The oil I stepped in must've
                        dripped from whatever car Felps
                        was riding in.

          As they pass random PEOPLE, Bruce eyes them suspiciously.

                                        BRUCE
                        Any idea what he looks like?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  But he's got a gunshot in
                        his side.
                                (pointing)
                        Right here.

                                        BRUCE
                        Then he shouldn't be hard to spot. 
                        What's the cop doing about it?

                        He's checking ID's.  Making sure
                        everyone's who they say they are.

                                        BRUCE
                        This day just keeps getting
                          weirder.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (disturbed)
                        And the body count keeps rising.

                                        BRUCE
                        You think it has something do
                        with me... with what you saw happen
                        to me?

          Johnny considers the question, then...

                                        BRIAN (O.S.)
                        Bruce!  Mister Smith!

          REVEAL Brian, he's frantic and scared.

                                        BRIAN
                          Something's wrong with Nikki!


    3838INT./EXT. RECREATIONAL VEHICLE - CONTINUOUS

            A frantic Brian wipes the matted hair from Nikki's
            perspiration drenched forehead.

                                        BRIAN
                        She just stopped talking.  

                                        BRUCE
                        It's burning hot in here.

                                        BRIAN
                        The engine overheated.  I had to
                        turn it off.

          Bruce places his hand on Nikki's forehead.

                                        BRUCE
                        Nikki, can you hear me?

                          Something's wrong with my baby.

                        The baby's fine.  It's you.  You're
                          dehydrated.
                                (to Brian)
                        You have anything to drink?

                        No good.  The sodium'll only make
                        things worse.  I need some...

          He turns back to Johnny... but he's already gone.

                        Water!  We need water!

          Most people turn away; ignoring his plea.  The lead Biker
          stops Johnny, blocking his path.  Serving up an intense
          glare, punctuated by a nasty scar on his leather cheek.

                                        BIKER #1
                        What's the problem chief?

                        There's a pregnant woman.  She
                        needs fluids.

          The biker's snarl curls into a slight smile.

                                        BIKER #1

          The bikers immediately span out...

          Banging on peoples windows; hitting them up for whatever
          they can spare.          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT THREE - 6/6/05 - PINK 38.

                        No.

          The biker yanks the bottle out of his hand.

          through cars and random motorists.  He rounds an SUV,
          coming face to face with Hank.  A tense beat.

                        I don't want any trouble.

          Johnny and Bruce share a slightly confused look.


  42A42AEXT. HIGHWAY - ESTABLISHING

            A refrigerated cube truck immobilized on the other side
          of the median; Hendersons Home Made Ice Cream stenciled
          on the side.


  4343INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          The DRIVER sits in the cab, perusing an open newspaper. 
          He looks up... alarmed by what he sees.

          Johnny approaches on a direct intercept course; followed
          by a swarm of other motorists led by the Bikers.


  4444EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          The driver climbs down, meeting Johnny and his entourage.

                                        DRIVER
                                (nervous)
                        What do you want?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your freezer still working?

                                        DRIVER
                        Sure.  It's got its own compressor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We need to put a woman in there.

                                        DRIVER
                        Come again?

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's pregnant.  If we don't get
                        her body temp down, her baby might
                        be in danger.

                                        DRIVER
                          Freezer's full.  I can't account
                        for the inventory, it'll mean my
                        job.

          Johnny looks around at the surrounding crowd; haggard
          faces.  He reaches for his wallet, offering the driver
          his credit card...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You take plastic?

          Off the driver's curious reaction.


  4545NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

          Two Bikers stand in the freezer tossing two-gallon drums
          of ice cream out to a huge jubilant crowd...

                                        BIKER #1
                        Cherry vanilla?  How 'bout rum
                        raisin?

          PAN OVER to the rear of the freezer compartment to FIND
          Nikki laying out across some cardboard boxes; a direct
          flow of cool air blowing across her body.  Brian kneels
          at her side, holding her hand.

                                        BRIAN
                        It's gonna' be okay, baby.

          Bruce climbs out of the truck, joining Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Ten minutes in there and her body
                        temp'll come right down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not going to stop the baby
                        from coming.

                                        BRUCE
                        No, but at least they have a
                        chance.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (overwhelmed)
                        What about you... and the rest of
                        these people?  How do I help them?

                                        BRUCE
                        This all started with me, right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        So?

                                        BRUCE
                        So, go back to the beginning.

          Bruce offers his hand.  Johnny hesitates, reluctant.

                                        BRUCE
                        I trust you.

          A beat.  Johnny reaches out, making contact... WHOOSH!


  4646MATCH, MOVE, MORPH...

          Another section of highway.  Observer Johnny stands amidst
          the aftermath of a multiple car pile-up... cars and trucks
          SMASHED and TWISTED.  Smoldering, twisted metal.  Survivors
          mill about in a daze.  Johnny moves through, passing by
          familiar faces...

          A battered Grim tries to free Hank's body from the
          overturned pickup...

          Jake lies on the side of the road; thrown from the open
          Jeep...

          Then Johnny SEES the Murano..

                                        OBSERVER JOHNNY
                        Bruce!

          He runs over to the crumpled car; it's torn open like a
          tin can...


  4747INT. MURANO - CONTINUOUS - VISION

          Bruce sits in the driver seat, gripping the wheel; his
          hazy gaze locked ahead.  Johnny leans in through the open
            passenger side window.

                                        OBSERVER JOHNNY
                        Bruce, hang in there.  You gotta'
                        fight.

          Bruce slowly turns to him... a trickle of blood escapes
          the corner of his mouth.  Two similar streams materialize
          from his nostrils.  His eyes flicker as he eases back in
          the seat, taking a final strained breath as he passes
          away.  Johnny takes it in; horrified.  He TURNS and again
          sees the highway sign that reads, BAYVILLE ROAD EXIT...
          WHOOSH!

          A stream of people move past Johnny, slowly returning to
          their cars.  He reacts with concern, stopping the Biker
          as he passes...

          The Biker moves off.  Bruce reads Johnny's concern.

                        Cops must've caught Felps.

          Bruce hesitates at the suggestion, then relents and runs

  4949EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          Johnny approaches the police cruiser... no sign of Massey. 
          He steps around to the rear of the car.

          Resting his open hand on the rear deck.  WHOOSH!


    49A49AVISION - PASSING THROUGH THE SHEET METAL

          into the trunk compartment, to reveal AN UNCONSCIOUS MAN,
          tied and bound; in his boxers and undershirt.  Dried blood
          on his forehead. FLASH!

                        gather evidence.  Over.

            FOOTSTEPS from behind draw his attention.  He turns...

          Felps, in his prison jumpsuit, strikes him across the
          head with a pipe.  The Real Massey drops.  FLASH!


    49AB49ABFROM INSIDE THE TRUNK - PITCH BLACK

          The lid swings open, flooding the compartment with light. 
          The Real Massey's bound and tied body (in boxers) is
          dropped in with a sickening THUD; obscuring our view.

    49AC49ACDIRT ROAD - MOMENT LATER

          Felps, wearing Massey's unbuttoned police shirt, grimaces
          as he wraps gauze around his gunshot wound.  The Real
          Massey's MOANS and MUFFLED PROTESTS draw him back to the
          open trunk...


          REAL MASSEY'S POV

          Felps leans over him, glaring down; conjuring a sadistic
          grin.

          He cocks back a clenched fist, unleashing a violent attack!*

          His eyes slip closed, then flutter open as he fights the*

          succumbing as his eyes ease shut and he slumps over. *

          A steady stream of people file past Bruce, moving
          purposely.  He bucks the current like a proverbial salmon. 
          Trying futilely to get their attention...

          REVERSE

          Massey is lying across the back seat of the cruiser;
            unconscious.  His gun tightly in hand, folded across his
          chest.  A pool of blood has seeped through the fabric of
          his uniform.


          JOHNNY

          reacts; Massey is Felps.

          He tries the driver's door... unlocked.  He slips in.          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT FOUR - 6/6/05 - PINK 46.


  5252INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny eases into the driver's seat.  He casts a look
          back at Massey, then goes for the car keys.  They're not
          there.  He turns his attention to the radio, fiddling
          with the dials... more STATIC.  Something O.S. draws his
            attention...

                                        JOHNNY

          the radio's wiring harness has been disconnected.

          He reconnects the wiring, then sits back as we see the
          barrel of a pistol press against the nape of his neck.

          glaring at him from behind.

          Johnny behind the wheel.  Massey now riding shotgun, the
          pistol held low; trained on Johnny.

                        The radio was never broken.  You
                          could've called for an ambulance
                        at anytime.

                        Drawing police attention was not
                        in my best interest.

                        The real Massey is tied up in the
                        trunk.

                                        MASSEY
                        You should take your act on the
                        road.

                        Every law enforcement officer in
                        the State is looking for you.

                                        MASSEY
                        True.  But now I have an insurance
                          policy... a genuine clairvoyant. 
                        That's gotta' count for something.

          Massey grimaces in pain, shifting uncomfortably.  Holding
          his wounded midsection.  Johnny takes note...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need a doctor.

          Massey tightens his grip on the gun.

                        drive.  Now!

          Johnny starts the engine as we hear a cacophony of car
          HORNS... 


  5555EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

          Bruce stands beside the Murano.  (The other lanes have
          started to move.)  The drivers trapped behind him lay on
          their horns.

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, Johnny, where the hell
                        are you?

          At that moment, the police cruiser slowly rolls past;
          Johnny behind the wheel.

          EYE CONTACT

          Bruce stares in disbelief as he and Johnny make eye contact
          as the police cruiser rolls past; what the hell is going
          on?  Then something else catches his attention, drawing a
          stunned reaction...


          BRUCE'S POV

          Massey's drawn gun pointed at Johnny.

          He looks around, then jumps in behind the wheel...the
          keys are gone.

                        He took my keys.

          Then he suddenly remembers something and jumps out of the
          car and moves quickly to the front bumper.  He reaches
          his hand up under the bumper and retrieves a spare key
            connected to a small magnet.

                                        BRUCE

          reacts; angered.

          Bruce's window explodes in a hailstorm of projectile glass. 
          One of the slugs catches him in the shoulder.  He swerves
          hard, losing control of the car...

          The Murano bucks wildly, spinning around to a jarring
          halt; across lanes.  Blocking the road.  Horns BLARE and
          tires SQUEAL with urgency, as fast approaching cars swerve
          past.

                        And I can't let this happen.

          He reaches across his body, securing his seatbelt.  Massey
          takes curious note, cocking the gun; jamming it at
            Johnny...

          Johnny slams hard on the brakes.  The car jerks, thrusting
          the unbelted Massey into the dash; jarring the gun from
          his hand.

          Bruce shoots past in the Murano, clearing the cruiser.

                          something for you.

          Johnny hands him a folded sheet of paper.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a list.  My deepest, darkest
                          secrets.  Stuff I'd only want my
                        very best friend to know.  It
                        might make things even between
                        us.

          They STOP at the end of the sidewalk leading to the parking
          lot.  Bruce seems deeply touched by the gesture.

                                        BRUCE
                        John, you don't owe me anything,
                        not after what happened today.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Does that mean you aren't going
                        to read it?

                                        BRUCE
                                (amused)
                        Not read it?  Are you crazy?  I'm
                        gonna memorize it!

          Bruce, having fun, starts off towards the car.  Johnny
          quickly FOLLOWS. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce?

                                        BRUCE
                                (screwing with him)
                        Maybe I'll put it to music!

                                        JOHNNY
                          Alright, give it back.

                                        BRUCE
                        The Ballad of Johnny Smith!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm serious, hand it over.

                                        BRUCE
                        Could go platinum!

                                        JOHNNY
                          Alright, have your fun. 

          As they reach the car, Johnny pulls out the keys.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I have another good idea.

                                        BRUCE
                                (still laughing)
                        Yeah, what's that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't you drive?

          The smile suddenly falls away from Bruce's face.

                                        BRUCE
                                (not so amused)
                        That's not funny.

          Now it's Johnny's turn to rub it in.  Bruce walks around
          to the passenger side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a little funny.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's demented, that's what it is. 
                          Twisted!

          They both get in the car.          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT FOUR - 6/6/05 - PINK 54.

          The car starts and backs out of its parking spot.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Okay, then how about we just go
                        home and pretend this day never
                          happened?

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        That works for me.

          A BEAT, then...

                        You're sure you don't want to
                        drive?

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        Turn on the damn radio!

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Have it your way.

          We HEAR the car radio turned ON, as the car drives away...
