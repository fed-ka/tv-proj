Close on a finger pressing the "record" button of a circa
1970's tape recorder.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
This is Harvey Milk speaking on
Friday November 18th. This is to be
played only in the event of my
death by assassination...
REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a
cluttered San Francisco apartment.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
During one of the early campaigns,
I started opening my speeches with
the same line and it sort of became
my signature...
Harvey at his kitchen table making his recording...
HARVEY MILK
If I was speaking to a slightly
hostile or mostly straight
audience, I'd try to break the
tension with a joke...
Harvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a
CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS.
HARVEY MILK
I know, I know, I'm not what you
were expecting, but I left my high
heels at home.
Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE.
2.
RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder.
HARVEY MILK
I fully realize that a person who
stands for what I stand for - an
activist, a gay activist - becomes
the target or potential target for
a person who is insecure,
terrified, afraid or very disturbed
themselves...
POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City
Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking. Something terrible has
happened. It's chaos.
A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY
BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it.
The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly
load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight.
The very picture of loveliness, MARY-ANN WHITE, 28, finds her
husband DAN WHITE, 31, sitting in the pews praying. He's a
handsome, devout, all-American man in a three-piece suit.
She sits by him. A weight hangs. He can't make eye contact.
DAN WHITE
Something has happened.
3.
She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She
holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to
conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself.
RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder...
HARVEY MILK
Knowing that I could be assassinated
at any moment, I feel it's important
that some people should understand
my thoughts. I think that--
(pauses, not sure what to say)
I wish I had time to explain
everything I did. Almost everything
that was done was done with an eye
on the gay movement.
CUT TO BLACK:
CLEAN WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK SCREEN READ MILK"
TITLE: "New York City. 1970."
HARVEY, 40, is HEADING UP THE STAIRS from the subway
platform. He is wearing a SUIT, but he's less than clean cut.
His hair is brushing past his ears.
HARVEY'S VERY INTERESTED POV: SCOTT SMITH, 22, a sexy curly
haired hippie in tight jeans and boots, is HEADING DOWN THE
THE STAIRS. Harvey tries to make eye contact.
HARVEY MILK
Hey. I'm Harvey.
SCOTT SMITH
(so what?)
Okay, Harvey...
HARVEY MILK
Today's my birthday.
(Scott laughs)
No, today is actually my birthday.
Well, tonight. At midnight.
SCOTT SMITH
Really?
4.
HARVEY MILK
And, believe it or not, I don't
have any plans. People took me out
after work...
SCOTT SMITH
(looking him over)
Work? So, that would be... Let me
guess. Ma Bell or AT&T.;
HARVEY MILK
The Great American Insurance
Company. I'm part of the big,
evil, corporate establishment that,
let me guess, you think is the
cause of every evil thing in the
world from Vietnam to diaper rash.
SCOTT SMITH
You left out bad breath.
Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They
both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor.
A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work fast.
HARVEY MILK
So... You're not going to let me
celebrate my birthday all by myself
are you?
SCOTT SMITH
(gently teasing)
Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute
for a suit... But I don't do guys
over forty.
HARVEY MILK
Well then, I'm in luck.
SCOTT SMITH
How's that?
HARVEY MILK
Because I'm still thirty-nine...
(showing Scott his watch)
And it's only eleven-fifteen.
IN A TIGHT TWO-SHOT, Scott is pressed against a wall with
Harvey pressed against his back having sex. Harvey is the
aggressor, completely uninhibited.
5.
OPERA MUSIC PLAYS on a record player. (Wagner's Tristan and
ISOLDE)
Harvey feeds Scott spoonfuls of CREAM PIE from a TRAY FULL of
FOOD that rests on the bed between them. Ice cream, cookies,
milk, berries... It's over the top and adorable.
HARVEY MILK
Where are you from?
SCOTT SMITH
Jackson, Mississippi.
HARVEY MILK
Well, this isn't Jackson, but you
still can't respond to every
strange man you meet on a subway
platform. It's too dangerous.
SCOTT SMITH
Now you tell me.
HARVEY MILK
There's nothing tougher than a New
York City cop. They're arrogant,
and they're everywhere. I'll show
you the cruising spots, if you
want, if you promise you'll be
careful... little Scottie-san.
SCOTT SMITH
Are you on uppers or what?
HARVEY MILK
No. This is just... plain old me.
SCOTT SMITH
You're afraid of the cops?
HARVEY MILK
I'm just discreet. I know a lot of
people here. If they found out, I
could lose my job.
SCOTT SMITH
(meaning a closet case)
Oh. You're one of "those."
(examines Harvey's eyes)
I think you need a change of
scenery. New friends.
6.
HARVEY MILK
I need a change.
SCOTT SMITH
(looks at the clock)
You're forty now.
HARVEY MILK
(just the truth)
Forty years old and I haven't done
a thing I'm proud of.
SCOTT SMITH
(re: the desert tray)
You keep eating like this and
you'll be a fat ass by fifty.
HARVEY MILK
(laughs it off)
No. Don't you worry. I won't make
it to fifty.
Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding,
he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face.
Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his
young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting
everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
(an idea, half-jokingly,
HALF-SERIOUSLY)
Why don't we run away together?
SCOTT SMITH
Where to?
RETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. (Throughout
the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is
telling us things no one else knows.)
HARVEY MILK
In those days, San Francisco was
the place where everyone wanted to
go... To drop out... To fall in
love...
8MM HOME MOVIE MONTAGE of Harvey and Scott DRESSED FULL-OUT
LIKE HIPPIES, long hair, beard, beads, sunglasses, driving
7.
through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into
San Francisco.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
But by 1972, The Haight was boarded
up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The
new place for us refugees was this
run down Irish Catholic
neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six
blocks square... The Castro.
The place is FILLED with OPERA MUSIC from a record player.
Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera.
Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through
the large, empty windows.
SCOTT SMITH
I cashed my last unemployment check
yesterday...
HARVEY MILK
Well, I hope you did something
useful with it.
SCOTT SMITH
I bought an ounce of pot. I was
just wondering if you had any
(MORE)
8.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
plans, or thoughts... About us
doing something to, you know, bring
in an income.
HARVEY MILK
Don't move.
Harvey straddles Scott. He begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him.
SCOTT SMITH
I suppose I can wait tables.
HARVEY
No way. I want you right here with
me... Did you see place downstairs
is for rent?
SCOTT SMITH
Yeah.
HARVEY MILK
I was thinking we could open a shop
together.
SCOTT SMITH
What kind of shop?
HARVEY MILK
One with very little overhead. Not
too much work... A little one, just
like Morris and Minnie Milk of
Woodmere, New York...
Scott is sitting on the bed, while Harvey is TALKING A MILE A
MINUTE FROM THE KITCHEN, totally energized.
10.
HARVEY MILK
We'll form our own business
association! Start with the gay-
owned businesses... We'll take down
the addresses of every customer that
comes in for a roll of film. We'll
ask them what they want to see done
here... what they want changed...
We'll get money rolling into this
neighborhood. Revitalize it...
SCOTT SMITH
Can I come in now?
HARVEY MILK (O.S.)
One more minute!
(back to his new scheme)
I'll go to the neighborhood banks.
They must have some gay customers.
SCOTT SMITH
Harvey. What's with all this
political activist crap? I thought
you were a goddamn Republican.
Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of
food. He sets them out on a small dining room table, still
rambling on to Scott in the bedroom.
HARVEY MILK
I'm a businessman, Scott. I think
businesses ought to treat their
customers right. Even their gay
customers. For God's sake, this is
San Francisco!
SCOTT SMITH
Harvey. It's just like every other
city in this country. People hate
us. Big surprise.
HARVEY MILK
We should have at least one block
in one city right? Start there and
take over the neighborhood.
(a smile)
Okay, you can come in now!
Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a
home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.
SCOTT SMITH
Wow. This is--
11.
Harvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face. Payback.
HARVEY MILK
Happy birthday!
Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear
some of the CREAM PIE onto him.
HARVEY MILK
And people started hanging around
our store. Not customers.
Activists, kids, folks who needed a
home away from home...
A NEW sign goes in the window: "We are VERY open."
A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings
of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a
clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the
arts, and checking out the cute ones.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute
art student who I'd picked up at
Toad Hall. Turns out he was also
good at running the Camera Shop...
something Scott and I found we had
surprising little interest in...
ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.
DANNY NICCOLETTA
Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about
street theater, now.
HARVEY MILK
What you're not getting is the
spectacle of it, the bigger than
life emotions...
Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of
an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.
13.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great
wit. A Harvard graduate, which
nobody cared about, in those days,
in the Castro... including himself.
JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that
sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for
something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young
man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And somewhere along the line Jim
picked up a protege, a cute
political kid from Wisconsin... Dick
Pabich... And of course there was
Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular
business with the new kids...
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And on occasion we actually had a
real customer. But only occasionally.
ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of
place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s.
SCOTT SMITH
Harvey... This guy wants to talk to
you.
HARVEY MILK
(approaches Allan)
Welcome. What can we do for you?
ALLAN BAIRD
Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters
representative, and Director of the
Coors beer boycott in California.
HARVEY MILK
Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's
a very big deal, so behave
yourselves.
ALLAN BAIRD
I was told you were like the Mayor
of the Castro, said you organized
the CVA, you might know some people
in the bars.
14.
HARVEY MILK
I do have friends in awfully low
places, but just so you know, it's
not official yet.
ALLAN BAIRD
What's that?
HARVEY MILK
The Mayor part. I've considered
gathering an army of queers to
march up to City Hall and secede,
but so far the young gays seem more
interested in jeeps and jeans. But
if I could be of any use, I'm all
ears!
ALLAN BAIRD
We can't get Coors to go union.
These guys are like me, they can't
be out of work too long.
Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his
nerves. It's Harvey at his best.
HARVEY MILK
I'm just curious. Are we your first
stop or your last?
ALLAN BAIRD
(clearly his last)
It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.
HARVEY MILK
Well, you seem to have noticed that
my kind of people drink a lot of
beer. If we're going to fast for
your sake, I think we should get to
deliver some of it when you win
this fight, don't you?
ALLAN BAIRD
(INCREDULOUS)
Is that what you really want?
HARVEY MILK
And allies. I'll have Coors out of
every bar in the Castro by the end
of the week. Deal?
ALLAN BAIRD
(nods, sincere)
Thank you Mr. Milk.
15.
JUMP TO: Allan is on his way out. Harvey walks back behind
the counter to Scott.
HARVEY MILK
No more Coors beer. It's gotta come
out of every bar. Gay and straight.
SCOTT SMITH
What's he giving you?
HARVEY MILK
Nothing for me. That's a convert.
SCOTT SMITH
A convert to what?
HARVEY MILK
The cause.
A STILL PHOTO MONTAGE: Jim, Dick, Scott and Danny get bar
owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps,
throw out their Coors stock, put on "Boycott Coors" buttons
and tape up "Dump Coors" posters.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
I got "my people" to get Coors out
of all the Gay Bars. 30 million
bottles worth in San Francisco
alone. Coors beer immediately fell
from number 1. They caved. One week
later, union man Allan Baird hired
the first ever openly gay union
boys to drive Teamsters trucks...
We weren't just a group of pansies
anymore. We had a neighborhood. We
had the unions. And for the first
time, we had a little bit of power.
HARVEY MILK
Maybe that was the day someone
first called me the "Mayor" of
Castro Street.
(a knowing grin)
Or perhaps I invented it myself.
Harvey, Jim & Dick, Scott, Danny and Dennis debate the merits
of working within "the system" versus dropping out. Everyone
is talking over each other...
16.
A YOUNG GAY MAN runs into the store.
YOUNG GAY MAN
The fucking cops, man, they're up on
Castro Street! Toad Hall.
Harvey and the guys race out of the store.
Scott sits on the toilet. Harvey rinses blood from a white
washcloth and goes back to cleaning Scott's HEAD WOUND.
HARVEY MILK
...if we had someone in the
government who saw things the way
we see them, the way the black
community has black leaders who
look out for their interests--
SCOTT SMITH
You're gonna run for Supervisor, is
that the idea?
HARVEY MILK
(HALF-JOKING)
I could go right for mayor, but I
think I should work my way up to
it... You'll be my campaign
manager.
17.
SCOTT SMITH
(SARCASTIC)
Because I have so much experience
in politics.
HARVEY MILK
Politics is theater. It doesn't
matter if you win. You make a
statement. You say, "I'm here, pay
attention to me."
SCOTT SMITH
Harvey, you do that every time you
cross the street.
HARVEY MILK
Coors looks like it might cave. The
union boys will owe me. Imagine if
we get their vote... It'll be fun!
SCOTT SMITH
Fun?
Harvey starts kissing him all over.
HARVEY MILK
We'll make it a spectacle.
HARVEY MILK
--look up to, no hope for a better
life. Those that did were
outcast... arrested.. suicide. And
the young ones, who did escape
home... and who arrive in San
Francisco, and then what...
CLOSE ON: A CUSTOMER'S SET OF PHOTOS BEING PASSED FROM HAND
TO HAND DURING THE FOLLOWING POLITICAL MEETING. (We catch a
glimpse of the PHOTOS and see naked skin).
JIM RIVALDO
Well, it looks like the big guns
and the rich gays in San Francisco
are going to back Dianne Feinstein
and other straight candidates they
consider "gay-friendly."
SCOTT SMITH
Who cares about those old queens?
Scott is laying down on THE BIG RED COUCH.
HARVEY MILK
Why isn't my campaign manager
leading the meeting?
SCOTT SMITH
I'm beat, Harvey. I passed out
flyers for seven hours straight.
HARVEY MILK
In the bathhouse?
SCOTT SMITH
(giving it right back)
People in bathhouses vote. I'm
tired. I'm taking a nap.
Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment.
A CUSTOMER comes in. Danny quickly gathers the REVEALING
PHOTOS and puts them back in the envelope.
22.
HARVEY MILK
Just checking the exposure. That a
new boyfriend? He's very cute.
CUSTOMER
(taking the photos, embarrassed)
Um... Thanks, Harvey.
HARVEY MILK
(to Jim)
So who are these so-called "gay
leaders?" And who appointed them?
And what are you suggesting, Jim,
that I'm supposed to go and solicit
their endorsement?
PAST HARVEY WE SEE A GRANDMOTHERLY VOLUNTEER, THELMA, opening
the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and
approaching Harvey.
THELMA
HARVEY--
HARVEY MILK
We're down here, on the streets,
trying to help people, so where
they hell are they?
DICK PABICH
David Goodstein is the publisher of
The Advocate and he has a house--
JIM RIVALDO
A mansion--
DICK PABICH
--in Atherton.
THELMA
(clearly shaken)
Harvey, you should read this.
CLOSE ON THE LETTER as it goes from Thelma to Harvey.
Scott reads the LETTER. Harvey sits VERY STILL.
SCOTT SMITH
"Harvey Milk will have a dream
journey and nightmare to hell, a
night of horror. You will be
stabbed and have your genitals,
cock, balls, prick cut off."
(MORE)
23.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
I'm calling the police.
HARVEY MILK
They probably wrote it.
(off Scott's anxiety)
Hey, If somebody tries to kill me,
I'll get the sympathy vote, right?
Could be just the push we need.
SCOTT SMITH
You think this is funny?
Look at it.
Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott.
HARVEY MILK
It's a complete joke. No rhythm. No
humor. It's insulting.
CLOSE ON THE LETTER: Someone has drawn a STICK FIGURE of
Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc. Harvey
makes a DECISION: He sticks the DRAWING to the refrigerator,
the first thing he'll see in the morning.
SCOTT SMITH
Don't do that.
HARVEY MILK
If you put it away, hide it in a
drawer, it'll just get bigger and
scarier. Now it's there. We'll
see it every day. It can't get us.
SCOTT SMITH
All this energy... to make yourself
a target. And what for? Something
we have no chance to win.
Harvey wraps his arms around him.
HARVEY MILK
I keep telling you, it's not just
about winning.
HARVEY MILK
So... I went for it again in '75...
with just a few... minor...
adjustments.
CLOSE ON: Harvey looking through a hole in the bottom of a
pair of well worn wing-tips. He tries them on anyhow.
JUMP TO: Harvey steps out of a dressing room in a brown suit.
His hair is cut short, his face is shaven clean. It's quite a
transformation. Scott and the old owner, LILY, size him up.
SCOTT SMITH
No. Not cute. The shoes are hideous
and I hate your hair. You're not
fooling anybody.
HARVEY MILK
I'm not gonna let the Pacific
Heights biddies write me off again
because of a ponytail. I like it.
Scott is horrified. Harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs
from its inner pocket.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Cabaret? For two? Lily, is this
from one of my kind?
LILY
No, no. You won't run into the
owner. He died in that suit.
SCOTT SMITH
This isn't sexy, Harvey.
Harvey grabs Scott, kisses him. Then playful:
HARVEY MILK
Too bad. No more pot, no more bath
houses for me and little poo.
MONTAGE: More ACTIVITY inside and outside the shop. More
VOLUNTEERS. The printing press burns through flyers.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
We ran and we lost the Supervisors
race a second time in '75, but with
(MORE)
28.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
more votes than ever. So in 1976,
against everyone's advice, I really
pissed off the Democratic political
power houses, because I ran against
"their boy"--
A SIGN GOES IN THE SHOP WINDOW "HARVEY MILK VS. THE MACHINE."
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
--Art Agnos, a part of their
"Political Machine." And this time
we weren't running for City
Supervisor. This time it was
bigger, California State Assembly.
It's a firestorm of words as Harvey debates Art Agnos.
HARVEY MILK
It's a racket. It's 1976 and you
still have to be straight, white,
Catholic and male to get into the
San Francisco police force. It's
Racist. Homophobic.
ART AGNOS
How many people do you consider
enemies, Harvey? I've counted five
already.
Art smiles. Chuckles flutter through the audience.
HARVEY MILK
You're right, Art. And many are
your closest friends. You see, I
don't think State Assembly seats
should be awarded on the basis of
service to the Democrat Machine.
Machines operate on oil and grease.
They're dirty, dehumanizing, and
too often unresponsive to any needs
but those of the operator.
ART AGNOS
Mr. Milk, I've worked for years as
a social worker in this city. I
know Sacramento. I know how to get
done what we all need done there.
HARVEY MILK
Tell me Mr. Agnos... right here in
the Castro, Robert Hillsbourough
was murdered for walking home with
his long time partner. Stabbed,
(MORE)
29.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
fifteen times. The last words he
heard were "Faggot, Faggot,
Faggot..." And you say you're
outraged, but why won't your
liberal establishment return our
calls? Why won't they bring these
murderers to justice?
Scott tries to make a simple meal of pasta, struggling to
operate in the kitchen that is filled with Harvey's POLITICAL
ENTOURAGE and VOLUNTEERS.
He finds Harvey, Jim, and Dick having an impromptu strategy
meeting in the adjoining bedroom.
SCOTT SMITH
Harvey. Dinner.
HARVEY
... get some union boys in the
audience, they love me...
JIM RIVALDO
I can't control who's in the
audience...
SCOTT SMITH
Harvey, you need to eat something.
Now.
30.
Scott steps back into the kitchen.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
Ladies and Gentlemen. Our apartment
is officially off limits.
CHASES the VOLUNTEERS out of the kitchen, out of his
bedroom... down the stairs...
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
Downstairs. Time to go. Go. OUT!
Harvey emerges, about to intervene.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
Don't say anything.
For once, Harvey keeps his mouth shut. Jim and Dick sneak
past Scott, sheepishly. When Scott and Harvey are alone...
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
Sit down and eat.
Harvey and Scott eat dinner in tense silence.
HARVEY
SCOTTIE--
SCOTT
If you say one thing about politics
or your campaign or where you're
speaking tonight or whose
endorsement you need... I'll stab
you with my fork I swear to God.
HARVEY
I just wanted to say... This is
the most delicious meal I've ever
eaten in my entire life.
Harvey gives a warm smile. Scott gives a laugh, but he looks
like he's about to lose it.
HARVEY MILK
If we lose this one, it'll be just
me and you again. I promise.
Scott nods. That's exactly what he needed to hear.
Harvey pours two cups of coffee, and delivers one to Cleve
who is pulled away on the big red couch.
CLEVE JONES
You staying up with me?
HARVEY MILK
The election's tomorrow. I won't
sleep... Was he good looking?
CLEVE JONES
No. He was hideous.
HARVEY MILK
Hard to tell what's worse. With me,
my boyfriends usually find better
looking ones to cheat with.
CLEVE JONES
I thought we were gonna spend the
rest of our lives together.
HARVEY MILK
Guess what, Cleve Jones.
CLEVE JONES
What?
HARVEY MILK
You're going to meet the most
extraordinary men, the sexiest,
brightest, funniest men, and you're
going to fall in love with so many
of them, and you won't know until
(MORE)
32.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
the end of your life who your
greatest friends were or your
greatest love was.
CLEVE JONES
Is that supposed to help?
HARVEY MILK
Maybe a little. Or not.
CLEVE JONES
I went to Spain last month... long
story. In Barcelona, there was this
memorial march for gay people who
died under Franco. The police tried
to break it up. It started a riot.
A bullet ripped through a drag
queens scalp, his wig flew off, but
he kept fighting. There was blood
literally running in the gutter.
HARVEY MILK
We could have a revolution here
too. But you can't just use the
Castro to cruise. You gotta fight.
CLEVE JONES
You think you'll win?
HARVEY MILK
Winning isn't my strong suit.
CLEVE JONES
(BRAVADO)
Well, I don't "do" losing. Ever.
Maybe I should run for office, and
you can work for me.
(off Harvey's laugh)
If you can do it, I can do it.
HARVEY MILK
Can you assemble a thousand people
in an hour?
CLEVE JONES
Yeah, sure.
HARVEY MILK
All right, if I run again, you're
my man.
CLEVE JONES
If...?
33.
HARVEY MILK
Polls open in 3 hours. Lets hit the
bus stops.
CLOSE ON THE TV SET PLAYING A 1970's ORANGE JUICE COMMERCIAL
featuring runner up to Miss America, ANITA BRYANT.
ANITA BRYANT (SINGING ON TV)
"Come to the Florida sunshine tree,
great tasting orange juice
naturally, orange juice with lots
of vitamin c, from the Florida
sunshine tree."
Harvey is alone in the shop, surrounded by remnants of a
celebration party that never happened.
Jim Rivaldo lets himself into the store. Jim has his maps
rolled up under his arm.
JIM RIVALDO
(trying to cheer up Harvey)
We lost, but we lost by less! More
votes than ever...
(Harvey fake grins)
I remember when that used to work.
I want to show you something. This
is remarkable.
Jim starts laying out his trusty MAPS, color coded with
precinct results from that night.
JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D)
The red is where you did best
tonight. If we can get the
initiative on district elections to
pass, and we can -- we can -- our
new Supervisor's District will go
right up Market. Right around the
Castro.
34.
The district Jim outlines is ALL BRIGHT RED.
JIM RIVALDO (CONT'D)
If you run for Supervisor with this
new district, it's a potential
landslide. You'll be the first up-
front gay man elected to major
office in the U.S.
HARVEY MILK
I don't know if I have another one
in me. Or Scott.
But Harvey's gaze deceives his words. HOLD ON HARVEY -
contemplating a FOURTH run for office.
The GROUP gathers around the TV WHICH SHOWS NATIONWIDE NEWS

ON THE TV: A REPORT ABOUT ANITA BRYANT'S VICTORY IN FLORIDA.
TV REPORTER
Gays in Florida can now be removed
from their jobs and prosecuted if
their "deviant" lifestyles are
uncovered.
HARVEY'S POV OUT A WINDOW: FURIOUS GAYS pour out of the bars
BLOWING WHISTLES, raising TRASH CANS... It might turn into a
RIOT.

Gays can't reproduce, so they must

Harvey's PHONE RINGS. He snatches it up.
HARVEY MILK
Scottie?
BOY'S VOICE
I'm sorry sir. I um... I read about
you in the paper.
HARVEY MILK
I'm sorry. I can't talk right--
BOY'S VOICE
Sir, I think I want to kill myself.
HARVEY MILK
No. You don't want to do that.
(BEAT)
Where do you live?
BOY'S VOICE
In Minnesota.
HARVEY MILK
You saw me in a paper in Minnesota?
How'd I look?
BOY'S VOICE
My folks are taking me to this place
tomorrow. A hospital. To fix me.
HARVEY MILK
There's nothing wrong with you.
Listen to me. You don't have to
hurt yourself, okay? Are you there?
(only breathing from the
other end)
Here's what you have to do. Are you
listening?
BOY'S VOICE
Yes.
HARVEY MILK
Get on a bus. Go to the next
biggest city. New York, San
Francisco, LA, or even Minneapolis.
It doesn't matter. Just leave.
(off the boy's tears)
You won't be alone. There are
people out here just like you who
will welcome you and love you.
(MORE)
36.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
You're not sick. You're not wrong.
God does not hate you. Just leave.
BOY'S VOICE
I can't.
HARVEY MILK
Yes. You can. Just get on a bus.
BOY'S VOICE
I can't... I can't walk, sir. I'm
in a wheelchair... Sir. Are you
there?
Harvey FORCES HIMSELF TO SOUND CALM...
HARVEY MILK
That's okay. It's going to be okay.
Over the phone, Harvey hears the SOUND OF AN ADULT VOICE,
someone finding the BOY on the phone, then...
The LINE goes DEAD. It's all too much for Harvey. There's
nothing a speech or a pep talk can do to fix this. Harvey is
overwhelmed. Dick comes upstairs.
DICK PABICH
Harvey, you better come down.
There's gonna be a riot.
Moving in a daze, stunned by the call, Harvey digs out A
BULLHORN and heads out.
From inside, SCOTT WATCHES HIS LOVER JUMPING BACK IN THE
FREY. A weight hangs. He doesn't follow...
Cleve RUSHES into the bar (ON FIRE WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY) and
BLOWS A POLICE WHISTLE to get everyone's attention.
CLEVE JONES
Out of the bar and into the
streets! Anita Bryant is coming
after you!
Harvey speaks to the "PARENT-TEACHERS UNITED FOR BETTER
SCHOOLS" group.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
--Hope for a better world... Hope
for a better tomorrow... Hope for a

better place to come to if the
pressures at home are too great...
Harvey speaks to a hall filled with TEAMSTERS.
HARVEY MILK
Hope for the worker who awakens
from the American dream to find
that all the jobs have left the
country... We gotta give em' HOPE!
PAN FACES OF TEAMSTERS - Several MINORITY FACES. CLOSE ON

HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(pre-lap, an intimate tone)
When San Francisco changed the
voting rules--
Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder...
HARVEY MILK
--they allowed people to elect
Supervisors directly from their own
neighborhoods. A black
neighborhood could elect an African-
American. Chinatown could elect a
Chinese Supervisor... And the
Castro could choose me or Rick
Stokes. But decent art begs for
balance, right? So little district
8, two miles south of The Castro--
DAN WHITE holds a small press conference. His words are
fiery, but his delivery and stage presence are lacking.
40.
DAN WHITE
I'm not going to be forced out of
San Francisco by splinter groups of
social radicals, social deviants,
and incorrigibles. You must realize
there are thousands upon thousands
of frustrated, angry people such as
yourselves waiting to unleash a
fury that will eradicate the
malignancies which blight our
beautiful city.
Harvey's suit is laid out. A record turns. Wagner blasts from
the windows. Scott is folding his clothes into a box.
HARVEY MILK
Evelyn Lear's in town, at the Opera
house in Tannhauser.
SCOTT SMITH
Clearly.
HARVEY MILK
What if she strolls into the Castro
for a cocktail?
(Scott keeps packing)
Just one more. We can't let Rick
Stokes take it.
SCOTT SMITH
Let Rick have it. Nobody thinks
you're a fraud here, Harvey. You're
not in New York, you're not a
closet case asshole anymore. People
respect you here. Relax for a year.
Get us back on our feet.
HARVEY MILK
If people are ever going to take me
seriously, I have to win this one.
SCOTT SMITH
Since when did you care if anyone
took you seriously?
HARVEY MILK
Anita wants to put us all back in
concentration camps. Rick Stokes is
too weak to beat her back if she
gets to California. I have to be in
office to protect us from them.
41.
SCOTT SMITH
I can't do another one.
(Harvey says nothing)
I'll be back for my sheets. If
you're not here, I'll see you in
the shop next week.
Scott picks up his box of clothes and starts out of the
apartment. Harvey, not meaning a word:
HARVEY MILK
If you leave me right now... I can
find someone new.
SCOTT SMITH
I know. You're a catch.
Scott leaves. Harvey is in shock, unable to comprehend the
loss. Unable/unwilling to reverse the choice he's made.
The ENTOURAGE is completely caught up in the new campaign
(Cleve, Jim, Dick, and newcomer MICHAEL WONG, 23, asexual and
devoutly political). Harvey is RANTING, ripping down an
Assembly campaign poster.
HARVEY MILK
--Ring out the old, ring in the
new. This is over. Done. I don't
want to see anything that say's
fucking Assembly. This three-time
loser faggot is running for
Supervisor goddamn it!
ANNE KRONENBERG, 23, parks her motorcycle outside, WALKS INTO
THE CAMERA SHOP, and plants herself behind HARVEY'S DESK.
Cleve, Mike, Jim and Dick are STARING at Anne.
JIM RIVALDO
Who the heck is she?
HARVEY MILK
(suddenly cool)
Our new campaign manager. She
called last week to volunteer and I
asked her to help.
DICK PABICH
Help or take over? What about Scott?
HARVEY MILK
We need new blood.
(introducing them)
(MORE)
42.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Guys... Anne Kronenberg.
(Off their puzzled looks)
She's a woman... A woman who likes
women. Odd, isn't it?
ANNE KRONENBERG
Hi guys. Mr. Milk... Rick Stokes
isn't pulling out. He's officially
filed to run against you. My friend
at The Advocate says David
Goodstein is backing him.
MICHAEL WONG
A gay candidate against a gay
candidate. It's unfortunate.
JIM RIVALDO
They'll split the gay vote. The
straights will divide and conquer.
HARVEY MILK
Try to find out when they're going
to announce.
DICK PABICH
You replaced Scott with a lesbian?
HARVEY MILK
Anne worked on a recycling campaign
up North. She's very organized.
JIM RIVALDO
How do you know she's not a plant
from Rick Stokes' campaign?
ANNE KRONENBERG
Are you guys always this paranoid?
MICHAEL WONG
Yes. They take after Harvey.
HARVEY MILK
Shouldn't you be doing someone's
laundry?
MICHAEL WONG
Right after you redecorate my house.
ANNE KRONENBERG
(pointed at Jim Rivaldo)
Sir, my girlfriends say you guys
don't like women. Just asking, is
there a place for us in all this,
or are you scared of girls?
43.
HARVEY MILK
Gentleman, we already have a tinker
bell, a lotus-blossom, Jim and Dick
in your three-piece suits. We need
someone to manage things. A woman
this time. She's the right price, and
she has bigger balls than any of you.
ANNE KRONENBERG
Just give me whatever's left over in
the register at the end of the day.
So should I call the Chronicle about
getting US an endorsement? No?
OFF the group of misfits, considering the addition.
PAN OFF: a large "RICK STOKES, SUPERVISOR DISTRICT 5" poster
to reveal Anne Kronenberg outside the hall handing "MILK"
signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are
filing in.
Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the
lecture hall and confronts Anne.
RICK STOKES
Young lady, you must be confused.
This is my night, not Mr. Milk's.
ANNE KRONENBERG
(as pleasant as can be)
No, sir. I'm Harvey's new campaign
manager. Anne Kronenberg.
RICK STOKES
Then you should know this race is
for District 5, the Castro, not for
all of your lesbian... compadres--
A tough lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads
in. Rick looks uncomfortable around all these women.
ANNE KRONENBERG
I'm sorry. Are we distracting you,
Mr. Stokes? I'd hate to screw you
up on your big night.
Dick runs up looking for more fliers. Taking Rick even more
off his game, Dick is flirtatious.
DICK PABICH
Hi Rick, handsome suit. Annie, do
you have any more hand cards?
44.
RICK STOKES
These people are not from this
area. They need to leave. Now.
DICK PABICH
Not true. Guess where we found them
all, Rick? A slew of them. Way up
on Valencia Street. Living right
there in our district. And you see,
as it turns out, Annie here is
very, very popular with the ladies.
Dick puts his arm around Anne. Rick is stupefied.
Harvey is still looking at the flier. Anne is leaving with a
stack of SF Chronicles. Cleve comes in, pulls one off her
stack, and looks for "the article."
HARVEY MILK
They've accused me of many things,
but never as blatant a lie as this.
ANNE KRONENBERG
First ever newspaper endorsement.
CLEVE JONES
(reading the article)
They endorsed you for being a good
businessman? Has Scott read this?
He'll piss himself.
HARVEY MILK
Yeah? Go show him.
(Cleve starts to go)
(MORE)
45.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Cleve, maybe you should go find a
boy to celebrate with. Just in
case.
CLEVE JONES
I'm going to The Stud. Meet me out.
Cleve goes. His energy is boundless. Harvey sits alone
watching the bargoers return home through his front window. A
bitter-sweetness lingers. A couple waves, one shouts out:
GAY MAN
Gonna win this time, Milk?
They walk on, not waiting for an answer.
Then, a drunk, cute, Latino, JACK LIRA, 25, stops. He stares
in at the political ads in the window. Harvey watches him
sway drunk out of his mind, waiting for him to fall. The two
make eye contact. Harvey smiles. Jack tries to. Harvey picks
up a folding chair and walks it out to him.
JACK LIRA
(re: poster in the window)
You're more handsome in the
posters.
HARVEY MILK
Thank you. Where do you live?
JACK LIRA
(too drunk to hear, flirting)
...Palomino's are my favorite
horse. They're smart. They're
fast and compact. Do you think I'm
more like a Palomino or a Stallion?
Jack smiles, out of his mind. Then he sits/falls down into
the chair, and slides off. Harvey stands above the passed out
young man. A newcomer. A wounded bird. Perfect.
Completely nude, Jack plays a tantalizing game of seduction,
allowing Harvey to hold him, then wriggling away... Dancing
against Harvey then BITING his shoulder... LYING on the bed,
then ROLLING away when Harvey tries to hold him...
No TALK. No POLITICS. Just SEX. A perfect RELEASE for
Harvey.
Harvey holds Jack after lovemaking.
46.
JACK LIRA
My father beat me when he found
out... So I came here. I stay in this
man's house. But I don't like him.
HARVEY
Shh, it's okay, now. No one's ever
going to beat you again.
A long, comforting beat between them.
JACK LIRA
I love you.
HARVEY
(smiles, playful)
Do you even remember my name?
(a beat, Jack shakes his
head, he can't remember)
Harvey.
JACK LIRA
I love you, Harvey.
HARVEY stands in a voting booth. He goes down the list of
names. He finally punches the one next to "HARVEY MILK"
District 5, and pulls the lever. The chads fall.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
And for the first time in my life,
it all came together... the union
boys, the women, the seniors, the
minorities... All of the us's
showed up...
The Shop is packed. It's a giant celebration party. Anne and
Cleve are working the door. SCOTT SMITH WATCHES FROM THE
CROWD OUTSIDE THE SHOP as Rick Stokes and David Goodstein try
to get in.
RICK STOKES
We just want to congratulate him.
47.
CLEVE JONES
I'm sorry. We're all full.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
(seeing Harvey inside)
Harvey! Harvey!
HARVEY MILK
It's too crowded. Sorry!
JACK LIRA shoves his way toward the door...
JACK LIRA
Harvey!
Harvey PULLS JACK INSIDE, right past Goodstein and Stokes.
Harvey CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF SCOTT OUTSIDE...
HARVEY MILK
Scottie--?
But Scott fades into the CROWD. Harvey (with Jack at his
side) is pulled back into the party.
CLEVE JONES
(eyeing Jack skeptically)
The new Mrs. Milk. I give it a
week.
JACK LIRA
(the crowd)
Harvey, is this all for you? Are
you this famous?
HARVEY MILK
No, darling. We do this all the
time. Do you like it?
Jim is calling out NAMES of the OTHER WINNERS.
JIM RIVALDO
Carol Ruth Silver... Gordon Lau...
It's the most liberal Board in
years!
HARVEY MILK
What about Dan White? Did he win?
JIM RIVALDO
(YES)
We'll deal with him tomorrow.
Harvey is DOUSED with champagne.
48.
JUMP TO: Harvey is interviewed by a TV REPORTER. Jack
squeezes his way under Harvey's arm and into the picture.
CHANNEL 5 REPORTER
Does this mean, as many straights
are concerned, maybe the gays are
taking over San Francisco? Are you
going to be a Supervisor for all
the people?
HARVEY MILK
I have to be. That's what I was
elected for. I have to be there to
open up the dialogue for the
sensitivities of all people, all
their problems, the problems that
effect this city effect all of us.
(toasts the camera)
Thank you San Francisco! Thank you!
Off a TV in Scott's NEW APARTMENT, we see a S.F. Morning show
featuring new Supervisors, Harvey Milk and Dan White.
HOST (ON TV)
This will be the first time in many
years that we've seen so many new
faces on the Board of Supervisors.
Do you think such diversity will
cripple the Board?
HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
The name of the game on the Board
is six votes to get anything
passed. So, like it or not, Dan
and I are now in bed together...
politically speaking.
THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program. He's been up
all night.
DAN WHITE (ON TV)
I've assured Harvey here that my
brochure's comments about "social
deviants" referred more to junkies
than to his people. See, I'm about
to have my first child. I have to
make sure this city remains a
decent place to raise him.
The segment over, sound assistants help Harvey and Dan remove
their microphones. Harvey tries to draw Dan in:
HARVEY MILK
How long were you a fireman, Dan?
DAN WHITE
A couple of years.
HARVEY MILK
And before that... You were a
police officer?
Dan studies Harvey suspiciously... What's his point?
DAN WHITE
You have something against cops?
HARVEY MILK
No. They tend to have something
against me.
(MORE)
50.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
(seeing Dan react uncomfortably)
But firefighters. Now those are true
heroes... They supported me in the
last campaign. I support them fully.
DAN WHITE
I appreciate it.
HARVEY MILK
I meant what I said. I'd like to
work together.
Dan hesitantly accepts Harvey's handshake. It's a step.
DAN WHITE
(cracking a smile)
I'll see you at the office, Mr.
Milk.
Harvey goes through the metal detectors at the entrance and
finds Cleve in a NEW SUIT waiting for the elevator.
HARVEY MILK
What do you think of my new
theater?
CLEVE JONES
A bit over the top.
HARVEY MILK
What's with the suit?
CLEVE JONES
I got it from a friend.
Harvey leads Cleve from the elevator to the grand staircase.
HARVEY MILK
When you come here, I want you to
wear the tightest jeans possible.
Never blend in. And no elevators.
Ever. Always take the stairs, you
can make such a grand entrance
going up the stairs.
Harvey leads Cleve down the hall of Supervisors' offices,
passing Dianne Feinstein's open door.
HARVEY MILK
And street talk only around
Feinstein. Shit, goddamn, fuck,
(MORE)
51.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
all that. It bugs the hell out of
her.
They arrive at his Lead Aide's desk: it's Anne Kronenberg.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Morning Annie, let's set Cleve up
on mail.
ANNE KRONENBERG
Will do.
HARVEY MILK
Come into my office...
Harvey walks in. Michael and Jim are in a strategy session.
HARVEY MILK
The first order of business that
will come out of this office is a
city wide Gay Rights Ordinance.
Just like the one Anita shot down
in Dade County. What do you think,
Lotus Blossom?
MICHAEL WONG
I think it's good. Not great.
HARVEY MILK
Then make it brilliant. I want
Anita's attention here. In San
Francisco. I want her to bring her
fight to US... This Bill needs a
unanimous vote. We need headlines.
JIM RIVALDO
Dan White won't vote for this.
Harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall,
indicating Dan is down there. Harvey whispers:
HARVEY MILK
Dan's fine. He's just uneducated.
We can teach him.
Dan pops his head into Harvey's office.
DAN WHITE
Harvey, committee meets at 9:30.
Oh, hi Michael, Jim.
(to Harvey)
Hey, did you get the invitation to
(MORE)
52.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
my son's christening? I invited a
few of the other supes as well.
HARVEY MILK
I'll be there.
DAN WHITE
Great!
All smiles, Dan leaves. Cleve mocks him. OFF Mike Wong's
expression: THAT WAS BIZARRE.
ANNE KRONENBERG
Are you going?
HARVEY MILK
Hey. I'll let him christen me, if
he'll vote for my Gay Rights
Ordinance. We need allies. We need
everyone.
Harvey RUSHES UP THE STAIRS into his apartment and finds:
JACK LIRA - Lighting a candle on the table which has been set
for a lovely, romantic dinner.
HARVEY
Jack?
JACK LIRA
Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're
hungry. I only know how to cook one
thing, but I make it good.
HARVEY
Did you... break in?
JACK LIRA
I asked the boy downstairs to let
me in...
HARVEY
Danny?
53.
JACK LIRA
He wouldn't let me in. So I came in
this way. Your friends aren't very
nice to me.
HARVEY
(avoiding the fight)
I have a Town Hall meeting tonight,
Jack.
JACK LIRA
You work too hard. I'm sorry about
your window. I'll fix it tomorrow.
(turning on the charm)
Are you surprised?!
HARVEY MILK
Jack, I have to go. I have an
invitation to a party tomorrow.
Lots of rich people, politicians.
We could get all dressed up...
Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him
through a simple dance.
JACK LIRA
So I could be the first lady?
HARVEY MILK
Uh-huh.
JACK LIRA
I watched TV here today. All day. I
saw All My Children. They killed
Margo. I knew it was going to
happen. They try and trick you but
it never works.
HARVEY MILK
(enjoying this)
You always see it coming?
JACK LIRA
What? Killing the blonde? Every
time. I'm good with that.
(gets slow, sensual)
I think now the old lady is going
to have an affair. Then she'll get
killed or married. Always one or
the other. Dead or married.
Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate.
54.
HARVEY MILK
If I make you a key, you won't
break my windows again, right?
JACK LIRA
That's right.
The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be
going back to work tonight.
Harvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY. He tries hard
to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the
only gay man at Dan's child's baptism.
Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father. Harvey waves.
Harvey and Dan have pulled themselves away.
HARVEY MILK
I'm proposing a citywide ordinance.
It ensures that a person who
already has a job can't be fired
for their orientation.
DAN WHITE
I'm not sure my constituents would
favor that.
Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.
HARVEY MILK
Is anyone else here from the Board?
DAN WHITE
You're the only one who showed up I
think.
HARVEY MILK
Were you christened here?
DAN WHITE
Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My
grandma immigrated here when this
was an Irish Catholic city. The
City of St. Francis... A lot's
changed here since then.
HARVEY MILK
You're more like one of us now...
an outsider.
55.
DAN WHITE
You're not like most homosexuals,
are you, Harvey?
HARVEY MILK
Do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"
DAN WHITE
(smiles, then)
Say, where do you stand on the
Psychiatric Center the City's been
pushing into my district?
HARVEY MILK
Well, I'd have to study it...
DAN WHITE
Getting it out of my district was a
key piece of my platform. It only
attracts arsonist, rapists, all
that, you know.
HARVEY MILK
Sure, sure. A campaign promise.
DAN WHITE
A big one.
(QUIET)
What do you say we watch out for each
other's interests? I'd like that.
HARVEY MILK
I'd like that, too, Dan.
Mary Ann White approaches with their child. It's awkward, as
if she's walked in on something intimate.
DAN WHITE
I'm sorry. Slipped into some shop
talk.
HARVEY MILK
The Gay Rights Ordinance. My fault.
MARY ANN WHITE
Seems an inappropriate subject in
here don't you think?
HARVEY MILK
Hey, don't knock it till you've
tried it.
His attempt to break the tension goes down in flames. She
cracks a polite smile. They're from very different worlds.
56.
Harvey is under pressure from his own advisors (Michael,
Dick, Cleve) to vote against Dan's bill.
DICK PABICH
Supervisors Silver and Lau are
asking you to vote to keep this
Psychiatric Center in Dan's
district. It'll go down 6 to 5 if
you vote to get rid of it.
MICHAEL WONG
It's a Youth Campus, Harvey. These
are kids that would be displaced
from their families if it's moved.
HARVEY MILK
I can't just dump Dan. The guy's
got nothing going for him. No
friends...
CLEVE JONES
Here we go, Harvey to the rescue.
Isn't it enough we have to put up
with Jack?
HARVEY MILK
Lay off. He registered 120 voters
last week.
CLEVE JONES
So do any of your volunteers, but
you don't make them all first lady.
MICHAEL WONG
What does Dan White do for you?
Really? Politically?
HARVEY MILK
He intrigues me... I think he may
be one of us.
Everyone groans. Cleve camps it up:
CLEVE JONES
Dear God, say it ain't so!
HARVEY MILK
It's just a theory...
DICK PABICH
You just think he's cute.
57.
HARVEY MILK
No... I know what it's like to
live that life. That lie. You can
see it in Dan's eyes... The fear,
the pressure...
Anne Kronenberg walks in. She's got that look in her eyes.
Something's up.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Good or Bad?
ANNE KRONENBERG
Not great. State Senator John
Briggs is Anita Bryant's go-to guy
in California for sure. He's filed
his petition for a statewide
referendum to fire all gay teachers
and anyone who supports them.
A pall falls over the room. This is worse than expected.
HARVEY MILK
How many signatures will he need to
qualify for the ballot?
CLEVE JONES
Whatever. He can get them in two
Sundays at church in Orange County.
HARVEY MILK
(instead of fear,
excitement bubbles up)
This means the fight's coming here,
where we can do something about it!
Wichita's one thing, Kansas City.
But Anita's heading for San
Francisco! She's not going to know
what hit her. Smile, children! This
is the fight we've been waiting for.
Dan's house is filled with RELATIVES for a birthday
celebration. Dan is glued to the NEWS, watching BRIGGS.
Dan's RELATIVES gather around the TV. Mary Ann puts their
BABY into Dan's arms and returns to wrangling kids.
THE COVERAGE CUTS TO HARVEY BEING INTERVIEWED:
HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
Look what happened in Germany. Now
Anita Bryant already says that Jews
and Muslims are going to hell, you
know she's got a shopping list. We
are not going to let John Briggs or
Anita Bryant legislate bigotry in
this city...
Hold on Dan watching Harvey on TV.
Cleve and Anne sit in the entry way, Cleve in his tight jeans
and shirt. He's very out of place amongst all the suits.
Harvey walks in. Cleve and Anne rush to his side. David
Goodstein and Rick Stokes turn to greet Milk.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
Hello, Harvey. Running late?
(Harvey doesn't stop)
(MORE)
59.
DAVID GOODSTEIN (CONT'D)
Oh Harvey... your boyfriend is in
the closet.
HARVEY MILK
Excuse me, David?
RICK STOKES
(QUIETLY)
The Latino, he's locked himself in
the coat room... Mr. Milk, Phil
Burton is here. He's likely the
next Speaker of the House and a
much needed ally against Prop Six.
We don't need a scene.
Harvey is at the door. Jack is locked inside the room.
HARVEY MILK
You're right, I know, I was late by
twenty minutes. I'm sorry, Jack.
JACK LIRA (O.S.)
Who were you with? Scott? Some boy?
HARVEY MILK
I was at work. Come out, sugar pea.
JACK LIRA (O.S.)
No. You embarrassed me. I didn't
know anyone. These are not good
people. I don't want to be here.
HARVEY MILK
Then go home, Jack.
JACK LIRA (O.S.)
No. I'll wait for you. Go away.
A tight smile from Harvey as he looks up to Cleve.
Harvey, Cleve and a dozen others are scattered about the room
for a meeting with the DEMOCRATIC PARTY ESTABLISHMENT. U.S.
Congressman PHIL BURTON, 51, leans on a desk, listening.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
The Briggs initiative is polling at
75 percent for approval statewide.
CLEVE JONES
80 percent in other polls. Some
even have us losing San Francisco.
60.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
(condescending to Cleve)
So it's important we not deceive
people into thinking we can beat
this, or we'll have riots and only
increase this backlash.
HARVEY JONES
Good point, David. Let's just roll
right over. Make it easier for
Briggs to fuck us up the ass.
Rick and David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it,
passing out copies of his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier.
PHIL BURTON
We're taking this very seriously in
my office. We want to send one of
these to every home in California.
We'll need money to do that.
HARVEY MILK
(reading the flier)
"Proposition Six is an affront to
Human Rights. An invasion of the
State into the private lives of
California citizens."
(points to the pictures)
Does it even say the word gay on
this thing? Anywhere?
DAVID GOODSTEIN
No Harvey, purposefully not.
PHIL BURTON
With the heat bearing down on your
movement right now, we think it's
best to dodge the "gay" bullet. Go
for the human rights angle.
HARVEY MILK
People need to know who's affected.
This flier needs at least one old
queen on it.
(a dig, to Goodstein)
Why don't you volunteer for that,
David?
RICK STOKES
(an olive branch)
Corey Wares is an out gay--
61.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
(cutting Rick him off)
RICK--
HARVEY MILK
This is shit. Shit and
masturbation. It's a coward's
response to a dangerous threat.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
(a beat, then)
I think you should leave.
In the face of Phil Burton, most the others seem to agree.
HARVEY PUTS PHIL BURTON'S FLYER IN THE FIREPLACE on his way
out of the room.
Harvey knocks on the coat check door.
HARVEY MILK
Jack, it's time to go.
(to Cleve)
Get everyone together. I want young
people, women, fresh heads.
Fighters and organizers, not
politicians.
CLEVE JONES
(as if Jack can't spell)
What about, S-C-O-T-T?
OFF HARVEY, knowing Scott would be an asset. Jack opens the
door and grabs Harvey's hand. They go.
Harvey's clan is assembled (Jim, Dick, Mike, Cleve, Anne,
Jack, Denis) along with fiery teacher Tom Amiano and MANY
OTHER YOUNG ACTIVISTS.
A HANDSOME PIZZA DELIVERY GUY is setting down boxes of
pizzas. They're in for the night. The atmosphere is 180
degrees different from the previous stuffy meeting.
CLEVE JONES
We're not interested in working
with those old Democratic Party
shits.
THE DOOR OPENS and someone new enters. He's HOLDING THE HAND
OF... SCOTT SMITH. They are obviously a new couple.
62.
Scott and his BOYFRIEND find a place on the floor. Harvey's
and Scott's EYES MEET across the room.
JIM RIVALDO
But we can't afford infighting
anymore, Cleve. We have to bring
together every group. Even the old
school Democrats.
HARVEY MILK
(taking over)
Is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy,
or are we just gonna stare?
People start chipping in for the HANDSOME PIZZA GUY.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
If we're gonna convince the 90% to
give a shit about us 10%... We
have to let 'em know who we are.
(his big new idea)
Everybody's coming out. The entire
state. No matter where they live.
DICK PABICH
"Come out, come out, wherever you
are!"
HARVEY MILK
I'm serious.
(beat, the room gets quiet)
We're going to tell everyone in the
state to come out. Every gay doctor,
lawyer, teacher, dog catcher... We
have to leave the ghetto, let all
those people out there know that
they do know one of us. And if
people won't step out of the closet,
we open the door for them.
ANNE KRONENBERG
Jesus.
SCOTT SMITH
The whole state is not San Francisco.
HARVEY MILK
Clearly, Scott.
JIM RIVALDO
It could be dangerous. There is
such a thing as a right to privacy.
63.
HARVEY MILK
Privacy's our enemy. You want real
political power? Let's tell the
truth for a change. Starting here.
If there's anybody in this room,
right now, who hasn't told their
families, their friends, their
employers... Do it. Now.
ANNE KRONENBERG
My folks know already.
A beat. The room is silent. Dick looks ill.
DICK PABICH
I haven't told my father yet...
HARVEY MILK
(a beat, then)
People vote two to one for us if
they know just one of us.
(BEAT)
Cleve, show Dick where you keep
your phone.
CLEVE JONES
It's in the bedroom.
After a moment, Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room.
People are stunned by Harvey's outrageous demand. Harvey sees
Scott GLARING at him.
Dianne bangs her gavel like a mad woman. Harvey's adamant.
HARVEY MILK DIANNE FEINSTEIN
I have told no lies here Supervisor Milk, you will
today or to Supervisor White come to order.
in the past--
HARVEY MILK
--I want it noted that I never
promised to back moving any Mental
Health Centers. I greatly respect
Supervisor White, but I would like
his remarks stricken.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN
Duly noted. We will take a recess
before recording the vote.
Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans over to Harvey.
CAROL RUTH SILVER
Thank you, Harvey.
Harvey is preoccupied with Dan approaching. He leans back.
DAN WHITE
Can I have a moment with Harvey?
Alone, please, Carol?
She politely recognizes the tension and gets up.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
Why are you turning on me like this
at the last minute? What did I do?
HARVEY MILK
I didn't have all the details. I'll
help you craft a different version
that doesn't displace any kids.
DAN WHITE
Harvey, I can't go back to my family
and to my folks and to my district
without this. Don't do this.
HARVEY MILK
I'm getting a lot of pressure, Dan.
DAN WHITE
You strung me along. And now you're
throwing me to the wolves.
66.
HARVEY MILK
You only need one more vote, Dan.
There are 5 other Supervisors you
could convince besides me.
Dan grabs Harvey. It's threatening. A new side of Dan.
DAN WHITE
I'll vote against your Queer Law.
I'll get Quentin against it.
HARVEY MILK
It'll still pass. You can't keep
alienating yourself here, Dan.
DAN WHITE
I gave you a chance, Harvey. I
really did. You blew it. You really
blew it.
Dan goes, the rage of a scorned adolescent under his suit.
Harvey's mood has darkened as he talks into his recorder...
HARVEY MILK
Across the country, a handful of
city councils had passed the very
first ordinances protecting gay
people against discrimination. But
Anita Bryant and her right wing
Christian fundamentalists were
creating and exploiting and fanning
a backlash. Now she had referenda
to repeal all of these gay rights
ordinances. While we were preparing
for the battle against Briggs and
Prop Six, Anita Bryant was taking
her show on the road... sweeping
the country. Her next stop was
Wichita, Kansas.
CHYRON: "Landslide: Wichita says NO to Gays." Anita talks to
a REPORTER. BRIGGS is among the supporters at her side.
ANITA BRYANT
I give thanks for all of our foot
soldiers of God here in Wichita.
But we must push on. Look what
happened to Sodom and to the world
of Noah. Onward Christian soldiers!
(MORE)
67.
ANITA BRYANT (CONT'D)
(lifting her hand with
BRIGGS'S)
On to California!
96 I/E. TELEPHONE TREE MONTAGE / EFFECT - DAY
A telephone tree MONTAGE starts with Cleve on a PAY PHONE on
Castro Street:
CLEVE JONES
Hi. We're losing Wichita. Rally
tonight. Sundown. Market and Castro.
A MULTIPLYING FRAME EFFECT: the person he called calls two
others, they call four, then more and more as the tree grows.
HARVEY'S POV ON: The VIOLENT DEATH THREAT LETTER AND DRAWING
that is still tacked up to his refrigerator.
OUTSIDE: The SOUNDS of a RIOT in the making.
Harvey rips down the threatening LETTER and throws it away.
Harvey BOUNDS down the stairs and into the shop. Cleve RUSHES
into the store, breathless.
CLEVE JONES
They're moving. I don't know
where, but...
HARVEY MILK
Did Jim call the press?
(shouting at Danny)
Get out there with your camera!
DANNY NICCOLETTA
I'm going!
CLEVE JONES
Press is covered. But we don't have
a permit to march.
HARVEY MILK
(digs for his bullhorn)
When I got Coors out of the bars,
the Union gave me this. I want you
to have it.
CLEVE JONES
What do I do with this?
68.
HARVEY MILK
You're an activist. Take it. March
them.
(off Cleve, unsure)
March those people up to the front
doors of City Hall. When it looks
really bad, the city's first gay
Supervisor will come out and play
peacemaker. We save the city from a
riot. We can turn this night into
more political power for the cause.
CLEVE JONES
I can't do it like you do it.
HARVEY MILK
I won't always be here. Somebody
else will have to take over.
(looking him in the eye)
I need you to be the scary one now.
The angry protesters march past the large glass windows of
TWIN PEAKS bar. Unlike the Dade County march, the bar is
empty. The patrons are already in the streets.
Harvey RACES to his office. He stops at a mirror to
straighten his tie and collect himself.
OUTSIDE: The SOUND of the ANGRY MOB on City Hall's front
steps. "Civil Rights or Civil War!" Someone THROWS A ROCK at
the City Hall doors.
Harvey rushes out the front doors, pushing past the police to
greet THE MOB on City Hall's front steps. Through the glass
doors we see Cleve rush up and hand Harvey his bullhorn:
HARVEY MILK
Hello. My name is Harvey Milk, and
I want to recruit you.
(AN ENORMOUS CHEER rises)
I want to recruit you for the fight
to preserve our democracy against
the Anita Bryants and John Briggs
who are trying to legalize bigotry!
We have a choice to make. The fight
is at our doors. We must either go
back in the closet and shut it
tight, or fight... History shows
(MORE)
70.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
that if we continue to fight, we...
will... win.
Jim, Dick, Anne, Michael, Frank and Cleve are all in the
office. The FRONT PAGE of the Examiner features a PICTURE OF
CLEVE AND HARVEY ARM IN ARM on City Hall's steps. Cleve is
jazzed. Harvey stews.
CLEVE JONES
They're calling it a "successful
mediation." You're a God damn hero.
Fuck. It came this close to a riot.
HARVEY
Lose the note cards next time. Your
job is just to say into that
bullhorn what they're all feeling.
CLEVE JONES
You're just jealous it wasn't you
out there.
HARVEY MILK
We're losing Prop Six by 60% and
you're over there celebrating a
riot. I need more visibility...
(the real problem:)
If we're going to beat this thing,
we have to get Briggs to
acknowledge us.
Harvey steps away, hot, pensive. Anne gets quiet.
ANNE KRONENBERG
Every paper's calling Prop Six the
main event now. We lose this, we'll
have anti-gay laws in all fifty
states, and Briggs won't return our
calls for a public debate.
DICK PABICH
He's ignoring us to death.
HARVEY MILK
(steaming back in)
We need something populist. What's
the number one complaint about city
life?
CLEVE JONES
The piss smell in the Tenderloin.
71.
HARVEY MILK
Close.
FRANK ROBINSON
Dog shit.
JIM RIVALDO
If you cleaned up all the dog shit
in the city, you could be elected
Mayor.
CLEVE JONES
"Mayor Milk."
HARVEY MILK
I like it.
HARVEY STUDIES HIS OWN PHOTO on the FRONT PAGE of the
Chronicle, making his announcement about dog poop.
The SUPERVISORS are assembled for a vote. The CLERK, 60,
wraps up his roll call
CLERK
Supervisor Lau?
GORDON LAU
Aye.
72.
CLERK
Lau, Aye. Supervisor Silver?
CAROL RUTH SILVER
Aye.
CLERK
Silver, Aye. Supervisor White?
DAN WHITE
No.
CLERK
White, No. Madam President, I have
ten ayes and one no.
Dianne Feinstein BANGS HER GAVEL down hard.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN
The San Francisco Gay Rights
Ordinance sponsored by Supervisors
Milk and Silver is passed.
CAMERA'S FLASH! THE PACKED CHAMBERS ROAR!
Harvey locks onto Dan White. Dan makes eye contact. Harvey
turns his attention to the chamber audience's applause.
A gaggle of press has congregated. Mayor Moscone and Harvey
walk into the office keeping their conversation private.
MAYOR MOSCONE
I can't get my stories on page ten,
you're getting page one?
HARVEY MILK
Doggy-doo's a real problem, George.
With a shit eating grin, Harvey offers up a powder blue pen.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Powder blue to sign they city's
first Gay Rights law... George, we
need your help with Briggs... The
gay community will have your back
from now on. On all issues. I hope
you'll have ours.
A beat between them. An alliance is forming. The Mayor sits
behind his desk and turns to the press with Harvey's pen.
73.
MAYOR MOSCONE
Good morning, everyone... I don't
do this enough, taking swift and
unambiguous action on a substantive
move for civil rights.
Moscone signs the law with the powder blue pen. Harvey leans
over him. THE PRESS CAPTURES THE MOMENT.
Dan sits at his desk, agitated. DAN'S POV: The FRONT PAGE of
the Examiner featuring MOSCONE AND HARVEY.
Harvey comes to the door.
HARVEY MILK
What are you working on, Dan?
DAN WHITE
If you have something to discuss,
you can have your aide make an
appointment with my aide.
HARVEY MILK
Listen, I know you're disappointed
about the Psychiatric Center...
What else do you have coming up?
DAN WHITE
Now you need something from me.
You want my me to join in with the
Queers on this Prop Six business?
HARVEY MILK
We prefer the word "gay," Dan.
Just as I'm sure you prefer the
word, "Irish-American" to "Mick."
DAN WHITE
Harvey, our society can't exist
without the family, without the
church.
HARVEY MILK
We're not against those things.
DAN WHITE
You're not? Can two men reproduce?
HARVEY MILK
(a smile)
No. But, we keep trying!
(SERIOUSLY)
(MORE)
74.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
C'mon, Dan. You're channeling Anita
and Briggs... we can work together.
On something...
DAN WHITE
Okay. You introduce an initiative
for Supervisor pay raises.
HARVEY MILK
(anything but that)
It's a bad time politically. I have
an election next year.
DAN WHITE
You asked for something. Introduce
pay raises. I can't take care of
my family on our salaries. You
don't have that problem, do you?
Dan's AIDE steps into the doorway. She seems surprised to see
Harvey in Dan's office.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
Mr. Milk, You'll excuse me, I have
a development meeting.
Dan goes.
A crowd sings Happy Birthday. One after another, Harvey's
guests throw CREAM PIES in his face. RICK AND DAVID GOODSTEIN
INCLUDED. A PEACE OFFERING. Harvey wipes pie from his eyes.
In the B.G. the black drag queen sensation, SYLVESTER, breaks
into his top 10 anthem, "You Make Me Feel." It's a who's who
of San Francisco's political elite. Jack scoots up to Harvey.
HARVEY MILK
What's wrong, Taco Bell?
JACK LIRA
Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of
your table. You should fire them.
HARVEY MILK
I'll take it under consideration.
Why don't you get us a drink?
A kiss and Jack heads to the bar. Scott approaches.
SCOTT SMITH
Don't let Cezar Chavez hear you
calling him Taco Bell.
75.
HARVEY MILK
He's getting better. He's enrolling
in classes on Monday.
Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey's jacket.
SCOTT SMITH
I remember when your birthdays were
a bit less... lavish. More
intimate.
HARVEY MILK
Who invited you? Anne?
SCOTT SMITH
My boyfriend got an invitation. I
was his "plus one."
HARVEY MILK
Congratulations. It was a tough
ticket to get.
SCOTT SMITH
Congratulations to you. Looks like
you're part of the Machine now.
(Harvey looks away, toward Jack)
You can do better.
HARVEY MILK
When I come home to Jack, I don't
have to talk politics or talk
intelligently. Or even talk.
(SELF-DEPRECATING)
And where's an old man like me
going to get such a good looking
young man, right?
SCOTT SMITH
You're not so old. You look
handsome... Happy 48th. Looks like
you're gonna make it to fifty after-
all, Mr. Milk.
Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS.
Harvey, still wearing cream pie remnants on his jacket, waits
for Jack to come out of the rest room. Harvey's one of the
last guests to leave. WAITERS are clearing tables.
HARVEY'S POV DOWN A DIMLY LIT CORRIDOR: A MALE FIGURE
APPROACHES, footsteps ECHOING on the marble floor. Harvey
braces himself.
76.
Emerging from the shadows: DAN WHITE. He approaches Harvey
with a bottle of Chivas.
Dan is SUPER-FRIENDLY, as if nothing unpleasant has ever
happened between them.
DAN WHITE
Sorry I missed the party, Harv...
HARVEY MILK
No problem, Dan. Good to see you.
DAN WHITE
Dog poop?
HARVEY MILK
Yeah.
DAN WHITE
It's good! It's a good one.
HARVEY MILK
Thanks. But it's a real problem.
DAN WHITE
Oh, yeah. I mean, God knows how many
problems it causes. All kinds of
diseases, birth defects probably, I
mean, stuff you can't even...
(drifting off, drunkenly)
Hey, I got you a little something.
HARVEY MILK
You didn't have to--
DAN WHITE
(at the same time)
You didn't have to--
(LAUGHING)
Why do people always say that?
"You didn't have to?" I mean, of
course, right? But, that's what
they always say. They always say
things like that...
Dan's attempts to be witty and erudite (like Harvey) only
leave him confused and tongue tied.
Harvey HAS NO IDEA why Dan is here.
HARVEY MILK
Are you okay, Dan?
77.
DAN WHITE
Oh, what? Yeah, sure. Harvey, I
just... I just want to say...
Happy Birthday.
Dan PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HARVEY for a sort-of macho but
really weird birthday hug. Harvey stiffens, it's such a
peculiar moment. Dan steps back, looks him over.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
I've really learned a lot from
watching you, Harvey.
HARVEY MILK
I doubt that.
DAN WHITE
No, I have. You gotta get out
there. Get noticed. That's how it
works. But, you have an issue.
That's your advantage.
HARVEY MILK
It's more than an issue, Dan.
(a beat, one last try to
get through to him)
Dan. I've had four relationships in
my life. Three of those four tried
to kill themselves. I know it was
my fault they did it. I told them
to stay quiet. To hide. Most of my
life I've been closeted. That's
what living this life is like for
most of us. The way things are...
This isn't just about our jobs, or
any issue, it's our lives we're
fighting for.
Jack emerges from the bathroom, barely together and leans on
Harvey. Dan steps back from Harvey and Jack, his moment
alone stolen away.
DAN WHITE
I've learned a lot from you,
Harvey. I'm going to get my picture
in the papers, too. You'll see.
I've got my own issue. That's
right. Dan White's Got An Issue!
John Briggs rides in a limo watching the freaks" outside. As
he nears the Parade Stages his POLICE ESCORTS take an
unplanned turn. He leans forward.
80.
JOHN BRIGGS
The parade is the other direction.
DRIVER
They're taking us another way, Sir.
The limo pulls in. Briggs cautiously steps out. Greeting him
are Moscone, the POLICE CHIEF, 25 SFPD officers, a gaggle of
press, and Harvey Milk.
It's a showdown... HIGH NOON.
JOHN BRIGGS
I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor.
MAYOR MOSCONE
I'm afraid it's not in the interest
of your safety, or my public's
safety to let you into that parade
grounds.
Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for
the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable.
HARVEY MILK
Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an
honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.
JOHN BRIGGS
I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to
fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.
HARVEY MILK
No sir. I would love to have a
public debate. I'm very interested
in the details of your argument.
JOHN BRIGGS
You know the details. As do the
people. Look at the votes across this
nation. The "public" is with me.
HARVEY MILK
Yes sir, today they are. But with my
City's Mayor and the San Francisco
press as my witnesses, I'm
challenging you to a public debate.
John nods, stiff. He can no longer avoid Harvey Milk. He gets
back in his limo.
81.
Harvey sits with John Briggs at a table facing forward. We
hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience.
HARVEY MILK
Senator, as a Christian it's
interesting that you don't seem to
understand what Christ was about.
He was about accepting people and
giving love, not carrying a Bible
in one hand and hatred in the
other...
(cheers from the audience)
...Now all the gay myths have been
shattered, all the fears, all the--
JOHN BRIGGS
Not in my mind they haven't--
HARVEY MILK
That's it. In your mind they
haven't, and I'm wondering why--
JOHN BRIGGS
Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who
believe in practicing bestiality to
teach our children, and the reason
we don't is because it is illegal.
But it's not illegal to be a
homosexual in California.
HARVEY MILK
And your law goes even further. Any
school employee who even supports a
gay person will be fired--
JOHN BRIGGS
True. But, gay people don't have
children of their own. If they
don't recruit our children, they'd
all die away. That's why they want
to be teachers, to encourage our
children to join them.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
How do you teach homosexuality?
Like French? I was born of
heterosexual parents, I was taught
by heterosexual teachers in a
fiercely heterosexual society. So
then why am I homosexual? And no
offense meant, but if it were true
that children mimicked their
(MORE)
82.
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) (CONT'D)
teachers, you'd sure have a helluva
lot more nuns running around.
The audience eats it up. It feel like "The Harvey Milk Show."
Continuing on with his recorded will...
HARVEY MILK
We were really genuinely frightened
by Proposition Six, and with the
backlash gaining strength, we were
very pessimistic. We didn't think
there was any chance we could beat
it. What we hoped to do was to
organize to the point that when we
did lose, there would be a
revolt... That all hell would break
lose.
Harvey, pacing, decisive.
DICK PABICH
People are coming out, though. We
met with groups in Bakersfield,
Redding, a dozen people showed up
in a library basement in Fresno
asking for our support if they came
out. Last Sunday, the Reverend of
St. Mary's came out to his entire
congregation...
HARVEY MILK
We're still losing, 60 to 30. We
have to take the show on the road.
Call Briggs's office. Do a press
release. Tell them he can pick the
town, the audience, and I'll ask
our supporters not to attend.
83.
DICK PABICH
Their audiences are insanely
devout. We'll get killed.
HARVEY MILK
Get me Orange County.
Jack is FLIPPING OUT, storming around the place.
JACK LIRA
You just have to go down to LA and
guess the right things on TV and
they'll pay us... You have to use
your fame now while you have it. We
could have nice things.
HARVEY MILK
I don't have time to do game shows
right now...
This stops Jack cold.
JACK LIRA
You are horrible! I have worked on
this surprise for you for weeks!
HARVEY MILK
Are you drunk right now?
JACK LIRA
You are an ungrateful asshole!
HARVEY MILK
Jack, I'll have more time soon.
JACK LIRA
You're ashamed of me!
HARVEY MILK
That's not true. I think you're
smart. You're capable. No matter
what your family or your father
said. I believe in you... We
should figure out something for you
to do. I could get you a job.
JACK LIRA
I'll never be good enough for you!
Jack THROWS A PIECE OF POTTERY AT HARVEY. It misses, CRASHING
THROUGH THE WINDOW onto the street below.
84.
HARVEY MILK
I'll get a broom.
Harvey goes. Jack collapses into a chair.
TV CAMERAS ROLL. They've gotten their ORANGE COUNTY DEBATE!
BRIGGS'S SUPPORTERS jeer Harvey as he rips into their State
Senator. Their vehemence frightens Dick in the audience.
Harvey lifts a Briggs flier.
HARVEY MILK
If in your statements here you say
that child molestation is not an
issue, why do you put out literature
that hammers it home, why do you play
on that myth and fear?
JOHN BRIGGS
Same thing with VD Harvey, we put
out publications about VD so you
can avoid it.
HARVEY MILK
(with a grin)
But you've even admitted that
there's more molestation in the
heterosexual group! So why not get
rid of the heterosexual teachers?
Boos from the conservative audience.
JOHN BRIGGS
We are not talking about homos...
child molestation, the fact is, at
least 95 percent of the people are
heterosexual. If we took
heterosexuals out AND homosexuals
out, you know what--
JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) HARVEY MILK
--we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers--
HARVEY MILK
--No child molestation... So you're
saying the percentage of population
is equal to the percentage of child
molestation?
JOHN BRIGGS
(getting more lost)
No, no, I'm not saying that at all--
85.
HARVEY MILK
That's what you just said.
JOHN BRIGGS
No. I'm saying that we cannot
prevent child molestation so let's
cut our odds down and take out the
homosexual group and keep in the
heterosexual group--
Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument. Briggs
looks down to his notes, lost. Harvey takes the opportunity
to rip into the State Senator:
HARVEY MILK
(directly to Briggs)
--Sir, in your own drive for
personal power, how many careers
are you willing to see destroyed?
How many lives will you destroy in
your lust for power, and when will
you stop?
The crowd boos, rails. This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange
County. In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by
the level of hatred. Harvey tries to maintain his composure.
Harvey sits down at the bar. The WAITER pours a coffee for
him. Harvey looks up to the TV.
HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter. It
feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey.
DAN WHITE
All I'm really saying is, if we
don't protect ourselves with this
kind of legislation, a transvestite
can show up at a public school with
all the qualifications for teaching
and they can't refuse to hire him.
86.
Harvey rushes from a packed session in the Supervisors'
Chambers to his office. Anne is behind him. He picks up the
phone. It seems urgent.
HARVEY MILK
Hey Jack, what's wrong?
JACK LIRA
Nothing. I just want to know when
you'll be home.
HARVEY MILK
You just had them pull me out of my
big vote on the dog shit ordinance.
Did you do this on purpose, Jack?
JACK LIRA
It's poop, Harvey. Aren't I more
important than poop?
HARVEY MILK
Yes, but... I don't know when I'll
be home. Maybe 6. 6:15.
JACK LIRA
Fine. 6:15.
Harvey hangs up. His patience is slipping. He looks up in
time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase.
Harvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out.
HARVEY MILK
Dan? How's the baby?
DAN WHITE
You didn't bring up Supervisor pay
raises. In fact, I heard you plan
to publicly oppose them.
HARVEY MILK
I heard you planned to vote against
them too, Dan. Were you trying to
set me up?
DAN WHITE
(parrotting Harvey
EARLIER)
(MORE)
87.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
It's not a good time for me to
bring it up. Politically.
HARVEY MILK
Dan, there's a vote to approve the
police desegregation settlement,
give me that and I'll consider
backing pay raises.
DAN WHITE
(suddenly very dark)
I don't trade votes... unlike you,
the way I was raised, we believe in
right and wrong. Moral and immoral.
HARVEY MILK
Black skin and White in your police
department?
(Dan steams)
Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out
against Proposition Six. You're
looking more and more out of touch.
DAN WHITE
If I come out against Prop Six,
it's only for the invasion of
State's rights issue.
HARVEY MILK
(smiles, trying to lighten)
And the potential witch hunts
against you "straight people,"
right?
Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response. He can't.
His behavior is alarming. He sets down his briefcase.
DAN WHITE
You underestimate me, Milk. You're
very, very wrong about me.
HARVEY MILK
I don't know what you mean.
A moment. Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
What is it, Dan? You can tell me.
DAN WHITE
You don't... You can't humiliate
me. And you will not demean me.
88.
Anne appears down the hall. Dan has more on his mind, but the
moment has passed. He picks up his briefcase and walks out of
the building. Off Harvey, concerned.
Opening the door, Harvey finds a trail of voter registration
cards, anti-Briggs literature, and Coors beer cans. Pushing
through his fear, he carefully follows the cans and flyers up
the stairs and through his apartment.
Odd notes are taped to the walls. They all lead to a black
velvet curtain with a note attached: "YOU'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE
CIRCUS, HARVEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY LAST ACT?"
Harvey pulls back the curtain to find Jack's body, cold and
discolored, hanging from a beam by a noose.
HARVEY CAN'T MOVE. He is mesmerized... horrified.
He grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting Jack down. He
cuts through the rope and FALLS TO THE FLOOR with the HEAVY
BODY.
Scott arrives. Sitting very still, Harvey is being consoled
by Cleve and Anne. Tears in his eyes, Harvey won't look up.
SCOTT SMITH
Harvey. Look at me. Look at me. You
did everything you could.
HARVEY
No, I didn't. Not everything...
89.
SCOTT SMITH
What else could you have done?
HARVEY
I could have come home at six
o'clock, not six-fifteen.
Scott puts his arm around Harvey. Harvey buries his head.
Anne helps Cleve take down Jack's many hidden notes. Cleve
quietly reads a prominently placed one:
CLEVE JONES
"Beware. The ides. Of November."
Into the recorder as if re-living the event over again...
HARVEY MILK
Jack was gone. I didn't have time
to mourn... There was no choice but
to keep on... to keep fighting.
Harvey sits in a make-up chair. A MAKE-UP artist is painting
him up to look like a clown. Several other CITY OFFICIALS are
in chairs beyond him. Harvey turns to the make-up artist.
With sincere enthusiasm:
HARVEY MILK
Thank you for this great honor. But
do you think once the magazine is
done snapping pictures, maybe I
could keep the suit for a while?
THIS IS THE MOMENT. Harvey watches aides on the phones comb
districts for voting results. Jim fills up a map on the wall.
DICK PABICH
San Bernadino is coming in. Not
good.
HARVEY MILK
Of course not. How not good?
MICHAEL WONG
60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno.
HARVEY MILK
Dear God, little Lotus Blossom.
Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar
results. They go up in red on the map.
JIM RIVALDO
Imperial is 69% "for" so far.
HARVEY MILK
Put it up on the board.
Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss.
He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up
to Harvey, concerned.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
The whole world is watching this.
This is San Francisco we're about
to lose. Are you ready?
CLEVE JONES
I can have 15,000 people in an
hour. But there's gonna be riots if
this thing passes.
HARVEY MILK
(darkens, pointed)
There goddamn better be.
CLEVE JONES
(stops, a beat, then:)
What are you telling me?
91.
HARVEY MILK
I can't say it because I'm a public
official, but for God's sake, if
this thing passes, fight back.
Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words.
Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone.
ANNE KRONENBERG
Don Amador down in LA.
HARVEY
(reluctantly answers)
Kind of a bad time, Don.
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)
No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave
me the phone.
HARVEY MILK
Paul who?
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)
You talked to me on the phone a
year or so ago. I'm from
Minnesota... I'm in a wheelchair.
REVEAL: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end.
HARVEY MILK
(a beat to take it in, then:)
I thought you were a goner, Paul.
YOUNG TEEN
I'm sorry. I should have called.
When I read in the paper that you
won the Supervisor seat, I got a
friend to put me on a bus to LA.
HARVEY MILK
Who did you know in Los Angeles?
YOUNG TEEN
Nobody. That's the uh... I just
didn't want to die anymore, sir.
(Harvey's at a loss for words)
I met your friend Don down here. I
turned 18. I voted today against
Prop Six... Thank you, Mr. Milk.
HARVEY MILK
No. You did this all by yourself.
92.
YOUNG TEEN
I don't think I'd be alive right now
without you, sir. You were right
about LA. It's like gay Disney
World.
HARVEY MILK
Then you have to see San Francisco!
YOUNG TEEN
Okay. I will. Don wanted me to
um... congratulate you on what he
says looks like a big win for us
tonight. Congratulations Mr. Milk.
Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in
LA county with green. On the other end of the phone, Harvey's
friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line.
DON AMADOR (V.O.)
It looks like we've taken LA
County, Harvey. By 65%. It's huge.
HARVEY MILK
I gotta go, Don. Thank you.
(frantic, to the room)
LA by 65% put it up! Put it up!
The tone in the room is changing. Jim storms up.
JIM RIVALDO
The polls were off. Briggs is going
down by more than 2 to 1. The only
district where it's leading in San
Francisco is Dan White's.
Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map. Anne, Dick & Jim,
all the volunteers. What this apparent win means to him, to
his people. To Cleve:
HARVEY MILK
Well crap Cleve, now what are we
going to do tonight?!
(re: a giant, jock strap
wearing, Lady Liberty)
Cover up Lady Liberty. The cameras
will be coming our way.
TV cameras roll. Lady liberty is covered with a "No on Six"
poster. A brass band marches dramatically into the hall.
Balloons fall. Harvey MOUNTS the stage to INCREDIBLE CHEERS.
93.
HARVEY MILK
To the gay community all over this
state... my message to you is... so
far a lot of people joined us and
rejected Proposition Six, and now we
owe them something... We must destroy
the myths once and for all, shatter
them. We must continue to speak
out... and most importantly, most
importantly, every gay person must
come out.
(CHEERS)
Tonight... Tonight it is clear that
everyone out there does know one of
us. And now that they do, they see
we are not sick... they can feel we
are not wrong... and they know we
should have a place in this great
country and in this world... A
message of hope has been to sent to
all the young people out there...
to all those afraid of this wave of
hate... to all those who have lost
their homes and their hometowns...
tonight we know there is a place
for us! My brothers and sisters...
we can come home again!
The crowd goes WILD. Harvey BEAMS. Moscone walks up onto
stage and lifts Harvey's hand. Harvey is now a member of the
S.F. political elite. Cleve watches from afar as Harvey steps
off and disappears into the crowd.
Dan watches HARVEY'S VICTORY SPEECH on the local news.
Dan White slides a sealed letter across a desk to an Aide.
It's addressed to Moscone. He seems oddly calm.
DAN WHITE
Could you give this to the Mayor
for me? As soon as possible.
Harvey walks down the hallway to his office, a spring in his
step. There are nods, hellos if not outright deference from
most passersby. His newfound political muscle is evident.
He comes face to face with Dan White.
HARVEY MILK
Morning, Dan.
95.
DAN WHITE
I just resigned. Congratulations.
I'm sure you're pleased.
Harvey doesn't know what to say. Dan's right, it does make
him happy. But it's not that simple.
DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
You'll be the next President of the
Board.
HARVEY MILK
I'm sure we could work together--
Dan walks away from Harvey. He doesn't want to hear anything
Harvey has to say.
Harvey watches as Dan is met in the hallway by an OFFICER
from the POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.
OFFICER
Hey, Dan. Just got word. Can we
talk to you for a minute?
DAN WHITE
Sure...
Dan heads for his office.
OFFICER
Downstairs. The Association
meeting room...
Harvey watches as Dan follows the officer down the stairs to
an ASSOCIATION MEETING ROOM on the next floor. When the DOOR
OPENS, Harvey sees SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES from the Police
Department wearing somber expressions.
It looks as if Dan is about to get REAMED OUT.
ACTUAL FOOTAGE: Channel 5 reporting from Dan White's street:
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV)
Most people were surprised when Dan
White quit last Friday citing
financial difficulties. Now we've
heard that White is asking for his
Supervisor job back. But many say--
Harvey, watching on the small TV set in his office.
96.
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV)
--White gave up all of his
political chits when he resigned
without making any arrangements.
The news story transitions in the B.G. as Harvey gets up.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV/BG)
The city of San Francisco is in
disbelief. Four-hundred bodies have
been found thus far in Jonestown,
Guyana. Leader of the People's
Temple, Jim Jones...
Harvey heads to Dan's office. He toys with the nameplate.
Something bittersweet lingers. He walks in.
HARVEY'S POV: On City Hall's lawn, Dan is with the press. He
looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window.
They make eye contact. It bears all the awkwardness of a
relationship lost.
Harvey is firm, his hands planted on the Mayor's desk.
HARVEY MILK
He gets dragged into a closed door
meeting with the Police Officers
Association, and comes out
demanding his job back? What do you
think they promised him? Or worse,
how did they threaten him?
97.
MAYOR MOSCONE
A man has the right to change his
mind. Give me some peace.
HARVEY MILK
How many of our propositions has
Dan shut down? We could finally
settle this police desegregation
nonsense. Cement rent control. It's
his vote on this Board that stands
in our way.
MAYOR MOSCONE
I get it, Harvey. I've been lobbied
all week. Enough.
HARVEY MILK
Let me just remind you that you're
up for re-election. If you re-
appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote.
They listen to me. You won't get
elected dog catcher.
MAYOR MOSCONE
(stern, silent, a beat, then:)
I'll make my decision on Monday.
(as Harvey's on his way out,
with a wry grin)
You know what you sounded like just
now? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly.
HARVEY MILK
(returns the smile)
A "homosexual" with a bit of
power... rather scary isn't it, Mr.
Mayor?
OFF Harvey. He's come a long way.
OPERA MUSIC CROSSES THE CUT TO:
Harvey sits in a balcony seat of the filled, darkened opera
house next to Brazilian opera star BIDU SAYAO, 76. He's
enraptured by a production of TOSCA.
ON STAGE IT'S "O Scarpia, we shall meet before God!" Refusing
to be taken prisoner, Tosca jumps from the walls of the
castle set to her death.
Mary Ann offers the phone to Dan. Dan takes it.
98.
DAN WHITE
(into the phone)
Yes. This is Dan White.
KCBS REPORTER (V.O.)
I'm Barbra Taylor from KCBS. I'm
interested in your reaction. I've
received information from the
Mayor's office that you won't be
getting your job back.
DAN WHITE
I'm sorry. I don't know anything
about that.
Dan hangs up on her.
Harvey can't sleep. He dials the phone. He lets it ring and
ring. Finally, a voice picks up on the other line.
SCOTT SMITH
Hello?
REVEAL: Scott, half asleep.
HARVEY MILK
Sorry to wake you up.
SCOTT SMITH
What's wrong?
HARVEY MILK
I went to the opera tonight. Guess
who my date was.
SCOTT SMITH
Who?
HARVEY MILK
Bidu Sayao herself. She was in the
first Puccini I ever saw. The crowd
went wild. It was like I was young
again, seeing my first live opera...
SCOTT SMITH
If you go to the opera again, you
should call me.
HARVEY MILK
Really?
Scott gets out of bed, considers his words. It's intimate.
99.
SCOTT SMITH
Yes. I'd go with you.
HARVEY MILK
I'd like that.
Harvey is quiet, a rare moment of reflection. An unexpected
tear rolls down his cheek.
SCOTT SMITH
Harvey?
HARVEY MILK
Look out the window, the sun's
coming up.
SCOTT SMITH
It's late. You should get some
sleep.
HARVEY MILK
I don't want to miss it.
SCOTT SMITH
Miss what?
HARVEY MILK
This.
Harvey's single word answer means, "Life."
OFF Harvey: Neither wants to hang up the phone.
The sun rising in his own living room, Dan White has been up
all night, too. The coffee table is covered with coke cans
and junk food wrappers.
Waiting for a MAN inside to turn away, Dan sneaks in through
a side window at City Hall. The man calls after him:
MAN
Hey, wait a minute, Mr.--
DAN WHITE
My aide was supposed to come down
here and let me in the side door,
but she never showed up.
MAN
And you are?
100.
DAN WHITE
I'm Dan White. City Supervisor.
We follow Dan down the hall and into the grand entry-way.
Harvey walks through City Hall's METAL DETECTORS. He picks up
his keys from the dish and heads up the grand staircase. Like
ships in the night, Harvey just misses Dan exiting the
elevator. Dan heads into Mayor Moscone's office.
With Dianne, Harvey is thrilled, rubbing it in.
HARVEY MILK
Who's it gonna be? Is he replacing
Dan with that God Damned liberal
lefty Don Horanzy? That'll really
shake up the Board, huh?
DIANNE FEINSTEIN
All I know is that we're getting a
new Supervisor today. If Dan shows
up, just avoid him. We don't need
a scene today, right Harvey?
HARVEY MILK
(grins ear to ear)
Heaven forbid, Dianne.
The MAYOR'S SECRETARY sits at her desk. Shouting can be heard
from inside his office.
Moscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office. Dan is
enraged. Moscone lights a cigarette.
DAN WHITE
You can't take this away from me!
Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails.
MAYOR MOSCONE
The issue is what's fair, for the
people of your district. Take some
time off. Spend it with your
family.
101.
Moscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan
White brandishing his revolver.
Moscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL
THUDS, not so different than a backfire. The secretary looks
out the window, concerned. The waiting man checks his watch.
Still gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole
in his tie.
Dan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office. Harvey's
voice can be heard down the hall. He sounds up-beat,
OPTIMISTIC:
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
This time next year we're marching
on Washington D.C. It'll look like
Market and Castro, but with a
million people. Write that down.
Tell President Carter we're coming
after him next. I'm going to
deposit this. I'll be back in 20
minutes.
Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND,
preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway.
DAN WHITE
Say, Harve, can I see you for a
minute?
HARVEY MILK
Sure.
Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office.
Harvey walks in first. Dan stays between Harvey and the door.
Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off.
Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires.
The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm.
HARVEY MILK
Oh no... N--
Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help.
102.
Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he
falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward
it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the
Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it.
HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city.
Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head. HE FIRES.
And just like that, Harvey falls.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Last week I got a phone call--
Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder...
HARVEY
--from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and
the voice was quite young, and the
person said... "Thanks." You've got
to elect gay people so that that
young child and the thousands upon
thousand like him know there's
hope... hope for a better world...
Scott and Anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service.
Most of the seats are empty. The speaker is unfamiliar, some
appointed CITY OFFICIAL.
SCOTT SMITH
(finally crumbling, tears roll)
Where is everybody? Didn't anyone
give a damn?
Harvey speaking into the tape recorder.
HARVEY MILK
I ask this... If there should be an
assassination, I would hope that
five, ten, one hundred, a thousand
would rise. I would like to see
every gay lawyer, every gay
architect come out--
HARVEY MILK
You gotta give em' hope... you
gotta give em' hope.
Harvey closes his note pad, puts down his pencil, and pushes
stop on his recorder.
