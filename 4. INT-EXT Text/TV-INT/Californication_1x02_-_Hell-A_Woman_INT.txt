      Hank pulls up in front of the cover of Dwell magazine.

      Today is a day he would very much prefer to honk the horn, 
      but he decides to suck it up and ring the doorbell.

      And so he does, bracing himself for the very real possibility 
      that a certain comely 16-year-old might answer.

      The door opens, revealing not Mia but her sire, BILL, an 
      annoyingly handsome and seemingly decent fellow who also just 
      happens to be Hank s nemesis.

                                  BILL
                    Hank.

                    Becca doesn t want to see you.

                                  HANK
                    Are you looking for a cock punch?  
                    Let me talk to her.

                    Hank, trust me, as the father of a 
                    teenage daughter, just give her 
                    some space.  She ll come around.

      Hank shakes his head, starts to walk away, turns back.  Walks 
      past Bill, into the house...

                                  HANK
                    You know... Bill, is it?

                                  BILL
                    Yep -- still Bill.

                                  HANK
                      I appreciate the parenting advice, 
                    but maybe -- just maybe -- it s not 
                    such a great idea to give your kid 
                    too much space.  Maybe too much 
                    space is what gets them in trouble.

                                  BILL
                    Hank.  Please.  My daughter is 
                    sixteen.  She s an angel.  Clearly 
                    I m doing something right.

                                  HANK
                    You poor bastard.

                                  BILL
                    Excuse me?

                                  HANK
                    Homo says what?

                                  BILL
                    What?

                                  HANK
                    Gotcha.

      Bill is stunned by the inanity of it all.  Hank notices a 
      recently unpacked painting leaning somewhere nearby.  It s 
      hideous -- absurdly expensive and completely pretentious.

                                  HANK
                    What the fuck is that?

                                  BILL
                    What do you think?  I could ve 
                    bought a new car instead.

                                  HANK
                    I think you should still buy the 
                    car.  And run over whoever painted 
                    this.  It s fucking hideous.

                    exactly the King s English there, 
                    fella.

      Hank moves in to give Karen a kiss hello.  As is his wont.  
      But Karen dodges the kiss.  As is her wont.  Bill, in turn, 
      kisses Karen, eyeballing Hank the whole time.

      Becca appears.  Deadpans Hank.

                                  BECCA
                    I still hate you.

                                  HANK
                      Naturally.

                                  BECCA
                    But I do want to see your movie.

                                  HANK
                    My book.  Not my movie.

                                  BECCA
                    Not my problem.  I like your movie.

                                  HANK
                    How is that even possible?

                                  BECCA
                    Because it proves you re not the 
                    asshole they say you are.

      Hank holds out his palm.  Becca produces a dollar bill.  
      Which Hank quickly pockets.

                                  HANK
                    Now who says I m an asshole? 

      An awkward moment as looks are exchanged.  Becca deadpans.  
      Hank is forced to give her the dollar back.  Hank starts to 
      lead Becca away, but Karen interjects:

                                  KAREN
                          (to Hank)

                    Thank you, sweetie.

                                  BECCA
                    Dad should come.  They re his 
                    friends too, you know.  And Uncle 
                    Charlie s his agent.  Maybe he has 
                    an offer for him.

      Karen and Bill exchange looks.  Much to Hank s amusement.  
      Bill, nothing if not a decent guy, summons the decency:

                                  BILL
                    You re welcome to come, Hank.

      Becca dutifully inserts the earbuds, cranks her iPod.

                    I guess this means the answer is 
                    no.  You re not going to marry me.  
                    I have to say -- I m disappointed.

      Nora leaves Hank all horned-up with no place to go.  He slips

      out the paper with the blonde s number on it.

      She looks down.  Hank follows her gaze.

                    Well, let me help you find it.

      She proceeds to go down on him.  Sucking and slurping like a 
      vacuum cleaner on steroids.  Gagging and spitting with glee.

      As Hank s eyes adjust to the apartment, he notices a 
      collection of porn DVD s.  He picks one up.  It s a parody of 
      his own movie:   Crazy Little Thing Called Anal.   

      Then he realizes that the girl blowing him is the same as the 
      one on the box.  Pretty much the same angle and everything.

                                  HANK
                    Hey, this is you.

                    Not a big porn guy, actually.

      All of a sudden, there s the sound of a KID CRYING from a 
      BABY MONITOR.  Followed by a  Mommy!  or two.  Hank freezes.

                                  HANK
                    Who might that be?

                                  THE BLONDE
                    That would be my daughter.

                                  HANK
                    Oh.  Do you need to...?

                                  THE BLONDE
                    Nah, she ll quiet down in a minute.  
                    Mommy s gotta get laid sometime.

      But the kid continues to cry.  Overcome with great sadness, 
      Hank gently guides The Blonde s head up and away from his 
      southern hemisphere.  Gives her a kiss on the cheek.

                                  HANK
                    Go be with your kid.

      He collects his stuff and leaves.


      Hank lies awake in bed.  Grabs his pants off the floor and 
      fishes for the card Nora gave him.  He picks up his shitty PC 
      laptop, launches the browser, types in the address for the 
      Hell-A website.

      The site is instantly appealing -- a cross between Rolling 
      Stone, Salon.com, and Suicide Girls.com.  The content covers 
      art, music, film, politics -- with a narrow focus on L.A.

      being the very edge of Western Civilization and the epicenter 
      of everything right and wrong with the world as we know it.

      Hank is instantly sucked into the raw, cool, unfiltered 
      aesthetic.  We get the sense he sees a kindred spirit in 
      there somewhere.  And then -- his computer dies.

      He hurls it across the room.  Gets out of bed.


      Hank stands in the middle of the sleek, ultra-tech space, 
      writing on one of the Macs.  We see a portion of the display, 
      the top of which reads:   HANK HATES YOU ALL. 

      As Hank s voice-over kicks in...

                    travels through this crazy little 
                    thing called life:  One:  a morning 
                    of awkwardness is far better than a 
                    night of loneliness.  Two:  I 
                    probably won t go down in history, 
                    but I will go down on your sister.  
                    And three:  while I m down there, 
                    it might be a nice to see a hint of 
                    pubis.  I m not talking about a 
                    huge 70 s Playboy bush or 
                      anything... just something that 
                    reminds me that I m performing 
                      cunnilingus on an adult...

      ...words, phrases and images from Hank s manifesto are 
      projected onto the walls and other computer displays. 

      Things like:   breast implants, bikini wax, vaginal 
      rejuvenation. 

      Pictures of 1950 s pin-up girls transforming over the decades 
      into the alien life forms that L.A. Women have become today.

      The whole store becomes Hank s private office and a 
      heightened, stylized manifestation of what s going on inside 
      his head.

                    But I guess the larger question

      Hank opens the medicine cabinet, finds a bottle of Percocet.  
      Pops one.  Closes the cabinet.  Looks in the mirror.  Doesn t 
      like what he sees.  Gives himself a quick pep talk.

                                  HANK

                    Of course it does.  Your novel -- 
                    while very much an exercise in 
                    nihilism -- is firmly rooted in 
                      romanticism.

                                  HANK
                    You ve read the novel?

      Becca stares at him until he gives her the dollar back.

                                  BECCA
                    You shouldn t take the lord s name 
                    in vain, you know.

                                  HANK
                    Where d you get that old chestnut?

                                  BECCA
                    Bill.  I was wearing my Cradle of 
                    Filth T-shirt.  The one that says 
                     Jesus Was a C-Word  on the back.

                                  HANK
                    That s my girl.

                                  BECCA
                    But I do pray sometimes.  Sort of.

                                  HANK
                    What for?

                                  BECCA
                    That you and Mom work out your shit 
                    and we move back to New York.

                                  HANK
                    Oh, baby... you don t owe me 
                    anything for that one.

      He pulls her into a long hug.  Doesn t want to let go.

                                  BECCA
                    Dad?  Are you okay?

                                  HANK
                    No.  But I m working on it.

      Hank exits Becca s room.  Picks up the dwindling supply of 
      scotch right where he left it -- by the door.  Takes a swig.  
      Just as Sonja is coming out of a nearby bathroom.

                                  HANK
                    Hey, sorry about that.  I honestly 
                    don t know what the fuck I m 
                    talking about half the time.  Ask 
                    anyone, they ll tell you.

                                  SONJA
                    No worries, Hank.

      Hank smells something.  He sniffs.  Sonja giggles.

                                  SONJA
                    Wanna get fucked up?


      Hank and Sonja share a joint on Karen and Bill s bed.

                                  SONJA
                    Why so smiley?

                                  HANK
                    Nothing like getting stoned on the 
                    very bed your ex-domestic partner 
                    shares with her fiance.  
                          (a happy sigh)
                    It s the little things.

      Sonja takes a deep hit, stands up.

                                  SONJA
                    Do me a favor?

                                  HANK
                    Sure.

                                  SONJA
                    Tell me what you think.

      She steps out of her dress.  Stands in front of him.  
      Completely naked.

                                  HANK
                    Honestly?

                                  SONJA
                    Honestly.  I m forty-something 
                    years old, there s no time for 
                    games.  I need to know the truth.

                                  HANK*
                    Okay, well, your breasts are 
                    obviously real... you have an 
                    abundance of pubic hair... and 
                    there s no evidence of vaginal 
                      rejuvenation...
                          (then)
                    Aside from the fact that you 
                    worship a space alien, you just 
                    might be one of the most beautiful 
                    women I ve ever seen.

      Sonja smiles, gives him the finger, says:

                                  SONJA
                    Thank you.

      And she means it.

                                  HANK
                    My pleasure.

                                  SONJA
                    Do me another favor?

                                  HANK
                    What s that?

                                  SONJA
                    Fuck me.
                          (then)
                    My husband recently left me for a 
                    guy named Ted and right now all I 
                    want to do is get fucked stupid by 
                    a man who actually likes women.  Is 
                    that okay with you?

                                  HANK
                    Well, I d be lying if I said I 
                    never wondered what it would be 
                    like to bang a Scientologist.

      A beat.  And then she jumps his bones.


      Where Hank teases an uber-enthused Sonja from behind.

                                  SONJA
                    Come on... just put it in...

                                  HANK
                    I don t think Tom and Katie would 
                    approve of your behavior right now.

                                  SONJA
                    Oh shut the fuck up already...

                                  HANK
                    Are you clear yet?

                                  SONJA
                    Shut up and fuck me!

                                  HANK
                    You are one kinky thetan.

      As Hank accommodates her, Sonja s ardor grows...  and 
      grows... until finally... after a particularly forceful 
      series of thrusts from Hank... she BUCKS against him... and 
      BRONCOS him...

      In the process, Hank is thrown backward, against the wall.  
      Taking down the absurdly modern painting that hangs there.







                                                                              (CONTINUED)        CALIFORNICATION EP102  FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07      28.

      Off the bed he falls, SMASHING his head against the edge of 
      the night stand on the way down.  Landing on the floor like a 
      sack of grain.

                                  SONJA
                    Oh my God -- are you okay?!

      A beat later, Hank staggers to his feet.  He touches his 
      head, comes away with bloody fingers.  He sees the painting.  
      Tries to put it back up on the wall.

      Getting blood all over it in the process.

      Suddenly, he s not feeling so good.  The combination of pot, 
      Percocet and single malt Scotch whisky is taking its toll.

      A moment later, he VOMITS all over the painting.

      And that s precisely when Karen, Bill, Charlie and Marcy all 
      pile into the room, drawn by the commotion.

      A horribly embarrassing moment as Hank stands there -- naked, 
      bloody and dazed.  Suddenly feeling vulnerable, Hank picks up 
      the painting and holds it in front of his genitalia.

                                  HANK
                    It s all good...


      Hank drives along the coast...

                                  HANK (V.O.)
                    As a boy, I was obsessed with 
                    girls.  All I wanted was 
                      everything.  To kiss them, taste 
                    them, smell them... but most of 
                    all... to understand them...


      In a darkened room, Karen kisses a sleeping Becca...

                                  HANK (V.O.)
                    As an adult, these girls... these 
                    amazing creatures... they remain a 
                      mystery...


      A pajama-clad Mia reads in bed -- God Hates Us All by Hank 
      Moody.  Finally, she puts the book down, slips her hand into 
      her bottoms and begins to masturbate...

                                  HANK (V.O.)
                    All I know for sure is that they 
                    become women...


      Hank reclines in the Porsche, looking up the sky, the top 
      down, parked somewhere near LAX.

      He feels a hand on his thigh.  Looks:  Karen is next to him.  

      She mouths something... something that sounds like...

                                  KAREN
                    I love you...

      But he can barely hear her...

      A MAGNIFICENT ROAR as A PLANE FLIES LOW OVERHEAD...

      Coming in for a landing...

      Hank watches for a moment.  Looks back.  Karen is gone.

                                  HANK (V.O.)
                    They say this is the City of 
                    Angels... but all I see are broken 
                    wings...

                                                                    OVER AND OUT:
