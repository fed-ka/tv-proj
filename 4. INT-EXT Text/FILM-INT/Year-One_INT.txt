The rude dwelling has a stark, somber, almost Amish feeling
to it. Zed and Oh sit at the table sharing a simple meal
youngest
with Adam, Cain and his
Adam's wife EVE and h
them, Lilith's tunic gaping open to reveal her breasts every
time she leans over to put something on the table. Zed and
Oh can't take their eyes off her.
ADAM
(to Cain)
Where is thy brother, Abel?
CAIN
(badly overplaying)
Abel? Haven't seen him. I thought
he was with you.
(to Zed and Oh)
You guys see him?
They shake their heads and cough nervously.
ZED AND OH
(equally unconvincing)
Nape. Not that I remember. Never
seen anybody-- anywhere-- anytime --
ever.
ADAM
(to Cain)
Your sister Lilith said she saw him
in the field with you.
CAIN
I think that was yesterday.
ADAM
No, this day. She said you both
made offerings.
CAIN
That might've been Boaz---
ADAM
No, you and Abel. She said it
looked like you were arguing.
CAIN
Hey, we're brothers, we argue
sometimes- it's not that big a
deal.

ADAM
And his flock was untended in the
PASTURE--
CAIN
(EXPLODES)
Okay! What am I-- his keeper? Get
off my back, will you?
He smashes his plate against the wall and storms out. An
awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks.
ADAM
I fear the worst for Abel. I am
sorely vexed.
ZED
Yeah, that's got to be pretty
vexing.
A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly
on his sorry circumstances.
ADAM
For my sin the ground is cursed.
Thorns and thistles does it sprout
for us, and we are doomed to toil
all the days of our lives. For as
the Lord has commanded, by the
sweat of your brow shall you get
bread to eat until you return to
the ground from which you were
taken. For dust you are, and to
dust shall you return.
ZED
Wow. That's kind of a downer isn't
it?
ADAM
It's the way of the world.
ZED
Boy, I hope not.
ADAM
(rises abruptly)
You are welcome to stay the night
and lay with my daughter Lilith.
Zed looks at the luscious Lilith, then back at Adam.
Official White

ZED
I'm waiting for the punchline.
ADAM
She is without a husband, and as
the Lord has said, thou shalt be
fruitful and multiply.
Lilith nods demurely and exits through a curtain. Zed starts
to follow her out.
OH
Hey! What about me?
ADAM
You may share the bed of my son
Seth.
ZED
Yeah, there you go.
(he exits)
Oh looks at Seth.
SETH
I multiplied with a sheep.
(Oh just stares at him)
My thingie smells like lamb chops.

Zed enters the room. Lilith reclines on a cot with a straw
mattress.
LILITH
(making room on the cot)
My bed is small but you're welcome
to share it. It's the way of my
people.
ZED
(lying down beside her)
And that's a good way to be. In
fact, I'm kind of surprised a
pretty girl like you is sleeping
alone anyway. I would've thought
guys would be lined up at the door.
LILITH
I don't like men.
Official White

ZED
(moving closer)
Maybe you just haven't met the
right one.
LILITH
I like girls.
ZED
(SUAVE)
So we have that in common--
LILITH
(stares at him for a beat)
I'm attracted to women.
ZED
(a beat)
I don't even know what that means.
What does that mean?
LILITH
I like to have sex with other
women.
ZED
(stares at her for a long
MOMENT)
I'm really not getting this.
Lilith shakes her head, turns away from him, and pulls up her
blanket. Zed shrugs and rolls over to sleep. They lie there
quietly in the dark for a long beat. Then--
Zed
(cont'd)
You're kidding! Whoa! That's
amazing!

Oh is lying next to Seth, wide-awake, trying to stay as far
away from him as possible.
SETH
Oooh, listen to this one.
Seth lifts his knees to his chest and farts a surprisingly

The spacious tent is lit by torches, and a feast is in
progress. TWENTY OR THIRTY BEARDED MEN in skullcaps and long
robes lounge on cushions or sit cross-legged in a circle on
the carpeted floor.
An EGYPTIAN BELLY DANCER shakes her hips for the pleasure of
Abraham who occupies the place of honor.
Zed and oh, now also wearing robes and skullcaps, are sitting
right beside him eating and drinking everything in sight.
Isaac sits beside them.
ABRAHAM claps his hands for attention. Zed and Oh look up as
the music stops.
ABRAHAM
(to the assembly)
My brothers, let us give thanks
unto God for staying my hand on the
mountain this day.
ISAAC

Best dad in all the land, everyone!

Praise be to God, hallowed be His

Abraham looks at them.
ABRAHAM
Friends, whence comest thou?
Zed and Oh look at each other blankly.
ISAAC
(HELPFULLY)
He wants to know where you're from.
ABRAHAM
(SUSPICIOUS)
Thou comest not from the cities of
the plain? From Sodom or Gomorrah?
Zed perks up at the mention of Sodom, recalling the
destination of the soldiers who took Maya and the others.
ZED
Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been
there. But I've heard of them.
OH
Are they nice?
ABRAHAM
The Lord has cursed them for their
abomination.
ZED
(nods gravely)
i didn't know that. What kind of
abomination are we talking about?
ABRAHAM
They bow down before false Gods and
worship graven images.
Official White

ZED
(clicks his tongue)
Abominable.
ABRAHAM
The men of the city are weak and
soft, fat with rich food,
intoxicated by strong drink.
ZED
(sounds good to him)
Really. Tell me more.
ABRAHAM
Their women are whores; their
shameless lust knows no bounds.
They flaunt their flesh without
shame and any man may have
knowledge of them.
OH
(he's sold)
And where exactly are those cities?
ZED
(off Abraham's stern look)
We just want to know so we can
avoid them.
ABRAHAM
(FIERCELY)
Walk not the path of Sodom! For
surely will the Lord send his holy
fire to destroy the city and all
who dwell within, to smite them and
all their seed for their iniquity.
ZED
(CONCERNED)
When do you think all this smiting
is going to go down? We may have
some friends there.

new arrivals.
FIRST GUARD
What's this now?
SENTRY
They were banging on the gate.
Hebrews, from the look of them.
ZED
We're not really Hebrews--
The guard smacks him in the mouth.
ZED

Okay. Lesson learned. No talking.
SENTRY
Should we wake the Sergeant?
FIRST GUARD
You don't want to do that. He gets
pretty mean when you wake him.
OH
Meaner than this?
The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly.
The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look
nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.

SERGEANT
(from behind the door,
ROARS)
BLOODY HELL! WHAT'S GOING ON OUT
THERE!
Zed and Oh exchange worried looks. Then the door flies open
and the SERGEANT, a huge, angry, sadistic rhino of a man,
fills the door frame.
SERGEANT
(cont'd)
Who the hell screamed?
They all point at Oh.
SERGEANT

(glowers at him)
I thought it was a woman.
He lumbers over and gets his face very close to Oh's.
SERGEANT
(cont'd)
You don't look like a woman, but
maybe you want to kiss me anyway.
Is that right? You want to kiss
me?
Oh turns away from his foul breath.
The sergeant grabs Oh by the throat and practically lifts him
off the ground.
SERGEANT
(cont'd)
By morning you'll be sorry you were
born.
OH
Don't have to wait 'til morning.
ZED
Hey! Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?
The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed.
ZED
(cont'd)
(quickly backpedaling)
Which would be difficult since
there are probably very few people
around who actually are your size--
He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head.

SERGEANT
(to another guard)
Get my big stick. I'll deal with
the fat one first.
ZED

Relatively fat one. I wouldn't be
talking about fat, if I were you.
Another blow from the sergeant.
ZED
(cont'd)
Right. Enough said.
The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then
steps up behind Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a
lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes.
SERGEANT
(to Zed and Oh)
Welcome to Sodom.
As he takes a big backswing, Zed and Oh shut their eyes and
prepare for the worst.
VOICE

Stop!
Zed and Oh turn to see Cain at the door, dressed like the
other guards in breastplate and helmet.

Oh is led away by the Eunuch as she takes Zed off in the
opposite direction.

I should look into that. How do
you get to be a eunuch?

The High Priest, an extremely vain, officious, and fussy man,
still over-dressed in sacramental drag, pushes back his
sleeves and starts examining the entrails as the King and his
MINISTERS look on, deeply concerned.
KING
Six sacrifices in the last ten days
and still no rain. What do the
entrails predict?
Official White

HIGH PRIEST
(nervously poking at the
sheep heart)
Well, the liver is streaked with
gray-- that's not a favorable sign--
but the heart looks good. See how
nice and red it is here. That's
always a good omen.
KING
What does it mean?
HIGH PRIEST
Usually it means that the sheep
took very good care of itself,
probably sticking to a high-fiber
diet of grass and hay.
KING
What does it mean for us?
HIGH PRIEST
Well, it could mean either a
surprise visit from a former friend
or sweetheart-- or that you're
going on a long sea voyage!
Wouldn't that be fun?
KING
(SCORNFUL)
How did you become High Priest?
HIGH PRIEST
Because I'm your brother?
PRIME MINISTER
Perhaps it's time for a new High
Priest.
HIGH PRIEST

Perhaps it's not time for a new

He dramatically flings his fingers out at the Prime Minister,

It's the will of the Gods.
The Queen and Princess Inanna are lounging on cushioned

yourself.
She walks off before he can answer.
Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS
walking past a row of "LIVING STATUES," semi-nude men and
women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint,
frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful
bodies.
Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude "GODDESS", then
furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess
slaps his hand, then resumes her pose.

mock humping, and waving his hands in their faces trying to

Amazing!
He comes to the LAST STATUE and does a double-take. This one
is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like
someone waiting for a bus. He is also painted gold, but
unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round
shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long,
shifting his weight uncomfortably and looking around in
obvious embarrassment.

ZED
Yeah, you look so-- gold. How's it
going?
OH
How's it going? I just had my
whole body painted by a fat guy
with no balls, and believe me, he
was very thorough, if you know what
I mean. How's it going with you?
ZED
Not bad. Had a little rub and a
scrub, now I'm up for some grub.
OH
That sounds nice-- for you.
ZED
Hey! You'll never guess who's here-

sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of
food.

There's Eema!
Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a
household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who
take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to
pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm.
SARGON
Stand still, wench! I want to see
what's under that skirt.
As he starts to lift her hem, she drops the whole tray of
food on him. His cohorts laugh.
EEMA
I'm sorry! It was an accident.
SARGON
That was no accident!
Sargon grabs her and raises his hand to hit her.
Zed steps in quickly.

I told you to fetch me more wine!
Apologize to this officer--- now!

evil, but now that I look around
I'm thinking maybe it's not all
bad. There's a lot to learn here.

No! Like the wheel, for instance!
That's pretty awesome-- the way it

I'm not really a slave. I'm a

anyone else to enter.
ZED
Then why am I going in?
INANNA
(IMPATIENT)
Because you were chosen? If the
Gods wanted you dead they would
have killed you already.
ZED
RIGHT--
INANNA
This is what you've been chosen
for! To speak to the Gods and
plead with them not to destroy the
city. Then come back out and tell
me what it's like inside.
Official White

ZED
(mulling it over)
Right-- right. Then again, if the
rules say--
INANNA
Do you always follow the rules?
ZED
What is it with chicks always
wanting guys to break the rules?
You-all have this bad boy complex----
She kisses him fiercely on the lips.
INANNA
Do this for me.
ZED
I'm going in.
He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the
columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of moonlight
reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.

Zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates
himself, face down on the floor, arms outstretched in
supplication. He lies there with his eyes tightly shut,
expecting to be vaporized any second. A long moment passes
in total silence. Then he opens his eyes and looks around
tentatively.
The inner chamber of the Holy of Holies is a bare room with
marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights
above.
ZED
(takes a deep breath and
starts improvising)
Thank you, O-- Merciful ones, for--
not like-- killing me, and letting
me receive the, uh, blessing of
your holy-- godliness.
He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine
response. Nothing comes.

ZED
(cont'd)
(props himself up on his
ELBOWS)
Okay, I don't know the right words--
so I'm just going to say what I
have to say-- if that's all right.
(waits for a response,
gets none, proceeds)
I know I haven't always done the
right thing. Eating the fruit was
bad, I know that-- and the Cain
thing-- and I have done somethings
with women-- I do love the ladies--
well, you probably know all that
because you're watching everything--
(a thought occurs)
Do you really watch everything?
That's got to be a little
disgusting sometimes-- but probably
pretty hot, too--
(QUICKLY)
Not that you would get off on any
of it-- okay, I'm getting off the
subject. Anyways, the word is
you've been considering destroying
this place. So I'm asking you not
to-- as a personal favor.
(NOTHING)
Feel free to jump in anytime. I
could use a little guidance here.
Still no response. He rolls over onto his back.
ZED
(cont'd)
Look, I know you think this place
is evil and it kinda is-- I see
that-- but that's not everybody.
There are a lot of good people,
too. So what if there were, like,
fifty really good people? Would
you still destroy the city?
(SILENCE)
Okay, you're right, that may be a
reach. How about twenty? I could
probably get you twenty extremely
good people if I really looked
around.
(SILENCE)
How about five? Five awesome
people-- including myself. I
personally know at least five
people worth saving. Does that
sound good?

ZED
(cont'd)
(NOTHING)
Hello? A little help? Am I
getting warm here? Okay, is it me?
Are you punishing me for stuff I
did?
(an insight)
Or setting me up for what I need to
do. Or both! Or neither?
(NOTHING)
Could you give me some kind of a
sign-- please-- anything?
Zed listens but hears only a profound silence. Then a
revelation. He sits up on the floor.
ZED
(cont'd)
Okay, wait. Is that the sign? The
silence? Is that it?
(waits for confirmation)
It is, isn't it! Just this really
silent-- silence.
(PONDERING)
You're not going to tell me what to
do; it's up to me to decide what's
right and what's wrong-- right? Is
that it? You're not going to speak
to me-- you're going to speak
through me? If that's right, don't
say anything.
(listens for a beat)
Okay, I read you loud and clear.
Thank you.
(an afterthought)
Oh, and if things don't work out
with Maya would it be okay with you
if me and the Princess had a little
"carnal knowledge"? Not in an evil
way or anything--
(he listens; silence)
Okay! You're right, probably not a
good idea. Thank you.
He backs out of the Holy of Holies, bowing all the way.

The doors to the Holy of Holies opens and Zed comes backing
out, still bowing and muttering. Then he turns and his face
falls.
Official White
99.
The High Priest, the King, the Queen, and a dozen Temple
Acolytes are staring at him in amazement. Oh stands beside
the High Priest dressed just like him.
ZED
I was just looking for the
bathroom.
INANNA
(INNOCENTLY)
I told him not to go in.
HIGH PRIEST
(SHRIEKS)
Seize them!
OH
(scared, points at Zed)
Seize him!
The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up and takes hold of Zed.
CAIN
(SMIRKING)
Should've invited me to the party.
CUT TO:

In the dim torchlight, we see Zed hanging spread-eagle five
feet off the ground, his arms and legs stretched out wide and
tightly bound to iron rings imbedded in the stone.
Oh is shackled to the wall beside him, hanging upside down.
They hear the faint scream of a man being tortured somewhere
deep in the prison.
ZED
I wish I was upside down. Looks
fun.
Oh won't talk to him.
ZED
(cont'd)
So this is it? We're not friends
anymore? After all I've done for
you?
Official White
100.
OH
What have you done for me? I've
been attacked by a cougar, I've
fallen down a mountain, I almost
had the tip of my thingy cut off,
I've been greasing up the High
Priest all night, and now I'm
hanging upside down in a dungeon.
And I have to pee real bad. All
because of you. You call yourself
a friend? Name one good thing
you've done for me.
ZED
I've helped you come out of your
shell.
OH
(in distress)
I really have to pee--
ZED
Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and
I may have made a few wrong turns,
but you have to understand-- I'm a
chosen. That's a lot of
responsibility -- you can't even
imagine.
OH
(ANGRY)
The only one who thinks you're
chosen is you, so shut up already!
ZED
(STUNG)
Okay, be mad, but I'm going to get
us out of here, if it's the last
thing I do.
Zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no avail.
ZED
(cont'd)
That was just my first idea-- and
I'm also accepting ideas.
OH
(SHOUTS)
Guard! I have to pee! Now!
Seriously!
(can't hold it anymore)
Oh, no--
Official White
101.
Because he's upside down, the streams runs down his stomach,
over his chest, down his neck, onto his chin and over his
face.
OH
(cont'd)
I hate you.
