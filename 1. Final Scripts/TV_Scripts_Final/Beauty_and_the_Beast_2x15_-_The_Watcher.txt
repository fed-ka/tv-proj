                                      ACT ONE


FADE IN:


DISSOLVE VARIOUS IMAGES of the City on a spring night, each one full of
people, full of twinkling lights: crowds strolling under the electric
billboards of Times Square...a yacht alive with music, noise, and partygoers
...crowds exiting Lincoln Center, the rich and famous moving to the queue of
limosines at the curb... crowds spilling out of a Broadway theater...cars and
buses playing bumper cars on Central Park West, past Tavern on the Green. GO
IN ON the Tavern wrapped in its light-strewn trees, like a storybook ice
palace glimmering in the night...

                                                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

...a magical, sweeping view of Central Park West and the lights beyond,
twinkling against a night sky (MATTE). SLOWLY GO IN amongst the tens of
thousands of tiny lights until we find...

CATHY S BALCONY

Cathy and Vincent there talking, a stolen moment. The night air chills Cathy.
She looks inside the apartment. The soft glow of a dancing FIRE in the
fireplace spills across the living room.

                                CATHY
        ...It s warm by the fire...

Vincent follows Cathy s look through the open doors and the breeze-swept
gossamer curtains. Then he takes his cloak off and drapes it around her
shoulders, Cathy accepting
It...end of discussion.

                                VINCENT
        ...You don t press me.

                                CATHY
                  (a little smile)
        ...I haven t pressed you yet.

                                VINCENT
        It s your world. I don t belong
        there.

Inside the apartment, the PHONE RINGS. After TWO RINGS, the ANSWERING MACHINE
in the living room picks up.


                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                          3.

        Why are you awake?

                                CATHY
        Jenny, go back to sleep.

                                                      CUT TO:


INT. THE WATCHER S APARTMENT SIMULTANEOUS POV - CATHY S BALCONY (FULL FRAME)

as seen through a telescope from a balcony vantage point somewhere across the
park. Cathy hangs up her phone and heads back towards Vincent. THE IMAGE
MOMENTARILY BLURS, as focus is adjusted, then SHARPENS AGAIN.

ANOTHER ANGLE " THE WATCHER S HAND

reaches for a phone setting near a high-powered telescope. He is
unidentifiable except for a high-tech, multi-function black WRISTWATCH. The
WRISTWATCH S ALARM BEEPS TWICE. He starts to dial a number (555-8291). His
attention goes back to the telescope.

POV - CATHY S BALCONY (FULL FRAME)

as seen through the telescope. Cathy reacts to her phone ringing again, goes
to answer it.

TELESCOPE POV FOLLOWS CATHY. FOCUS is adjusted to a sharp MEDIUM-SHOT - CATHY

veiled by gently billowing gossamer curtains.

                                CATHY S VOICE
                    (filtered/expecting
                  Jenny)
        Hello?

                                WATCHER
        Cathy?

                                CATHY S VOICE
                  (filtered)
        Yes?

                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                          4.

CONTINUED:

A pause, then...

                                WATCHER
        I can see you.

Not fully believing, Cathy does look towards the french doors (and therefore
the telescope).

                                WATCHER
        Hi.

A chill down Cathy s spine. Her glance shoots towards Vincent. The Watcher
lets her squirm an extra second.

                                WATCHER
        Yeah, I can see him too.

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:


INT. CATHY S LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Cathy hangs the phone up as if it s on fire, switches the LAMP OFF and is
instantly on the balcony.

EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

Her tone urgent, violated...

                                CATHY

        Get off the balcony.

                                VINCENT

        What s wrong?

                                CATHY

        Someone s watching. Go!

Vincent, immediately alert, steps back into the shadows, his eyes darting
across the cityscape.

                                CATHY
        I ll meet you downstairs.

He doesn t move.

                                CATHY
        Vincent, please go!

Their eyes lock. Finally he moves to exit. Cathy watches for a split second
then heads back into her apartment.
GO WITH CATHY.                                                                          5.


INT. CATHY S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Cathy pulls the drapes in the dining room then moves through her dark
apartment to pull the drapes in the bedroom. She grabs her keys. The PHONE
RINGS as she is headed for the door. She waits. After TWO RINGS, the
ANSWERING MACHINE picks up.

                                CATHY S VOICE
                  (on machine)
        You have reached 555-8291. Please
        leave a message after the beep.

BEEP.
                                WATCHER S VOICE
                  (on machine)
        Open the drapes.

Cathy hesitates only a second, thinking  the hell with you,  then exits. STAY
ON THE DOOR as we hear her LOCKING IT O.C. then immediately UNLOCKING IT. She
sticks her hand back in and FLIPS ON THE LIGHT, pulls the door shut, LOCKS
it.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THRESHOLD - CATHY S SUB-BASEMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Cathy is pacing, Vincent contemplative, their sense of safety shattered.

                                CATHY
        There was a call on my machine yesterday, but I didn t think
        anything of it. I thought it was just a prank call.
                  (a beat)
        What are we going to do?

                                VINCENT
        Nothing in what he s said, the sound of his voice...seem
        familiar?

Cathy shakes her head.

                                CATHY

        No.

                                VINCENT
        A noise in the background?

                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                              6.

CONTINUED:

                                CATHY
                    (tries to replay the
                    calls in her head)
            ...I don t think so.
                                      (a beat)
            There are ten million lights outside that balcony; he could
            be behind any one of them...

                                VINCENT
            What would you normally do?

                                CATHY
            It s departmental policy to turn
            it over to the police.

                                VINCENT
            ...Then do it.

                                CATHY
            Vincent, we don t know what he
            has, we can t take that chance.

A beat. For Vincent, a sad truth.

                                VINCENT
            Who would believe him?

So much goes unsaid as Cathy looks at Vincent, feels his shame, wishing
she could sheathe him from it. Finally, she goes to him, gently touching
him.

                                CATHY
            Don t...

A long, pensive beat...

                                VINCENT
            ...It was wrong of me to ever come
            to your balcony.

Cathy looks at him sharply,  no  in her eyes.

                                CATHY
            Do you think I ve been wrong every
            time I ve wanted you there?
                    (a beat/needing to
                        convince him)
            Vincent, it s the one part of
            my world that belongs to us .. it s
            ours.


                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                7.

CONTINUED: (2)

                                VINCENT
            ...And because we ve shared it,
            you may now be in danger.

                                CATHY
                    (snapping)
              I might have been in danger
              anyway!

                                VINCENT
            And you would have gone to the
              police!

Cathy cannot deny that. After a moment...

                                CATHY
            Don t worry about me.

INT. D.A. S OFFICE

CLOSE ON - CATHY

sitting at her desk, oblivious to everyone and everything going on around
her. There s a legal pad in front of her where she s penciled various notes.
She is wearing a set of mini-earphones which are plugged into a small
cassette player. She has been repeatedly listening to a phone message from an
answering machine tape, trying to hear something she s missed, to recognize
the voice, identify a background noise... something...

                      WATCHER S VOICE (CONT.)
                (on audio tape)
        ...don t wear it that way again.

SOUND: ANSWERING MACHINE BEEP.

WE HEAR Cathy REWIND THE CASSETTE TAPE.

She glances at the recorder counter, presses the  play  button.

SOUND: DEAD AIR then ANSWERING MACHINE BEEP.

TIGHT ON CATHY

Just now, Cathy is startled by a man s hand suddenly rapping sharply on
her desk top. She looks up and sees JOE in front of her as she quickly
turns off the cassette player and takes off the earphones, fighting the
urge to wad up her page of notes. Joe is wearing an overcoat, carrying
his briefcase, and holding a half-inch thick computer print-out.

                                JOE
           Forget something this morning,
            Radcliffe?
                    (off Cathy s blank look)
            Brian Crater? His deposition...?

A missed appointment registers with Cathy, her heart sinking.

                                CATHY
           I m sorry.

                                JOE
           It s okay, I got it.
                    (handing her print-out)
            Dave caught me on the way by.
            This is for you.

Cathy knows what it is. She hopes Joe hasn t noticed.

                                CATHY
              Thanks.

                                JOE
            Look, is something going on here
            I should know about?

                                CATHY
           No. Why?

                                JOE
            Because you missed a deposition,
                    (re: print-out)
          and you requested a status list
          on all your prior cases.

Behind Joe, JENNY ARONSON has come up and stopped several feet away, not
wishing to intrude. Cathy notices her. Jenny gives a casual  hi, there  wave.

As Cathy comes around desk to give Jenny a hug...

        What are you doing here?

                                JENNY
          Surprising you and taking you to
        lunch, I hope.

                                CATHY
                (glancing at watch)
        Is it---
                  ( lunchtime /it s not)
        It s eleven o clock.

                                JENNY
        I m hungry.

                                CATHY
        You re always hungry.
                (to Joe)
        You want to go over that
          deposition right now?

                                JOE
        No, it can wait---

                                CATHY
                (to Jenny)
        ---Then we re on---

Cathy puts the tape and tablet in her purse, grabs her jacket.

            I order those to keep my files
            up-to-date, but you re cute when
            you re worried.

                                JENNY
          Why are you worried?

EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE OUTDOOR CAFE - NOON RUSH

Cathy and Jenny are seated at a table, in mid-conversation.
Jenny keeps stalling on telling about her bad dream.
Cathy s interest is piqued, but deep down she s also a
 little afraid.

                                CATHY
          You were asleep. You were
            dreaming. And you saw...?

                                JENNY
          ...I feel like I m putting a curse
          on you.

                                CATHY
          I m going to throw something on
          you if you don t tell me about
          this dream.

Jenny still hesitates, thinking  this is serious... 

                                CATHY
          Come on, not all of your bad
            dreams come true.
                  (a beat)
          Like the polka-dotted guys from
            Mars? That hasn t happened yet.

                                JENNY
                  (a warm smile)
          You remember that?

                                CATHY
            Yeah. Come on, what was this one?

Finally, a deep breath...

                                JENNY
            Okay. It was one of those weird,
            quick, flash dreams. You were---
              I don t know where you were --
            you were somewhere, and all of
              a sudden, the lights went out,
            and you were in the dark, and you
            wanted to move but you couldn t,
            and there was this--- this hand,
            but it wasn t connected to anything,
            and it was trying to touch you.

                                CATHY
              Uh-huh...

                                JENNY
            You tried to scream, but you
              couldn t.

                                CATHY
            Okay, wait, wait -- see right
            there -- that s not going to
              happen. A severed hand s coming
            at me, I m gonna scream.
            Guaranteed -- I will scream.
            So what happened next?

                                JENNY
            Well, then I see you running --
            you know how dreams are, they
a don t make sense -- so now you re
            running---

                                CATHY
                    (without a smile)
            Is the hand still after me?

                                JENNY
                  (genuinely although
                  subtly trying to warn
                  Cathy)
            I don t know, Cath, but listen, you re running.
            I don t know if you were running from someone,
            or maybe to someone... I don t know.
            But you can t catch your breath... you can t breathe.

A beat. Jenny edits.

                                JENNY
          And then I woke up. And I guess
          I needed to hear the sound of your
            voice, so I called you.

Cathy can t help but think of the Watcher. Of f her look...

                                JENNY
          What?

                                CATHY
                (still absorbed)
          ...It s just so weird that you
          have these things...

                                JENNY
          Why?

                                CATHY
          About a minute after you called,
          I got another call from some guy.

                                JENNY
          Who?

                                CATHY
          I don t know -- I don t know him,
          but he said something that scared me.

                                JENNY

          What did he say?

                                CATHY
          It s not important. But if I ever
          find out who he is, I m going to strangle him,
          and that ll be the end of your dream.

Jenny has reacted to the word  strangle  with wide-eyed alarm.

                                JENNY
          Oh, my god, I can t believe you
          said that.

                                CATHY
          Why?

                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                          14.

                                JENNY
        Because that s what I saw. You
        couldn t breathe because something
        was around your neck. You were
        trying to pull it off, but you couldn t.
        You were being strangled.
                (a beat)
        You died Cathy.

As they look at each other...

                                FATHER
        We don t know that she is in
        danger. If she is, then we ll
        find a way to protect her. We ll send John,
        or Pascal, one of the helpers---

        I don t want Catherine frightened.

        Then why are you here -- to ask
        my permission to let you be
        trapped and killed, or worse?

                    She won t ask for help because

           You re starting to feel me with you,
            aren t you? Could you feel me
          in your room last night?
          ...I was there. 

ON CATHY S REACTION...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:                                                                            21.

INT. JOE S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Cathy knocks on the door.

                          CATHY
          Do you have a second?

                          JOE
          Sure.

Cathy enters.

                          JOE
            What s up?

                          CATHY
          If--- Let s say someone calls
          you in the middle of the night...
                    (couple of edited
                    thoughts)
            ...and they hang up. How would
          you go about finding that person?

                          JOE
          Well, what did that person say?

                          CATHY
          Nothing really. I just want to
          find him.

                          JOE
                  (a beat then)
          You know what departmental
        procedure is regarding---

                          CATHY
          ---I don t want the police involved.

For a second Joe is thrown by this.

                          JOE
          Have you called the phone company?

                          CATHY
          Yeah, they said--- actually they said
          this summer there s going to be
          some new things on the market,
          but right now I m on my own.
            Unless I want to change my number.

                          JOE
            That s a possibility---

                          JOE
          ...What about a tap?

                          CATHY
                  (no police)
          No.

                          JOE
          Tracing unit?

                          CATHY
          I ve ordered one. It s going
          to be put in tomorrow, but I don t know
          if he ll stay on the line long enough.

A beat.

                          JOE
          Does this have anything to do
          with you ordering that list of your prior cases?

                          CATHY
            I don t think it s a prior case.

                          JOE
          Is he threatening you?

Cathy hesitates in answering...and that s Joe s answer.

                          JOE

            What s this guy saying?

                          CATHY
            Nothing.
                  (off Joe s unconvinced
                  look)
            Benign things.

                          JOE
          Like what?

                          CATHY
          Like benign things.

                          JOE
          Like give me an example.

                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                              23.

CONTINUED: (2)

                            CATHY
            Like he likes my sweater, hates
            my hair, I don t know.

Joe reacts by holding the phone receiver out to her.

                            JOE
            Call the cops.

                            CATHY
            Why?
                                        JOE
                    (checking rolodex)
              Because he s watching you.

Joe is dialing a number, still holding receiver out. Cathy is immediately
there to block the dialing.

                            CATHY
            No.

                            JOE
            Cathy, call Mike Cohen.

                            CATHY
            I don t want to overreact.
            People like this fantasize,
            but deep down they don t have any guts.

                            JOE
            Usually. You want me to pull some files
            with some not so pretty pictures?
            You don t fool around with creeps like this.

                            CATHY 
              Please.

Joe returns the phone receiver to the cradle.

                            JOE
              ...What does this guy have on you?

                            CATHY
            ...My phone number and my address.

Joe is well-aware he s not getting the full story. A beat.

                            JOE
            Where are you keeping your gun?

Carry it in your purse.

                          CATHY
            All right.

On Cathy s subtle relief that Joe is showing support...

EXT. CATHY S ROOFTOP - THAT EVENING

His head hidden by his hood, Vincent casts an ominous dark figure against
the backdrop of city lights. He is surveying the buildings across the park
with an antique brass telescope when he turns at the sound of SOMEONE
APPROACHING via the stairwell. The door CREAKS as it opens.

CATHY

emerges from the stairwell which is located so Vincent cannot immediately
see her. She takes a moment to steel herself, to psyche herself into an
act...she hopes.

ANOTHER ANGLE -

Cathy comes up alongside Vincent.

                          VINCENT
            What s happened today?

                          CATHY
          Nothing.

Vincent looks at her.

                          VINCENT
          What happened?

                          CATHY
          I got paranoid, but I m fine now.

CONTINUED:

                          VINCENT
          Did this man contact you?

                          CATHY
          ...He sent me flowers.

                          VINCENT
                    (having felt her panic)
          It was more than just flowers.

                          CATHY
          But I handled it. Alone.
          He knows about you, Vincent.
          Until we find out what he wants,
          you have to stay away.

Vincent looks at Cathy, finally walks away...

                          VINCENT
          He wants you.

Cathy comes up to him.

                          CATHY
          What can I say -- or do -- to
          convince you?

                          VINCENT
            Catherine, I feel your fear. How
          can I leave you alone with that?

                          CATHY
          Because I can handle fear, Vincent
          -- but if something were to happen to you...

A beat.

                          VINCENT
          Stay below tonight.

                          CATHY
          I m not going to let him do that
          to me. And it gets us nowhere.

Momentarily, Vincent walks away, his eyes back on the cityscape. As Cathy
watches him...

INT. CATHY S APARTMENT - SAME EVENING

Cathy exits the elevator and goes to her apartment, unlocks the door.                                                                                      26.

INT. CATHY S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

    Cathy reaches in, SWITCHES ON THE LIGHT, enters. She locks the door
    behind her, including the chain, glances around, throws her stuff
    down, seeing the ANSWERING MACHINE blinking (one call). She
      tentatively REWINDS THE TAPE, switches to  play. 

WATCHER S VOICE
                            (on machine)
                    Why aren t you there?
                              (pause/anger deep)
                    You re with him, aren t you?
                            (pause)
                    Of course, you re with him. Why
                    do I even ask?
                              (pause/firmer)
                    Whore.

                            softening, like a hurt
                            husband)
                    No more. Okay, Cathy -- no more?

    DEAD AIR THEN ANSWERING MACHINE BEEP.

    Cathy SWITCHES OFF the machine, ends up going to the balcony doors.
    She SWITCHES OFF THE LIVING ROOM LIGHT at a nearby switch, opens the
    drapes, and unlocks that door.

    EXT. CATHY S BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

    Cathy steps out onto the balcony. CAMERA WATCHES FROM TEE REAR as
    she moves to the railing to look out across the city. BEGIN SLOW
    CRANE AROUND -- we half-expect the CAMERA at any moment to reveal
    someone in the shadows behind Cathy. HOLD ON CATHY S FACE as she
    looks out across the thousands of pin-prick lights, knowing one
    of them could be the Watcher, wondering which one.

    INT. CATHY S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

    CATHY S SILHOUETTE

    on the balcony against the thousands of lights, the gossamer
      curtains blowing gently in the night breeze. Cathy turns and
      reenters the apartment, locking the balcony door behind her, pulling
    the drapes. She does not switch on the living room light. As she
    heads towards the bedroom, she starts to undo her clothes.                                                                            27.

POV FROM INSIDE CATHY S CLOSET - CATHY

enters the bedroom, flipping THE LIGHT ON, still undoing her clothes. We
see her through the closet louvers. She takes off her shirt, hangs it
casually on the closet knob, and heads for the bathroom.

INT. CATHY S BATHROOM . MINUTES LATER

CATHY

is taking a shower. Suddenly, behind the almost-closed bathroom door, she
sees the LIGHT IN THE BEDROOM GO OUT. CLOSE ON - CATHY S FACE

reacting, for a moment paralyzed.

Cathy thinks to look for a weapon.

CATHY S POV - THE BATHROOM

her eyes searching for a weapon...the BLOW DRYER...SOAP
...PERFUME...NAIL FILE... Her eyes lock on the CAN OF HAIR SPRAY.

CATHY

quietly opens the shower door, reaches for a towel.

TIGHT ON - CATHY S HAND

struggling to reach the towel that is a little beyond reach. She grasps
it.

INT. CATHY S BATHROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

CATHY

pulls the towel around her as she steps out of the shower. She steps
softly, cautiously over to pick up the can of hair spray. She turns off
the shower water. She steels herself, opens the bathroom door, prepared
for the Watcher to be standing in the doorway. No one is there. She enters
the dark bedroom, ready for the Watcher to be on either side of the
doorway.


INT. CATHY S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

No one is there. Now, he could be anywhere. The closet door, closed
earlier, is now open. The drapes are open. She makes her way to the
nightstand, keeping her eyes on the room, the shadows, even as she slides
the drawer open. She reaches in, glances down for the gun.

POV - NIGHTSTAND DRAWER

The gun is not there.

FADE IN:


INT. CATHY S BEDROOM - DIRECT PICK-UP

CATHY

is at the nightstand. Her hand trembles as she reaches to turn on the
BEDSIDE LAMP, her eyes constantly scanning the bedroom. She SWITCHES ON
THE LAMP.


CATHY S POV - THE BEDROOM


No one else appears to be in there.


CATHY

suddenly hears A SLIGHT SOUND from the direction of the dark living room.

Her head turns sharply in reaction.

INT. CATHY S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cathy moves from the bedroom into the living room, her eyes scanning the
room.

CATHY S POV - LIVING ROOM

The drapes ar- - -e open wide, the MOONLIGHT streaming in. Her eyes lock

a Suddenly, behind her, she hears

SOUND: BEEP-BEEP.


Cathy spins. At first, nothing. Then she sees...

CATHY S POV - HIGH-TECH WRISTWATCH


left by the Watcher next to the phone.

Suddenly, Cathy is startled again by an ABRUPT KNOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR.

          Who is it?

                            JOE (O.C.)

            Him! He was just in here!

Having not seen anyone between the elevator and the door, Joe heads for
the stairwell. Cathy catches him as he throws that door open, in
determined pursuit.

                            CATHY
            No-- he has my gun.

Joe steers Cathy quickly back into her apartment.

                    (as they move)

            No.

Cathy catches a fleeting glimpse of Vincent on the balcony; he steps out
of view, into the shadows. Headed for the phone, Joe does not notice.

                            CATHY
            What are you doing?

INT. CATHY S LIVING ROOM LATER THAT EVENING

CATHY

is sitting against the back of her sofa, focused on the floor, her mind
disassociated from the room s activity. She is now dressed in casual
clothes.

JOE

is closer to the door, watching her. He hands three twenty-dollar bills to
a LOCKSMITH in exchange for a set of new keys.

                            LOCKSMITH
              It s a good lock. I don t think
              she ll have any problems.

                            JOE
              Thanks.


The Locksmith tests the new deadbolt one last time on his way out.


Nearby, a PLAIN-CLOTHED COP is packing up and closing his fingerprinting
case. DETECTIVE MIKE COHEN enters from the bedroom, putting away his note
pad.

                            DETECTIVE COHEN
          Okay, I think we ve got everything
          we re going to get tonight.

Cohen s entry pulls Joe and Cathy from their thoughts, but
Cathy is as close as she needs to be, does not move with
Joe, Cohen, and the cop to the door.

                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                            32.

                          JOE
          Did you find anything?

The cop pauses in the corridor, waiting for Cohen.

                          DETECTIVE COHEN
                  (sensitive to Cathy)
          No, it looks pretty clean. If we do get lucky on any of the
          prints, it won t be until late tomorrow.

                          JOE
                    (nodding)
          If you do come up with something,
            I want the information to go
          directly to Cathy.
                  (a glance to Cathy)
          If you can t find her, then to
          me. No one else.

                          DETECTIVE COHEN
                  ( whatever you say )
          Sure.

                          CATHY
            Thanks, Mike.

                          DETECTIVE COHEN
                  (to Joe)
          You want a cop outside?

Joe looks to Cathy.

  CATHY

                    (already answering
                  Cohen)
          No.

Joe and Cohen exchange a look, Cohen following cop into corridor.

                          DETECTIVE COHEN
                  (for Joe s ears)
          Can t live with  em and---

                          JOE
          ---I know...
                  (ready to close door)
          Thanks, Mike.

Just as Cohen is in the corridor, Joe closing the door behind him, Cathy
has a last thought.


                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                          33.

          Mike?
                (Cohen has paused)
          I owe you a favor. Don t file
            a report, okay?

                        DETECTIVE COHEN
                  (reluctantly)
          Okay.

Cohen exits. Joe closes the door, an uncomfortableness between him and Cathy,
both still at the door.

                      CATHY
          Thanks.

                      JOE
              (heading for couch)
            So...what s on tonight?

Cathy catches his elbow, steers him back towards door, grabbing his jacket to
hand him.

                        CATHY
          Nothing.

                      JOE
            Radcliffe ---

                      CATHY
            Thanks for checking up on me.

                      JOE
          I m not leaving. I m sleeping right there,
          on that little-short-dinky couch.

                      CATHY
          No, you re not.

                      JOE
          Yes, I am.

                      CATHY
          No, you re not.

                      JOE
          Why not?

                        CATHY
          ...I have my reasons.

                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                            34.

                        JOE
            ...Whatever it is, Cathy, we can
          get you out of it.

                        CATHY
                  (her own meaning/
                    kissing his cheek)
          No, we can t.


Her attitude is unwavering; he s not staying.


                        JOE
          Okay. Lock your door.
                  (gives her set of keys)
          Put a chair in front of it.
          Actually put that couch in front of it.

                        CATHY
            Good-bye. Good-night.

Cathy pushes Joe out the door, closes the door.

                        JOE (O.C.)
          Lock it!


Cathy turns the deadbolt, locks the door securely, turns to lean against

the door.

coffee table. BEGIN A SLOW PAN to find CATHY S WATCH near the phone; it
reads: 12:15. CONTINUE PAN...over to the front door...past the locks and
knob, shiny in the dark...across the apartment... until we find CATHY next
to the balcony door, the drapes pulled shut. Cathy is looking out between
the drapes with binoculars. The fireplace shovel is propped within ready
reach. Suddenly she reacts to the SOUND OF THE ELEVATOR MOVING, her head
turning sharply, listening, perfectly still...her nerves raw. THE ELEVATOR
moves past her floor without stopping.

She is no longer there. The room is now FAINTLY LIT with one TABLE LAMP.
FIND CATHY sitting on the sofa, her bed pillows propping her up, a blanket
over her legs, which are pulled up, the fireplace shovel nearby. She is
transfixed on

THE DEADBOLT AND DOORKNOB.

EVERY APARTMENT SOUND SEEMS LOUDER THAN USUAL...the WRISTWATCH TICKING...
a REFRIGERATOR HUMMING...A FAUCET DRIPPING...THE ELEVATOR MOVING...
Somewhere far away, outside of Cathy s world, a SIREN drones faintly
through the night. All efforts to sleep have been useless.

MOVE IN SLOWLY ON CATHY

as various SOUND BITES haunt her:

Cathy remains transfixed on the door. We hear The ELEVATOR
ASCEND in the corridor, IT STOPS AT HER FLOOR, THE DOORS
OPEN.

Cathy locks her door and walks to the elevator, pushes the  down  button and
waits, poised at the door. She glances up at the FLOOR INDICATOR which shows
the elevator is starting to move up from the third floor.

We continue to INTERCUT between Cathy in front of the doors, Cathy
impatiently punching the  down  button, and the Floor Indicator. Once...

                          CATHY
          Come on.

Each time we see the Floor Indicator, the lights indicating a progressive
approach, we get the feeling something is wrong, something evil is coming up
in that elevator, this foreboding only heightened by the fact that Cathy
seems unaware of it.

conscious, towards the rear of the car. The trunk is already open, the
Watcher apparently going to put Cathy inside.

                        WATCHER
        I like it here. I used to play here.
        Now you ll be here, and I ll come visit you.

The Watcher puts Cathy in the trunk...

                (mumbles)
        ... No ...

The Watcher looks at her, wanting desperately to kiss her...but ultimately he
doesn t have the courage. Infuriated, repulsed by his own gutlessness, he
slams the trunk down.

mouth in the barely sufficient air pocket...her only chance for life...

CLOSE ON - WOODS

We hear SOMETHING MOVING RAPIDLY THROUGH THE BRUSH. Suddenly Vincent comes
up, his face FILLING THE FRAME, his arm grabbing a tree trunk, half to stop
his forward motion, half for support. His breathing is labored, his concern
for Catherine overpowering. We see in his eyes he can feel her slipping
away...the signal of her heartlight growing weaker...almost disorienting
him...

EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

ON THE TREES AND UNDERBRUSH

as WE HEAR SOMEONE COMING THROUGH THEM. Suddenly the Watcher COMES INTO
FRAME. He stops abruptly, seeing...

VINCENT.

Vincent is still down, on one knee, his head lowered. He looks up, an
immediate recognition. The Watcher grins at him. Triumphant.

                        WATCHER
        Too late.

Vincent starts to rise, the thirst for blood in his eyes. The Watcher sees
what s coming, doesn t move, at some level feeling a destiny tonight. Vincent
annihilates the Watcher.

Vincent turns from the carnage, walks away, desolate, in the direction the
Watcher came from...in the direction Vincent last felt Catherine. Going for
her body. Tears tumble down his cheeks.

SILHOUETTES. The Woman drops the Man s hand and holds out her arms to Cathy,

face nestled into his neck, her eyes closed, her body drained, weary.

The night is alive with activity. Three patrol cars throw red light
everywhere; POLICE RADIOS SQUAWK, filling the air with disembodied voices.
A TOW TRUCK slowly pulls Cathy s car from the lake. The CHOPPER has just
landed, its rotors still thwacking, whipping the air. Joe jumps to the
ground, runs out from under the blades to the first available TROOPER. We

Trooper Fred indicates one of the patrol cars. FOLLOW JOE over to find Cathy
in the backseat, still wrapped in Vincent s cloak but now wearing someone s
grey sweats too. Another TROOPER (RAY) is trying to question her.

                        TROOPER RAY
        You don t remember how you got
