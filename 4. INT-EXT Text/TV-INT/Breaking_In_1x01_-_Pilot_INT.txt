      We PULL BACK from the commercial on a flatscreen.  The entire 
      team now sits across the table from MR. LOPEZ, an impeccably 
      dressed business-man in his 40s.  A beat of silence, then:                                                                                      3.


                                  MR. LOPEZ
                    No.  

                                  OZ
                    Let me ask you a question, Armando.  
                    Do you want your car dealership to 
                    be robbed by meth heads?

                                  MR. LOPEZ
                      Preferably not.

                                  OZ
                    Well, if you don t hire us, you re 
                    telling all those snaggle-toothed 
                    crystal junkies to come steal a 
                    Porsche.

                                  MR. LOPEZ
                    Look, I ve just spent a fortune 
                      installing the newest security 
                    system on the market.  My alarm 
                      self-generates a new password every 
                    hour which is emailed only to me.  
                    My dealership is a fortress.

      Oz falters.  Roadblock.  Then -- from the back of the room --

                                    CAMERON
                          (mumbles involuntarily)
                    Coccyx.

                                  MR. LOPEZ
                    Excuse me?

                                    CAMERON
                          (VERY hesitant)
                    Um... Coccyx?  That s currently the 
                    password for your alarm.

                                  MR. LOPEZ
                    How did you know that?

      Cameron is a deer in the headlights.  Wishing he didn t speak.  
      Melanie grabs Cameron s laptop and reads:

                                    MELANIE
                    Looks like he hacked into your email 
                    and stole the password.  He also got 
                    your social Security number, ATM pin, 
                    credit card info, even your username 
                    to an adult website called Plumpers  
                    dot org?                                                                                        4.


                                  OZ
                    We re not here to judge.  

                                  CASH
                    I too enjoy a plus-sized lady from 
                    time to time.

      Mr. Lopez just gawks at them.  Finally:

                                  MR. LOPEZ
                    I ll give you three days to try and 
                    steal a Porsche out of my showroom.  

                                  OZ
                    We ll do it in two.  I ll put my 
                    best man on the job.

                                  JOSH
                          (sniffs, cocky)
                    Damn right.  Don t worry, I ll be 
                    gentle.

                                  OZ
                    Sit down.  I meant -- Cameron.

      Cameron just sits there, speechless.  EYES WIDE IN FEAR.


      A panicked Cameron pulls a bottle of Tylenol out of a drawer.  
      As he goes to grab a cup of water, a BUTTER KNIFE is suddenly 
      handed to him.  He peers up to find JOSH, eyes narrowed.

                                  JOSH
                    I assume this is what you re 
                    looking for.  Y know, to stick in 
                    the small of my back.  

                                    CAMERON
                          (re: his girth)
                    There is no small of your back.

                                  JOSH
                    You re quite the comedian, Margaret 
                    Cho.  But let s get one thing 
                    straight. I m top dog in this office.  
                    The Bayport Porsche job was mine.  

                                    CAMERON
                    And you can have it.  I m gonna go 
                    tell Oz that I don t want to be 
                    team leader.  Ever.                                                                                      5.


                                  JOSH
                    Ah, so that s how you re gonna play 
                    it?  Word to the wise, ese.  This 
                    is my world.  Do not take me on.

                                    CAMERON
                      I completely agree.

                                  JOSH
                    We ll see about that, won t we?

                                    CAMERON
                    No.  We won t.  You re clearly the 
                    best and I m in no way debating that.

                                  JOSH
                    Oh, you re good. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Honestly -- I m not.

                                  JOSH
                    Then game on.

                                    CAMERON
                    Game off.  There is no game.

                                  JOSH
                    May the best man win.

      Josh smacks the bottle of Tylenol out of Cameron s hand and 
      backs out of the room with a face that says  that just 
      happened .  Cameron calls after him:

                                    CAMERON
                    Which will be you!  You re hands 
                    down the best man!

      Cash now heads into the break room, greeting Cameron with a 
      friendly fist pound. 

                                  CASH
                    Sup, noob sauce!

                                    CAMERON
                    Okay, you re way too happy.  Please 
                    tell me you re not planning another 
                    office prank.  

                                  CASH
                    No pranks today, man.  I m just 
                    here to get my Chunky on.                                                                                      6.


      Cash gets a Chunky from a vending machine.  He sensually 
      undresses the candy bar from its wrapper. 

                                  CASH
                          (increasingly breathy)
                    Oooh, baby.  My mouth is gonna have 
                    sex with this candy bar.  Don t you 
                    worry, girl.  Daddy s gonna be real 
                    tender.  Yeaaaaah, lemme taste some 
                    of that fine stuff...  

      Cameron just stands there.  Super awkward.  Finally:

                                    CAMERON
                    You kids have fun.  Be safe.


      Cameron is now hunkered down in his CUBICLE, peering across 
      the bullpen into Oz s office (think the new shitty Sony TV 
      offices where glass walls provide no privacy whatsoever).  

      Cameron sighs.  Here goes nothing.  The moment he leaves his 
      cubicle, Cameron is cornered by EDDIE PONG.  He s the creepy 
      Asbergers-y HR guy who has NO concept of personal space.

                                  PONG
                      Cookiepuss.  

                                    CAMERON
                          (leaning back)
                    Cookie... wha?

                                  PONG
                          (leaning in)
                    Puss.  Ice cream cake.  New guy is 
                    always in charge of the office 
                      birthdays.  There s one on Friday --

                                    CAMERON
                    Yeah.  You told me yesterday, Pong.  
                    And the day before.  I ll get to 
                    it.

      Pong slowly, deliberately applies a POST-IT note to Cameron s 
      shirt.  It reads  COOKIEPUSS . Cameron heads onwards for Oz s 
      office.  Heart pounding.  Foot over foot.  Dead Man Walking.  

                                    MELANIE (O.S.)
                    Where do you think you re going?

      Cameron looks over and finds Melanie at the Xerox machine.  
      He instantly turns into a shy, awkward idiot.                                                                                      7.


                                    CAMERON
                    Melanie!  Hi, hello.  Didn t see 
                    you there.  Making copies I see.  
                      Wonderful.  The world needs more 
                    copies of things.  Oh God.  I just 
                    wanted to talk to Oz.

                                    MELANIE
                    Trying to bail out of the Porsche 
                    job already?

                                    CAMERON
                    It s not bailing when I didn t ask 
                    for it.

                                    MELANIE
                    You asked for it the second you pulled 
                    out your coccyx in that meeting.

                                    CAMERON
                    It was an accident.  I kinda just 
                    want to keep a low profile here. 

                                    MELANIE
                    Clearly.  This is our first 
                    official conversation since you ve 
                    started.  Just for future 
                      reference, am I always going to 
                    have to be the one to initiate?

                                    CAMERON
                    Most likely.  And now thanks to you 
                      commandeering my laptop, I have to 
                    go tell Oz he s made a mistake by 
                    putting me in charge.

                                    MELANIE
                    Okay, you ve only been here a few 
                    weeks so lemme give you the three 
                    cardinal rules of this office.  
                    One: Oz doesn t make mistakes.  
                    Two: If Oz gives you a job, any 
                    job, DO IT.  Which brings us to our 
                    third and most important rule:

      Melanie points to a sign: 35 DAYS WITHOUT MELTDOWN.  

                                    MELANIE
                    Don t make Oz angry.  You wouldn t 
                    like him when he s angry.

                                    CAMERON
                    So... he s like the Hulk?                                                                                      8.


                                    MELANIE
                    No, the Hulk is sometimes nice.

      Cameron gives a small nod.  He s now officially terrified.   


      Oz s office is PACKED with anti-stress items.  A desktop Zen 
      garden, punching bag, coffee table bubbling fountain, foot 
      massager, lava lamp, tension balls, you name it. A sound 
      machine on a bookshelf plays sounds of the rainforest.

      Oz unwraps his sandwich at his desk as Cameron knocks on the 
      glass door.  Oz happily waves him in.  Even when he s NICE 
      he s intimidating as shit. 

                                  OZ
                    Cam the man!  Way to step up in that 
                    meeting.  You really made my week.  

      Oz bites into his sandwich.  He grimaces and spits it out.

                                  OZ
                    Sprouts?  Who the hell puts this 
                    crap on a sandwich?  It s like a 
                    mouthful of Kermit the frog s pubes.  

      Oz madly rakes his Zen garden.  A beat.  He smiles.  

                                  OZ
                    I m cool.  You need something?

                                    CAMERON
                    Uh... kinda.  I was thinking Josh 
                    should take point on the Porsche 
                    job.  He deserves it.

                                  OZ
                    Now that s why I want you in 
                    charge.  You re a real team player. 

      Cameron is at a loss.  Wow, that backfired.  Oz continues:

                                  OZ
                    Besides, this is nothing compared 
                    to the hacker stuff you ve pulled 
                    online.  You re the first person to 
                    screw with those Nigerian scammers.

                                    CAMERON
                    You... know about that?

      Oz peers up from his Zen Garden.  He knows EVERYTHING.                                                                                      9.


                                  OZ
                    Oh, I know all about Prince Nwosu.  
                    Dude thought you were sending him 
                    twenty grand.

      QUICK POP: A NIGERIAN DUDE excitedly opens a Fed Ex package.  
      POOF!  Blue ink sprays out all over him.

                                  NIGERIAN DUDE
                    I deserve this.

      BACK TO SCENE: As Oz throws away his one-bite sandwich.

                                  OZ
                    That s why I brought you into this 
                    company.  I think you can be the 
                    best.  You just don t know it yet.

                                    CAMERON
                    Listen, I m just a computer monkey.  
                    I speak three languages and they re 
                    BASIC, HTML and JAVA SCRIPT.  I m 
                    really not a people person and I m 
                      definitely not a leader.  

      Oz s smile is now GONE.  And he snaps the little Zen rake.

                                  OZ
                    Dammit!  My f n tranquility rake! 
                          (then, eyes burning)
                    You better figure out how to be a 
                    leader  cause you don t have a 
                    choice. 

      Cameron GULPS and nods.  Mission accepted.


      A weary Cameron heads into the parking garage, his head down.  
      Without looking up, he grabs his keys and uses them to unlock 
      his car.  BLOOP!  BLOOP!  

      We now REVEAL that his crappy 1997 Ford Focus is UPSIDE DOWN 
      in his parking spot.  Cash pops in next to him.

                                  CASH
                    BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!  

      Cameron just gawks at his upside down car.  Cash gives him a 
      friendly WHAP on the back..

                                  CASH
                    Sorry, but you gotta haze the new 
                    guy.  That s how every office works.                                                                                    10.


                                    CAMERON
                    No, that's how this office works.  
                    In the real world, I think this is 
                    a felony.

      Cameron angrily tries to open the door.  It won t budge -- 
      but the alarm begins to BLARE. 

                                    CAMERON
                    You crazy-glued this shut, didn t 
                    you?

                                  CASH
                    Welded.  Want a ride home?

                                    CAMERON
                    That would be nice.

      SMASH TO BLACK.

                                END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    11.


                                            ACT TWO


      An exhausted Cameron enters the office and heads for the break 
      room.  He spots Pong stationed in front of it, waiting for him. 
      Cameron sneaks to his cubicle -- where he finds Pong.  WTF?

                                  PONG
                    Office party is tomorrow.  Any 
                    movement on the Cookiepuss?

                                    CAMERON
                    Please stop.  I have a lot going 
                    on. 

      BAM.  Pong places a COOKIEPUSS POST-IT on Cameron s forehead.  
      Cash then heads into the bullpen, now dressed like HAN SOLO.

                                  CASH
                    Yo, check what I got.  BAM!  Han 
                    Solo costume for Dragon Con.  I 
                    know you re a fan of The Wars.  Any 
                    interest in being my Chewbacca?

                                    CAMERON
                    You can t be serious.

                                  CASH
                    What?  A black man can only be 
                    Lando Calrissian?  Is that it?

                                    CAMERON
                    No.  I mean you can t expect me to 
                    go to a comic book convention with 
                    you after you upside-downed my car.

                                  CASH
                    Aw, don t hate on a guy for pulling 
                    a little office prank. 

                                    CAMERON
                    A little office prank is Xeroxing 
                    your butt.  You re a strategy 
                    expert with a 161 IQ.  You don t 
                    know how to do little.

      QUICK POP: Cameron walks through the bullpen to his cubicle... 
      but it s gone.  He peers up and finds it s been CEMENTED TO 
      THE CEILING along with his desk, chair, ETC.  Cash pops in.

                                  CASH
                    Boom goes the dynamite.                                                                                    12.


      QUICK POP:  THE FAMOUS WRIGLEY FIELD SIGN.  It READS:  
       CAMERON F. BRIGHT.  VISA CARD: 4192 1037 7743 1026  EXP 6/11.  
      BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE! 

      BACK TO SCENE: As Cameron and Cash head into the break room.

                                    CAMERON
                    Forty thousand drunk fans charged 
                    beer to my card, thanks for that.

                                  CASH
                    Look, you re my boy.  The Chewie to 
                    my Solo.  So lemme explain how this 
                    works.  Prank a brother back.  Earn 
                    my respect and the hazing stops.

                                    CAMERON
                    I don t have time for games.  I have 
                    to steal a Porsche and  figure out a 
                    way to make Josh not be an ass bag.

                                  PONG
                          (passing by)
                    And buy a cake.

                                  CASH
                    Listen, Noobasaur.  You can handle 
                    Josh.  Again, it s about respect.  
                    Be confident. Commanding.  Hell, 
                    Josh works for you now.

      As Cameron thinks this over, Cash pops a buck into the vending 
      machine.  ZZZZT!  The Chunky gets stuck as it dispenses.  Cash 
      shakes the machine.  The Chunky hangs there, taunting him.  

                                  CASH
                    Oh, you wanna dance?  LET S DANCE.


      Everyone is now crammed into the break room.  Blueprints and 
      tech specs cover the area.  Cameron stands before Melanie, 
      Josh and Cash.  He stammers, trying his best to act confident.

                                    CAMERON
                    Hi, thanks for meeting here.  I 
                    didn t know you had to schedule the 
                      conference room in advance.  Anyway, 
                    here s the game plan for tonight s 
                    job.  I ve got everything completely 
                    figured out except for the part where 
                    we beat their security, take the car, 
                    and get out.                                                                                      13.


                                  JOSH
                    So lemme get this straight.  You 
                    gathered us here to tell us you 
                    don t know what the F you re doing?

      This is it.  Cameron s moment to be commanding.  Gain respect.

                                    CAMERON
                    It doesn t matter what I know, 
                    Josh.  I m the one in charge here 
                    which means you do what I say.

                                  JOSH
                    Why are you talking like a girl?

                                    CAMERON
                    I m not talking like a girl.  

                                  JOSH
                    You re voice is getting high.  

                                    CAMERON
                    I m exuding confidence and being 
                      commanding!

                                    MELANIE
                    There it is.  I hear it now.

                                  JOSH
                    Listen, Lady Gaga.  We don t have 
                    time to solve your problems.  Oz 
                    has me leading my own project.  Top 
                    secret and awesome.

      Cameron points to Josh s laptop.  He s blatantly iChatting.

                                    CAMERON
                    Okay, that s clearly not work.  
                    You re on a video conference... 
                    with three girls at once.

                                  JOSH
                    I m multi-assing.  The trick is to 
                    overlap them on the screen so you 
                    never lose eye contact and use 
                    generic terms of endearment like 
                     boo  and  baby-girl .
                          (to all three girls)
                    Boo, you re the only lady for me.

                                  GIRL 1 / GIRL 2 / GIRL 3
                    Aww. / Mwah! / You re my teddy bear!                                                                                    14.


                                    CAMERON
                    Okay, look.  You all have special 
                    skills and in a job like this I need 
                    them.  First and most important --

      Cameron looks at Melanie.  His heart leaps into his throat.

                                    CAMERON
                      Melanie... hey there.  Love that 
                    thing you re wearing.  What do you 
                    call that?

                                    MELANIE
                    A plain white T-Shirt?

                                    CAMERON
                    Very cottony, super cool.  Anyway, 
                    I need you to figure out a way into 
                    their key vault.  Cash, can you 
                    find a way around their motion 
                    sensor trigger plates.  Cool?

      We REVEAL Cash on the other side of the table, fashioning an 
      INGENIOUS candy bar grabber out of everyday office items.  

                                  CASH
                    I ll work on it, my man.  But first 
                    I mma get me that Chunky.

                                  JOSH
                    Bernice in accounting?

                                  CASH
                    Chocolate bar.  But for the record, 
                    tapped it.  Thrice.

      Cash hustles over to the vending machine and gets to work.  
      Cameron looks at Josh.  Does his best to sound commanding:

                                    CAMERON
                    Josh, I ll leave the intel up to 
                    you.  Think you can smooth talk 
                    their receptionist and sneak your 
                    way into their computer system?

                                  JOSH
                    Don t insult me.  I can sell shit 
                    to an Eskimo. 

                                    CAMERON
                      I think... you re mixing the 
                    metaphor there.                                                                                     15.


                                  JOSH
                    Eskimos happen to be very savvy 
                      consumers!  The last thing they d 
                    ever want to buy is human feces! 

                                    CAMERON
                    I... wha...

                                  JOSH
                    I!  Wha!  Good luck robbing Bayport 
                    Porsche without me!

      Josh storms out.  Cameron sighs.  So much for gaining respect.  

                                    MELANIE
                    Don t worry.  I ll get him on board.

                                    CAMERON
                    How?  You heard the guy.  He s the 
                    master of persuasion around here.

                                    MELANIE
                    True.  But I ve got boobs.  

                                    CAMERON
                    I, uh, didn t notice. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Well, I really appreciate them.  The 
                    help.  Your help.  I owe you one.

                                    MELANIE
                    Damn right.  Lunch is on you.  


      Cameron clatters away on his keyboard in hacking mode.  Cash 
      pops into frame.  Cameron jumps and fumbles with his mouse.

                                  CASH
                    What s all this?  

                                    CAMERON
                    Porno.  I... love pornography. 
                    Weird stuff, too.    

                                  CASH
                    Looks to me like you ve hacked 
                    Mel s life.  Credit cards, Amazon 
                    wish list, medical records -- 

                                    CAMERON
                    Just trying to surprise Melanie 
                    with the perfect cake.  

                                  CASH
                    Slow your roll, my noob-ian prince. 
                    There s a reason Mel s our safe 
                    cracker.  That girl is wild.  

                                    CAMERON
                    How wild we talking?

      QUICK POP: Melanie leaps onto the field during a Sox game!  
      She dodges security guards and slides into home.  Southpaw 
      the mascot corners her.  She tackles him to the dirt!

                    Trust me, that is one rabbit s hole 
                    you do not want to go down.

                                    CAMERON
                    Trust me, it is.  And this is the 
                    perfect chance to show her I can be 
                    just as thoughtful as her Douche 
                    Lord of a boyfriend.

                                  CASH
                    Man, that s an utter waste of time.                                                                                    21.


      Cash then holds a robotic spider-like contraption.

                                  CASH
                    Hey, you got any spare RAM?  I m 
                    building a robot.  He s gonna crawl 
                    in the machine and get me my Chunky.  

                                    CAMERON
                    Dude, I have a Chunky right here.  
                    Just eat it and move on.

                                  CASH

                    Porsche dealership, I can certainly 
                    get me a damn candy bar! 

                                    CAMERON
                    Wait -- did you actually figure out 
                    how we can steal that Porsche?

      Cash slams down a stack of blueprints and print-outs.

                                  CASH
                    I m in MENSA.  I can figure out

      QUICK POP: The Phantom Menace!  Jar Jar goofily stumbles about 
      the battle field on Naboo.  But JAR JAR has been crudely 
      removed and the fat  Star Wars kid  has comped in his place. 


      It s intense in here.  A pit-stained Cameron mans a power 
      point presentation, the rest of the team at the table.

                                    CAMERON
                    Hi.  I, uh, don t really do public 
                    speaking so I quickly wipped up a 
                      presentation that ll walk you 
                    through tonight s plan in thirty 
                    short minutes. 

      ZRRRNNN.  Oz pulls the plug, cutting off the power point demo.

                                  OZ
                    You have sixty seconds.  GO.

      Cameron reads from an index card:

                                    CAMERON
                       Webster s defines security as--                                                                                      22.


                                  OZ
                    55 seconds.

                                    CAMERON
                    Skip the preamble, right.  Plan  
                    starts with our intel man.  Josh 
                    will pose as a prospective buyer --


      Josh is decked out in Armani, slicked back hair and a fake 
      goatee.  He chats up a slick car salesman.

                                  JOSH
                          (Euro-trash accent)
                    Uh, how you say?  I must think on 
                    this before I made ze purchase.  
                    But would you be so kind as to 
                    print out my travel itinerary?  I 
                    have jet to take to Prague.

                                  SALESMAN
                    By all means, Baron.

      Josh hands the salesman a USB flash drive.  He plugs it into 
      the receptionist s computer and prints out a fake itinerary.

                                    CAMERON (V.O.)
                    The USB will automatically install 
                    a back door onto their network.  I 
                    can then remotely access and 
                      deactivate their alarm system.


      Cash sits in the back of the tricked out Titan Team van, 
      manning a sweet control system ala the movie Sneakers.  

                                  CASH (INTO HEADSET)
                    You have five minutes!  Go go go! 


      Cameron and Melanie CRAWL across the showroom floor.

                                    CAMERON (V.O.)
                    Once we re in, we ll be dealing with 
                    CCTV rigged to motion sensors.  Cash 
                    will guide us through the dead spots.

                                  CASH (OVER HEADSET)
                    Straight ahead.  And -- freeze.                                                                                    23.


      Melanie stops cold.  Cameron slams his face right into her 
      backside.  She smiles at him.  Cameron wants to die.

                                  CASH (OVER HEADSET)
                    Left fifteen degrees.  NOW!


      Melanie now brushes fingerprint dust onto a high-tech safe.

                                    CAMERON (V.O,)
                    Car keys are kept in the main 
                    office.  Then cue Melanie.

      Melanie shines a UV light on the safe.  Finger prints appear 
      ONLY on the number 4.  Melanie shrugs and hits 4444.  CLICK.


      Everyone applauds as Cameron strides inside and tosses the 
      keys to Oz.

                                    CAMERON
                    Your Porsche, sir.  In and out in 
                    five minutes flat.
                          (for Josh s benefit)
                    I believe that s a first.

                                  OZ
                    Yeah.  It is.

      Oz POINTS out the window.  Everyone looks --

      TELEPHOTO ZOOM to the front license plate on the car.  It 
      reads: Bayport Porsche.

                                  OZ
                    You were supposed to rob Baybridge 
                    Porsche.  This car is from Bayport!  
                    Not Baybridge!  Bayport!  You.  
                    Stole.  The.  Wrong.  Car.

      Off Cameron s horrified look --

                                END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    24.


                                          ACT THREE


      Cameron, Cash and Josh are gathered by the cubicles, gazing 
      into Oz s office.  He sits at his desk, staring out the 
      window.  SILENT.  Melanie approaches, jacket in hand.

                                    MELANIE
                    It s six o clock.  Anything?

                                    CAMERON
                    Nope.  He s just... sitting there.  

                                  CASH
                    This is bad.  If Oz doesn t vent 
                    some steam, man will go Chernobyl.

                                  JOSH
                          (loving it)
                    Looks like Oz picked the wrong 
                    horse to back.  Once again, I m top 
                    stallion around this stable.  So 
                    suck on that oat bag!  

      Josh WHINNIES and gallops off, whipping his backside.

                                  CASH
                    He clearly ran out of horse 
                      metaphors.

                                    CAMERON
                    There has to be a way to fix this.  
                    Maybe... I could put the car back?

                                    MELANIE
                    Sure.  Place crawling with cops.  
                    Security on heightened alert.  
                    It ll be a piece of cake.

      Pong then creepily slides into frame next to Cameron. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Which I ve ordered, go away. 

      Pong s creepily slides out of frame.  Oz finally walks out of 
      his office, eerily calm.  He points to Cameron.

                                  OZ
                    You.  Come with me.  

      Oz heads out.  Cash puts a loving, meaty arm around Cameron.                                                                                    25.


                                  CASH
                    You ll be fine.  But if he starts 
                    throwing punches, stand by the 
                    vending machine.  Loosen up that 
                    Chunky.  You re a good man.


      The office is dark and empty, except for Cameron, Josh and 
      Oz.  Cameron types like a maniac in hacker mode.

                                    CAMERON
                    Melanie s right.  Since we robbed 
                    Bayport, they ve doubled their 
                    security.  Sneaking the Porsche back 
                    in isn t an option, so I hacked the 
                    DMV s server and found this --  

      Cameron brings up a driver s license photo of a 60 year-old 
      white dude -- MR. CUMMINGS.

                                  OZ
                    Arnold Cummings.  Owner of Bayport 
                    Porsche.  Divorced, one son.  Not 
                    much info to go on.

      Cameron brings up Facebook -- the account of a college kid.

                                    CAMERON
                    It s enough for me.  I cracked his 
                    son s Facebook account, kid s a 
                    sophomore at DePaul.  Photos 
                    suggest he s a bit of a drinker.                                                                                    29.


      Cameron clicks through pics of our sloppy drunk frat guy. Oz 
      nods, impressed.  And Josh angrily chows down a Cheeto.

                                  OZ
                    The lush is our in.  I want you two 
                    working together on this.

                                  JOSH
                    Together as in I m calling the shots?

                                  OZ
                    Together as in I ll eat you both 
                    for dinner, enjoy some TV, fall 
                    asleep on the couch, awake tomorrow 
                    morning, have a cup of coffee then 
                    crap you both out in a giant 
                    steaming mound of togetherness.

                                  JOSH
                    Alright then.  Looks like we re 
                    going back to college.


      Cameron sits at Cash s control system typing madly.

                                    CAMERON
                    Hacking into the secure members-

                    five, pinky lock --


      Josh floors it down the street.  Cameron now notices he has 
      37 MISSED CALLS on his phone.  He hits VOICE MAIL:                                                                                    33.


                                    CAMERON
                    Dammit.  Now what?

                                  PONG (ON SPEAKER)
                    Hi.  It s Pong.  From the office.  
                    Where you work.  Just calling again 
                    to make sure you got that cake.

      CLICK Cameron hangs up.  THE. GODDAMN. CAKE.  He breaks out 
      his iPhone and begins to type madly.

                                    CAMERON
                    Turn the Porsche around.  We re 
                    going to Frankie s Diner.  They re 
                    open until 2am.

                                  JOSH
                    That s in Skokie.  We ll never make 
                    it.  Just buy one at Pick-N-Save. 

      Cameron s eyes narrow.  Determined.  Yes, he just robbed a 
      Porsche.  But this is his real mission.  

                                    CAMERON
                    No.  It s the only place still open 
                    that has blue velvet cake.  It s 
                    gotta be blue velvet.  Step on it.

      But it s a red light.  Cameron madly types on his blackberry, 
      HACKING INTO the city s transportation grid.

      EVERY LIGHT down the street turns GREEN.  Josh is AMAZED, but 
      he d never admit it.  He FLOORS the car and they speed off.


      It s a typical super-awkward office birthday party.  Everyone 
      in the company is here, crooning off-key to Melanie.

                                  EVERYONE
                    Happy birthday dear Mellllanie.   
                    Happy birthday to yooooou!

      Applause as Melanie blows out the candles.  Cameron hands her 
      a giant novelty card with a monkey on the front.  She reads:  

                                    MELANIE
                    It s your birthday.  Go bananas.

      Pong CRACKS UP.  It s uncomfortable.

                                  PONG
                    Monkey s dressed like a Doctor.                                                                                    34.


      Melanie digs in happily and smiles at Cameron.  He melts.

                                    MELANIE
                    Blue velvet.  My favorite.  How d 
                    you know?

      QUICK POP -- Cameron meets Dutch in an alley.  He hands over 
      a jug of urine.  Dutch inspects it like a glass of fine wine.

                                  DUTCH
                    Frothy.  Good color.  Nice doing 
                    business with you.

      Dutch hands him a slip of paper.  It reads: BLUE VELVET CAKE.

      BACK TO SCENE: As Cameron smiles sheepishly.

                                    CAMERON
                    Uh... lucky guess.

                                    MELANIE
                    So, I heard you fixed your little 
                    Porsche problem.  Maybe there s 
                    hope for you yet. 

      Melanie crosses to the sign on the wall and flips a page.  It 
      now reads: 36 DAYS WITHOUT MELTDOWN.


      Cameron pokes his head into Oz s office, holding a plate of 
      cake in each hand.

                                    CAMERON
                    Brought you a piece of cake.

                                  OZ
                    I hate cake.  Sit down.

      Cameron immediately does.   

                                  OZ
                    Just heard back from Baybridge 
                    Porsche.  Said you got in with a 
                    smash n  grab.  Crude, but clever.

      Cameron now notices Oz s screen saver.  Two adorable little 
      eight year-old twins.  Cameron can t believe it.  Oz is a DAD.

                                    CAMERON
                    Like you said.  A lot was on the line.                                                                                    35.


                                  OZ
                    Well, it s not over yet.  I just got 
                    a call from the owner of Bayport 
                    Porsche.  Apparently, his idiot son 
                    stole a car off his showroom floor 
                    and he wants to hire us.  

      Cameron nearly chokes on his blue velvet.  Oz grins.

                                  OZ
                    You want to take point on this one?

                                    CAMERON
                    Better give it to Josh.  Truth is, 
                    I d rather just keep my head down, 
                    pay you back, then move the hell on.

                                  OZ
                    You re a smart guy, Cameron.  So 
                    answer me this.  Move on to what? 

      Cameron is silent.  Once again, he doesn t have the answer. 

                                  OZ
                    Y know, I used to feel the same 
                    way.  But sooner or later... you 
                    find a reason to stay put.

      Oz looks at his kids on the screen saver.  And Cameron looks 
      out the window as his motley crew feasts on the cake and Pong 
      still cracks up at the novelty card...  


      Cash sits in a chair right in front of the machine, gazing at 
      his floating Chunky.  A broken man.

                                  CASH
                    I give up, Chunky.  I tried and you 
                    are the better piece of brown 
                      deliciousness.

      Melanie and Cameron step next to the machine.  Cameron nods 
      to her.  In a flash, she picks the lock on the machine and 
      pops it open.

                                    CAMERON
                    Boom goes the dynamite.

      Cash now realizes the Chunky has been GLUED into the machine.

                                  CASH
                    It was... you?

                                    CAMERON
                    Just like you said.  Earn your 
                    respect and the hazing stops.

      Cash stands.  Nods with admiration.  And whispers menacingly:

                                  CASH
                    Oh no, Noobraham Lincoln.  It is 
                    ON.

      Cash heads out of the break room.  Cameron s eyes go wide.  
      THIS BACKFIRED.  BIG TIME.  He chases Cash out.

                                    CAMERON
                    No.  No no!  Nothing s on!  It s 
                    off!

      Melanie grabs the Chunky, unwraps it and digs in.

      AND WE --

      FADE OUT.
