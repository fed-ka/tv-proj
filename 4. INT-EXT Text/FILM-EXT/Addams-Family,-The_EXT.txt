A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an
endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy."
They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they
pompously begin their umpteenth verse,
THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past
the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows,
weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter.
THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF
where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY,
PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler,
gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH
over the edge.
AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE
BLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN. TITLES BEGIN.

FROM THEIR VANTAGE POINT --
it appears to Gomez and Morticia that Judge Womack is
waving to them. Gomez waves back.
GOMEZ
(calls)
Sorry about the window, Judge!
Keep the ball! I have a whole
bucketful.
He holds up a bucket of golf balls. He tosses his
golfclub to Thing, who DEPOSITS IT in the golfbag.

Too fast.

Tires smoking, the school bus strains to chug down the

TULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET,
approach "GATE," a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of
its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and
Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be
startled by "Gate."
Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered
grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent.
High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap-
pointed in Tully than he is in himself.
Margaret passes through Gate first. Then, as Tully passes
through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the
end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his coat.
TULLY
Let me go!
Ignoring Tully, Margaret continues stiffly up the walk.
TULLY
(to Gate)
Gimme that! Stop it! I'm warning
you! It's not a good day!

Gomez rallies the family for the search. Morticia wears
a black cloak. Granny has grabbed her divining rod.
Lurch distributes torches, then stands aside, awaiting
instructions. Pugsley helps Gomez unroll an ancient map
of the area.
GOMEZ
Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung
heap. Mama and Morticia - the shallow
graves. I'll take the abyss, and
Lurch - check the bottomless pit.
MORTICIA
(worried)
Her favorite...
GOMEZ
(calls out)
Fester!!
FESTER (O.S.)
Up here.
They look up at Fester, looking down at them from
Wednesday's window.
GOMEZ
Fester! You take the ravine!
And
the unmarked, abandoned well!
FESTER
Somebody should stay behind - in
case she comes back.
GOMEZ
Good man!
Good thinking!

Gomez reaches a stately mausoleum at the far end of the
cemetery. Two proud marble vultures guard the entryway.
Gomez lowers the uplifted claw of one of the vultures and
the stone doors slide open. He steps into -

Gate can't open. He rattles miserably on his hinges --
locked tight with heavy chains and yellow police tape -
large "NO TRESPASSING!! COURT ORDER!! ADDAMS FAMILY -
KEEP OUT!!" signs are posted on Gate's rusty bars.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
the family, appalled at the sight of Gate.
Lurch carries
the sleeping Wednesday and Pugsley.
GOMEZ
What's all this?
TULLY --
hurries down the walkway, waving his legal document.
TULLY
This is a restraining order, Gomez.
GOMEZ
A restraining order?
TULLY
It requires you to keep a distance of
one thousand yards from this house.
You've got about nine hundred and
ninety-nine yards to go - catch my
drift?
GOMEZ
(in disbelief)
I am restrained - from my own house!?
TULLY
Not your house, moustache! Not any
more! It belongs to the eldest living
descendant, the older of the brothers
-- Fester Addams!
GOMEZ
But - this is lunacy!
MORTICIA
Fester adores Gomez!
TULLY
He's afraid of him. Seeing the
twins brought it all back.
(to Gomez)
You're bitter rivals, Gomez - always
were, always will be!

But he isn't even Uncle Fester.
Gomez and Morticia turn to look at her.
GOMEZ
(to his family)
Do not fear - justic shall

They say a man who represents
himself has a fool for a client.
Well, with God as my witness -

coat draped over his shoulders as if he were an invalid,
his head thrown back.
Morticia carries out Cleo, her carnivorous plant. Granny
carries her favorite cauldron, Wednesday one of her Marie
Antoinette dolls, Pugsley his chemistry set. Lurch uproots
his favorite tree and joins the procession. Thing follows,
dragging a toy wagon packed with his rings, his glove.

Wednesday and Pugsley have set up a LEMONADE STAND, their
contribution to the Addams' financial well-being. An
array of POISONS are lined up on their rickety table.
They've slashed their prices to a nickel per cup. The
pitcher on the table before them steams.
Cars speed by.
Carrying a SAMPLE VACUUM CLEANER and a bucket, Lurch comes
out of the motel courtyard. Pugsley offers him a cup of
punch.
PUGSLEY
Here, Lurch.
On the house.
Lurch downs it in a gulp and heads off.
Feeling the effects of the lemonade, Lurch BURPS -- a
tongue of flame shoots from his mouth and INCINERATES A
WOODEN INDIAN advertising the Wampum Court.

Scout cookies.

Is this made from real lemons?
WEDNESDAY
Yes.

I only like all-natural foods and

White clapboard. Geraniums in the flower boxes.
Surrounded by a white picket fence.
Carrying his SAMPLE VACUUM CLEANER AND BUCKET, the tools of
his new trade, Lurch carefully opens the little white gate.
AT THE DOOR,
he rings the doorbell, afraid he might break something.
A BLONDE HOUSEWIFE in tennis whites, obviously in a hurry,
opens the door -- only to be greeted by a BUCKETFUL OF
SLOP thrown past her, onto her peach Oriental rug. She
SCREAMS in horror, turns to challenge the perpetrator of
this atrocity and, seeing Lurch, SCREAMS again.
In a panic, she tries to slam the door on Lurch, but, like
the salesman's manual undoubtedly advised, he STICKS his
foot in the way. The door partially RIPS off its hinges.
Lurch steps inside and shuts the door as best he can.
A moment passes. The door swings open and Lurch exits,
jauntily waving a check.

A group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There

Halloween costumes - there's a witch, a ghost, a skeleton,

and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and
he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the
children CHANT:

torches are seen, like fireflies.
