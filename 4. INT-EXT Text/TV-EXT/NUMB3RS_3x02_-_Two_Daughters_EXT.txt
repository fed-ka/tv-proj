  A TRAFFIC COP gets off his motorcycle, takes out his ticket 
  book...


  The TRAFFIC COP works his way down the block, writing 
    tickets... 


  As the TRAFFIC COP turns the corner...

  ... finding a MINIVAN sitting, abandoned. He enters the 

  LICENSE PLATE...

  into his handheld computer -- it comes back STOLEN -- 

  -- so the traffic cop approaches the van cautiously...

  HIS POV -- INSIDE THE VAN --88

  Side panel door open; spray painted in large letters, is:

  "BUCK GOES FREE."

  PULL BACK FROM POV --

  to DON and COLBY, looking at the message.

                              DON
                "Buck goes free."

                              COLBY
                She left out the "or else."

                              DON
                No... she s making us wait for that 
                part.

  As Don and Colby walk away from the minivan, we are now in 
  the middle of a

  CRIME SCENE --

  the van cordoned off, COPS rerouting traffic, CRIME TECHS 
  working on the minivan for evidence.

  DAVID joining them --

                We're doing a complete canvas of 
                the area, but there aren't a lot of 
                people out here after ten, eleven 
                at night.

                pursuit curve will hold up any 
                longer.  Given the arrest of Buck 
                Winters and the change in movement 
                from random to incentivized;

  CRYSTAL stands outside a garage, in front of a SILVER PONTIAC

                              DON

                -- thought you might want to talk 
                to her.  She's got first hand

                You know, sometimes when you re on 
                  a manhunt long enough... getting in 
                their head... it can give you 
                tunnel vision.
                      (beat)
                I had to give it up. I didn t like

                Well, there s the difference. 
                Hunting didn t change me -- it

                I ve got a call for you... came in 
                through the switchboard.

                              MEGAN
                      (takes the phone)
                Reeves.

                                                            INTERCUT WITH:


  CRYSTAL driving, eyes tearing...

  OVERLAY THE BALLS5858

  Dropping through the Galton Board, over CRYSTAL DRIVING...

                              CHARLIE
                And consider what happens when you 
                begin to block the paths...

  ... some of the paths becoming blocked, then more, steering 
  the dropping balls off to one side...

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                The distribution changes, the 
                patterns alter...

  CRYSTAL'S POV --5959

  (As Neko Case "Tigers Have Spoken" plays, softly, in the 
    background:)

  Of the LONG ROAD arching ahead of her.  As she comes to the 
  rise in the hill...

                              CHARLIE
                And, if we block enough avenues...  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   52A.



  IN THE OVERLAY --A60A60

  As the BALLS DROP -- Charlie blocks some of the paths --  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   53.



  ON THE ROADBLOCKB60B60

  As DON S CAR and COLBY S CAR join the flashing lights and 
  myriad CHP and FBI cruisers... Getting out and getting 
  ready...

  IN THE OVERLAY --6060

  we see ALL OF THE BALLS FALL INTO A SINGLE CHANNEL --

                              CHARLIE
                ... the ball no longer has a choice 
                where to fall.

  CRYSTAL6161

  brakes to a halt.

  POV -- REAR VIEW MIRROR

  MORE FLASHING LIGHTS behind her.  Her CELL PHONE RINGS.

                                                            INTERCUT WITH:

  MEGAN --6262

  standing with DON, COLBY, DAVID and the OTHER COPS at the 
  roadblock.

                              MEGAN
                There's no reason to end it this 
                way.

                              CRYSTAL
                Can't think of another way.
                      (beat)
                Could you tell my daughter...

  Crystal pauses, thinking:

                              MEGAN
                Tell her what?

                              CRYSTAL
                Nothing. It s like I never was.

                              MEGAN
                Crystal --

                              CRYSTAL
                You might want to get out of the 
                way, Agent Reeves.  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   54.




  Don looking through BINOCULARS --

  HIS POV --

  of the Taurus, down the road toward them.

                              DAVID
                She's going to try to run us.

  ON THE TAURUS

  picking up speed...

  The Neko Case song rising up now...

  ON THE FBI AGENTS --

  raising their machine guns and rifles, preparing for a 
  fight...

  ON CRYSTAL

  intense and possessed, pressing all the way down on the gas --

  -- clutching the grenade --

  ON DON AND MEGAN --

  tracking the car -- waiting for it to come into range...











                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   55.

    CONTINUED:6464


  PAN OVER -- REVEALING EDGERTON --

  lying on the roof of his truck, looking through the scope of 
  his rifle (same rifle as in Toxin)...


  As a GUNSHOT splinters the windshield -- a thick hole --

  -- and Crystal sits up quickly, then slumps forward over the 
  wheel --

  -- her foot sliding off the gas pedal...

  ... the GRENADE falling out of her hand, to the floor...


  As the agents watch the Taurus slow to a stop in the middle 
  of the road --

  ON EDGERTON --A67A67

  Looking over his rifle --

  -- at DON, who holds a rifle of his own.  He racks open the 
  bolt -- ejecting a spent, smoking round...

  ... then turns and gets into his car.

  ON CRYSTAL S CAR --B67B67

  -- as the INSIDE EXPLODES.  Windows blowing out...

  ... the interior consumed in fire.

C67C67ON MEGAN -- 

  Looking dimly at the burning wreckage, containing her 
  emotions --

                              MEGAN
                All right, guys.  Let s clear it.

  Megan looks back at DON S CAR -- disappearing into the 
  distance.

  AS THE MUSIC FADES OFF...


  LARRY and a downbeat MEGAN walking across the campus.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   55A.

                I am forever looking outward for my 
                  miracles... the core of Comet Wild

                              LARRY (CONT'D)
                the spectral properties of 
                  supernova remnant RX J1713.7-
                3946... the sheer magnificence of 
                the Magellanic clouds...
                      (beat)
                ... and, upon occasion, this blinds 
                me to those miracles that 
                  transpire, daily, all around us.

                              MEGAN
                I didn't see any miracles today.

                              LARRY
                The tendrils that connect human 
                beings to one another are so 
                  unlikely, so inherently fragile...
                      (beat)
                ... like microscopic black holes 
                that last mere fractions of a 
                second before dissolving into 
                quarks and gamma rays...
                      (beat)
                ... I think it's miraculous that 
                they exist at all.

  Megan is quiet for a beat...

                              LARRY (CONT'D)
                But maybe I should be quiet now.

                              MEGAN
                No, Larry... now is when you kiss 
                me.

                              LARRY
                Oh --
                      (realizes)
                Yes, of course.

  They kiss -- Megan taking added emotional comfort in the 
  moment.
