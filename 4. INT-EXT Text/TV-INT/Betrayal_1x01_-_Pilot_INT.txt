 EYES dart back and forth, as the O2 mask is placed SARA S
over her mouth. SIRENS BLARE; emergency lights flash. The 
Man by her side reaches over, wipes a spray of blood off 
her forehead. She looks in his eyes, then glances down at 
her hand. His fingers intertwine with hers. TWO WEDDING 
RINGS rub up against each other. As the rig screams away, 
A CARD RISES:  6EARLIER.  MONTHS  Under which, the sirens 
become SCREAMING and PLAYING...



Sara, who looks smashing in a cocktail dress, studies her 
baking. A crinkled look of perplexedness on her face, as 
JANEY (17, babysitter) looks on. Oliver watches TV.

JANEY
Should they be smoking like that? 

SARA
I can always scrape off the black part.

 Walking through, in a loose dress shirt, is Sara s
husband, DREW HAYWARD (35), on a cell phone.

knocked a year off the damn sentence... --

slick on one hand, brusk on the other. As Sara reaches to 
pull a new necktie from a box, she addresses Janey:

Sara moves to Drew, starts to put on his tie - A LUSH 
BURGUNDY SILK with gold and azure accents. Masculine but 
romantic. The action of knotting his tie is one of those 
familiar moments married couples take for granted.

 KENDRA: R u coming? 



A noisy singles place with hook-ups happening all around. 
Not a place for Sara at all, but here we find her, with 
Kendra and two other moms, LYNNE and CLAIRE (both 30s).

CLAIRE
 Oh my god, that new PE teacher - he s
like a huge muscle with great hair!

They all laugh. A crush of BUSINESSMEN and YOUNG WOMEN 
presses in. Sara feels a bit suffocated, takes a big sip. 

SARA (CONT D)
Stuffy in here. Be right back. 



Sara leans down over the sink, as she rinses her face 
with her hands. When she leans up, Kendra is standing 
next to her, holding out a paper towel.

in your marriage? Is that okay to ask? 

KENDRA
You know that spark you felt when you 
first met Drew - the one two people feel 
when they spot each other across a room -

It surprises Sara, as she absorbs the lesson of the 
sparkless marriage - not so different from her own, 
though no one might be able to see it. Yet. 

SARA
Jeffrey..? Had an affair?

KENDRA
Yes. And even though I want to kill him 
sixteen times a day, the truth is, he 
probably did us both a favor. We were

JACK RUNNING... through an underpass, up a flight of 
stairs, coming out onto the platform, as the Conductor is 
hopping onto the train, which is starting to rev up. 

JACK
Hold up! Sara! 

He runs along the windows, searching the faces, until... 
he finds her. Seeing him from her window, she moves back 
along the car, until she arrives at the inter-car gangway 
connection - stands at the open-air landing, looking out 
at him, as he tries to keep up with the train.

distance. ON JACK - bent over, hands on knees. Shaking 
his head and wondering: what the fuck am I doing?

JACK

could have been worse. 

It's an enigmatic moment, and the relief in Jack's 
expression does not hide a hint of guilt - which is lost 
on T.J. as he waxes nostalgic. 

T.J.

hear it, his eyes fixed ahead, focused and determined. 



Somewhat timidly, Jack and Sara walk down a hall, to a 
room. They arrive at a door. He opens it and they enter. 
The door swings closed slowly behind them. They look 
around, scanning the room, until their eyes inevitably 
find each other... and then it hits like a tsunami, they 
can't keep their hands off one another. 



As they kiss, Jack unbuttons Sara's blouse. She undoes 
his belt. Full steam ahead... but then, her cell phone 
rings. She reaches out for it - he takes her hand. ZABEL - BETRAYAL - 1/17/13                               39.

impulsive, a parting gesture - chaste, tender - but it 
has an electrifying effect. Their hands lock together; 
the eyes proceed to follow that example. And now he

 A BLUR: his jacket is thrown off - he unbuttons her it s
blouse - she rips off his shirt - he slips off her bra. 
They fall onto a daybed, rolling, BODIES PRESSED against 
each other. Frantic and intense, filled with passion. 
 no stopping it - there never was. From the very There s
first moment, it was inevitable.

ACT FIVE



He breezes in, trailed by his assistant, LIZ, who 
proceeds to dial a number on his phone.

late and clear my day tomorrow? 

LIZ

DREW
Great, thanks. 

She goes. On speaker, we HEAR the phone ringing. It keeps 
ringing as he waits expectantly. And waits.

day, tell you later. Okay, call me.

KARSTEN

Witness the transformation of Karsten from angry, scared 
father into comfortable, relaxed businessman - the 
consummate dealer. The powerful mogul who fears no one. 
He adjusts his cuffs, summons a wide warm smile as two 
detectives enter: BIRNBAUM (40s) and LOPEZ (20s).

the tub, a Man sits with a Woman astride him, heaving in

having sex. As we get closer, we see it is T.J., that he

Drew is busy at the computer as Sara walks in. 

SARA
Hey...

DREW
Hey. Where were you? 

SARA
At my studio.

DREW
There was no answer. 

SARA
I must have left the ringer off. 

She notices a box identical to the one in which the 
burgundy tie was - only now it holds a BORING BLUE TIE. 

DREW
Oh yeah, I exchanged it. Went back and 
found something even better. Nice, right?

Sara heads to the kitchen. In BG, Oliver plays with 
trucks. Singing a sweet little song. Sara grabs the 
bottle of Bordeaux. Gets a corkscrew, but her hand is 
trembling, and the bottle slips - SMASH! - it shatters. 
Oliver plays on, benignly unaware. Sara leans against the 
cabinet, slumps to the floor. Sitting there, she watches 
the red wine spread across the linoleum, like blood.
