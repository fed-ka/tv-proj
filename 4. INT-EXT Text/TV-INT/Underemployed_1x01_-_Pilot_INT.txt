Sofia sits at her computer: nothing. She looks up at all the 
 match. she d thought always she BOOKS GREAT the all BOOKS:

SOFIA (V.O.)
Life is weird. You grow up wanting 
a certain kind of life; a dream of 
a life; but by the time you get 
there, that life is gone. It s old-
fashioned, or it s just not you. 
You have to make your own life -- 
and you have to make it your way. 

SOFIA REACHES UP AND SWEEPS ALL THE BOOKS TO THE FLOOR!

(CONT D) (V.O.) SOFIA
Everyone goes through this. 

And then she sits down and looks at the blank screen again.


Miles again offers COLOGNE SAMPLES to PASSING SHOPPERS. "UNDEREMPLOYED" Subliminal Pickup Header Draft        32.


MILES
 Fever  by Justin Bieber? It s hot, 
fresh, and free. Feel the fever...?

SOFIA (V.O.)
Everyone settles for a little less 
than they wanted... 


At her desk, Daphne rips open her FIRST PAYCHECK. SCORE! 

TODD
Hey, Glover.

Daphne looks up to see Todd leaning into her cubicle. 

DAPHNE
Yeah?

TODD
Free for dinner tonight? Or drinks?

Daphne thinks about it a second, but then SADLY says:

DAPHNE
No. But thanks for asking.

Todd heads away. OFF DAPHNE: wondering how that went over. 

SOFIA (V.O.)
...and gets a little more than they 
bargained for.


Raviva is at the stove, stirring A POT OF SPAGHETTI SAUCE. A 
BASSINET is nearby, into which she smiles periodically. 

RAVIVA
You didn t make a mistake. And 
everyone s getting here at seven."UNDEREMPLOYED" Subliminal Pickup Header Draft        33.


LOU
I ll be home as soon as I can.

ON THE STREET, Lou sees a FAMILY approaching -- a MOM and DAD 
and TWO SMALL CHILDREN. 

LOU (CONT D)
Oh, I gotta go, I love you, bye. 

Lou hangs up and arranges his clipboard. 

LOU (CONT D)
Do you folks have five minutes for 
the environment? Five minutes? 

MOM
Yeah. I think we have five minutes.

As Lou starts in on his pitch, we PULL BACK as MUSIC RISES...

sits down beside Lou, takes Rosemary from him and kisses him.  

DAPHNE
So this is world domination. 
(after a fond look around)
I like it. 

SOFIA (V.O.)
If life is about working and 
earning money, we re all screwed.


Sofia is still at her desk. She puts her fingers on the keys. 

SOFIA (V.O.)
But if life is about living, none 
of my friends are underemployed.

And she starts typing! FREEZE-FRAME ON SOFIA: SUPER OVER: <3 -
