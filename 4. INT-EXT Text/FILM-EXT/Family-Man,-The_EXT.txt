The skating rink at Central Park...Christmas tree at
Rockefeller Center...the view down Fifth Avenue with
Christmas decorations...Park Avenue.
We close in on a spectacular pre-war doorman
building...
Jacks Ferrari racing through the park...
A modern Wall Street building.
The sign above the
glass doors reads, P.K. Lassiter and Associates,
Investment House.
The Ferrari SCREECHES to a halt.
Jack gets out, heads
into the building...
A single light remains on in the building.
Jack emerges from the building, walking across the
large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall...
Jack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow
falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at
the windows of the closed shops along the way.
He gets to the end of the block spots the Wong
Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street...
He heads toward it...
Jack and Cash walking down the street...Jack, holding
his carton of egg nog under his arm, counting out two
hundred dollars...
JACK
How'd you know my name was
Jack?
CASH
I call all you white guys
"Jack."
Jack nods...
CASH (CONT'D)
You know you seem pretty
relaxed for a guy who just had
a gun pulled on him.
JACK
There's no way I was gonna die
in that deli...
(off Cash's look)
Let's just say I've been on a
lucky streak lately.
CASH
(a big LAUGH)
A lucky streak, huh?
Jack hands him the money.
CASH (CONT'D)
Sound pretty sure of yourself,
don't you?
Jack nods.
CASH (CONT'D)
So you're telling me, you've
got a gun to your head and you
don't think for one second,
what if this, what if that,
maybe I shouldn't do this, I
shoulda done that.
JACK
I don't do that.
That's just
not for me...
Cash looks at him, then smiles.
CASH
Okay, Jack.
Nice doing
business with you...
Cash is about to take off...
JACK
Hey...
Cash turns around.
JACK (CONT'D)
What do you want to carry that
gun around for, anyway?
You're just gonna do something
you'll regret...
CASH
You want to talk about
regrets, you're talking to the
wrong person.
Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens
the carton...
JACK
I'm just saying that you seem
like a smart guy.
At a
certain point you're gonna do
something, and then there's no
turning back...
CASH
Yeah, in most cases that'd be
true.
Jack takes a sip of the egg nog.
JACK
I mean there must be programs
out there, opportunities...
CASH
(a deep laugh)
Wait a minute, wait a
minute... you're tryin' to
save me?
A look from Jack...
CASH (CONT'D)
Oh man, you're serious...
(out to the street)
This man thinks I need to be
saved!
JACK
Everyone needs something.
Cash looks at Jack...
CASH
Yeah?
What do you need?
JACK
Me?
CASH
You just said everyone needs
something.
JACK
I've got everything I need.
CASH
Wow.
It must be great being
you.
You got it all.
Cash looks at Jack.
He smiles and shakes his head.
JACK
Look, I'm not saying you'd be
able to do it without some
hard work...
CASH
(a hearty LAUGH)
You still think this is about
me, don't you?
JACK
Sure it's about you.
But it's
about society, too.
CASH
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this
one... Just remember, Jack,
you did this.
You brought
this on yourself...
And with that, Cash turns and leaves Jack alone on the
street with his egg nog...
Jack emerges from this charming, suburban two-story
house, some tasteful Christmas lights decorating a tree
in the center of the snow-covered lawn...
He races to a blue Dodge mini-van sitting in the
driveway, a My Ferrari Is In The Shop sticker on the
rear bumper.
He climbs into the mini-van and peels out
of the driveway...
The mini-van pulls up near Jacks apartment building.
Jack, still wearing pajamas under the coat, leaps out,
running toward the grand entrance where Tony stands
sternly in front.
JACK
Tony, thank god...
Jack starts to walk past but Tony blocks the way.
TONY THE DOORMAN
Sorry, pal.
Entrance is
for residents and guests
only...
JACK
What are you talking
about?
Its me, Jack
Campbell.
Penthouse C.
I put you into commercial
paper!
TONY THE DOORMAN
(not moving)
Uh-huh...
Just then, Mrs. Peterson walks to the door with
her little DOG.
Tony opens the door for her...
JACK
Elizabeth Peterson!
The little dog starts BARKING ferociously at Jack.
MRS. PETERSON
(to Tony re:
Jack, annoyed)
Who is this man?
Tony shrugs his shoulders.
JACK
You know me, Betty.
You
do.
Jack Campbell.
Were on the co-op board
together.
We fought side
by side for garbage
disposals.
Every morning
we exchange quasi-sexual
witty banter.
Think...
She looks at Jack with a raised eyebrow, the dog still
YAPPING.
TONY THE DOORMAN
(to Mrs. Peterson)
Should I call the cops?
Im gonna call the
cops...
Jack pleads to her with his eyes.
MRS. PETERSON
(raising a hand
to Tony)
No...
JACK
(a sigh of relief)
Thank you, Betty.
I know
if I can just sleep this
off, Ill be fine...
MRS. PETERSON
And sleep you shall.
Noblesse oblige is not
dead.
Not yet
anyway...Come, lets get
you some help.
Surely
there must be a shelter
somewhere in this city.
JACK
A shelter?!
Im the
richest guy in the
building...Ive got twice
the square footage you
have!
Mrs. Peterson shakes her head at him, a look of pity on
her face.
Frustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van...
CUT TO:
Jack pulls up across the street and gets out of the
van.
Running across the empty plaza toward the
building entrance...
...its desolate...
Jack walks through the plaza like a zombie, his face
registering nothing.
He crosses the street, moving
toward the mini-van...oblivious...when...
SCREECH...a Ferrari 456M stops within inches of Jacks
torso...a VOICE from the car...
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey!
Watch where youre
walking!
Jack turns...sees the DRIVER low in the seat...cant
quite make out the face...
VOICE
You almost dented my two
hundred thousand dollar
car!
Jack...still stunned...looks at the car, very
familiar...the voice of the driver, also familiar...
VOICE (CONTD)
Thats right!
My new
cars worth more than
your shitty house!
A look of realization on Jacks face...
VOICE (CONTD)
I feel like I really did
win the lottery!
...its Cash, and hes in Jacks car...
Jack moves over to the passenger window in shock...a
smile from Cash...
CASH
Miss me, Jack?
JACK
Thats my car!
You stole
my car!
CASH
Its a callable asset
seized in accordance with
the acquisition by-laws
of your alt-fate
contract...
JACK
What?!
CASH
Basically, its my car
now.
Get in.
Cash reaches over and opens the door.
Jack
hesitates...
CASH (CONTD)
Look, I dont make the
rules, Jack.
This is how
it works.
Get in.
Cash gives him a reassuring look.
Jack gets in...
The blue mini-van snakes through the curved streets of
the neighborhood, almost all the houses decorated for
Christmas.
Arnie walks Jack through his backyard...
ARNIE
Look, you fit the profile
exactly.
Thirties,
house, kids, financial
responsibilities.
You
start thinking...this
isnt the life I dreamt
about.
Wheres the
romance, wheres the joie
de vivre?
Suddenly,
every lingerie ad in the
Newark Star Ledger
represents a life you
cant have...
JACK
(thinking, then...)
Its just two kids,
right?
A chuckle from Arnie.
ARNIE
You made a choice, Jack,
a promise to your wife.
Maybe sometimes it seems
like you gave up the
world, but look what you
got...
They arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house...
cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up
lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being
built...
ARNIE (CONTD)
Four bedrooms, two and a
half baths, and a
partially finished
basement...
Jack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL.
ARNIE (CONTD)
(shaking his head)
Kids...
Arnie leads Jack toward the house.
ARNIE (CONTD)
Okay look, you probably
dont want to hear this
right now but remember
what you told me last
summer when I almost had
that thing with Arnie
Jr.s speech therapist.
A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding
glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his
shoulders and looking him in the eye.
ARNIE (CONTD)
Dont screw up the best
thing in your life just
because youre a little
unsure about who you
are.
Okay?
Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie...
ARNIE (CONTD)
God, it feels so good to
finally give something
back to you...
Arnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open.
ARNIE (CONTD)
Im gonna hug you now...
Arnie gives Jack a gentle hug...then gives him a little
push toward the door...
Jack and Kate, a casserole dish in her hand, walk up
the path to this tacky but large house, its outside
decorated with the most garish display of Christmas
decorations this side of Pasaic.
Kate RINGS the doorbell...
EVELYN THOMPSON, 30s, wearing a dress thats a bit too
tight and a bit too low cut, opens the door...
EVELYN
Kate!
Jack!
(turning around,
to guests)
Everybody, Jack and Kate
are here!
Jack looks right past her...to the house filled with 50
GUESTS.
A loud WHOOP from the guests...Jack has the look of a
condemned man on his face as he follows Kate inside...
The sound of CRICKETS.
Jack, wearing a down jacket, is being dragged down the
street by Lucy, his breath condensing in the cold
winter air.
The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple
of garbage cans, but isnt doing her business.
JACK
Figure it out...Im s
crewed...dont have to
be a genius to figure
that out...
The dog stops, sniffing at a manicured lawn...
JACK (CONTD)
(to Lucy)
Its as good a place as
any...
But the dog keeps moving, pulling Jack with her.
JACK (CONTD)
...but obviously not up
to your high standards...
(to himself)
Okay...he said youre
working on a new deal
now...fine, youve done a
thousand deals, whats
the first thing you do?
Lucys sniffing around someones Christmas display but
Jacks too wrapped up in his thought process to notice.
JACK (CONTD)
Triage.
Its your
signature.
You survey
the damage, find out
everything you can, you
probe, leave nothing to
chance.
Im just gonna
have to go detective.
How did you get
Mentadent?
You learned
everything there was to
know about toothpaste and
then you pounced...
Jack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal...
JACK (CONTD)
Thats our play here...
Resolute, Jack turns to the dog.
JACK (CONTD)
If you could take a dump
some time in this
century, then we could go
home where its warm...
Jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses...
JACK (CONTD)
That is if I can even
remember how to get
home...
(to Lucy)
You remember, dont you
girl?
But the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along...
...he pulls Josh out and walks quickly toward the
building, holding the baby away from his body.
He gets to the door and holds Josh out to the DAY CARE
LADY.
She stares at Joshs outfit...
JACK
Do I get a receipt or
something...?
The woman looks at Jack like hes crazy.
The mini-van pulls up to the drop-off point at this
suburban New Jersey Y.
Annie opens the door.
ANNIE
I have winter camp until
four, then ballet until
five thirty.
JACK
Five thirty.
Okay.
ANNIE
Try not to be late
because kids dont like
to be the last one picked
up.
JACK
Got it.
Good tip.
ANNIE
Bye...
CHAPTER SEVEN - A TIRE SALESMAN
Jack watches her as she runs toward the building.
Then...
JACK
(calling out window)
Hey!
Annie!
Annie turns back toward him.
JACK (CONTD)
Where do I go now?
ANNIE
Big Eds.
JACK
Big Eds?
Big Eds
Tires?
(suspicious)
Why...?
ANNIE
Thats where you work.
A beat.
Then...
JACK
You mean I sell tires...
She shrugs her shoulders and walks off.
JACK (CONTD)
Thats what I do.
Im a
tire salesman...
CUT TO:
Jack approaches Big Eds from the parking lot...slowly,
taking it all in...
Its like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.
A big retail
store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for
everything from alignments to brake jobs...
Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a
Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands
with TOMMY the salesman.
TOMMY
Hey Jack, you happen to
know the stock number on
those new Michelin X1's?
JACK
Uh...lemme get back to
you on that one...
(looking at his
name tag)
Tommy...
HECTOR
(to Tommy)
Thomas, why you bother
Jack about that.
Look it
up yourself...
(to Jack)
Okay Jack, we talk
later...
Jack nods amiably then continues into the store...
Its mid-January and all signs of the Christmas season are
gone except for the snow on the ground in the busy parking
lot.
The blue mini-van makes its way down this road...
Jack is walking Lucy.
He passes a house that looks
familiar to him.
Then he sees it...
...the name THOMPSON etched on the mailbox...
Its the Thompson house, now sans the garish Christmas
decorations, a drying Christmas tree tied up on the
curb, ready to be picked up as garbage...
Jack stops, pulling the dog back, looking up at the
house...
He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom...the faint
outline of a woman reading by the window...
EVELYN THOMPSON...
Jack looks around, sees the street is empty, then
nudges the dog, leading her up the path to the house.
He gets to the front door...moves his hand up to the
doorbell...but its a tentative move...he keeps it
there a moment, perched at the button...but for some
reason he cant bring himself to push it...
He looks down the street, toward his own house, then to
the window upstairs.
Finally, he turns...
JACK
(pulling the leash)
Cmon, girl, lets go
home...
A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree-
lined lower Manhattan street.
The mini-van parked outside a small brownstone right on
the square.
Its like something out of a Henry James
novel... charming, meticulously maintained, elegant...
The mini-van passes a sign that reads, Welcome to
Teaneck.
The front door of the Campbell House...
Jack emerges in his work clothes, putting his coat on,
a bagel in his mouth...
He disappears from frame, the screen door closing
slowly behind him...
In a moment...Kate appears at the door, a cup of coffee
in her hand...she follows Jack with her eyes as he
heads to the car.
Then...a smile from Kate...
In a moment...Jack returns to frame and heads straight
into Kates arms...
...a passionate kiss as she leans against the door
post...
KATE
Have a good day...
A smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends
him on his way...
Jack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with
a MAN (40s) wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair
of high top Nike Air Jordans.
JACK
For the money, theyre
hands down the best
radial we carry...
MAN
(thinking, then...)
Okay, Ill take them...
JACK
You wont regret it...
(shouting to Tommy)
Tommy!
Set Mr. Conlin up
with four B.F. Goodrich
G-Force T/As...
(looking the man
over)
...and give him ten
percent off for having
the best costume...
Just then, a black ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SERAPH pulls into
the lot, its front left tire riding on the rim...
ESTELLE (O.S.)
(over P.A. system)
Jack, Kate on line two!
Jack pick up two!
Jack turns toward the door, but then looks curiously
back at the Rolls...something familiar about it...
Then...Peter Lassiter gets out of the car...
KENNY
(walking out to Jack)
Kates on two, Jack.
(on seeing the Rolls)
Nice ride...
JACK
(staring at Lassiter)
If youre into that kind
of conspicuous
consumption...
KENNY
You want me to handle
him?
I think Im
ready...
ESTELLE (O.S.)
(over P.A. system)
Jack!
Kate still holding
on line two...
JACK
Sure...be careful, he
looks like a tough
negotiator...
Jack walks inside...
...towards Kenny and Lassiter.
LASSITER
(to Kenny)
I seem to have had some
kind of blow out...
Jack approaches, tapping Kenny on the shoulder.
JACK
Why dont you let me take
this one, Kenny?
KENNY
Okay, chief.
Kenny nods then heads back inside...
JACK
Peter Lassiter...
LASSITER
(surprised)
Do I know you?
JACK
Not exactly. Ive seen you
on CNBC.
(with a smile)
You look taller in real
life...
CUT TO:
Jack pulling up to the building in Lassiters Rolls...
He gets out of the car, walks to the building, feeling
good, confident, stopping to gaze up at the
skyscraper...he breathes in deeply, then heads
inside...
...Jack reaches out and snags Annie...she CACKLES in
delight...
The three of them fall over onto the soft white snow...
The laughter from the kids is uncontrollable, Jacks
joy is just as palpable...
Finally, Annie stops laughing and grabs Jack around the
neck, hugging his tight.
ANNIE
(whispering in
Jacks ear)
I knew youd come back...
DISSOLVE TO:
Snow begins to fall...
Jack with Lucy on a leash, walking side by side, his
mind elsewhere...
Lucy leads him around a corner...to a large open
field...
Lucy stops.
She looks back at Jack, then out to the
open field.
Jack removes the leash. The dog bounds happily out
into the field, looking for just the right spot.
Jack puts his hands in his coat pocket...pulls out a
half-eaten roll of PEPPERMINT LIFESAVERS, puts one in
his mouth...
He looks up at the sky, snow gently falling onto his
face. Its cold, but its beautiful...peaceful and
still...the air clean and crisp...
He breathes in the fresh air, the Lifesaver dissolving
in his mouth, watching the dog...
Jacks Ferrari speeds down the bridge, toward Jersey...
Jacks Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops
out. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it...
A MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers.
Jack stares at him in shock.
MAN
Can I help you?
JACK
Is Kate here? Does Kate live
here?!
MAN
Kate? No, theres no one here
named Kate.
Is that good
enough for you?
Jack starts rapping his head against the door post,
much to the shock of the guy standing there.
JACK
Damn...damn...damn...
MAN
Hey, are you okay?
JACK
No...Im not...
MAN
Is there anything I can do
for you?
Jack shakes his head mournfully.
MAN (CONTD)
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen.
You got a cigarette?
JACK
Im sorry, no...
Jack walks off, beleaguered...
Jacks car drives by as Arnie carries a bicycle box out
to the garbage.
The car screeches to a halt in front
of the driveway.
ARNIE
(shouting at Jack)
Hey, you cant park that
thing here.
JACK
(out the window)
Its me, Jack...
ARNIE
I dont care if youre Tim
Allen with your fancy car
and all your tools, you
still cant park here.
JACK
Tell me you recognize me,
Arnie.
Please...
ARNIE
Howd you know my name?
JACK
We bowl together. Were
bowlers ...we won a
championship...were winners.
ARNIE
I never won anything in
bowling.
Arnie peers at Jack through the window.
ARNIE (CONTD)
Wait a second...
(thinking)
Jack...Jack...
JACK
Yes...Jack Campbell...
ARNIE
Of course. Jack Campbell. I
went to high school with
you...you played baseball,
right?
(at the Ferrari)
Youre doing well...
JACK
(remembering)
Yes, thats it...yes, we
went to high school together.
ARNIE
You never really talked to
me.
I wanted to talk to
you, man...
JACK
Yeah...I guess I just
wanted you to know, we
couldve been really good
friends...
Jacks limo makes its way downtown.
Jacks limo pulls up outside this house on Washington
Mews...
Jack gets out...
Jack in his Ferrari, racing down the highway at 120
MPH...
He looks at the clock, it reads, 8:46. He opens up
the throttle...
Snow is falling as Jacks car races up to the terminal
then stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD
sees him...
AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD
Hey, you cant leave that
there!
Jack runs into the terminal, ignoring the guard...
