HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL
Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to
the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly
DISSOLVE INTO:
HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.
Tires smoking.
Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the
awaiting b.g.
CUT TO:
HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT
The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps
out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing
ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into
his SUV, gets an idea.
THE BACK --
--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not
gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE
SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it.
BEN
(to himself)
Thank God I decided to do some community service.
Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards
the sign when suddenly --
HIS CELL RINGS.
Ben answers the call.
BEN
(into phone)
Yeah.
VOICE
Very good. You follow directions well.
Now for the final part of the game.
Put down the bat and approach the sign,
slowly.
Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the
sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.
BEN
(into phone)
Where are you?
VOICE
Closer than you think.
BEN
(into phone)
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want
from me?
VOICE
To see your reaction.
BEN
Reaction to what?
Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a
gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs
turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.
BEN
OHMYGOD! NO!
CHRISTINE --
Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in
the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the
Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows,
not seeing --
THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.
In one quick, brutal
stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around,
face to face with his attacker.
BEN
(screaming)
BUT I'M THE KILLER IN STAB 3!
THE GHOST
You just lost the role Ben.
Consider this your parting gift.
AND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart,
causing a vicious eruption of crimson.

OPEN ON:
TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY
GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the
WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for
TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.
GALE
Good morning Hollywood. And today
officially starts the Summer movie
season. Opening the box office this
week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins
in Arlington Street,
Eugene Levy
and Jason Biggs in American Pastry,
and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
in STAB 2, based off my best selling
book the WINDSOR MURDERS.
CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea
of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.
GALE
Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed
to the occasion. Today we have director of the
upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman
Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice
welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER,
ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy
white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee
mug beside Gale's hand.
ROMAN
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
GALE
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
ROMAN
(addressing audience)
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so
many fans of the genre. And I must say
that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,
or Tori or David not returning to complete
the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is
here. Aided with my excellent cast of
newcomers I believe we're going to pull
off one of the best Stabs yet.
GALE
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly
seems that way.
(a beat)
Honestly though,
(smiles)
tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
ROMAN
(a long pause)
Honestly, my life.
A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this
light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.
GALE
Your life?
ROMAN
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with
those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like
I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick
your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to
a Tobe Hooper flick.
Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into
applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second
rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of
the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her
imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as
if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.
A LOUD BUZZING O.S.
Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign
hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing
red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to
Roman.
GALE
Would you excuse me for a moment?
ROMAN
(smiling)
Sure.
Gale bolts for --
SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY
A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY
RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of

All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey
parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.

SID'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Sid's house is deep within the Napa Valley. Secluded amongst verdant vineyards

CUT TO:
JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
A nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway
in his truck. Gale follows behind in her VW JETTA.
DEWEY
(noticing Gale)
Stop following me.
GALE
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
DEWEY
You're not a detective.
GALE
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
DEWEY
Gale, your engine's still running.
GALE
Fuck!
Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to
shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges --
TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY
WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand.
TOM
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
GALE
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual.
That's a shocker.
TOM
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me
last month. The one where you said my car
accident was caused by me drinking and drugs,
and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my
insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
GALE
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya.
Stage the news to boost ratings.
TOM
Really, cause that stunt lost me the
lead role in Roman Polanski's latest
picture. Huh, what a coincide I was
picked up by Roman Bridger. Well,
not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get
my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck,
because of your big mouth I'm here,
drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second
rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer
Jollie and yourself!
(a beat, subtle)
Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should
Have a look at your break line. That your
car over there?
Gale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him.
GALE
I think we should go inside. I have to have
a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
TOM
(laughs)
You mean what's left of us.
(tosses empty bottle aside)
Yeah I'm running on empty anyways.
Gotta refuel.
Tom and Gale walk into the house. Something stirs in the bushes.
CUT TO:
JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Tom walks out into the darkness, looks around. Angelina's nowherein sight.
TOM
(calling out)
Angelina! Hey! Where the hell are you?
I was only playing! Hey look, I can really
get you a bit part! Just come on out! Ok?
(pauses)
Damn it. There goes my chances of getting
some head from her.
Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth. He lights it, walks around the
side of the house. A noise catches his attention.
A low, muffled squealing.
TOM
Aaaangelina?
Tom turns to a guest house. The door is half open, darkness
spilling out. Tom
smirks, steps inside.
CUT TO:
BACKYARD - JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly KA-BOOM!
THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT! THE ROOF SPLINTERS.
A HUGE CONFLAGRATION! The three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains
down onto the Earth.
THE GHOST --
WATCHES FROM THE SHADOWS, FLAMES BOUNCING OFF HIS PALLID WHITE MASK.
SIRENS ARE HEARD IN THE NEAR DISTANCE.
AS THE GHOST RUNS OFF INTO THE NIGHT, HE DROPS ANOTHER NEWSPAPER CLIPPING ON

Kincaid and Dewey's cars drive through the lot. They drive over towards a row
of trailers, park.
KINCAID disappears to do something else while GALE, DEWEY, and Sidney get out
of Dewey's truck.
DEWEY
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3
Production offices. That's where Sarah
Darling was murdered last night.
SIDNEY
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.
(a beat)
What does my mother have to do with this
all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
A figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young,
scrawny goth girl in
heavy make-up.
This is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape
marked SCARY MOVIES 101.
SIDNEY
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me!
What are you doing here?
GALE
Who's this.
DEWEY
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
SIDNEY
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
KAREN
(smiling)
That's me. First and Last.
Sidney hugs Karen. So does Dewey.
SIDNEY
It's been a while? You still working
at Bradley's?
KAREN
Nope. They opened up a Hollywood Video
down the street. It pays better.
Anyway, I'm here because I heard on the
news about the murders and well, I found
this while rooting through Randy's things.
Karen holds up the video.

Sidney and Karen are hugging.
SIDNEY
Thanks Karen. You be careful.
KAREN
Don't worry Sid. I got tickets to see
Family Feud. I did have a somewhat ulterior
motive for driving all the way down here.
Karen smiles. She hugs Sidney one more time, scampers away.
GALE
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys
later.
DEWEY
Do you want us to come with you?
GALE
I work better alone.
Why don't you do some snooping
around the set?
Gale runs off.
SIDNEY
I can see nothing's changed.
DEWEY
No.
CUT TO:
SUNRISE STUDIO FILM ARCHIVES - DAY
Gale's banging on the door trying to gain access. Nobody home. Gale notices
the card lock and the sign reading
'AUTHORIZED PERSONAL ONLY'. Gale smiles.
Since when has this ever stopped her before. She reaches into her pocket book,
pulling out a couple of credit cards, a video store card, etc. She tries them
in the lock. NOTHING.
A hand reaches down, grabs Gale from behind. She lets outa blood curdling
scream. It's only JENNIFER.
JENNIFER
Geez.
GALE
What the hell are you doing?
JENNIFER
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?
GALE
I am Gale Weathers!
JENNIFER
Here's how I see it.
I've got no house, no movie,
no gun, and I'm being stalked.
Because someone wants
to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.
So now, starting now, I go where you go.
That way,
if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and
since they really want to kill you, they won't
kill me, they'll kill you.
Make sense?
GALE
None.
JENNIFER
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
GALE
And as a sane person.
For you that must be quite a stretch.
JENNIFER
That's funny.
GALE
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
JENNIFER
Need to get in that building?
GALE
(sarcastically)
No really?
JENNIFER
There a story in that building?
GALE
Possibly.
JENNIFER
(flashing a Sunrise Studios Key Card)
Gale Weathers would find a way.
(she swipes and opens the door)
Jennifer opens the door, steps in first. Gale follows, door closing ominously
behind them with a loud CLACK.
CUT TO:
Sidney stands beside Dewey and Detective Wallace.
SIDNEY
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
DEWEY
Do you want me to come with you Sid?
I mean, remember what Randy said?
SIDNEY
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace.
My knife.
(smiles, raises up her fists)
These two lethal weapons.
DETECTIVE WALLACE
Sure you don't need a police escort?
That's what we're here for.
SIDNEY
No really, I'll be fine.
Dewey and Wallace nod. Sid begins to walk towards the soundstage.
SIDNEY
I'll be right back.
CUT TO:
STUDIO LOT - DAY
Sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. She looks
up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end.
SIDNEY
(crying)
Shit.
BAM! An exit door flies open. The GHOST comes charging out. Sidney screams,
runs for a wooden fence. She begins to scale it, dropping over on the other
side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife. Sid takes off
running for WALLACE and DEWEY.
WALLACE AND DEWEY,
HEARING THE SCREAMS, spin around, drawing out their guns.
Wallace looks at
Dewey.
DEWEY
(re:gun)
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
SIDNEY
(hysterical)
Jesus Christ Dewey help me!
They tried to kill me in the bathroom!
The killers!
DETECTIVE WALLACE
Wait a second? Killers? There's two
of them now? Aw shit!
Wallace whips out his cellular, dials a number. Sidney falls into Dewey's
arms, collapsing like a house of cards, crying hysterically.
DETECTIVE WALLACE
(into phone)
Yeah this is Wallace. We got a problem
down
here on the Sunrise Studios lot.
No not another one. At least not yet.
Yeah we've had an attack.
(to Sid)
Do you need medical assistance?
(Sid nods her head 'no')
No. Oh really. Alright, see you in a minute.
Wallace closes up his phone.
DEWEY
What?
DETECTIVE WALLACE
Well I got some good news in a way.
Roman Bridger didn't make those calls
To Sarah Darling. Police let him go.
Here's the bad news: The cellular was
cloned, it's untraceable. We now have
no suspects.
GALE(O.S.)
Dew!
Dewey and Sidney turn around to see an excited Jennifer
and Gale race into
frame.
GALE
Sidney, what happened?
DEWEY
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
GALE
We did some researching in the archives.
Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the
book on your mother's murder. For two years
of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically
disappeared off the face of the Earth.
SIDNEY
What are you talking about?
JENNIFER
We've found out where she went.
GALE
She was an actress Sidney. Minor
B-Movies. But now we have a new
suspect in this twisted fucking
web . . . John Milton.
DETECTIVE WALLACE
The head of the studio?
GALE
It makes sense doesn't it? It's his
big grandiose swan song from the genre.
What a better way to end than with a bloodbath?
JENNIFER
Sidney, what happened?
SIDNEY
I was attacked in the bathroom.
DEWEY
Wallace, shouldn't you be investigating
the bathroom?
DETECTIVE WALLACE
(looks at building)
I'm waiting for back-up.
I don't carry bullets in my
gun unless I know I'm gonna use em.
Dewey nods suspiciously.
Kincaid comes rushing into
frame.
DETECTIVE KINCAID
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened?
I got a call on my cell from home.
They told me that someone was attacked.
DEWEY
And what made you think it was Sidney?
DETECTIVE KINCAID
(glaring)
Sid, get in my car. You're coming
back to the station with me where it's
safe.
GALE
Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay
John Milton a little visit.
DEWEY/JENNIFER
(together)
Agreed.
CUT TO:
SUNRISE STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
Gale races out of the office building. A car horn blares. She screams.
KINCAID jams on his breaks, gets out his car. He draws up his gun.
DETECTIVE KINCAID
Jesus Gale what happened?
GALE
(frantic)
He killed Milton! The killer's
inside there! Oh God!
(realizing)
DEWEY! Dewey's in there too!
He needs medical help!
He's hurt!
DETECTIVE KINCAID
Alright, calm down. I'm going
to radio in for backup right now.
VOICE(O.S.)
Not so fast. We're not finished.
Kincaid spins around. Gale screams. The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere,
slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the
hood of his car, dead.
GALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife
menacingly.
VOICE
I wouldn't run if I were you Gale.
It's only gonna end up with you getting
Skewered like a fucking pig. I need you.
GALE
(nervously)
Awfully late time to be doing an interview.
VOICE
I need you as bait. For Sidney.
Gale closes her eyes, cries as the killer stalks towards her.
CUT TO:
SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT
Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on
the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence.
CUT TO:
SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings.
Again, she answers it.
SIDNEY
(into phone)
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
VOICE
You're doing real good. Can't
you figure it out? I wanna finish
this where it all began. Woodsboro.
SIDNEY
I thought you wanted me here?
Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is
startled out of fright.
Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production
poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's
in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the
holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness.
CUT TO:
SUNRISE STUDIOS - THE NEXT MORNING
The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.
Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.
