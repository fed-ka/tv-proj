Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is
broken, SCRAPING against the deck.
WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the
city. He couldn't fucking care less.
He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it
down the canyon.

He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's
clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in
their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping
it down with a flip-flopped foot.
He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins
drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container
is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really
empty.
Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.
And
spraying.
We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of
Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making
her unrecognizable.
Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream,
soaking into the wooden deck.
Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He
takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his
pocket.

EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames.
On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet.
MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us
through these MAIN TITLES.
In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails
through the air, tumbling end-over-end.
Just as it's about to reach its target, we...

Margaret's brought coffee and pastries from Susina.
MARGARET
Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they
were rats. L.A. is teaming with
rats. They live in the palm trees.
GARY
Sure.
Maybe.
He's obviously not convinced.
MARGARET
Okay. You know I'm a licensed
psychotherapist.
GARY
Really?
MARGARET
No. I'm a publicist. My job is
what other people think of you, not
what you think of yourself. So
pull your shit together. I am
thisclose to getting Christine
Walsh to do your piece in Parade.
GARY
Parade?
I fucking hate Parade.
MARGARET
Everyone hates Parade. But the
people who watch "Crime Lab," they
love their Marilyn Vos Savant.
Give them a woman of indeterminate
age who solves riddles and they are
in hee-haw heaven.
GARY
Okay.
MARGARET
One heartfelt act of contrition and
maybe the showrunner won't kill off
your character between seasons.
He nods.
He gets it.

Gary is lying in the sun, eyes shut.
Suddenly, a golf ball
hits him on the head.
He sits up, perplexed. For a long moment, he has no idea
where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond
the wall that separates the properties.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Sorry!
Really sorry.
(A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent.)
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Over here. To your left.
(correcting)
Right. Sorry. Right.
He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner
of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh-
scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really
is.
SARAH
I'm working on my putting, if you
can believe it.
Indeed, she's holding a putter.
GARY
Not really.
SARAH
Okay. Maybe I was just looking for
a way to meet my infamous neighbor.
You see, I'm under house arrest,
too.
GARY
What did you do?
15.
SARAH
I had sex with my husband.
GARY
That's awful.
SARAH
Nine months later, I had Jaden.
That's her over there.
She points to a small portable baby monitor.
GARY
She's cute.
SARAH
She's sleeping for another...
(checks watch)
...seventeen minutes. She keeps to
a schedule.
GARY
She sounds really boring.
SARAH
(whispers)
She is.
A beat.
A smile between them.
GARY
You're rich. Shouldn't you have a
nanny from Ecuador?
SARAH
I'm Canadian.
GARY
(as if that explains it)
Ohhh...
SARAH
I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I
want to maintain this air of moral
superiority by doing everything
myself.
GARY
Very Canadian.
SARAH
Thanks.
Another pregnant pause.
16.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Listen, Jaden goes down again at
2:30. Maybe I could stop by.
GARY
I'm pretty sure I'll be here.
SARAH
It's a date.
GARY
Is it?
She picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house.
Suddenly, she realizes...
SARAH
Oh.
I'm Sarah, by the way.
GARY
Gary.
SARAH
Yeah.
I know.

Gary is sitting on a bench by the front walk, trying to read
more of his book. He looks over to see Sarah coming up the
steps, carrying the baby monitor and a bottle of chardonnay.
She stops beside him.
SARAH
The best of all possible worlds.
GARY
(confused)
Okay.
SARAH
(pointing to his book)
Voltaire. Candide.
(off his reaction)
Are you actually reading it?
GARY
I thought I was.
He gets up.
SARAH
Sorry I bailed. Jaden had a fever.

GARY
Ah!
How boring of her.
She hands him the wine.
SARAH

HEADLIGHTS FLARE as cars travel down Miracle Mile, bringing
us to a Metro Bus stop -- a semi-enclosed bench with backlit
signage.
24.
The far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab.
("This fall, Mondays are murder.") The bench side is a promo
poster for a show called Knowing. ("Some fates are chosen
for you.")
It's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his
toes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here
from the house, which is probably a block away.
There's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt.
Over Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl
(Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter
to get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin.
GARY
Jesus!
You scared the shit out
of...
She signs "What's wrong?"
GARY (CONT'D)
(confused)
What?
NOELLE
(signed, subtitled)
You're hurt.
GARY
I don't speak that.
Sorry.
I
don't...
She points to his toes.
Getting what she must mean...
GARY (CONT'D)
I'm fine.
I'll be fine.
Looking around, he realizes that the little girl is out here
by herself.
GARY (CONT'D)
Where are your parents?
She looks at him oddly, not really getting the question.
GARY (CONT'D)
Your mom, your dad. Where are
they?
NOELLE
(signed, subtitled)
Mom is at the car. Where you left
her.
Again, Gary has no idea what she's saying.
25.
NOELLE (CONT'D)
(signed, subtitled)
You're lost.
GARY
Look, you need to go back, okay?
You shouldn't be out here. It's
not safe.
Noelle glances to her left.
We hear BWOOP BWOOP as a police cruiser pulls over to the
curb.
GARY (CONT'D)
Shit.
We go to a WIDER ANGLE as TWO OFFICERS get out of the car.
Gary looks back.
Noelle is gone, though there's really nowhere she could have
disappeared.
Putting on his best face for the police...

So he says, "Foil or epi?"
MARGARET
Epe.
GARY
I say, I'm about equal in both.
MARGARET
Which is true.
GARY
So he tosses me this fucking Conan
sword and goes after me. I'm just

But I end up cutting his ear.
MARGARET
You cut his ear off?
GARY
Just a little. But I got the job.
Margaret is confused.

He nods.
Margaret starts walking back to the house.
MARGARET (CONT'D)

Well, who thought it was a good

Left alone, Gary rolls the dice idly. He gets a 4 and a 5.
Rolls again. 4,5. 3,6. 4,5. 3,6. 3,6. 3,6. 4,5.
He keeps rolling, the wheels in his head starting to turn.

FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY
Sarah is looking in through the living room windows, trying
to spot Gary. Giving up, she turns back to the main steps,
only to find...
MARGARET,
who doesn't look pleased.
MARGARET
I know who you are.
SARAH
Really.
MARGARET
I know what you are. And if you
come near him again...
SARAH
You'll what?
Margaret lets that go unanswered.
There's obviously
something big we're not privy to.
SARAH (CONT'D)
What are you going to do, M...
She's forgotten Margaret's name -- if she ever knew it.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Sorry, what's he calling you?
MARGARET
Margaret.
SARAH
I like that. "Margaret."
Classic.
MARGARET
Why can't you just leave him alone?
SARAH
Alone? He's an actor. If nobody's
watching him, he doesn't really
exist.
(approaching)
And for the record, I'm not the one
deceiving him.

SARAH (CONT'D)
He's going to figure it out
eventually. And when he does, who

Gary opens the newspaper to a page at random.
He starts
circling things with a red Sharpie.
MACRO CLOSE UP.
His pen circles the number nine every time
it appears.
As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the
rounded trellis, just a few feet away. She's holding her own
newspaper, still in the wrapper.
SARAH
Hey neighbor.
GARY
Hi.
34.
SARAH
Sorry for the psychotic episode.
I'll blame it on hormones.
GARY
Okay.
SARAH
Are you alright? You look a little
Beautiful Mind-ish.
He almost deflects it, but decides to trust her:
GARY
How many times should the number
nine come up? Probablistically?
SARAH
Probablistically?
GARY
(annoyed)
You know what I mean.
SARAH
One time out of ten.
GARY
How about every time?
He hands her the paper through the bars.
GARY (CONT'D)
But they only show up when you look
for them. Looking for them changes
things.
Trying to find an explanation...
SARAH
Some of these are prices. There's
going to be a lot of nines when...
GARY
There is something wrong with the
world.
Sarah looks up slowly. She smiles for an uncomfortably long
beat. She's stalling, thinking.
SARAH
You have an eyelash on your...
here...
She steps forward, and motions for him to lean closer to the
bars. Brushing off the non-existent eyelash, she WHISPERS:

SARAH (CONT'D)
I can get you out of here.
But you

near the bars of the trellis.

Everything okay?

Peachy's good. I like peaches.
WIDER,

FRONT WALKWAY - DAY
He's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, headed

Leaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the
tension.
Margaret calls out from the arched windows.
MARGARET
You don't know what you're doing.
She's almost at tears.
He stops at the edge of the chalk
line.
GARY
What happens if I cross this line?
The tear in her eye falls.
MARGARET
I don't know. But it's not good.
He very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin
BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet. He shoots her a look
to say, is that all there is?
But the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come from
all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequence-
activated DRONE.
Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about
to happen.

GARY
Oh shit.
The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames.
We see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret, illuminating

The same flash catches a leaf in mid-air, sizzling through it
like an etched x-ray.

Oh my God.

You're morally incapable of doing

Gavin doesn't rise to the challenge.

Don't get me wrong. I think you do

Who were you talking to?
Gavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression.
MUCH WIDER
We see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera
Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably
perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go?
Was there ever anyone there?
Our CAMERA style has changed:
instead of handheld and jerky,
we're smooth and slow.
The MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of
creeping dread.
We HOLD for a long beat. The light changes. Still a little
unnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street.
Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her
head:
A SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT.
WIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind
of sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to
see the lights other than Gavin.
Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just
landed on an alien world.
A beat, then he has an unsettling thought.
He slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same
sphere of light -- only his is bright white. Pulsing.
Blinding.
GAVIN
Oh God.

daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day
hike. Mary carries a small videocamera.
Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path...
GABRIEL

Don't get too far ahead.
Noelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her

She checks her phone.

MARY

They're both relieved. Finding the AAA card in his wallet,
Gabriel takes the phone and dials.
It's at this moment we notice the familiar green string
bracelet around Gabriel's wrist.
In the back seat, Noelle KNOCKS on the window.
She signs,
asking if everything is okay.
MARY (CONT'D)
We're okay. Daddy's calling people
to help us.
Gabriel pulls the phone from his ear.
Looks at the screen.
Hits redial. Fuck.
GABRIEL
The minute you try to place a call,
the bar goes away.
MARY
Keep trying.
GABRIEL
Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary.
But
it will keep happening.
MARY
Well, what do you want to do?
GABRIEL
I don't know.
He tries redial.
MARY
Maybe if you hold it up higher.
Humoring her, he holds it at arm's length.
No good.
72.
GABRIEL
The problem is we're boxed in.
It's a canyon.
A beat.
GABRIEL (CONT'D)
Where we turned off the main road,
it was more open. And higher, too.
MARY
That's at least a mile.
GABRIEL
I can run that.
MARY
So...we stay here?
GABRIEL
You okay with that?
MARY
I don't think we have a choice, so,
yeah. Go.
Half a beat, while each waits for the other to think of a
better plan. Neither does.
Gabriel leans down next to Noelle's window.
GABRIEL
Daddy's going to get a truck to
help us out. You take care of your
mom, okay?
Noelle nods.
GABRIEL (CONT'D)
I'll be right back.
Gabriel gives Mary a quick peck and starts running down the
road.
We MOVE IN on Noelle, who smiles a little.
CUT TO:

Gravel CRUNCHES under Gabriel's shoes as he runs.
He keeps
an easy pace.
In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's
travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields.
73.
He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a
larger...
304
304
Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal.
By his reaction, it's still iffy.
He dials, but the call drops.
Tries again.
Just the same.
He looks left.
Looks right.
Looks back down the dirt road.
He decides to head off to the right, downhill.
305
305
We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the
road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal.
In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female
hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her:
GABRIEL
Excuse me!
Hi! Hello?
She stops, turns.
Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we
reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh
start" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness-
loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader
Joe's in Venice.
GABRIEL (CONT'D)
Excuse me.
Do you have a cell
phone?
SIERRA
No, I don't. There's no service up
here.
GABRIEL
(re: his phone)
Yeah, I'm finding that out.
SIERRA
You can usually get a signal up at
the ranger station.
GABRIEL
Okay...
She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came.
74.
SIERRA
You follow the road. It's
probably... I don't know. You have
a car?
GABRIEL
It's dead.
That's why I need...
SIERRA
Oh...
She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth.
Notices him
noticing her.
GABRIEL
Yeah.
A beat.
She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the
road.
GABRIEL (CONT'D)
Are you headed back to your car
now? If you could give me a ride
to a gas station, wherever...
She doesn't leap to extend an invitation.
It takes a beat
for Gabriel to figure out why.
GABRIEL (CONT'D)
Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy
Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to
rape you or kill you or anything.
She doesn't seem reassured.
GABRIEL (CONT'D)
Of course, that's what Ted Bundy
would say. Look, I'm a videogame
designer.
(fishing through wallet)
My wife is an editor. My daughter
is four.
He offers her a family photo.
She looks at it, but doesn't
take it.
GABRIEL (CONT'D)
They're waiting back at the car,
and I want to get some help before
it gets dark.
SIERRA
I can call somebody when I get to
town.
Trying to temper his frustration...
75.
GABRIEL
I believe you. I do. But you
don't know where the car is. And
the guy might not come. We can't
be up here all night.
Sierra backs away.
SIERRA
I'm sorry.
GABRIEL
Don't be sorry. Just help me out
here.
SIERRA
No.
I can't. I'm sorry.
Once she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and
keeps walking.
GABRIEL
Why won't you trust me?
She doesn't turn back, heading down the road.
TRANSITION TO:

Mary is sitting in the back seat of the Prius with Noelle,
who's getting tired of her coloring book.
Noelle signs something to Mary, who considers the request.
MARY
Okay, but you have to be careful,
understand? You have to use Big
Girl hands.
Noelle nods. Mary hands her the small video camera. Noelle
has some trouble folding out the little screen, but
eventually gets it open without any help from her mom.
MARY (CONT'D)
Do you want to see where we were
today?
Noelle nods.
Mary takes the camera back for a second, flipping it to
playback mode and rewinding. The blocky video footage zips
past.
76.
MARY (CONT'D)
Okay, now hit play. This button.
Noelle does. On the tiny screen, we see Noelle and her
father eating lunch by a waterfall. (Mary is filming.)
MARY (CONT'D)
There's you. And there's Daddy.
You're a little movie star, huh?
Noelle smiles.
Signs something.
MARY (CONT'D)
He'll be back soon. Don't you
worry.

Gabriel continues walking, headed back in the direction he
came. From behind him...
SIERRA (O.S.)
Hey!
He turns, finding her a ways back.
She approaches.
GABRIEL
Were you following me?
SIERRA
Once I was sure you weren't
following me. I'm sorry, it's
just...
GABRIEL
You thought I was Ted Bundy.
SIERRA
Kinda.
GABRIEL
My name's Gabriel.
Bundy.
She smiles.
SIERRA
Sierra.
They shake.
SIERRA (CONT'D)
Weird that there's no cars.
At
all.
77.
GABRIEL
Yeah.
SIERRA
So, listen. I'm parked that way.
She points off the road, through the forest.
SIERRA (CONT'D)
It's not that far. If you want,
I'll give you a ride to town.
GABRIEL
Really?
SIERRA
Yeah.
Make up some karma.
GABRIEL
Lead the way.
She does. They cross off the pavement, descending into a
dark forest.
TRANSITION TO:

FOREST - DAY
Gabriel walks with Sierra. The trees here are taller,
creating a cathedral-like ceiling above them.
SIERRA
Okay, confession.
I kind of
recognized you.
GABRIEL
Really?
SIERRA
I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a
picture of you in some videogame
magazine my boyfriend had. You're,
like, the shit.
GABRIEL
No.
SIERRA
You're like the Quentin Tarantino
of that world. A videogame God.
GABRIEL
Not really.
78.
SIERRA
Fine.
GABRIEL
You seriously recognized me off of
one photo?
SIERRA
I thought you were kinda hot.
Considering.
GABRIEL
Considering..?
SIERRA
Within the subset of videogame
people.
GABRIEL
Okay.
SIERRA
I wasn't masturbating to your
picture or anything.
GABRIEL
Well, I guess I'm flattered.
SIERRA
You should be. I'm stingy with
compliments.
GABRIEL
So your boyfriend plays videogames?
SIERRA
Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too
many. He used to play Evercrack
back in the day, but yours, well,
that was like...what's worse than
crack?
GABRIEL
Super-crack?
SIERRA
Sure.
He was this orc witch doctor
guy.
GABRIEL
Shaman?
SIERRA
Yeah. At one point he was spending
like, 40 hours a week gathering
"thunderleaf" or whatever.
(MORE)
79.
SIERRA (CONT'D)
Then I was his mule, hauling it
around because he ran out of space.
GABRIEL
You had an account?
SIERRA
I was part of your world, and you
didn't even know it.
GABRIEL
Sorry.
SIERRA
You can make it up to me.
309

Mary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing.
She holds the other cell phone (Gabriel's), which she turns
on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal.
Each time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES.
IN THE PRIUS
Noelle is still playing with the video camera, watching
footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further.
CLOSE ON the blocky pixels rushing past.
Noelle hits "play."
For now, we just hear the audio.
MAN'S VOICE
...I have five seasons mapped out,
and though it sucks, either you go
away, or the show goes. I had to
make a decision, and that's the
decision I made. I'm sorry.
We reveal the screen. We're watching the argument between
Gavin and Melissa from Part 2.
MELISSA (ON TAPE)
So it's done. Finished. Decided.
GAVIN (ON TAPE)
Yeah.
Confused, Noelle looks out at her mother, Mary, who is still
pacing with the cell phone.
MELISSA (ON TAPE)
I understand.
80.
GAVIN (ON TAPE)
You do?
MELISSA (ON TAPE)
I understand. It's not your fault.
You're morally incapable of doing
the right thing.
Noelle REWINDS further.
Blocky pixels RUSH PAST as we...

Sierra continues to lead the way. She seems confident where
she's headed, even though there's no real path.
During the conversation, we notice a small tattoo on her
right shoulder blade: IX.
SIERRA
So you play a lot of characters at
once?
GABRIEL
A couple.
Most people do.
SIERRA
You're not most people. You
created the world. You know all
the secret codes.
GABRIEL
What, like `God mode'?
SIERRA
That's what you call it?
GABRIEL
That's when you have all the
powers, and you can't be killed.
It's fine when you're designing,
but it's really boring to play. A
game isn't fun unless there are
rules.
SIERRA
And you make the rules.
GABRIEL
Yes I do. I mean, you want to give
everyone freedom, but they can't
handle it. Half your players are
teenage boys, and it's like they're
programmed to be destructive.

They deliberately crash the world

Mary sits down in the front passenger seat of the car.
Noelle is still in back, watching footage on the video
camera.
MARY
How are you doing, kiddo?
Noelle doesn't look up.
MARY (CONT'D)
I was thinking we could all go to
El Cholo for dinner. How would you
feel about some blue corn
enchiladas? Should we ask Daddy
when he gets back?
Without looking up...
NOELLE
He's not coming back.
Mary is stunned. For her part, Noelle seems to have no idea
she just spoke her first words.
We hear three evenly-spaced BEEPS.
After the third one, Mary
says:
MARY
How could you...
Mary flinches.
It's like someone walked over her grave.
Noelle hands her the camera. The footage is cued to earlier
in Part 2, where Gavin is having Melissa loop in a wild line:
MELISSA (ON TAPE)
Howkajew. How could you. How
could you.
(MORE)
83.
MELISSA (ON TAPE) (CONT'D)
(beat)
I feel so dirty.
GAVIN (ON TAPE)
That's how I like ya.
Mary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the
video camera. But she's still holding it.
She hits STOP.
Tries to collect herself.
Noelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach.
She signs,
"Mommy?"
Mary backs away.

FOREST VALE - DAY
Gabriel and Sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his
outer shirt. For the first time, we see that Gabriel has a
large tattoo on his back which looks like this:
IX
He's sweating a lot.
GABRIEL
Am I crazy, or is it getting
hotter?
SIERRA
Oh, you're crazy.
She hands him back the water bottle.
He gladly drinks.
When she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. The
motion leaves them face-to-face. She pauses for a moment,
just long enough for him to turn away.
He doesn't.
She kisses him. He doesn't really kiss back -- but he
doesn't fight it, either.
She puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside.
Only
when she reaches his crotch does he pull back.
GABRIEL
I have a wife. And a daughter.
They're waiting for me.
SIERRA
Where are they?
84.
GABRIEL
Back at the car.
SIERRA
I mean, which direction?
GABRIEL
They're back...
Gabriel turns, trying to get his bearing.
The trees BLUR.
He nearly falls over.
He manages to steady himself.
SIERRA
Face it, G.: You don't know where
they are. You don't know where you
are. We've been walking in circles
for an hour.
GABRIEL
Where's your car?
SIERRA
There is no car. That was all a...
(what's the word)
"pretense," I guess. An excuse to
get you alone.
Wobbling, Gabriel sits down on a stump.
Sierra kneels down
in front of him.
SIERRA (CONT'D)
Dizzy, huh? It's probably just the
GHB. In the water.
She holds up the water bottle.

Gabriel experienced the flashbacks.
He felt time move.
GABRIEL

SIERRA
I'm sorry it had to come this, G.
But it'll all be over soon.

GABRIEL
You're trying to kill me.
SIERRA
No! No. This isn't a murder.
It's an intervention.

SUSAN
I had to get you away from her. She
was holding you back. You had to
give her up.

But you

SUSAN

You're

Gabriel dry-heaves.
Sierra rubs his shoulders.
SIERRA
That's right. Just let it go.
Let
it go.
She's genuinely empathetic -- she doesn't enjoy his
suffering.
GABRIEL
Why are you doing this?
SIERRA
You did it to yourself.
Admitting
that is the first step.
She comes around to face him. And now we see they're not
alone. Two other familiar faces approach:
THE PAROLE OFFICER/AGITATED MAN, and
OCTAVIA.
86.
They're Nines as well.
SIERRA (CONT'D)
You're a crack-head, G. The thing

It's not that hard to make a
universe. At first, you just
checked in every once in a while.
See how the Neanderthals were
doing. Move some continents
around. But then you got more into
it. Starting playing a couple of
characters of your own. Kings.
Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon,
you were playing 24/7.
G.
How long have I..?
S.
You've been gone for four thousand
years. Not that time means the

You came looking for me.

nice. It's cozy. But do you

mother's shoulder, watching the videotape with her.
ON SCREEN, with tinny audio: (from scene 177)
MARGARET
You could destroy the world with a
single thought.
(suddenly)
Don't, incidentally. Just file
that away. But the truth is, you
hold all the cards: every church,
every candle, every sacrifice --
that's for you. When people pray,
they're not praying because they
want this thing or that thing.
They just don't want to be

Next week, you'll be back here
redesigning the pinecones. You
have to quit cold-turkey.
GABRIEL
I can't.

SIERRA
You can. But I can't force you to

BACK YARD - DAWN
Gabriel stands in the doorway, looking out at the inky-blue
sky. His eyes are red, tired. He hasn't slept at all.
It's very quiet, except for the occasional precocious BIRD
CALL.
Mary enters from the living room, still in her pajamas.
He
knows she's there. Neither wants to speak.
MARY
You need to go, don't you?
GABRIEL
No.
I can stay.
MARY
How long? Forever? Every day,
you'd know what you were missing.
He smiles, a little.
MARY (CONT'D)
What happens? If you go.
GABRIEL
Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous
disintegration into a fiery void.
Oblivio accebit. The end of
everything.
MARY
That's all?
Both smile.
GABRIEL
That probably wouldn't happen. The
basic structure of the universe
should hold. I guess I'm just
worried about the human factor.
You guys kill each other a lot.
92.
MARY
In fairness, that's usually in your
name. Plus we've gotten much more
efficient at it.
A beat.
GABRIEL
I like this world. I like my life,
here, with you and Noelle...
MARY
But it's not real. I'm not really
your wife, you're not really my
husband. On some level, it's all
pretend.
GABRIEL
It's not pretend. There's a reason
you were there, in every version.
You were my sister, my wife, my
best friend...
MARY
That's a little creepy.
GABRIEL
I wanted you close. In one
version, I even told you. I warned
you that some day they might come
for me, and...
MARY
...You'd have to leave.
How many
versions were there?
GABRIEL
Ninety.
This is the last one.
MARY
Wow.
GABRIEL
I've destroyed billions of people
with a thought. Obliterated them.
And you'd like to think it's
painless...
MARY
Stop. You don't have to explain, or
apologize. Everything that is, is
because of you. If that's all,
that's enough.
With that, there's really nothing more to say.
93.
MARY (CONT'D)
So.
GABRIEL
So.
MARY
Guess you don't really need to pack
anything.
GABRIEL
I'm good.
MARY
You're great. It's been a
pleasure.
GABRIEL
Likewise.
I love you.
MARY
Love you, too. Ya big lug.
He kisses her. It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending
kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. At the end of it, he
WHISPERS into her ear:
GABRIEL
You're my favorite.
She smiles.
With two fingers, Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet
around his left wrist.
And in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary
between water and air.
He's stepped out of this dimension.
Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice
that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two-
dimensional images.
She and everything around her has become like wallpaper,
slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath.
Gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light.
The light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that
ripple through the tissue-thin walls.
Picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window,
heading west.

swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness.
We see three lights in the distance.
We join them, moving

Further ahead, more lights, circling. It's a loose spiral
made of stars, resembling nothing so much as the number 9.
