      An old Dodge TRUCK with plates reading  Mexico  is in line at 
      a BORDER CHECK POINT.

      INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

      Two TEEN BOYS are in the cab of the truck. A BORDER PATROL 
      OFFICER stands ahead waving cars through. He glances at the 
      Truck and puts up his hand and waves for them to pull over.

                                      DRIVER
                    We re so screwed. 

                                      PASSENGER
                    It s routine. Don t freak. 

      EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

      The window rolls down. The BORDER PATROL OFFICER leans in.

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    Where you going? What re your 
                    plans? 

      ALEX, the driver, 15, says nothing. 

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    Help me here. 

      The passenger, JORDI PALACIOS, 14, leans over from his side. 
      He is wearing a Dodgers hat and has enormous eyes radiating 
      an old soul. Except at the moment, he appears somewhat 
        hyperactive.

                                    JORDI
                    We re going to a Dodger game! Yes!  

      Alex looks apologetically to the Officer.

                                    ALEX
                    My cousin Jordi is crazy. 

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    Passport, Jordi. And yours...

      Alex gives Jordi a look like idiot. Unfazed Jordi hands his 
      passport to the Officer. Alex slowly reaches for his wallet.

                                    JORDI

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    I can read. 

      He looks down at the picture of Jordi with his longish hair, 
      then looks up scrutinizing him now.

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    Can I see you without your hat on? 

      A BEAT. A moment of decision for Jordi. He takes off his hat 
      revealing he s completely bald. 

                                    JORDI
                    I shaved it for the Dodgers. For 
                    luck. 

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                              (to Alex, amused)
                    He is crazy. The Dodgers suck.

      He hands Jordi his passport back and waves them through. 

      INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

      They ride in silence, relief dripping off them like sweat. 
      Alex checks the rear view mirror and sees they re clear.

                                    ALEX
                              (panicked)
                    Dodger Game? Are you friggin nuts?

                                    JORDI
                    I had to distract him... If he saw 
                    you don t even have a drivers 
                    license we d be on the bus back to 
                      Concepcion right now. 

      Alex is sitting on 6 inch stack of newspapers so he can see 
      over the steering wheel. Jordi looks at a map on his phone.

                                    JORDI
                    Look for signs for the 405. 

      Jordi puts his hat back on. He leans back and closes his 
      eyes.

      wrist. It belongs to LEO ROTH, 15, charismatic, confident,

                    Recently Leo had started hanging 
                    out with Ace Salzburg. And
                    Ace Salzburg was never boring.

      A HOT FEMALE BODY in a cheerleading uniform soaring through 
      the air. She gets caught clumsily in the arms of a MALE 
        CHEERLEADER. 

                                    HOT CHEERLEADER
                    Ow! You just gave me niplash! 

      KARA SOUDERS, 16, is dictator of the CO-ED CHEERLEADING 
      SQUAD. Beautiful, smart and mean. She would have made an 
      awesome Nazi. 

                                    KARA
                    Are you manstrating? You have no

      We pull back to reveal the rest of the CO-ED CHEERLEADING

                    This water sucks by the way. 

      Kara thrusts the bottle into the hands of LOW SELF-ESTEEMY

      Kara suddenly begins to sway. Her eyes roll back as she loses 
      consciousness falling to the ground, landing spectacularly on 
      a pile of towels, legs splayed.  

      Water Girl runs to Kara and throws the pee/water mixture on 
      Kara s face to revive her.

      A SLEEPING BOY in bed: This is CHARLIE, 13, our narrator.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                      Neanderthals were considered adults 
                    when they turned 9, which had to 
                    bite. Today you re considered an 
                    adult when you re like in your 
                    20 s, which is probably bad for the 
                    future of mankind but lucky for me 
                    cause I m in a coma. Yeah, this is 
                    me, talking to you. In a coma.  
                    Deal with it. 

      FLASHBACK A MOM, small and intense, listens to a DOCTOR 
      droning on with no bedside manner.

                                      DOCTOR
                      Consciousness is as fragile as pulling a 
                    wet napkin from the sides.

                    The doctor actually said that to my Mom 
                    to explain why I was in this coma. That 
                    was like a year ago.  

      With the super human strength only a mom whose child s in 
      danger can possess, she SLUGS the Doctor.

                    My mom applied pressure to his face with 
                    her fist. I guess it was all those kick 
                    boxing lessons.

      The Doctor crumples to the ground writhing in pain.

                    The thing about a coma is you can hear 
                      everything, you just can t respond. It 
                    can be so friggin annoying...

                    Remember that song about the 
                    bicycle you loved you were little? 
                    It was by that band from England... 
                    What were they called?... The lead 
                    singer had big teeth...

                    I could check on my phone...

      Mom s voice fades out and we just hear Charlie.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Here s what I miss, the smell of pizza,

                    Thank you Sam. The Barista was one 
                    of those home schooled types. I 
                    wasn t sure if he could even spell 
                     Scary  without adding an  e  but 
                    he managed. 

                                    SAM
                    I m sure you inspired him.

      Jordi walks to the Admitting Desk. 

      KARA, on a gurney is wheeled past him yelling at a PARAMEDIC.

                              (to the Paramedic)
                    Did you even brush your teeth this 
                    morning? Your breath smells like 
                    toe nails.

      They disappear through sliding doors. 

      A NURSE looks up at Jordi.

                                    NURSE
                    May I help you?

      Jordi removes his hat showing the Nurse his bald head.

                                    JORDI

                                    JORDI
                    Dr. McAndrew. He said to page him.  

      McAndrew s name gets Jordi immediate results.

                    Of course. I ll call right away. 
                    Wait over there.

      Jordi goes to sit down. As he waits his turn he observes A

      INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

      Hernandez is walking in a hurry. She stops, smelling 
      something. She traces the smell to the supply closet door. 
      She opens it.

      INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

      Leo and Ace sitting in a cloud of smoke are face to face with 
      the ultimate buzz kill, Hernandez. 

                                      HERNANDEZ

      INT. HOSPITAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - MORNING

      Teacher, JOSE FONG, is mid-lecture. The blackboard reads: 
       HENRY V by William Shakespeare.  

                                    FONG
                      Displaying intelligence and 
                    charisma, Henry is a teenage prince 
                    with more than a few problems. 

      Leo and Ace enter in the back. It causes a stir with OTHER 
      STUDENTS as everyone is happy to see them. 

                                    FONG
                    Nice of you two to show up. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Here s the weird thing about a  
                    hospital -- you becomes friends  
                    with kids that you d never know in  
                    a million years. Losers, populars, 
                    stoners, nerds -- the walls kind of 
                    fall down.

      Leo s happy to see a beautiful Indian-American girl. EMMA 
      MEHTA, 14. Honors student, smart, funny. She s too thin.

                                    ACE
                    Your girlfriend s here.

                                    LEO
                    Shut up.

      Leo wheels over to where Emma s sitting. There s a definite 
      tension between them based on some mutual history.

                                    EMMA
                    Hey. Why are you in that chair?

                                    LEO
                    Why are you so skinny?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Emma and Leo suck at doing casual. 
                    They hooked up a few months ago.

      FLASHBACK Emma and Leo making out in a supply closet. There s 
      genuine heat. They stop and look at one another overwhelmed. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    And it freaked them both out. 
                    Because they both felt it and they 
                    didn t want to.

                    So now they re obsessed with making 
                    each other miserable. 

      PRESENT Emma draws something and slides the paper to Leo. 

                                    EMMA
                    I drew this just for you.

      It s a drawing of a dick. 

                                    LEO
                    Nice.

      Fong s pissed they aren t paying attention.

                                    FONG
                    Leo, tell us about Catherine s 
                      relationship with Henry.

                                    LEO
                    She s totally hot for him. 

      This gets laughs from the room. Emma shakes her head. 

                                    EMMA
                    No, she s not. They can t 
                      communicate. He speaks horrible 
                    French. She doesn t speak English. 

                                    LEO
                    See, around her he doesn t have to 
                    be the best at everything. That s 
                    why she s into him. 

                                    EMMA
                    No, that s why he s into her.

                                    FONG
                    Henry s a total pleasure seeker but 
                    he has no close friends. Why? 

                                    LEO
                    He s going to war and getting too 
                    close to anyone s a bad idea.

                                    FONG
                    Explain.

                                    LEO
                    Because then it won t be hard to 
                    say good bye.

      This just slips out. Fong takes this in.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 12

      INT. EXAM ROOM - MORNING

      DR. WILLIAM MCANDREW, 35, rock star pediatric oncologist and 
      surgeon. Tries not to get too attached even though it s 
      impossible. He s so handsome it hurts to look at him.

                                    DR. MCANDREW
                    You re not my patient. I can t find you 
                    in the system. Who referred you?

                                    JORDI
                    Me. I referred me. It takes months 
                    to get an appointment with you. And 
                    by then my cancer will have spread. 
                    So I told them I was already your 
                    patient. And by law they can t turn 
                    me away at the ER. 

                                    DR. MCANDREW
                              (quietly impressed)
                    Not bad. 

      Jordi reaches into his backpack and hands McAndrew a folder.

                    It s in Spanish.

                                    DR. MCANDREW
                    But I don t work like this. Go back 
                    to your original doctors. They know 
                    what they re doing. 

      McAndrew hands Jordi back his file and heads for the door. 

                                    JORDI
                    I knew my odds of getting you as my 
                    doctor sucked, but I figured what 
                    the hell? Maybe I had a chance. I 
                    mean what was the chance I was 
                    going to get cancer? And here I am.   

      McAndrew stops. He almost made it out the door. Fuck.

                                    DR. MCANDREW
                    I take it the word  no  is not in 
                    your vocabulary. 

                                    JORDI
                    If  no  was in my vocabulary why 
                    would I be asking you to say  yes?

      McAndrew looks at Jordi, he just got himself a new patient.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)

                    No. He s in a coma. 

      Kenji leaves. Kara looks at Charlie. She walks over and pokes 
      him. Hard. No response. She snaps her fingers by his ear.  

                                    KARA
                    You don t mind if I smoke do you, 
                    Coma Boy?... I didn t think so.

      Kara grabs her bag, takes a cigarette and lights it. She sits 
      on her bed, lies back and takes a deep drag. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    You gotta wonder what I did to 
                    deserve this. 

      Kara goes over to Charlie and blows the smoke into his mouth.  
      It comes out his nose.

                    That s Rosemary s Baby in 3115. 
                    Ignore her.

                                    BRITTANY
                    And my boyfriend s playing tonight 
                    so I was wondering if I could go 
                    hear him for just one hour. On my 
                    break.

                                      HERNANDEZ
                    Brittany, how long have you been 
                    working here?

                                    BRITTANY
                    Six weeks.... I drove out with my 
                    boyfriend and our dog. From 
                      Springfield. The one in Missouri. 
                    Not the one in Illinois... 

      Hernandez dumps the muffins in the trash. Brittany flinches.

                                      HERNANDEZ
                    You re assuming I care. 

      INT. CHARLIE AND KARA S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Kara s repeatedly pressing her call button with no response. 

      Kara goes to Charlie s call button and hits it. Happy, she 
      gets back in her bed, pulls out her new iPhone and starts 
      playing a game. 

      Breathless, Hernandez races in. She heads straight for Charlie.

                                      HERNANDEZ
                    Charlie? Charlie...

      Hernandez takes his vitals. No change. She looks at Kara.

                    with grilled chicken, dressing side 
                    and a peach Snapple. 

      Kara gives her a dismissive wave. Hernandez smiles.

                                      HERNANDEZ
                    Coming right up. New iPhone?

                                    KARA
                    Yeah, jealous much?  

      Hernandez whips the iPhone from her.

                                    KARA
                    Hey!

                    You don t scare me. You re just 
                    some loser nurse who rides the bus.

                                      HERNANDEZ
                              (waving Kara s phone)
                    Gotta go make some calls. 

      Hernandez leaves.

      More like a dorm than a hospital room, there are pictures of 
      Leo with his PARENTS, a photo of him playing SOCCER, with a 
      GIRL at the beach, with his team.

                    You don t get it. It s not just the 
                    roommate. It s their parents 
                    coming, their grandparents, their 
                    stupid friends.

                    So he must be a total loser.

      McAndrew looks up to see Jordi in the doorway with Brittany. 

                                    BRITTANY
                    Hi, Leo. Jordi, this is your bed. 
                    I m going to order you some lunch.

      Brittany leaves. 

                                    MCANDREW
                    Jordi, meet Leo Roth your new 
                    roommate. Leo, this is Jordi Palacios.

      McAndrew goes. Jordi looks around. He s quiet. It s awkward.

      As Jordi looks around the room the enormity of his situation 
      is finally catching up with him. His courage now transforming 
      into fear. He fights it.

                    Why re you here?

                    taking it off tomorrow.  

      A beat. Leo s face. It s all making sense to him.

                                    JORDI
                    I know that silence. No one knows what to

                    Easy for you to say.

                    Not really.

      Leo pulls back the blanket and reveals to Jordi and to us, 
      why he uses a wheelchair. He s missing his leg. Now it s 
      Jordi s turn to be silent.

      INT. CHARLIE AND KARA S ROOM - DAY

      A hospital volunteer, NICK, 34, a scruffy hot rocker is 
      playing his guitar, singing. His voice is beautiful. He s 
      singing  Fix You  to Charlie. 

                                    NICK
                    Lights will guide you home. 
                    And ignite your bones. 
                    And I will try to fix you.

      Nick begins the guitar rift.

                                    KARA
                    Will you stop it already! I ve 
                    blown like five levels of Candy 
                    Crush since you came in! 

      Nick stops playing.  

                                    NICK
                    What would you like to hear?

                                    KARA
                    Silence. Your taste s so average it 
                    hurts me. Scoop some vanilla on

                                    NICK
                    You re tough.

                                    KARA
                    Why would you volunteer for this? 
                    Don t you have a real job?

                    I have a job for money but I 
                    consider this my real job. 

      Nick puts his hand on Charlie s forehead gently.

                                    NICK
                    Hey, Charlie. 

                                    KARA
                    It s not like he can hear you.

      She rolls her eyes and goes back to Candy Crush. Nick grabs 
      his guitar and leaves. Just then, Charlie rips a huge fart.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 20

                    her till her eyes water. 

      It travels fast over to Kara. She s being gassed. She puts 
      her pillow over her face.

                                    KARA
                    Ahhh! Sewage fart!

                    There are still some things I do 
                    really well. 

      INT. THE SWAMP - DAY

      Leo is wheeling himself towards the door.  

                                    JORDI
                    Where are you going?

                                    LEO
                    Maybe you do.

      Leo leaves Jordi alone. He looks around and spies an extra 
      wheelchair. 

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Leo wheels down the hall unaware Jordi s right on his tail.

      INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY

      Leo gets in the elevator. Jordi, from the other side, wheels 
      in taking Leo by surprise. The doors shut.

                                    JORDI
                    Does it hurt?

      Beat. Leo chooses his words carefully.

      Leo and Jordi wheel out into a different world. It s all 
      adults. Still architecturally beautiful, but a different vibe.

                    a rich old hippie. Not a stoner. 
                    There s a difference.

      INT. EMMA S ROOM - DAY

      Emma sits at a small table reading her Chemistry textbook. 
      Her food is barely touched. A Nutritionist writes on a pad 
      notating what she s eating then heads out.

      Kara wanders in wearing her cheerleading uniform with her arm 
      in a sling. 

                                    EMMA
                    Uh... hello? You looking for 
                      something?

      Kara sits across from Emma.

                                    KARA
                    Yeah. You gonna eat that?

                                    EMMA
                    Excuse me?

      Kara gives her a look like,  Cut the crap. 

                                    KARA
                    Look, I m hungry. I want to eat, 
                    but I don t get the good stuff.  
                    You don t want to eat, but your 
                    food is made by a private chef. So 
                    help me, help you. 

      Emma nods in the direction of a bowl of quinoa. Kara puts the 
      bowl in her lap under the table. She eats a few quick 
      spoonfuls while Emma keeps her eye on the door.

                                    KARA
                    Did you ever try the salted ice 
                    cubes diet? That s supposed to 
                    really work if you can stick to it. 

      Kara puts the empty bowl back on the table and picks up half 
      a turkey sandwich. Emma sees the Nutritionist in the hallway.

                                    EMMA
                    She s coming. Hide it.

                                    KARA
                    Where?

                                    EMMA
                    Your sling.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 25


      Kara quickly stuffs the sandwich in her arm sling. The 
        Nutritionist comes over and sees Emma s eaten half a 
      sandwich. She gives Emma a positive nod and moves on.

                                    KARA
                    You re a good liar. I wish I had 
                    your willpower. I have cigarettes 
                    and Adderall if you get hungry. 
                    Room 3115.  

                                    EMMA
                              (proudly)
                    I don t smoke, drink or do drugs.

                                    KARA
                              (with total sarcasm)
                    It s so unhealthy, right? Not like 
                    starving yourself.  

      INT. ACE S ROOM - DAY

      Ace lies in his bed while Brittany gives him a sponge bath.  
      She notices a copy of Twilight on his bedside table.

                                    BRITTANY
                    Twilight? I love Twilight. 

                                    ACE
                    I m only reading it to attract a 
                    Mormon.

                                    BRITTANY
                    You have a thing for Mormons?  

                                    ACE
                    No, just Mormon donors. They don t 
                    smoke, drink or do drugs. Their 
                    lungs are perfect for transplant.  
                    I carry it around the ICU and ER to 
                    see if any family members or 
                    patients will spot me.

                                    BRITTANY
                                (disappointed)
                    So you haven t actually read any of 
                    it?

                                    ACE
                    Sorry, I gave up when she wrote 
                    about how he sparkled.  
                    Brittany, I need to talk with you 
                    about something...  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 26


      Ace looks at her with real vulnerability. 

                                    BRITTANY
                    What? 

                                    ACE
                    I feel really close to you. I mean 
                    we re not that far apart in age. 
                    You re super hot and you re a 
                    really good person...  

                                    BRITTANY
                    Thanks, Ace. For that last part.

                                    ACE
                            (a beat)
                    I never said this before. I m 
                    scared that I might die... a 
                    virgin.

                                    BRITTANY
                    Don t say that. 

      Brittany s sponge reaches his lowers. Her eyes widen. He s 
      got  a rocket in his pocket.  

                                    ACE
                    And I would hate to waste that. 

      This bath is so over. Brittany attempts not to freak.

                                    BRITTANY
                    I need to get your mist machine.

      Brittany pulls over a cart with an oxygen mask.

                                    ACE
                    You could be my Bella and give me 
                    that singular experience I can 
                    carry with me into eternity. 

                                    BRITTANY
                              (flustered)
                    Now you have to breathe with this 
                    for half an hour before postural 
                    drainage therapy.

      She puts the mask on Ace. He pulls it down.

                                    ACE
                    What if we just make out? I can get 
                    roof access. The view s amazing.

                    We could watch the helicopters land 
                    with injured from crashes on PCH.

      Brittany walks out the door. She s clearly upset.

                    What?... Not enough sparkle?

      INT. CHARLIE AND KARA S ROOM - DAY

      Charlie s lying in his coma singing in his mind.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Then you give it all you got
                    Fat bottomed girls, you make the 
                    rockin  world go round...

      Charlie singing Queen s greatest hits for the comatose. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I want to ride my bicycle. I want 
                    to ride my bike. I want to ride my 
                      bicycle...

      We pulls back and see Water Girl s sitting on Kara s bed 
      patiently waiting with flowers. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    She s so digging my show.

      Kara enters none to happy to see Water Girl

                    You re okay. I m so relieved. When 
                    I saw the bed was empty --

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Kiss her. You know you want to.

                                    KARA
                              (defensive)
                    Of course I m okay. I m just waiting 
                    for my parents to pick me up. This 
                    place is a total freak show. 

                                    WATER GIRL
                    These are from the whole squad.

      Water Girl tries to hand Kara the flowers, but she refuses.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Damn.

                                    KARA
                    You re using this as an excuse to 
                    see me. And you didn t need to call 
                    9-1-1.

                                    WATER GIRL
                    You were unconscious.... I thought 
                    you might have hit your head or 
                    broken your neck... 

                                    KARA
                              (cutting her off)
                    You saw an opportunity and you 
                    grabbed it. I ve seen the pictures. 
                    I can overcome it because I look 
                    super hot in them, but you need to 
                    be honest with yourself.

      Water Girl visibly flinches. Her hurt is palpable.

                                    WATER GIRL
                    You want me to be honest? The only 
                    reason I m here is because nobody 
                    else would come. 

                                    KARA
                    What?

      For a nanosecond, this gets to Kara.

                                    WATER GIRL
                    I felt sorry for you.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 32


      This hits a nerve in Kara s defense mode that goes deep. It s 
      her Kryptonite. 

                                    KARA
                    You felt sorry -- for me?... 

                                    WATER GIRL
                    At least I have some compassion. 
                    Everyone else just hates you.

      Water Girl dumps the flowers in the trash and leaves.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                      Impressive. 

      Kara tries to call out to Water Girl, but no sound comes out.

      She puts her hand to her heart. It s happening again. She 
      attempts to reach for the call button but she s beginning to 
      lose consciousness. She squeezes it just before PASSING OUT.

      INT. PEDIATRIC NURSES STATION - CONTINUOUS

      Kara s call button LIGHTS UP AND BUZZES. Kenji looks at it 
      and shakes his head.

      Hernandez waits for the inevitable second buzz, but it 
      doesn t come. The silence unnerves her.

                    That girl would never do anything 
                    once if she could do it twice.

      Hernandez takes off, running full speed to Kara s room.

      Hernandez rushes in and sees Kara lying on the floor, all 
      color drained from her face.

      Sunlight. Bright. Hot. Charlie sits at the top of the high 
      diving board in swim shorts. Kara comes climbing up the 
      ladder to the top, wearing a butt ugly bathing suit.

      Jordi is a foot smaller than Ace. He doesn t back down.

      INT. PARKING GARAGE VALET - AFTERNOON

      Expensive doctor s cars are lined up in a row of the garage. 
      A white BMW pulls up. The driver is the valet, J.J. who gets 
      out tossing keys to Ace who s waiting with Leo and Jordi.

                                    J.J.
                    I hate this guy. I call him      
                    Dr. Mo-Fo because he hasn t    
                    tipped me in a year. This car means 
                    more to him than his patients. 
                    Twenty minutes, that s all. 

      The three of them get in and pull out. Ace is a fast and 
      terrible driver. Music:  Electric Avenue,  by Eddy Grant. 

      EXT. WESTWOOD LIQUOR STORE - DAY

      Ace, Jordi and Leo are outside finishing In & Out take-out.

                    That s not gonna be a problem.

      Jordi pulls a cup out of the garbage and hands it to Leo. 

                                    LEO

                    Is that any way to talk to a person 
                    with one leg?

      Jordi grabs the cup from Leo.

      INT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

      Ace puts a case of beer on the counter. He has a wad of cash. 
      The CASHIER, Hispanic, weary looks at him.

                                    CASHIER
                    I.D. please? 

      Ace pulls out an I.D. and hands it to him.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 38

                              (examining I.D.)
                    I m not taking that.

      Ace launches into the faux outrage of a teen with a fake I.D.

                                    ACE
                    What? This has never happened 
                    before...

                                    CASHIER
                    It s happening now.

                              (in Spanish to Cashier)
                    Help out a brother here. He s just 
                    trying to get the crippled kid laid 
                    over there. 

      Jordi points to Leo who s standing outside on his crutch. The 
      Cashier puts his fist over his heart and nods.

                    That s a beautiful thing.

      He rings up the condoms -- and the beer. 

      EXT. DOCTORS VALET - NIGHT

      Ace pulls up with music blaring from the car. He gets out and 
      pops the trunk revealing several cases of beer and In & Out 
      Burger bags. Leo and Jordi get out.

      Ace then takes in J.J. standing next to DR. MO-FO, the BMW s 
      owner, who is pissed-off to say the least. 

                                    DR. MO-FO
                    You could go to jail for this.

      Leo and Jordi look at Ace.

                                    JORDI
                              (quietly)
                    Bring your A game. 

      Ace starts coughing on cue. It s really impressive.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 39


                                    DR. MO-FO
                    You re faking. 

      Ace falls to the ground coughing harder as a CROWD gathers. 

                                    LEO
                    What kind of doctor says that to a 
                    kid with cystic fibrosis and two 
                    kids with cancer in front of a 
                      children s hospital? 

        Embarrassed, Mo-Fo gets in his car and drives off with the 
      beer and the In & Out still in the trunk. 

      Ace jumps up fast yelling to anyone who will listen.

                                    ACE
                    My beer! That doctor stole my beer!

      INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

      Leo, Jordi and Ace leave and pass Kara s high-powered mom  
      and dad, HENRY and ANDREA SOUDERS, speaking with Dr. Holzman. 

                                    HOLZMAN
                    She has an enlarged heart and it s 
                    beginning to fail. It s very rare in 
                    someone so young, but it happens. 

                                      ANDREA
                    I don t understand... how?

                                    HOLZMAN
                    She could have had an infection 
                    years ago that went undetected. I m 
                    so sorry. 

      Andrea begins to cry on Henry s shoulder. 

                                    HENRY
                    So what do we do? What s the 
                      treatment?

                                    HOLZMAN
                    We can t tell her yet. We have to 
                    monitor her and keep her 
                      comfortable. Eventually, I m afraid 
                    she s going to need a heart 
                      transplant. 

      Andrea and Henry are reeling. In total shock.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 42

                                    HOLZMAN
                    I m not sure. But I have to warn 
                    you, hearts are very hard to come 
                    by and the waiting list s long.  

                                      ANDREA
                    We ll get her on another list then. 
                    Somewhere else.

                                    HOLZMAN
                    There isn t one. A strict governing 
                    board decides eligibility and your 
                    daughter is going to have a very 
                    hard time qualifying.

                                      ANDREA
                    Why?

                                    HOLZMAN
                    There re other issues at work here. 
                    The more honestly we address them the 
                    better the outcome will be.  

                                    HENRY
                    Go ahead.

                                    HOLZMAN
                    There s a lot of young people who 
                    value their lives. I m sorry to say 
                    your daughter doesn t appear to be 
                    one of them. We tested her and she 
                    came up positive for tobacco, 
                    Adderall, alcohol, cocaine, 
                      marijuana, Xanax... and those are 
                    just the preliminary results. 

                                      ANDREA
                    Oh God... 

                                    HOLZMAN
                    Her attitude isn t the best either, 
                    all of which will put her at the 
                    bottom of the waiting list. If she 
                    gets on the list at all.

                                    LEO
                    Okay forget it. This is Jordi,
                    my new roommate.

      Emma closes her book. This gets her attention.

                                    EMMA
                    Roommate? Whoa. Let me get this 
                    straight. They gave you a roommate? 

                                    LEO
                    I must be dying, right?

                                    EMMA
                    It s all over. Finito.
                              (to Jordi)
                    You re probably going to have a 
                    single soon. What re you in for?

                                    JORDI
                    I have a problem with my leg. It s 
                    gotta go. Tomorrow.

                                    EMMA
                    Do you get to keep it?

                                    JORDI
                    Yeah, I m planning to freeze it.

                                    EMMA
                    Like wedding cake. 

                                    JORDI
                    Right. I ll take it out every year 
                    for a walk...

                                    LEO
                    That s sick even for me.

      Emma can see she s making Leo jealous by talking to Jordi.

                                    JORDI
                              (this is a compliment)
                    You re seriously twisted.

                                    EMMA
                    Thanks. Not everybody appreciates 
                    it. 

                                    JORDI
                    You should come to the party.

      Emma shoots Leo a look and smiles back at Jordi. 

      INT. CHARLIE AND KARA S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

      Nick s playing his guitar. Kara studies him.  

                                    KARA
                    Volunteer Dude, so... uh... where 
                    are his parents?

      As Kara sits up a little, her hospital gown slips revealing a 
      bare shoulder. She doesn t fix it.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Are you watching this?

                                    NICK
                    Divorced. His mom s away this week 
                    and his dad... I don t know. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    My dad was with me when I had my 
                    accident and as a result lost 
                    custody. 

                                    NICK
                    Why do you ask?

                                    KARA
                    This is going to sound cray-cray... 
                    but when I was unconscious, he 
                    asked me to tell his dad something. 

      Nick s tries to stay detached but his eyes betray real need. 

                                    KARA
                    I was probably just hallucinating.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 46


                                    NICK
                    What did he say? Exactly.

                                    KARA
                    Oh, sorry. I ll have to think hard 
                    to remember exactly what he said... 
                    in the meantime, could you go get 
                    something for me? 

      Kara twirls a long blond curl around her finger and smiles at 
      Nick. 

      INT. THE SWAMP - NIGHT

      Leo and Jordi sit in the swamp. Leo s reading Henry V and 
      Jordi s playing a game on his phone. 

                                    LEO
                    This party looks like it s going to 
                    be a total bust. I m sorry.

                                    JORDI
                    I m not. I had fun today. Sort of 
                    took my mind off things.

      Ace comes in waving a key card. 

                                    ACE
                    I got the key card for the roof 
                    from Ruben but... 

                                    LEO
                    What?

                                    ACE
                    I had to trade him the weed to get 
                    it. 

                                    LEO
                    That blows.

      Just then Kara walks in carrying a case of beer and dumps it 
      on a bed. 

                                    KARA
                    No tips, please.

      Kara takes out a bottle twisting it open with her teeth. 

                                    KARA
                    I m getting so wasted tonight boys 
                    and that s not an invitation.    FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 47


      She sits down in a chair and puts her feet up on Leo s bed. 
      He looks at her completely intrigued.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Leo always said he d die of boredom 
                    before he died of cancer.  One 
                    thing you can say about Kara. She s 
                    never boring. 

                                    LEO
                    Who are you?

                                    KARA
                    Your new best friend. Have a beer. 

                                    LEO
                    Sure.

      Emma enters. Seeing Leo and Kara hanging out Emma s instantly 
      jealous.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Toys always look better when 
                    someone else is playing with them.

                                    KARA
                    If it isn t the human Ambien. Sleep 
                    disorder clinic s on the 4th floor.

      Leo brightens when he sees her. Kara notices.

                                    EMMA
                              (shutting him down)
                    I m here to see Jordi.

                                    JORDI
                              (to Emma)
                    You made it. 

                                    EMMA
                              (glancing at Leo)
                    I did. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Now things were getting 
                      interesting. 

      INT. ADULT NURSES STATION - NIGHT

      Several Nurses enjoy the smell coming out of Ruben s room as 
      Leo, Jordi, Kara, Emma and Ace sneak behind them unseen and 
      up a door marked STAIRS -- the advantages of a contact high.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 48


      EXT. HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - NIGHT

      Leo, Jordi, Ace, Emma and Kara step outside. It s a million 
      dollar view. They turn around to see a spread of food, 
      couches and music. It s all set up just for them. Ace is 
      stunned.

                                    LEO
                    That was some trade, Ace. Nice 
                    work.

      For once Ace is speechless.

      INT. RUBEN GARCIA S SUITE - NIGHT

      Ruben s listening to Richie Havens sing  Freedom  from the 
      Woodstock live recordings as he inhales from a bong.

                                    RUBEN
                    Want some?

      We reveal McAndrew sitting across from him. 

                                    MCANDREW
                    No. I don t smoke.

                                    RUBEN
                    How long do we let them stay up 
                    there?

      McAndrew checks his phone.

                                    MCANDREW
                    Another half hour give or take.

      EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - CONTINUOUS

      Music plays. The lights of L.A. shine in the distance. Kara 
      approaches Leo. 

                                    KARA
                    I need a phone. That Nazi Nurse 
                    took mine. 

      Leo watches Emma and Jordi talking. Kara watches Leo watch 
      them.

                                    LEO
                              (distracted)
                    Oh yeah... sure. Here.

      Leo hands her his phone. Kara looks at it.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 49


                                    KARA
                              (cringing)
                    This is really old. Like 2013. 

                                    LEO
                    Can you ever just give it a rest?

                                    KARA
                              (with vulnerability)
                    If I could don t you think I would?

      For a brief moment we see the price Kara pays for being Kara. 

      INT. CHARLIE AND KARA S ROOM - NIGHT

      A phone is ringing. Nick answers. 

                                    NICK
                    I thought you wouldn t live up to 
                    your end of the deal. 

                                    KARA (V.O.)
                    I m trying... And thanks for 
                    nothing buying the beer. It s 
                    totally flat. 

                                    NICK
                    Find your music, Kara. 

                                    KARA (V.O.)
                    I found my music. Here it is.

      We see Kara s MIDDLE FINGER on Nick s iPhone via Facetime. 

      Nick stands the phone next to Charlie on the table.

      Imagine Dragons,  Demons  When you feel my heat. Look into my 
      eyes. It s where my demons hide. It s where my demons hide.

      In a series of QUICK CUTS we see --

      -- Everyone taking turns drawing on Jordi s leg with markers.

      -- Kara sitting by herself, deep in thought, looking very 
      alone. Ace approaches her.

      -- Hernandez alone in the break room next to a window. She 
      leans out to look at the night sky. She can hear the voices 
      of the party on the roof above. She knows. She does nothing.

      -- On Leo taking it all in. He looks down at his Red Bands 
      and decisively starts sliding them off his wrist.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 50


      Your eyes, they shine so bright. I wanna save that light.
      I can t escape this now. Unless you show me how.

      -- They gather around Leo who holds up the Red Bands.

                                    LEO
                    I ve been wearing these for a long 
                    time. Too long... and it s time to 
                    let them go.

      Leo tosses one to Ace.

                                    KARA
                    Ugh. Worst party favors ever.

                                    LEO
                    This is from my first trip to the 
                    ER. Ace was there too that night. 
                    It was the first time we met. 
                    Everytime his Nurse said something, 
                    he would ask,  And theeeeeeen?  She 
                    got so pissed she quit. So he 
                    demanded a new nurse -- who had 
                    actually seen  Dude, Where s My 
                    Car? 

      He tosses another band to Emma.

                                    LEO
                    Emma, this is from my biopsy. It 
                    saved my life, so I want you to 
                    wear it. To keep you safe.

      It s clear he s not going to give up on Emma easily. 

                                    EMMA
                    Thanks, Leo.

                    To Kara, this is from when I had my 
                    skin graft...

      He tosses another band to Kara.

                                    KARA
                              (cutting him off)
                    TMI. I just threw up in my mouth.  

      She tosses it back at him.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 51

                                    KARA
                    Again, blowing chunks. 

      He tosses it back to Kara. This time she reluctantly accepts.

                                    LEO
                    Jordi, this is the most important 
                    band of all. I wore it when I had 
                    my big surgery. I want you to know 
                    you re not alone. 

      Jordi takes it from Leo.

      They all put on their bands. Even Kara. Leo leans into the 
      phone holding one up to it.

      Charlie has the iPhone next to him. Nick s dozing in a chair.

                                    LEO (ON PHONE)
                    Charlie, I have yours right here.

                    Wait everybody.

      Leo positions the phone so that they re all in the frame.  
      They wave to Charlie.

                                    ALL (ON PHONE)
                    Bye Charlie.

      At the sound of his name he turns his head towards the phone.

                             ACT FOUR

      INT. THE SWAMP - NIGHT

      Jordi s reading what everyone wrote on his leg. He looks up 
      and sees Emma standing in the doorway.

                                    JORDI
                    You didn t go with everyone for 
                    FroYo?

                                    EMMA
                    No. Why didn t you?

                                    JORDI
                    Can t eat this late. Surgery 
                    tomorrow.

      She enters to sit on Leo s bed. She picks up the book of 
      Henry V lying there and realizes her Red Band is gone. 

                                    EMMA
                    Shit.

                                    JORDI
                    What?

      Emma looks away, shame and embarrassment taking over.  

                                    EMMA
                    My Red Band must have fallen off 
                      somewhere. It was too big. Or my 
                    wrist is too small.

      This is a big admission for Emma.

                                    JORDI
                    I ll find you another one.

                                    EMMA
                    But it won t be the same. 

      They look at one another. Both in the same place at the same 
      time.

                                    JORDI
                    Emma... can we dance?. I ve never 
                    danced with a girl before... And it 
                    might be a while before I get to again. 

      Emma pulls out her iPhone puts on the song indie rock song 
       Waltz.  They put their arms around each other.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 53


      Just stay with me. I don t know the notes. I don t know the 
      time. I don t know the steps and I m trying to hide.

      For a moment times stops. There s no past and no future. Just 
      Jordi and Emma in a world that makes sense. The weight of the 
      world melts off their shoulders. 

      Leo comes into the doorway and sees them. He slips out 
      without their knowing he was there. 

      The dance changes in intensity. Emma and Jordi tighten their 
      grip, holding onto one another for dear life. Ports in a storm.

      INT. ACE S ROOM - NIGHT

      Leo enters only to discover Ace and Kara making out. They 
      don t see him. 

      INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Leo sits down in a waiting area and takes out his iPad. He 
      hesitates for a moment, takes a deep breath, and taps the 
      screen.

      CLOSE-UP: QUICKTIME VIDEO FILE

      The video begins on an outdoor soccer field.

      ON LEO - His face a mix of emotions.

      ON BRITTANY - Coming down the corridor. She sees Leo, who 
      upon seeing her, quickly closes the iPad.

                                    BRITTANY
                    Illegal downloads? I won t look.

      Leo debates whether to let her in. 

                                    LEO
                    It s not illegal. Watch it with me?

                                    BRITTANY
                    Sure. 

      He then turns the iPad towards her and hits PLAY.

      It s Leo on the soccer field. And he s really good. He kicks 
      the winning goal, JUMPING up and down in victory. His fellow 
      players swarm around him, joyous. 

                                    BRITTANY
                    That s awesome... I have to go do 
                      something...  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 54


      She moves on, briskly. 

      The expression on Leo s face isn t one of sadness, but of 
      pride. He s putting the parts of himself back together.

      INT. SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT

      Hernandez walks inside. She hears something, unsure of what 
      it is or where it s coming from. She approaches the linen 
      section. She finds Brittany behind a pile of sheets, crying.

                                      HERNANDEZ
                    Didn t anyone teach you the number 
                    one cardinal sin of Pediatrics is 
                    crying on the job? 

                                    BRITTANY
                    I m sorry, I was just feeling --  

                                      HERNANDEZ
                    Who gives a crap how you feel?  
                    What matters is how they feel.
                    None of this is happening to you. 
                    It s happening to them. 

                                    BRITTANY
                    I know that. But if I deny my 
                    feelings then I ll end up like y...

      Brittany stops short. Uh oh.

                                      HERNANDEZ
                                (threateningly)
                    Like?...

                                    BRITTANY
                    ... Like this extremely talented 
                    nurse... who always acts like she s 
                    so tough but really she s really a 
                    coward in my humble opinion...  

                                      HERNANDEZ
                    Your humble opinion? And why s she 
                    a coward?

                                    BRITTANY
                    Cause it takes courage to 
                      vulnerable and she refuses to be.

      Hernandez shoves fresh linens into Brittany s arms.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 55


                                      HERNANDEZ
                    Your patient just threw up. Go do 
                    your job.

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

      Brittany arrives with clean linens. Ace is in a chair next to 
      the bed looking none too good. Kara is long gone.

                                    ACE
                              (seriously embarrassed)
                    What are you doing here? You don t 
                    work nights.

                                    BRITTANY
                    This is my first double shift.

                                    ACE
                    I don t want you to see me like 
                    this.

      Brittany takes in how vulnerable he is at this moment.

                                    BRITTANY
                              (gently)
                    Ace, it s my job. 

                                    ACE
                    How s it going? Your job...

      Now it s Brittany s turn to get vulnerable.

                                    BRITTANY
                    Tonight was really hard. This kid 
                    who I really care about broke the 
                    trust I had in him. He lied to me 
                    and made me think he cared.

                                    ACE
                    Brittany, it s against the law to 
                    do what I was proposing so don t 
                    get all high and mighty on me. It 
                    takes two. You re the one who would 
                    have been in trouble not me. 
                            (a beat)
                    And I didn t lie. I do care. 

      They look at one another. Brittany breaks the moment and 
      takes in the remnants of his partying around the room.

                                    BRITTANY
                    You might want to rethink the FroYo 
                    and Funyuns combo.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 56


                                    ACE
                    But it s so good. The sweet and 
                    then the salty.

                                    BRITTANY
                    I know, right? 

      INT. THE SWAMP - NIGHT

      Semi-darkness. Jordi is lying in bed. He can t sleep. Neither 
      can Leo.

                                    LEO
                    It s hard to sleep over the sound 
                    of your thoughts.

                                    JORDI
                    You didn t really answer my question 
                    when I asked how much it hurts. 

                                    LEO
                    Okay, it does hurt... just not the 
                    way you think it will. They give you 
                    awesome painkillers for the physical 
                    pain. What hurts most is not that 
                    it s gone. What hurts is remembering 
                    it was ever there. But then with time 
                    that memory stops hurting too. 

      Silence. Jordi is processing all of this. 

                                    LEO
                    Okay, thoughts... so loud... 
                      deafening... what? Come on...

                                    JORDI
                    I won t be me anymore.

                                    LEO
                    You will be you. You might even be 
                    more you. 

                                    JORDI
                    How?

                                    LEO
                    Because I m going to let you in on a 
                    little secret. Your body isn t you. 
                    Your soul is you. And they can never 
                    cut into your soul...

                    Now go to sleep and stop bothering me.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 57


      INT. CHARLIE AND KARA S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

      Kara s standing on a chair in front of the window. We see her 
      hands pressing sticky white hospital tape onto the glass. 
      Hard to tell just exactly what she s up to.

      EXT. CITY OF ANGELS HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

      Her shift over, Brittany is pulling out of the parking lot. 
      She s driving a beat-up Mazda with Kansas plates. She notices 
      fellow HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES boarding a city bus. One of them is 
      Nurse Hernandez. Just another person in a crowd.

      EXT. CITY BUS - CONTINUOUS

      As Hernandez waits to board the bus she glances over her 
      shoulder at the hospital. Something catches her eye. 

      HER POV -- A window of the hospital where white surgical tape 
      spells out the message: PLEASE SEND PIZZA ROOM 3115. 

      Pissed, Hernandez whips out her cell phone. Not an iPhone, 
      but a now antiquated flip phone, and punches in numbers. 

      INT. THE SWAMP - MORNING

      Jordi is being placed on a gurney to be taken to surgery. Leo 
      gives him an encouraging smile as he s wheeled out. 

      INT. PEDIATRIC NURSES STATION - MORNING

      As Jordi is wheeled past the elevator, a Delivery Man 
      balancing ten boxes of pizza comes off the elevator. His 
      shirt reads,  24 HOUR PIZZA. 

      The Delivery Man goes up to the on-duty Nurse at the desk.

                                    DELIVERY MAN
                    I m looking for room 3115.

                                    NURSE
                    Who ordered these?

                                    DELIVERY MAN
                    No name. But they re paid for.

      The Nurse points in the direction of 3115 and he heads off.

      INT. L.A. CITY BUS - DAWN

      A weary Nurse Hernandez sits on the crowded bus, her phone 
      vibrates. She looks at the text. It reads:  PIZZA DELIVERED.  
      We see the slightest hint of a smile.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 58


      INT. CHARLIE AND KARA S ROOM - DAWN

      The room is filled with open pizza boxes full of steaming 
      pizza, the smell filling the room. Charlie lies there wearing 
      a Red Band on his wrist. Kara lets in the realization that 
      she might have done something good. 

      She examines one of the pizzas.  

                                    KARA
                    This pizza is shit. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Not to me.

      Kara walks over to Charlie. She looks at him frustrated.

                                    KARA
                    So like wake up already!

      MUSIC CUE: The song  Recover  by the Chvrches.

      And if I recover will you be my comfort? Or can it just be 
      over or we can leave it there. So pick any number. Choose any 
      color. I ve got the answer. Recover. 

      INT. SURGERY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

      Jordi, wheeled by McAndrew, gets to the O.R. A NURSE slips a 
      Red Band on his wrist. Now he has two.

                                    JORDI
                    Hang on.

                                    MCANDREW
                    What, Jordi?

                                    JORDI 
                    Can I... do one thing?

                                    MCANDREW
                    Sure. 

      Jordi gets off the gurney and walks a few steps. He turns a 
      corner and when he s out of sight of McAndrew and the 
      Staff...

      He begins to run as fast as he can on his two legs. Filled 
      with exhilaration and freedom.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 59


      INT. EMMA S ROOM - DAWN

      Emma lies in bed, asleep. Jordi pulls his Red Band off his 
      wrist and leaves it on the pillow so it will be the first 
      thing she sees when she wakes up.

      INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Jordi walks towards the surgery corridor. Leo s standing on 
      crutches in the waiting area. He lifts up his wrist showing 
      off his single Red Band to Jordi who does the same. 

      ON MCANDREW - watching, proud to see what s transpired.

      ON JORDI - his expression strong, confident, and ready for 
      whatever awaits him. He keeps walking. 

      MUSIC CUE: Punk Band Astrid s cover of the Beatles, GETTING 
      BETTER

      Have to admit it s getting better. A little better all the 
      time. 

      Leo sits down in the Family and Friends area, settling in for 
      the long wait. He pulls out his paperback Henry V from his 
      back pocket and starts reading.  

      Get-ting so much bet-ter all the time.
