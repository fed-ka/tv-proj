CITY STREET - NIGHT
Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares.
A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in
fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms,
chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes
off his glasses.
FREEZE ON BEAVIS
ANNOUNCER
Beavis!
FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
BEAVIS
Freeze, butt-wipe!
An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses
a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT
ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.
OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits
would.
Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.
Butt-Head slaps a pimp.
Beavis drives, chasing a car.
Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.
BUTT-HEAD
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.
A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B.;
B&B; dive for cover just before a building explodes.
In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.
Butt-Head does the same.
Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.
A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head.
FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into
bed. Suddenly...
SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
B&B; arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely
attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy
and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
BUTT-HEAD
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
BEAVIS
No it wasn't!
BUTT-HEAD
Uh,...Oh yeah.
B&B; stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage.
PRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.
McVICKER
Why.... You... You bastards... Ge...
get out! You're suspended. One more
screw up... and you're expelled.
B&B; walk off laughing.
THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK
B&B; walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.
BUTT-HEAD
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't
know Anderson had a Camper.
BEAVIS
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.
Heh heh. TV.
B&B; walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY
ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
MARCY
Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look
at the refrigerator?
BUTT-HEAD
Uh, no.
BEAVIS
We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
MARCY
Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.
Come on in.
BUTT-HEAD
Cool. Huh huh huh.
B&B; walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.
ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME
Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
TOM
Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know,
the most important thing you can have
on a camper is a good propane regulator,
and this here's the best one they make.
MARCY
I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed
before we leave.
TOM
Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip
our whole lives and we're gonna go come
Hell or high water...
Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&B;
AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
TOM (CONT.)
What the hell is that noise?
ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
B&B; come out. Tom notices them.
TOM
Hey, what's goin' on here?
MARCY
They're here to fix the TV, Tom.
TOM
The TV ain't broken.
BUTT-HEAD
Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.
Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&B.;
TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&B; out of focus.
TOM
Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda
familiar. Ain't you them kids that've
been whackin' off in my tool shed?
BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD
Huh huh huh huh huh.
ANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back
and forth.
B&B; walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
B&B; are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has
the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight
Cowboy."
BEAVIS
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
BUTT-HEAD
What's your problem Beavis?
BEAVIS
I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a
golden, throbbing light.
BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV".
Pull back to show B&B; are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge,
featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap
Rates."
B&B; stare up, as if at a god.
BEAVIS
(crazed)
Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.
MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second
door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.
B&B;'s eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the
legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS
him.
McVICKER
Please mmm... may I have another?!
B&B; LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.
McVICKER (CONT.)
Beavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you
bastards.
BEAVIS
Can we watch your TV?
McVICKER
Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out!
Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards
the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed
by McVicker asking for another.
BUTT-HEAD
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
BEAVIS
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing
everything!
CITY STREETS - MORNING
Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with
bloodshot eyes. B&B; are in the back seat. He eyes them through the
rearview. Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a
SHRIEK.
MUDDY
One more thing. Mah wife's got this
leather satchel. It's black, about this
big. I need ya to bring it back. It's
real important. Sentimental value... Any
questions so far?
BUTT-HEAD
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
MUDDY
She sure does.
BUTT-HEAD
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
BEAVIS
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
MUDDY
Just make sure it looks like an
accident...
BEAVIS
(spastic)
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an
accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
MUDDY
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have
a drink on it.
Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon.
AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate,
fishtails to a stop, throwing B&B; onto the sidewalk, and peels
away.
BUTT-HEAD
We're gonna get paid to score.
BEAVIS
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna
get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
BUTT-HEAD
Beavis, this is the greatest day of
our lives. Huh huh huh.
LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING
The plane lands.
MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
HARLAN and ROSS, the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole B&B;'s
TV are standing outside Muddy's motel room. Harlan knocks on the
door.
ROSS
Where the hell is he?
HARLAN
You sure this is the right place?
Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered TV. No
one's there.
Muddy's four-by-four SQUEALS into the lot and skids to a stop next
to Harlan and Ross' van. Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.
HARLAN (CONT.)
You Muddy?
MUDDY
(slurring)
You the cops?
ROSS
Uh, no. Earl sent us. You know, to take
care of your wife...
Muddy grabs Ross by the collar.
MUDDY
What the hell?!... What about those other...
ROSS
Huh?
Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by-
four.
MUDDY
Dammit!!! She did it to me again!!!
HARLAN
Hey, I noticed your TV was broken. You
wanna buy a new one?
Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it.
MUDDY
I'm gonna go to Vegas and kill all
three a' them!
Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused.
Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards HITTING THE FRONT OF
THE VAN. This causes B&B;'s TV and some other loot to spill out the
back onto the sidewalk.
Ross starts to pick it up.
HARLAN
Just leave it. Worthless piece o' crap.
ROSS
Yeah, really. We gotta start stealin'
from rich people.
LAS VEGAS - DAY
MONTAGE SONG BEGINS.
Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot
Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las
Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do
With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like
"Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's
"You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best.
The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling
up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.
VEGAS - DUSK
Lights are popping on.
Billboards and signs are lighting up.
The whole strip is coming alive. Pure excitement.
VEGAS - DAWN
Sunrise.
The song rings out.
HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
More Feds and police enter.
ANGLE ON B&B;, walking past, oblivious to all else. As he walks
away, Beavis rubs his butt.
B&B;
Huh huh huh huh huh.
BUTT-HEAD
This is gonna be cool. Huh huh.
They walk to the tour bus across the street.
TOUR BUS - DAY
It takes off.
We PAN back to the hotel as Muddy arrives in a cab.

The bus parks.
THE ROAD - DAY
Dallas drives by in a slick car.
HOOVER DAM - DUSK
The lights go out.
VEGAS STRIP - DUSK
In succession, one set of lights after another goes out. The
famous strip goes dark.
CAMPGROUND - DUSK
Marcy Anderson hammers the last peg in for their tent. Tom checks
the stew on the fire and looks around.
TOM
I'll tell ya, it doesn't get any better
than this. This here is God's country.
Unspoiled and...
A rumbling interrupts him. He and Marcy turn to see:
A wall of water, heading for them.
TOM (CONT.)
Aaaaghhh!!!...
They're smashed by the flood.
HOOVER DAM - DUSK
Mass chaos. Traffic jams. Honking horns. People shouting.
ANGLE ON B&B; AND THE SENIORS, about to get on the bus.
BUTT-HEAD
That was boring. Huh huh.
BEAVIS
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and
over again.
BUTT-HEAD
Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we
find that chick.
MARTHA
Oh, we're a long ways from Washington Bob.
This is the Hoover Dam.
Martha gets on the bus. HOLD ON B&B.;
BEAVIS
Damn! Heh heh hmm heh.
They get on the bus.
HOOVER DAM - DUSK
The doors close on the tour bus. It pulls out and drives away.
SIDE OF ROAD - DUSK
At her car, Dallas watches the bus from a distance, then lays down
her binoculars, satisfied.
DALLAS
You boys better show up.
With a look at the Fed car behind her, she gets in her car and
drives down a different road.
ROAD - DUSK
The bus heads off into the desert.
DISSOLVE TO:
HOOVER DAM - MORNING
Police cars everywhere. Fire engines. Reporters. News helicopters.
Disaster.
Several A.T.F. cars pull up. Flemming and several of his agents
get out and head immediately for the dam.
TOUR BUS - DAY
It takes off down the road.
MONTAGE SONG BEGINS. (Maybe White Zombie doing something like,
"Born to Be Wild")
INSERT: A RED LINE snakes across a map to Grand Canyon.
GRAND CANYON - DAY
Gorgeous. Our seniors and others take pictures and stare in awe.
Some hold hands. One crosses herself.
ANGLE ON B&B;, nearby, also staring in awe. REVEAL they're watching
a jackass take a dump.
B&B;
Huh huh huh huh huh.
BEAVIS
The poop's coming out of the ass of the
ass. Heh heh heh.
BUTT-HEAD
Huh huh. It's coming out of the ass, but
it's also coming out of the ass of the
ass.
SIDE OF ROAD - DAY
Flemming reads a map strewn on his hood. He turns to Bork to give
orders. Bork repeats them into his radio. Several cars pull out.
INSERT: A RED LINE snakes across a map to Utah.
SALT LAKE CITY - DAY
Martha and the seniors pose in front of a classic Salt Lake City
view. A sign nearby reads "Welcome to Salt Lake City."
REVERSE ANGLE shows B&B;, taking their picture.
P.O.V. OF CAMERA shows Butt-Head's hand covering half the lens.
Framing is crooked and way off. Click and FREEZE.
SIDE OF HIGHWAY - DAY
Middle of nowhere. Confused, Martha is taking a picture.
REVERSE ANGLE shows B&B;, posing by the road sign: Baggs, Wyoming.
B&B;
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
P.O.V. OF CAMERA, showing B&B; laughing.
INSERT: A RED LINE snakes across the map to Wyoming.
CROSS-DISSOLVE BETWEEN THE BUS AND THE SIGHTS IT PASSES:

REVERSE SHOWS THE TOUR BUS driving by. More seniors rush to the

A spectacular view of Yellowstone Lake and the Rockies.
REVERSE SHOWS THE TOUR BUS. Seniors staring in awe.
PAN over to another window. B&B; press their BARE ASSES against the
window.
YELLOWSTONE/OLD FAITHFUL - DAY
MONTAGE SONG ENDS.
A RANGER/GUIDE stands in front of the seniors talking about the
geyser. B&B; are towards the front, off to one side.
RANGER
(a la Carl Sagan)
There are over two hundred active geysers
in Yellowstone Park alone. Old Faithful
here is one of the largest. During an
eruption the water can reach as high as
two hundred feet!...
BUTT-HEAD
So?
RANGER
(ignoring Butt-Head)
It shoots out over twelve thousand gallons
of water in a single eruption...
BEAVIS
That's not that much.
BUTT-HEAD
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis.
Huh huh huh. This sucks.
B&B; walk off as the flustered ranger leads the seniors to some
benches where they wait for the geyser to erupt.
YELLOWSTONE/OLD FAITHFUL - LATER
The geyser erupts. The seniors watch in sheer awe.
MARTHA
It's...incredible...!
OLD FAITHFUL/PARKING AREA - DAY
The bus idles. The last senior climbs aboard.
The driver looks around impatiently. He checks his watch.
DRIVER
I can't wait forever.
SIDE OF A ROAD - DAY
Flemming is on the radio. Bork runs up.
BORK
Chief, we got 'em! They're on a senior
citizens tour bus going east on I-40.
OLD FAITHFUL/PARKING LOT - DAY
B&B; get on a bus that looks completely different than the tour
bus.
I-40/SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY
The tour bus is stopped. Like P.O.W.'s, the seniors stand with
hands on heads. Agents search the bus.
ANGLE ON LINE OF SENIORS. Flemming walks nearby and is told:
BORK
They're not on the bus.
Flemming looks the seniors over.
FLEMMING
(re: seniors)
These people know something. I want full
cavity searches. Everyone. Go deep on 'em.
Hurley and two agents grab the nearest senior and drag him away.
FLEMMING (CONT.)
I tell you Bork, these guys are smart.
Damn smart. They're probably a hundred
miles away by now.
Behind Flemming, an agent waves on traffic including B&B;'s new
bus. As it pulls past, B&B; hang B.A.'s. Flemming doesn't see.
MONTAGE SONG BEGINS:
INSERT: A RED LINE snakes through a map, pretty much retracing the
route B&B; took north. Down into Utah.
MISSION OF ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI CHURCH - DAY
A beautiful old adobe-style church. Nuns exit the bus, excited,
followed by B&B; who look around.
The nuns walk into a visitor center. B&B; walk right into the
church.
ST. FRANCIS CHURCH - DAY
As B&B; board the bus they are STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.
INSERT: A RED LINE snakes further down into Arizona.
PETRIFIED FOREST VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY
This establishes.
PETRIFIED FOREST VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY
MONTAGE SONG ENDS.
B&B; step outside. Nearby, a tourist car pulls up.
BEAVIS
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
BUTT-HEAD
Uh... I think you scared them off.
BEAVIS
This sucks. What are we doing here?
Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and
score or something?
From the car, a tourist couple heads into the building.
BUTT-HEAD
(to couple)
Uh, do you know where Washington is?
TOURIST MAN
Yeah, 'bout 2000 miles that way.
He points to the desert, then continues into the building.
BUTT-HEAD
Cool. Huh huh huh.
B&B; walk off into the desert.
PETRIFIED FOREST TOURIST CENTER - LATER
The place is crawling with A.T.F.
Flemming walks out with Bork
and the OLD RANGER.
FLEMMING
Didn't see which way they went. Didn't see
their vehicle. I don't suppose you tried
to stop them?
OLD RANGER
The most dangerous guys in America? Not
me, Sonny. I make nine dollars an hour.
FLEMMING
National security is the responsibility of
every American. Bork...
BORK
Cavity search...?
FLEMMING
Deep and hard.
Agents lead the old Ranger away.
FLEMMING (CONT.)
They're not gonna get away this time. I
want roadblocks. Every road outta here for
two hundred miles.
ROAD - DAY
IN MONTAGE SHOTS:
A.T.F. agents put up roadblocks.
Agents load guns.
Agents pile up sandbags and prepare for battle.
DESERT - DAY
WIDE SHOT. A wasteland. Scorching desert hear. B&B;, small in
frame, look lost. They're parched, weak.
BEAVIS
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
BUTT-HEAD
This desert is stupid. They need to put a
drinking fountain out here.
BEAVIS
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or
something... Are we almost there?
BUTT-HEAD
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or
something.
ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD. Lost, alone, B&B; wobble like they haven't
long to live. Overhead, vultures circle.
ANGLE ON B&B;, exhausted, spent. Staring ahead, Butt-Head suddenly
sees something.
BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
Whoa! Check it out!
Beavis clears his eyes and sees it too.
B&B;
Yes! Yes! Huh huh huh.
Excited, saved, they rush weakly forward.
B&B;'S P.O.V. REVEALS they rush to: A GIANT BIG SCREEN TV.
BEAVIS
Turn it on! Turn it on!
As they get closer it disappears - just a mirage.
BUTT-HEAD
Uh...
BEAVIS
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
ANGLE ON SUN, brightening. The FRAME WHITES OUT.
ROADBLOCK - DAY
Cars are backed up into the horizon.
The car up front is waved on. Up next: Tom and Marcy. An agent
steps over and shows the picture of B&B.;
TOM
Something wrong, Officer?
AGENT
Sir, we're looking for these two
fugitives.
ANDERSON SQUINTS to see.
HIS P.O.V. REVEALS the photo out of focus.
ANDERSON
Why I'll be danged. It's those boys been
whackin' off in my camper...
AGENT
You saw these two?
ANDERSON
I sure did. They were whackin' off in my
tool shed. Then whackin' off in my camper.
I never seen so much whackin' off.
The agent steps back and shouts into his walkie-talkie:
AGENT
Blue Den this is post nine! I have
positive ID!! (to Tom) Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you and your wife to step out of
the vehicle.
ANDERSON
Well you see, me and the missus are on our
way to Washington. We got this schedule...
The agent pulls his gun and orders:
AGENT
Now!!!!
SIDE OF HIGHWAY/JUST OFF ROADBLOCK - DAY
A BIT LATER. Agents swarm over Tom's camper, turning everything
upside, pulling out dishes, trashing everything.
TOM
(furious)
Now wait right there. You're dealing with
a veteran of two foreign wars. They're the
ones been whacking off. If I find anything
broken in there, you and I are gonna
tangle!
An A.T.F. agent smashes the micro on the ground and sifts through
the pieces.
Nearby, Flemming and Hurley watch.
FLEMMING
(appalled)
Masturbating in a man's camper! We're
dealing with two sick individuals. I want
that camper torn apart, full cavity
searches all around.
SNAP! SFX as Agent Hurley puts on her rubber gloves and leads Tom
and Marcy away.
Agent Bork runs up to Flemming.
BORK
Chief - just came in! Two days ago,
Express Airways had a disturbance by
someone calling himself - Cornholio. Guess
who matches the description?
He holds up a police sketch of Cornholio. Flemming walks to a
nearby chopper. SOUND of engine revving. Others follow.
FLEMMING
Finally, a real break. Get me that
flight's point of origin. We're gonna kick
some ass.
DESERT - DAY
B&B; walk along in the scorching heat. Ahead of them they see a
DUMB GUY and a DUMBER GUY with motorcycles parked. They are trying
to start a camp fire, LAUGHING.
DUMB GUY
(to B&B;)
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
BUTT-HEAD
(dehydrated)
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
B&B;'S TOWN/STREETS - DAY
Agents rush down the business streets. People are in a panic. It's
like an invasion.
ANGLE ON ELITE MOTOR LODGE - ON B&B;'S TV SET as agents rush by,
knocking it over with a crash.
DESERT - NIGHT
B&B; and the Dumn abd Dumber Guys are sitting around a campfire.
The Dumb Guy looks like an older, more stupid, version of Butt-
Head. The Dumber Guy is a couple of evolutionary scales down from
Beavis. Their relationship is an exaggerated version of B&B;'s.
Butt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like
the Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire,
hypnotized. Dumb Guy is eating spaghetti out of a can.
BUTT-HEAD
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
DUMB GUY
(mouth full)
Yup. Huh huh.
BEAVIS
Fire.
DUMB GUY
Here's another true story. About fifteen
years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet,
called Highland...
BUTT-HEAD
Really? That's where we're from.
DUMB GUY
Well, then you know what I'm talking
about. Anyway, here's the story. I
scored with these two chicks. True story.
BUTT-HEAD
You scored with two chicks?!
DUMB GUY
(spaghetti dribbling from mouth)
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
DUMBER GUY
Ih hih hih hih hih hih.
Dumb Guy punches Dumber Guy in the head with a closed fist.
DUMB GUY
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I
scored with both of them...
BUTT-HEAD
Uh, do you think these two sluts still
live in Highland? That would be cool.
DUMB GUY
(after taking another big bite)
Hey, you wanna see something really cool?
Huh huh huh.
Dumb Guy gets up, turns his butt towards the fire and starts to
drop his pants.
DESERT/LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS
The campfire is in the distance, middle of nowhere. A flatulant
sound is heard. Suddenly, a big beautiful purple and orange
fireball erupts, lighting up the sky.
B&B;/DUMB GUY/DUMBER GUY (O.S.)
Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
BEAVIS (O.S.)
Fire.
DESERT - MORNING
B&B; wake up. The Dumb Guy and Dumber Guy are gone. The sun is
scorching.
B&B; inch forward - spent, dehydrated, near death.
ANGLE ON GROUND as B&B; collapse into frame. Butt-Head looks up at
the sun, squinting.
BUTT-HEAD
(barely alive)
The sun sucks.
A vulture picks at Beavis' shirt. Beavis SMACKS the vulture.
BEAVIS
(to the vulture)
Cut it out butt-hole!
The vulture moves revealing a PEYOTE CACTUS. Beavis looks at it.
BEAVIS (CONT.)
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be
like, water in cactuses?
BUTT-HEAD
(semiconscious)
Uh...
Beavis takes a bite of the cactus, chews and then coughs.
BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
(sees something)
Hey Beavis, check it out.
IN FRONT OF B&B;: Two vultures start humping.
B&B;
(struggling to laugh)
Huh huh huh (cough) huh huh (cough).
ROADBLOCK - DAY
START ON SUN - over B&B;?
REVEAL it's over Muddy who looks at a picture of B&B; held by an
A.T.F. agent.
MUDDY
No, I can't say I've seen 'em. I sure hope
it's safe to drive around here.
COP
Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main
roads. If they're around, they're probably
hiding out in the desert.
MUDDY
That's good to know, Officer.
Muddy takes off with a smile and turns off onto a side road.
DESERT - LATER
B&B; barely crawling forward. Butt-Head stops, then Beavis. They're
barely able to talk.
BEAVIS
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
BUTT-HEAD
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my
life is like, flashing in front of my
eyes!
BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him
sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the
exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.
BUTT-HEAD
Whoa, my life is cool!
TIGHT ON BEAVIS:
BEAVIS
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too.
It's like a really long time ago...
BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus.
It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
BEAVIS/SPERM
Yeah, heh heh. This is gonna be cool.
Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg.
With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose.
BEAVIS/SPERM (CONT.)
Hey, how's it goin'? Heh heh heh.
Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg. His
conception looks like a dumb accident.
BACK ON BEAVIS:
BEAVIS
Yeah, heh heh I scored.
Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.
BEAVIS (CONT.)
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird.
I think I'm freaking out.
BUTT-HEAD
Huh? Huh huh.
BEAVIS
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like,
everything looks all weird and...
BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors
start shifting.
BEAVIS (CONT.)
...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's
all these weird shapes and it's sort of
like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It
could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the
lower left hand corner.
I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of
something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This
is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you...
fire!"
The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but
I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White
Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
BEAVIS' P.O.V.:
We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire.
The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
FIRE
I am God of Hellfire and I bring
you...(music begins) Fire...
BEAVIS
Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball
of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in
bikinis and various images of B&B;'s TV in all its glory.
As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass
of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B; head-banging, weird
stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the
surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as
maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the
movie.)
Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B;'s near-dead
bodies.
The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B.; REVEAL they were not
far from the side of a road all along.
B&B;
Ahhhhghhhhgh!
B&B; snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them
with a shotgun.
BEAVIS
Aagh! I'm all wet!...(realizing) Oh, cool.
Heh heh heh. Water.
Muddy aims his shotgun at B&B.;
MUDDY
Ah'm gonna enjoy this. Any last words
b'fore ah kill ya?
B&B; think.
BUTT-HEAD
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt
cheeks, huh huh huh.
BEAVIS
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say

BEAVIS
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to

MUDDY

B&B;
Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Muddy lowers the gun a bit.
MUDDY
You know, I just might need you after all.
Aw right, in the trunk. You're gonna help
me get mah unit back.
Muddy pops it open. B&B; climb in. Muddy closes the trunk on them
and walks to the front of the car. HOLD ON THE TRUNK.
BUTT-HEAD (O.S.)
Boy, it sure is hard to score. Huh huh
huh.
Muddy peels out.

Hey, Beavis, check it out. I'm jacking
off!
B&B;
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Pumping up the jack, they cause the lid of the trunk to start to
bend.
Suddenly, it pops open. B&B; are a sweaty mess. They gasp.
BUTT-HEAD
This sucks. Let's get outta here.
They look out. The road behind them races past at 80 mph. Beavis
stares dumbly.
BEAVIS
Uh, you first.
BUTT-HEAD
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really
fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
BEAVIS
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Butt-Head shoves Beavis out of the car.
BEAVIS (CONT.)
Ahhhhghghhghghgh!
Beavis tries to run, but hits the road and flips over and over -
and smashes his butt.
BEAVIS (CONT.)
Owwwwww, my butt!!!!!!
His body stops in the middle of the road. A huge truck, about to
hit him, swerves and jackknifes over the side.
Behind the truck, several cars screech to a halt, one smashing
into the other.
ANGLE ON MUDDY'S TRUNK
Butt-Head looks at the road.
BUTT-HEAD
Huh huh huh huh huh. That was cool.
ANGLE ON MUDDY'S TIRE. It hits a pothole.

lid. He bounces against the road again and again.
Finally, he loses his grip as the lid to the trunk closes.
ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, rolling along the highway.
A car, about to hit Butt-Head, screeches to a halt. Other cars
behind it smash and pile up.
ANGLE ON ROAD SOME WAYS BACK. On Tom and Marcy in their car.
TOM
Boy, what I wouldn't give for five minutes
alone with them two little bastards...
The car ahead of Tom crashes into the car ahead of that. Tom
crashes into it. And the car behind crashes into Tom.
OVERHEAD ANGLE shows cars and trucks behind, crashing, piling up.
A massive pile-up.

at:

Bork reports to Flemming. Butt-Head is held by two agents.
BORK
We just cleared all four floors. No sign
of him.
FLEMMING
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've
found him by now.
Bork sees something. It's Beavis, about a hundred yards away.
BORK
Chief, look!
FLEMMING
(picks up radio)
Attention all units. We've got him. He's
in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
OUTSIDE ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DAY
Beavis stands, T-shirt still over his head. Suddenly, dozens of
agents surround him, pointing guns at him. Beavis seems oblivious
to the danger.
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
I am the great Cornholio! I will lay waste
to your bunghole! Heh heh.
BEHIND THE AGENTS, Flemming approaches and gives orders.
FLEMMING
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the
unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't
wanna take a chance on hitting it.
BORK
Where are his pants?
FLEMMING
Who knows?
Beavis reaches to scratch his butt. Agents step back, cautious.
Flemming picks up a bullhorn and addresses Beavis.
FLEMMING (CONT.)
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't
hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us
where the unit is.
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?

agents) Get that other kid. We might need
him.

Bunghole. (Beavis) Heh heh, this is cool.
(Cornholio, chanting) Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
FLEMMING

IT HITS BUTT-HEAD'S HEAD, BOUNCES AND FALLS INTO HIS HANDS.
The agents all stare at Butt-Head - quiet, not sure what to do.
Butt-Head hands it to Flemming, nonchalant.
BUTT-HEAD
Uh, here ya go. Huh huh huh.
The crowd CHEERS.
ON ANDERSON'S CAMPER.
Tom is handcuffed roughly.
TOM
Now wait just a minute...
An agent comes out of the camper with the picture of Dallas. Bork

Flemming approaches Tom.
FLEMMING
Sooo, using two innocent teenagers as
pawns in your sick game, huh?
TOM
