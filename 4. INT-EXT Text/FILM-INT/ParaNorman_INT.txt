An attractive FEMALE SCIENTIST in a gore-spattered lab
coat moves fearfully along a wall, passing benches strewn
with broken lab equipment. Her ample bosom heaves as she
PANTS nervously, mascara-rimmed eyes darting to and fro.
Glass SMASHES on the floor nearby and MELODRAMATIC MUSIC
swells. The woman backs into a shadow, not noticing a
pair of dead eyes catching the moonlight behind her.
The music climbs to a frenzy as something GROANS horribly
into the woman's ear. She spins around on her stiletto
heels as a rotted face looms out of the darkness,
drooling through broken teeth, and lunges at her neck.
ZOMBIE
Brains!
CLOSE ON the woman as she raises her hands and SCREAMS.

Eleven year-old NORMAN BABCOCK sits on the floor
watching TV. He has large piercing eyes and a messy shock
of hair. The movie scene we just witnessed continues off-
screen with the sound of bloodcurdling SCREAMS.
Behind him sitting upon a sofa is GRANDMA BABCOCK, a
plump old lady squinting through thick glasses.
GRANDMA BABCOCK
What's happening now?
NORMAN
The zombie is eating her head,
Grandma.
GRANDMA BABCOCK
That's not very nice. What's he
doing that for?
NORMAN
Because he's a zombie. That's what
they do.
GRANDMA BABCOCK
Well he's going to ruin his
dinner. I'm sure if they just
bothered to sit down and talk it
through it'd be a different story.
Norman CHUCKLES, as if the idea is absurd, then winces as
he hears his father shout from the kitchen.

PERRY BABCOCK (O.S.)
Norman! Didn't I tell you to take
out the garbage?
NORMAN
Coming, Dad!
GRANDMA BABCOCK
Tell him to turn up the thermostat
too, will ya? My feet are like
ice.
Norman nods to her and shuffles over to the kitchen door.
3 3
Norman's mother, SANDRA BABCOCK, is emptying the
dishwasher. She is in her late thirties, and wears `mom'
clothes that do no favors for her figure. His father,
PERRY BABCOCK, is older, with a neatly-trimmed beard
trying hard to delineate chin from neck. He stands on a
chair, decked out in tool belt and safety goggles, even
though he's only changing a light bulb in a ceiling
fixture.
Sandra smiles at her son as he makes his way silently to
an overstuffed trash can as tall as he is.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Hi. Whatcha watching in there?
NORMAN
Sex and violence.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Oh. That's nice.
Perry glares over as Norman wrestles with the garbage.
PERRY BABCOCK
Can't you be like other kids your
age and pitch a tent in the yard,
or have a healthy interest in
carpentry?
SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry...
NORMAN
I thought you said kids my age
were too busy shoplifting and
joyriding?
SANDRA BABCOCK
Norman!
He hefts the bag onto the floor and ties it in a knot.
ParaNorman 3.
3 CONTINUED: 3
Breezing into the kitchen through the back door while
CHATTING inanely on her cell phone, Norman's older sister
COURTNEY is fifteen years-old and is the bleached-blonde
cheerleader archetype of every schoolboy's sordid dreams.
COURTNEY
Oh yeah, he's r-i-double p-e-d.
Like, a seven pack at least.
(TO NORMAN)
Ew! Watch it!
She pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the
garbage outside.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Courtney, be nice.
COURTNEY
Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve
him. I mean, she's nice and I
really like her, but she's a
complete loser. Yeah, I know.
Courtney slumps into a chair at the table, twisting a
strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger.
Norman returns inside and shuts the door, pausing a
moment as if thinking something over.
NORMAN
Dad? Grandma says, "Can you turn
up the heating?" Her feet are
cold.
The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face,
Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS, and Sandra pales.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Now, Perry...
PERRY BABCOCK
How many times do we have to go
through this, Son? Your
grandmother is dead!
NORMAN
I know!
PERRY BABCOCK
Then why do you keep on talking to
her?
NORMAN
Because she talks back!
COURTNEY
O-M-G, you are such a liar!
ParaNorman 4.
3 CONTINUED: (2) 3
NORMAN
I'm not making this up! I swear!
She talks to me all the time!
COURTNEY
Oh yeah? Prove it!
Norman levels her a look that says "you asked for this".
NORMAN
She said it's not very ladylike to
hide photos of the High School
quarterback with his shirt off in
your underwear drawer.
Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows.
COURTNEY
I knew it! You've been sneaking
around in my personal stuff!
NORMAN
No I haven't! Grandma told me!
COURTNEY
You are the worst!
Courtney, brimming with outrage, storms out of the
kitchen, her ponytail wagging furiously behind her.
Sandra kneels down beside Norman with a wearily
sympathetic smile.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Norman, I know you and Grandma
were very close, but we all have
to move on. Grandma's in a better
place now.
NORMAN
No she's not, she's in the living
room.
Perry throws his arms in the air, swaying on the chair.
PERRY BABCOCK
Your grandmother was old and sick,
and she died. That's all there is
to it!
SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry, this is just part of the
mourning process.
ParaNorman 5.
3 CONTINUED: (3) 3
PERRY BABCOCK
Stop indulging him! I'm nothing if
I'm not liberal, but that limp-
wristed, hippie garbage needs to
be nipped in the bud!
Norman SIGHS and steps between his parents as they argue.
He mutely heads out of the room.
4 4
Norman sits on his bed, using a couple of zombie action
figures to act out his parents' ongoing "discussion"
which carries upstairs.
Norman gets up off the bed and approaches the door.
PERRY BABCOCK
This isn't the West Coast, Sandra;
people talk! They do!
SANDRA BABCOCK (O.S.)
He's just sensitive, Perry.
PERRY BABCOCK (O.S.)
Oh please, "sensitive" is writing
poetry and being lousy at team
sports... not this! I won't have
him turn out like that uncle of
yours! If that crazy old tramp has
been around here putting ideas in
Norman's head...
SANDRA BABCOCK (O.S.)
Perry, no one's had anything to do
with Uncle Prenderghast in years!
I bet he doesn't even know what
Norman looks like!
Norman quietly closes the door, and the room goes black.
ParaNorman 6.
CLOSE ON a faded photograph of Norman, held in the grimy
hand of MR PRENDERGHAST. He stands over a dusty desk
scattered with pictures of Norman, Sandra and older
family members. He is in a dark study; a wall-to-wall
trove of curious miscellanea and dumpster-dived junk.
MR PRENDERGHAST
Not much time, not much time...
He pulls an old leather-bound book out from the mess, and
traces a finger over a woodcut illustration on its cover;
an ethereal woman lying beneath a cluster of stars.
Wincing with pain, the man drops the book and clutches at
his chest, COUGHING and GASPING horribly.
CAMERA PANS to a wall covered in countless photographs,
newspaper clippings and scrawled occult markings. It is a
shrine of sorts; a madman's recondite genealogy project,
and at its center is a photograph of Norman, posing with
his family on vacation.
ZOOM IN to the photograph, hurtling past the Babcocks and
through dense trees further and further into a dark
forest.
TITLE: PARANORMAN

Norman opens bleary eyes, turns off his zombie hand alarm
clock, and slides out of bed.
Dressed for school, Norman pauses at the front door and
turns to look at the sofa in the living room. He waves
happily, and Grandma smiles back.
Courtney passes him as she comes down the stairs in the
opposite direction. She also stops to look at the sofa,
but to her eyes it is empty. She sneers contemptuously.
9 9
An expanse of unevenly lacquered floor, scuffed by scores
of dragged heels. Rows of dented lockers line the walls.
Norman stands before his locker, across which someone has
daubed the word "FREAK" in marker. Clearly something of a
daily ritual, he reaches inside, takes out a bottle of
surface cleaner and a rag and proceeds to wipe it off.
Across the hallway, another kid is removing graffiti from
his locker. NEIL is overweight with frizzy red hair, and
is busily rubbing a handkerchief over the word "FATTY".
He watches Norman with interest.
A voice behind his shoulder gives Norman a start.
ALVIN
Hey, ghost jerk! You know what?
Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN, the only 6th
grader in his class who shaves, looming over him. He is
flanked by a couple of leering sycophants, one of whom
wears a T-shirt emblazoned with "TEAM ALVIN".
Norman SIGHS.
NORMAN
What do you want, Alvin?
ALVIN
Why don't you see some more
ghosts, goober?
ParaNorman 10.
13 CONTINUED: 13
The kids LAUGH uproariously, encouraging Alvin to show
off some more.
ALVIN (CONT'D)
Hey! Hey! Norman!
Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker
beside him. He swats it flat with his hand.
ALVIN (CONT'D)
Talk to that.
The kids around Alvin burst into LAUGHTER.
ALVIN (CONT'D)
That is so Alvin!
The bullies strut away, content in the psychological
damage they've managed to inflict.
PUG
Loser!
ALVIN
That was good, right guys?
Norman mutters as they leave, but not loud enough so as
anyone might hear.
NORMAN
Flies don't talk.
Across the hall, Neil continues to watch with sympathy,
but he is already being hurried along by his friend
SALMA, a nerdy Indian kid with braces.
SALMA
Neil, come on. Let's go.
14 14
Amidst stacked bleachers, foam mats and stray dodge
balls, a crudely constructed stage fills one end of the
gymnasium. Mediocre art class scenery represents a
colonial town, complete with plywood hills, chapel and
crescent moon dangling perilously from a basketball hoop.
In a director's chair far too small for the job is MRS
HENSCHER, an imposing woman with spectacles and beret who
looks like she smells of too-much perfume.
At the front of the stage wearing a pilgrim hat and
carrying a large scroll, is NORMAN. He is surrounded by
kids whose attempts at home made period costume leave a
lot to be desired.
ParaNorman 11.
14 CONTINUED: 14
MRS HENSCHER
You stink of illiteracy!
(A BEAT)
Pilgrims? The Mayflower? Don't any
of you know anything about the
history of this town?
Mrs Henscher tries her best to remain unfazed.
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
Puritans were strict and devout
settlers, who came here to build a
home, a place without sin. What is
it now Salma?
Salma is holding her hand up. She looks like the Wicked
Witch of the West. Even beneath green makeup and plastic
warty nose, it is clear she is not best pleased.
SALMA
Why is the witch always a hideous
old crone with a pointy hat and a
broomstick? I don't believe it's
historically accurate, Mrs
Henscher!
Mrs Henscher's knuckles clench white around her script.
She attempts an understanding smile, in the same way a
shark might.
MRS HENSCHER
It's not supposed to be. It's
supposed to sell postcards and key
chains.
(CLAPS HANDS)
So let's try it again. Top of page
six, Norman.
Norman skips ahead on his scroll.
NORMAN
The founding fathers of Blithe
Hollow discovered an evil witch
amongst them...
MRS HENSCHER
No no, Norman, with gusto! Like
this!
Waving her arms theatrically, she bellows Norman's lines,
milking every syllable for effect.
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
They put her on trial and hanged
her!
(MORE)
ParaNorman 12.
14 CONTINUED: (2) 14
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
But the vengeful witch cursed her
accusers, seven of them in all, to
die a horrible and gruesome death,
and rise from their graves as the
living dead; their souls doomed to
an eternity of damnation!
(A BEAT)
Now I want you to try that again,
but with conviction! My reputation
is at stake here, and I won't have
this turn out like that wretched
Kabuki debacle of oh-nine!
As she launches into her lecture, Norman notices a change
in the room. The lights dim, the wind outside picks up,
and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes.
Norman glances around at the other kids on the stage, to
see if they are seeing what he is seeing. For a split
second the children are replaced with faded figures in
real Puritan dress. Seven solemn figures.
As he turns around nervously, Norman sees the suggestion
of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows...
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
Norman! Are you listening to me,
boy?
Norman is brought back to the real world with a start,
and nods timidly from behind his scroll.
NORMAN
Sorry, Mrs Henscher.
MRS HENSCHER
So am I. Now, unless there's any
other issues, let us resume...
They put her on trial and hanged
her!
Neil turns excitedly to Norman.
NEIL
Ooh! This is my moment!
He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around,
not realizing Alvin has slung the hangman's noose around
Norman's neck.
Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who
keels over, rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall. He
lands on top of Salma, her kicking legs sticking out from
under him as though Dorothy's house had just landed on
stage.
The kids break into uncontrollable LAUGHTER.
ParaNorman 13.
14 CONTINUED: (3) 14
ALVIN
Boom, baby!
NEIL
Sorry!
Mrs Henscher flings her script into the air, her face
beet red.
MRS HENSCHER
Oh, you useless bunch of...
The school bell RINGS drowning out her howling voice.
15 15
As kids hotfoot it out of the building as quickly as
possible, Norman stands pitiably in front of his locker.
Fresh graffiti reads "SEE YOU TOMORROW, FREAK".
Norman heads for the door, and pretends not to hear when
Neil shouts out behind him.
NEIL
Norman, wait up!
16 16
PANTING and WHEEZING, Mr Prenderghast staggers into his
study, SLAMS the door behind him and heads for his desk.
MR PRENDERGHAST
I'll show him, and that scary
little fat kid...
He shakily rummages around the collected papers and
trinkets, and pulls out the leather bound book, all the
time GRUMBLING crazily.
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
Doesn't he realize we're running
out of t...
With a strangled CROAK he clutches dizzily at his chest,
then keels over backwards, stiffly hitting the floor with
a THUMP.
Silence, then, a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of
him, sculpting his shape in the air.
With a GASP, Mr Prenderghast's corpse sucks the spirit
back in, and he staggers back to his feet.
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
No! Not yet! Not yet!
He CROAKS again, this time for real, CRASHING back down
onto the ground.
The ghostly shape re-emerges from the body.
He blinks his eyes, looking around as if he's just been
woken from a deep sleep, then down at the defunct body
lying at his feet.
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Aw, nuts.
ParaNorman 21.
Rows of plastic chairs in front of the spotlit stage are
occupied by expectant families. Among the sea of faintly
buzzing video cameras, and a ripple of APPLAUSE, Sandra
politely smiles at the acting talents of other peoples'
children. Next to her, Perry struggles to fit a battery
into his camera.
PERRY BABCOCK
Great, now we'll never get to
remember this moment.
ANGLE ON STAGE as Salma, in full witch get-up, waves her
hands theatrically at the other children.
SALMA
I curse you accusers to die a
horrible and gruesome death and
rise from your graves as the
living dead; your souls doomed to
an eternity of damnation!
The Pilgrims who aren't dying and rising from the dead
begin to menace Salma with their farming implements, and
begin a slow ominous chant.
KIDS
Kill the witch! Kill the witch!
Sandra nudges her husband and cheerily points toward the
stage.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Gosh, aren't they adorable?
Norman hears a HOOTING sound from above. An owl with big
glowing eyes wheels down over the audience from the beams
of the gymnasium.
Norman glances around, wondering why no one else seems to
notice as it glides low and alights in the papier mache
branches on Neil's head. It turns to Norman and HOOTS.
ParaNorman 22.
30 CONTINUED: 30
He looks down from it and catches Neil's eye. Neil makes
a puzzled expression.
NEIL
What?
KIDS
Kill the witch! Kill the witch!
The chanting seems to deepen and slur and the air grows
dark and thick. The shapes of the audience and the kids
beside him swim around, blurring like a finger pulled
through oil paint. The ceiling disintegrates into clouds,
which CRACKLE with lightning.
NORMAN
(under his breath)
Oh no! Not again!
All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere, and
through the darkness in the distance are occasional
lights of small houses. This might be how this very spot
looked three centuries ago.
31 31
Norman stands next to Neil on stage, eyes closed and
WAILING. Everyone around him stares in stunned silence
as, still SCREAMING, he runs into the spotlight.
NORMAN
THE DEAD ARE COMING!
He continues running directly off the edge of the stage
and lands on the floor with a THUMP.
For a moment no one knows quite how to react. Mrs
Henscher quizzically checks her script.
Norman's eyes focus and he sees everyone standing around
him, staring. Sandra pushes through the crowd.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Norman!
MITCH
Did he say the dead are coming?
PERRY BABCOCK
(NERVOUS LAUGHING)
No, no, no!
NORMAN
YES!
Everyone jumps as Norman abruptly sits up, eyes wild.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
The tree told me!
ParaNorman 24.
32 CONTINUED: 32
Perry's face drains of color while the other parents
MURMUR and MUTTER, crowd speak for "what a weirdo".
Norman sees their expressions of disgust and suspicion.
Worst of all, peering around parents' legs with a look of
shock and fear is Neil. Norman catches his eye a moment,
and Neil looks down at the ground.
33 33
Barely keeping his fury in check, Perry drives home,
Norman sitting despondently in the back seat.
PERRY BABCOCK
This is where it stops! It's one
thing being a mental case in front
of your family, but not the whole
freaking town! There's not gonna
be any more talking to ghosts, or
grandmas, or, or... what is it
now?
SANDRA BABCOCK
I think it's trees.
PERRY BABCOCK
You're grounded! You hear me?
Perry pulls the car up in the Babcock's drive and gruffly
climbs out of the car.
NORMAN
This is ridiculous. I wish
everyone could see what I see! I
didn't ask to be born this way!
Perry mutters as he slams his door shut.
PERRY BABCOCK
Funny, neither did we.
Norman catches the remark and feels it hard in his gut.
His mother hears it too, and leans over her seat with a
look of sympathy.
A beat as she sees the pain in her son's face.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Y'know, sometimes people say
things that seem mean, but they do
it because they're afraid.
NORMAN
He's my dad. He shouldn't be
afraid of me.
ParaNorman 25.
33 CONTINUED: 33
Sandra's eyes are filled with sorrow.
SANDRA BABCOCK
He's not afraid of you. He's
afraid for you.
Sadly, Norman climbs out of the car.
35 35
Norman walks the familiar gauntlet of school kids, only
this time the abuse is tenfold.
KID #1
Look! It's AbNorman!
KID #2
What'd the tree tell you today,
Norman?
KID #3
Are the dead coming soon, Norman?
36 36
An overhead bulb casts a dim light over chipped wall
tiles and yellowed ceramic sinks with leaky faucets.
The door opens and Norman hurries inside, a number of
voices still SHOUTING behind him. He shuts the door,
cutting them off, and leans against it, taking a breath.
He heads over to the first stall. The door is locked, so
he takes the next one.
CLOSE ON Alvin, sitting on the toilet in the next stall
scribbling obscenities on the wall to pass the time. He
pauses as he hears the lid drop next door, then resumes
his vandalism.
Norman sits on the lid of the toilet, pulling his knees
up under his chin feeling sorry for himself.
ParaNorman 26.
36 CONTINUED: 36
ANGLE ON toilet paper in an industrial-sized roll. It
jitters on its mount and begins to turn slowly on its
own, unspooling sheet by sheet toward the floor. Norman
frowns and watches as it stops unravelling and a draught
of wind blows out of nowhere, ruffling his hair.
The toilet roll suddenly spins violently, flinging the
paper into the air in reams. The screws holding the
dispenser to the wall RATTLE fiercely.
The toilet underneath Norman begins to shake and shudder,
spilling water over the floor. Norman WAILS loudly as he
jumps onto the back of the cistern.
Alvin is frozen in place in his stall, hearing the noises
and really not sure how to react to them. He glances down
and sees toilet water leaking across the tiles.
He quickly pulls up his pants to cover his dignity, and
jumps up off the toilet with a SQUEAL.
In Norman's stall everything stops dead and the lid of
the toilet slowly CREAKS open.
Norman GASPS as Mr Prenderghast's face stares up at him
out of the toilet bowl. With some effort the old man's
ghost shimmies out of the toilet, eventually POPPING out
like a cork from a bottle, hovering in the air in front
of Norman's face.
NORMAN
You died?!
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Yeah, but I got unfinished
business here!
NORMAN
Ew! Couldn't you use another
stall?
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
My ghost isn't going anywhere
until I pass on my duty to
another! And that would be you!
NORMAN
Me? No, you must have it wrong!
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Oh it's you all right! I've been
holding back the witch's curse for
years, but now I'm dead. It has to
be you!
NORMAN
But I... I don't know what any of
it means!
ParaNorman 27.
36 CONTINUED: (2) 36
Before Norman's eyes the bathroom stall and everything
beyond it is ripped away, revealing thick undergrowth and
tall trees. Norman is suddenly sat on the toilet in the
middle of a forest.
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
It means the past is coming back
to haunt you! Time is running out!
The anniversary of the witch's
death is tonight. Her ghost is
going to wake up, and when she
does she'll raise the dead! You
gotta keep her in her grave!
The toilet paper on the ground twists up beneath Norman's
feet, sculpting skull faces and clutching hands that
reach for him as he shrinks back.
NORMAN
But I'm just a kid! How am I
supposed to stop it?
In an instant the air and trees around him are eaten
away, the school bathroom reappearing through the holes.
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Read from the book at the spot the
witch was buried!
NORMAN
What book?
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
The one in my hands!
Norman looks at the ghost's wispy hands.
PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)
Not these hands, my other hands!
The me that's at home in my study
starting to smell a little funny!
Norman looks sick and overwhelmed, but the ghost doesn't
let up, swirling right up to his face.
PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)
Get the book and read from it!
Before the sun sets tonight!
NORMAN
But this is crazy!
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Do I look crazy to you?
Norman pauses a beat. Mr Prenderghast is floating upside
down, various bits of bathroom detritus orbiting around
him. A piece of toilet paper dangles off his nose.
ParaNorman 28.
36 CONTINUED: (3) 36
PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)
Tell me you'll do this!
NORMAN
I... I...
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Swear!
NORMAN
Y-you mean like the "f" word?
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
I mean promise!
NORMAN
Okay, okay, I promise...
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
That'll do!
Mr Prenderghast's ghost begins to disappear, bubbling and
melting at the edges like a burning photograph.
NORMAN
No! Mr Prenderghast, wait!
Alvin, hearing only Norman's voice, gingerly peeks around
the corner of his stall.
PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Sorry kid, I'm done here! I'm
free! I'm finally free!
NORMAN
Wait! No, you can't leave now!
Please! I don't understand.
Mr Prenderghast hangs in the air a moment, face scrunched
up as he awaits his release, CACKLING crazily.
The ghost explodes into a million particles of light,
blowing open the stall door and catapulting Alvin
backwards across the room. The mirrors behind him crack
and the light bulb shatters.
From the floor, Alvin groggily looks up and sees Norman
framed in the stall with the door hanging off its hinges.
He reaches over and flushes the toilet.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Uh... yeah. You might want to give
that a few minutes.
He grabs his bag and runs out of the room.
ParaNorman 29.
Norman sprints madly for the main doors, passing Neil and
Salma who glance up from their lockers as he stumbles by.
NEIL
Norman?
Alvin tears around the corner in pursuit, but Neil stands
in his way, waving his arms indignantly.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Hey! What's the big deal?
ALVIN
Don't get your bra in a twist, fat
boy, this has nothing to do with
you! Keep out of my way!
NEIL
Or what?
ALVIN
Or I'll punch you in the boobs!
NEIL
I don't have boobs. These are
pectorals!
Alvin jabs him in the chest.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Ow! My boobs!
Neil swiftly steps aside.
Alvin reaches the door to see Norman disappearing along
the path as fast as he can. Alvin YELLS after him.
ALVIN
You're dead, freakshow! Do you
hear me? D-E-D! DEAD! You're gonna
be so dead you're gonna have to
talk to yourself when you're dead!

Wearing her fanciest dress, Sandra bustles out of the
kitchen to the front door.
PERRY BABCOCK
I really don't think we should be
leaving him.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry, you promised me a meal that
someone else microwaved.
ParaNorman 30.

He's probably up there right now
fiddling with his ouija, or his
orbs, or whatever it is he's got
up there. This is not good.
42 42
Norman paces his room looking pale and anxious as he
hears the front door shut downstairs. Everywhere he turns
he finds himself face to face with some zombie related
novelty, from his lurid horror posters to his shelves of
ghoulish action figures, and it's not doing anything for
his nerves.
His cell phone BEEPS from his pocket, giving him a start.
He takes it out and reads a text; "COME TO THE WINDOW".
Norman cautiously walks over and peers around the edge of
the window frame.
A figure stands motionless in the yard below, sheets of
laundry billowing off the clothes line beside it. It
stares up at Norman through the blank eye holes of a
hockey mask.
Norman GASPS and jumps back.
With a frown, he re-emerges and opens the window.
The figure lifts the mask, and Neil beams out from
underneath, waving excitedly.
NEIL
You wanna play some hockey?
Norman SIGHS.
NORMAN
I've kinda got other things on my
mind right now.
Neil looks a little uncomfortable.
NEIL
Is it all that walking dead stuff
again?
NORMAN
Mr Prenderghast appeared to me in
the bathroom!
NEIL
Ew.
ParaNorman 31.
42 CONTINUED: 42
NORMAN
No, his spirit! He says the
witch's curse is real and I have
to go up to the old graveyard to
stop it! Before the sun sets
tonight!
Neil shifts uneasily as he processes.
NEIL
So you wanna come play a bit
later?
NORMAN
Didn't you hear what I just said?!
NEIL
Yeah, but I thought my idea was
less likely to get us eaten.
Norman knows he's on his own in this.
NORMAN
Just go home, Neil. I'm better off
on my own anyway.
NEIL
But...
NORMAN
Go home!
Norman reaches up and closes the window. Neil's shoulders
sag and he turns away.
Across the room, his Grandma materializes, and squints
her eyes through the window as Neil awkwardly pulls
himself over the garden fence.
GRANDMA BABCOCK
Jeez, who rattled your chains?
NORMAN
No one.
Norman isn't in the mood for any more discussion.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Dad says I'm not supposed to talk
to you any more, Grandma.
GRANDMA BABCOCK
Jackass. If I were a poltergeist
I'd throw something at his head.
Y'know, by rights I'm supposed to
be frolicking in paradise with
your grandfather, but I'm not.
ParaNorman 32.
42 CONTINUED: (2) 42
Norman looks up as she drifts closer to the bed.
NORMAN
So why did you stay?
GRANDMA BABCOCK
I was never one for frolicking.
I'll bet there's no cable or
canasta up there either. Besides,
I promised I'd always look out for
you.
She smiles, floating in a sitting position at the end of
Norman's bed. She bobs gently, like a balloon. For a
second, this seems to comfort Norman, but then another
thought crosses his mind.
NORMAN
So it's your... duty?
GRANDMA BABCOCK
In a manner of speaking...
NORMAN
And you'd do it no matter what?
GRANDMA BABCOCK
Of course.
NORMAN
Even if it was something really
scary...
Grandma eyes him curiously.
GRANDMA BABCOCK
There's nothing wrong with being
scared Norman, so long as you
don't let it change who you are.
Norman thinks this over, then smiles up at her again. She
goes to rub his head affectionately, but her ghost hand
just passes right through his spiky hair.
She gives him a wink, and drifts away through the wall.
He is still scared, but now determined too. He steels
himself and grabs his jacket from his bed.
43 43
The tiny room is crammed full of posters, pom-poms, plush
toys and plastic trophies. Pretty much everything is
pink. Courtney sits talking on her phone, cotton buds
between her toes as her painted nails dry.
ParaNorman 33.
43 CONTINUED: 43
COURTNEY
So I said to her, "Girl, come back
and talk to me when your basket
toss gets twelve thousand hits on
YouTube!" Yeah, no, I said that.
(listens and nods)
Yeah, I'm stuck on lame patrol.
Tonight's gonna be a total yawn.
From downstairs, a door SLAMS. Courtney frowns, puts her
hand over the phone and shouts out.
COURTNEY (CONT'D)
Norman?!
44 44
The fading light of day spills across the floorboards and
faded wallpaper of a long passage.
NORMAN
Hello? Mr Prenderghast?
Motes of dust float around Norman as he moves slowly
toward a door, slightly ajar, muttering to himself.
He quietly makes his way past all manner of objects that
epitomize the state of Mr Prenderghast's mind; a
mannequin in a shopping cart, a pile of broken
typewriters, a suspended bag of spoons, a closet full of
identically soiled hobo suits, a Nordic track...
48 48
The study is filled with teetering piles of junk and old
furniture draped over in dust sheets. A crucifix hangs
over a metal cot with rumpled bedding. This is evidently
where the old man lived his whole life. Starlight from a
window picks out a macabre halo on a shape on the floor:
Mr Prenderghast, dead where he fell, tightly clutching a
leather-bound book.
CLOSE ON Norman's face as he swallows nervously and steps
closer to the body. He gingerly takes hold of the book
and gives a gentle tug. It holds fast in the rigor mortis
grasp. He tugs harder, shaking the book repeatedly, the
corpse shaking with it.
NORMAN
Let go!
Norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body
across the floorboards, Mr Prenderghast's head glancing
off table legs and smacking repeatedly against the
floorboards, as Norman tries to wrestle the book free.
With a final yank the book pulls loose and, GASPING,
Norman grips the book to his chest and runs to the door.
49 49
Neil sits on the floor in front of a huge TV, remote
control in hand, as the doorbell RINGS loudly from the
hall.
MITCH (O.S.)
Neil! Will you get the door?
NEIL
I'm busy!
MITCH (O.S.)
Are you freeze-framing Mom's
aerobics DVD again?
ANGLE ON TV, with a still image of a Lycra-clad
instructor bending over. Neil quickly turns it off.
NEIL
No!
The doorbell RINGS again.
MITCH (O.S.)
Neil! Would it kill you to get off
your butt and answer the door?
53 53
I/E. NEIL'S DRIVEWAY, FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS
COURTNEY
I'm gonna kill them.
She impatiently leans down to push open the mail slot.
COURTNEY (CONT'D)
I know you're in there! Slumber
party's over, dorks!
The door opens and she finds herself face to navel with
Mitch, out of the shower with a towel around his waist.
ParaNorman 39.
53 CONTINUED: 53
MITCH
Um, can I help you?
COURTNEY
(under her breath)
Hell yeah.
Courtney catches herself and quickly affects a LAUGH.
COURTNEY (CONT'D)
Sorry to bug you so late, but
does, erm...
(checks page in hand)
...Neil live here?
MITCH
Yeah, he's my brother.
COURTNEY
Oh wow! That's great! Your brother
and my brother are like best
friends! I'm Courtney.
She tries to regain her composure as Mitch turns away.
MITCH
Hey Neil! You come here a minute?
There's a girl asking for you.
Neil's face emerges dubiously from a room down the hall.
Courtney flashes her widest fake grin and puts on a high
pitched sing-song voice.
COURTNEY
Hey there! How ya doin'... little
guy...
NEIL
Neil?
COURTNEY
Yeah, Neil. Do you know where
Norman is? He kinda disappeared.
NEIL
Oh no...
(CATCHES HIMSELF)
...idea! I have no idea where he
is. Sorry. Bye!
Neil goes to turn around but his brother stops him short.
MITCH
Whoa, Neil! Better start talking,
buddy.
ParaNorman 40.
53 CONTINUED: (2) 53
NEIL
I didn't really think he was
serious about going up to the old
graveyard on his own!
COURTNEY
So Norman!
MITCH
Oh, man. That place is bad news!
Total slasher movie vibe! Why'd he
go up there?
NEIL
I don't know. Maybe we should go
look for him.
MITCH
I told you he was trouble.
(TO COURTNEY)
Sorry. But I did.
COURTNEY
No, it's fine. He sucks. But I
really gotta make sure he doesn't
die or anything tonight. Will you
help me? Please?
Mitch gets an eyeful of her best damsel in distress act,
then SIGHS.
MITCH
Okay... I guess I should go get
some clothes on.
Courtney gives a disappointed WHINE as he heads off down
the hall, shoving Neil's head as he goes.
NEIL
Uh, is Norman in trouble?
54 54
The front door is kicked open and Norman and a near
hysterical Alvin rush inside, slamming and locking the
door behind them.
ALVIN
Are they gonna try to eat our
brains?!
NORMAN
I think you'll be safe.
ALVIN
Oh, thank God!
ParaNorman 41.
54 CONTINUED: 54
He manages to think this through, and frowns.
Alvin watches curiously as Norman turns his attention to
the book, frowning as he runs his hand over the embossed
leather cover.
NORMAN
I don't get it! Why didn't it
work?
He opens the book and leafs through page after page of
ornate calligraphy and woodcut illustrations.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
"The Story of Sleeping Beauty".
This doesn't make any sense!
His mind racing, Norman heads off along the hallway.
ALVIN
Wait! Where are you going?
56 56
The room remains as before, with Mr Prenderghast's corpse
lying on the floor. Norman enters with purpose and
approaches it, leaving Alvin horrified in the doorway.
Norman crouches low over the body, holding the book out
in front of Mr Prenderghast's blank eyes.
NORMAN
Mr Prenderghast, I don't
understand! Tell me what to do!
ALVIN
Dude, what are you doing?
NORMAN
(points to corpse)
He told me to read from the book
to stop the curse! I thought it
was a spell or something, but...
Norman narrows his eyes as he sees Mr Prenderghast's
desk, still strewn with pictures and newspaper clippings.
He hurries over and begins rummaging through the mess,
scattering papers across the floor.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Come on! There has to be
something...
ALVIN
I really need to get home! I've
got like a seriously early curfew.
(MORE)
ParaNorman 42.
56 CONTINUED: 56
ALVIN (CONT'D)
My mom gets really upset when I'm
not...
Something CLUNKS loudly from down the hall, sending Alvin
into a desperate babbling panic.
ALVIN (CONT'D)
We gotta defend ourselves! We
gotta shoot them in the head with
like silver stakes or something!
I'm way too awesome to get eaten!
Norman, are you listening to me?
You really have to do something!
Norman uncovers a couple of faded photographs of the old
graveyard. One is of the seven tombstones, the other is
of the stone marker, which reads "HERE LIES BURIED THE
SEVEN VICTIMS OF THE WITCH'S CURSE..."
Beside the photos is a torn page from an old book. An
engraving illustrates the seven members of the witch's
trial, solemnly seated at a bench within the courthouse.
NORMAN
Seven victims...
Frowning, Norman glances up and sees a page from an old
book tacked to the wall. It is an illustration of a
hideous old crone, cackling evilly.
Another THUMP from down the hall.
Norman looks again from the photographs in his hand to
the image of the old witch. There's something he's not
seeing... He looks at the pictures in front of him.
Graves. Jurors. Witch.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Seven graves.
(EYES WIDEN)
The witch's grave! It wasn't
there!
He turns to Alvin.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
I was reading the book in the
wrong place!
Down the hallway, another loud THUMP.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Hide!
ParaNorman 43.
CLOSE ON the door knob RATTLING furiously, then a CRACK
as a mottled hand punches it right through the wood.
A figure limps slowly into the hallway, dragging one
crippled foot behind the other. It stops halfway along
and tilts its head, as if listening, and emits a dire
MOAN. More shapes appear behind it in the doorway and fan
out along the hallway.
58 58
The boys tremble in their hiding places trying not to
make a sound; Alvin crouched behind a stack of books and
Norman lying underneath the bed. The footsteps grow
louder as the zombies shuffle into the room.
NORMAN'S POV - rotten legs step up to Mr Prenderghast's
body, lying where he fell on the floorboards. Two
withered feet suddenly step right up to the bed.
Something drops onto the floor inches in front of
Norman's face with an unpleasant SLAP. Norman's eyes bug
out as he realizes it is a zombie's dislodged ear. A
weltered arm reaches down to grope around for the body
part, until Norman pushes the ear, as carefully as he can
manage, back into the zombie's fingers. The hand retreats
back out from under the bed.
There is a loud SCREAM as Alvin, unable to contain
himself any longer, jumps out from his hiding place and
makes for the door. The corpses look up as he disappears
down the hall, then stagger after him.
Norman takes this chance to follow, but the Dead Judge
blocks his exit. They both stand quite still, staring
into each others' eyes. The corpse tilts its head, almost
quizzically, and its eyes widen as it notices the book
under his arm.
Norman steps sideways to run past it, but the corpse does
too. Both it and Norman step one way, then the other, and
back again. Norman feigns one direction and quickly bolts
in the other, past the corpse and out the door.
59 59
Alvin reaches the front door and throws it open. Directly
in front of him is another zombie on the doorstep,
opening a mouth full of jagged teeth.
Alvin SCREAMS like a little girl, smacks it ineffectually
with his spatula, and the door is abruptly SLAMMED in the
zombie's face, a surprised and muffled GROAN coming from
the other side.
ParaNorman 44.
59 CONTINUED: 59
Alvin, still screaming, looks down to see Norman beside
him, leaning against the door.
The Dead Judge leads the advance of zombies down the hall
toward them. Norman hears his MOAN.
Norman swings the door back open, the zombie on the other
side moving with it, teeth firmly embedded in the wood.
As it attempts to pry itself free, Norman grabs Alvin by
the arm and they both dart onto the porch behind its
back, headed for the road.
NORMAN
Come on!
60 60
Mitch drives along dark roads. Neil sits behind him
looking bemused while Courtney, in the front passenger
seat, extols her life history.
COURTNEY
And she said I could totally
consider a career in formation
swimming. But I was like, "I wanna
do something that helps people
less fortunate than me", thank you
very much, y'know, like the poor
or people who are like dying or
ugly or something, `cuz I really
think that ecology and world peace
are like totally important today.
Do you use free weights? Your
deltoids are huge.
MITCH
I've never used deltoids in my
life, I swear. You can test me.
Neil lies back in his seat, eyes rolling.
NEIL
Kill me now.
COURTNEY
Thank you for doing this Mitch. He
means an awful lot to me. I love
him like he was a brother.
NEIL
He is your brother.
Courtney counters the backseat barbs by smiling demurely,
but Mitch's attention has been drawn by something else.
MITCH
Whoa! Look at that sky!
ParaNorman 45.
60 CONTINUED: 60
The wooded hill rises steeply a few miles in front of
them, and at its top is the old chapel. Pressing down
upon it, huge seething thunderclouds shift into
otherworldly shapes. Mitch and Courtney are mesmerized.
Neil suddenly points past Mitch's face.
NEIL
Look out!
Mitch slams on the breaks, twisting the wheel.
MITCH
Oh no!
61 61
I/E. MITCH'S VAN ON WOODED ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Running down the middle of the road, blinded by the glare
of the van's headlights, are Alvin and Norman. The van
swerves around them and grazes the trees, the side mirror
flying off as it hits a branch.
Mitch fights to control the van as Courtney SCREAMS.
NEIL
That was Norman!
Shaken, Mitch realizes another figure is looming out of
the darkness in front of them. He slams on the brakes
again, but too late. The tall dirty-looking figure stands
stock still as the van plows straight into him.
Dust flies up from the wheels of the van as it skids to
an eventual stop in the center of the road.
62 62
Mitch turns to everyone as he pulls off his seat belt.
MITCH
Is everyone okay?
Courtney and Neil answer in unison, both of them upside
down in their seats with their legs sticking up in the
air.
COURTNEY NEIL
No!
No!
Mitch, trying to stay calm, looks in his rear-view mirror
and sees a prone shape on the ground some yards back.
ParaNorman 46.
MITCH
Did you see that?
COURTNEY
That was insane!
MITCH
I know, right? I kicked that like
a hundred yards!
COURTNEY
Norman, what just happened?!
ALVIN
Zombies! I swear, okay? We saw
them burst out of their graves!
For real!
He realizes Mitch and Courtney are staring at him, and
tries to disguise his raw panic with nonchalance.
ALVIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
(TO COURTNEY)
Just so you know, I totally saved
his life, and I could totally save
yours.
COURTNEY (O.S.)
Sorry, who are you?
ALVIN (O.S.)
I'm Alvin. I'm in his class.
Norman, not so easily distracted from the problem at hand
as the others, glances uneasily through the window.
NORMAN'S POV - The zombies lurch arthritically toward the
van, GROANING and GURGLING.
NORMAN
Uh, guys... maybe we should
actually drive away now.
MITCH
Oh, right.
ParaNorman 48.
64 CONTINUED: 64
Mitch starts the engine with a YELL, just as the nearest
zombie leers in through the window.
Courtney lets out an infuriated GROWL.
COURTNEY
I just knew something like this
was going to happen tonight!
MITCH
You did? Wow, `cos that zombie bit
really threw me.
Courtney turns in her seat and glares at her brother.
COURTNEY
Why d'you have to go and get
everyone involved in all your
weird stuff?!
NORMAN
Well, you weren't supposed to
follow me, were you?
NEIL
Sorry. My fault. When I'm nervous
I get mouth diarrhoea.
ALVIN
Ha ha! Diarrhoea!
COURTNEY
Oh my gosh, I think I'm having an
aneurism! This is so typical of
you!
NORMAN
You don't understand! I'm the only
one who can stop this, Courtney!
COURTNEY
Oh, I understand! I understand
that this is all getting
completely out of...
The van's sunroof is suddenly ripped open, and the Dead
Judge's arm reaches down into the vehicle, clawing inches
above Courtney's head.
COURTNEY (CONT'D)
...HAND!
The Dead Judge leans further into the van, MOANING
horribly. He seems to have his sights set on Norman, and
reaches one arm down toward Norman and the book peeking
out of his shoulder bag.
Norman shrinks back as the zombie GROANS horribly.
ParaNorman 50.
71 CONTINUED: 71
Alvin disappears behind the back seat with a WHIMPER, but
Neil valiantly leaps into the fray, wrestling the clawing
fingers away from his friend.
NEIL
Whaddawedo? Whaddawedo? Mitch?!
MITCH
I don't know! I don't know!
NEIL
You're the oldest!
MITCH
Not mentally!
Mitch hears a SIREN wail out behind him, and looks in his
mirror to see the flashing light of Hooper's bike.
MITCH (CONT'D)
Oh great. The cops.
Hooper pulls level with the passenger seat window, waving
angrily.
SHERIFF HOOPER
Pull over the vehicle!
The Dead Judge leans further into the van, Neil hanging
off him like a pendulum.
COURTNEY
Norman! How do we stop them?!
Norman looks again at the book in his hands.
NORMAN
I'm supposed to read from the book
at the witch's grave!
NEIL
We've got to go back to the
graveyard?
NORMAN
She wasn't buried with the others.
I don't know where else to look...
COURTNEY
Well you better think of something
quick!
Norman wracks his brain.
NEIL
I have an idea!
ParaNorman 51.
Salma sits at her computer in an immaculately tidy
bedroom. Even her collection of dolls are flawlessly
groomed and sit on a shelf looking like they're waiting
to be called in for an interview.
Salma talks into her cell phone with an expression of
withering disdain.
SALMA
So Norman, let me get this
straight; you guys all go on this
big supernatural adventure and
you're calling me in the middle of
the night because you need someone
to help you do your homework?
INTERCUT KIDS IN THE VAN/SALMA
Norman talks into his cell phone, occasionally ducking as
Neil's flailing limbs are shaken from side to side by the
GROWLING upside down zombie hanging above their heads.
NORMAN
Uh... yeah.
76 76
Neil drops back down onto his seat. The Dead Judge's arm,
torn off at the shoulder, is still clutched in his hands.
He stares down at it, wide-eyed, as it wriggles like an
animal in his grasp.
The Dead Judge slides slowly down the windscreen of the
van with a dull SQUEAK.
COURTNEY
Mitch, do something!
Mitch flicks on the windscreen wipers, which wipe the
zombie's rotten flesh from side to side across the glass.
Mitch and Courtney's eyes follow the Judge's movements
from side to side.
ParaNorman 52.
77 CONTINUED: 77
Behind them, Neil SQUEALS as the dismembered arm crawls
all over him, fingers scuttling like a spider's legs.
The arm frees itself from Neil and turns on Norman,
leaping at him like a viper.
Norman holds the book up as a shield, and manages to swat
the zombie arm away, flipping it across the front seat,
where it lands on the back of Mitch's neck.
Mitch SCREAMS as the rotten hand clamps down onto the top
of his head, and madly tries to shake it off. It hangs
onto him grimly, bony fingers hooked around his nostrils.
With Mitch no longer steering, the van swerves crazily
across the road, shaking the Dead Judge off the
windscreen. He disappears under the front of the vehicle,
his one remaining arm clinging onto the underside.
INTERCUT KIDS IN THE VAN/SALMA
Norman shouts pleadingly into the phone as he and Neil
are flung violently from side to side across the back
seat.
NORMAN
Salma! We need to find out where
the witch is buried! I went to the
old graveyard but her grave wasn't
there!
SALMA
Well, duh. People found guilty of
witchcraft weren't considered
people anymore. Norman, your witch
was buried someplace else... in an
unmarked grave!
(REPROACHFULLY)
If you cared to pay attention some
of the time, you would know that
we covered this in fifth grade
history class.
NORMAN
Salma! Please! Hurry! Y'know, I
would Google this myself if there
wasn't a 300 year old dead guy
trying to rip my face off!
With a SIGH, Salma types at her computer.
SALMA
Okay. It says here she was tried
in the old Town Hall on Main
Street. There may be a record of
her execution and burial in their
archives.
ParaNorman 53.
77 CONTINUED: (2) 77
Norman listens intently then shouts over to Mitch, still
struggling with the zombie hand gripping his face.
NORMAN
Quick! She said go to the Town
Hall!
79 79
Mitch finally manages to pry the Dead Judge's arm off his
head. He throws it, thrashing around violently, over his
shoulder.
Alvin lifts his face tentatively over the edge of the
back seat to see what's going on. The zombie arm plants
him in the eye, sending both sprawling against the floor.
Alvin SQUEALS as the arm snakes around his neck into a
bizarre approximation of a wrestling hold.
ParaNorman 54.
Perry and Sandra Babcock are driving home from their
evening out. Neither look especially happy.
SANDRA BABCOCK
I really think it might help if
you tried to see things from his
point of view.
PERRY BABCOCK
I don't want to.
85 85
The Babcocks' discussion continues as they drive.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry, not believing in the
Afterlife is like not believing in
Astrology.
PERRY BABCOCK
I have no idea what you're talking
about. Seriously, where did you
learn that?
SANDRA BABCOCK
Calm down.
Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS.
86 86
Preceded by an ear-splittingly guttural WAIL, Mrs
Henscher runs through the streets, waving her arms about
hysterically.
Moments later, the Babcocks' station wagon pulls around
the corner.
88 88
Mitch's van SCREECHES through the intersection, swerving
in front of the Babcock's station wagon, which veers
wildly as Perry brakes hard.
He leaps out of the car as the van drives away.
PERRY BABCOCK
Delinquent drivers! Where are the
police when you need them?
Hooper's bike hurtles through the air and bounces off the
hood of the station wagon with a CRUNCH. Before Perry can
react he is buried under the mass of Sheriff Hooper,
dropping like a meteorite onto his head.
89 89
The kids, hanging on for dear life, hear a loud CRUNCH
from the back of the van.
They all turn to see the van's rear doors ripped open.
Silhouetted in the space is the one-armed Dead Judge,
cape muddied and torn from his crawling back out from the
vehicle's undercarriage.
The zombie lunges toward the startled kids, and MOANS.
Mitch turns his attention back to the road ahead, but too
late, and he YELLS as green-faced Mrs Henscher runs
SQUEALING into the van's headlights.
Mitch throws all his weight onto the wheel, tires
SCREAMING as the van misses Henscher by inches. The
violence of the turn flings the Dead Judge backwards like
a slingshot, disappearing out of the doors and shattering
into a dozen pieces as he SMASHES into the hard road.
90 90
The kids hurry through the door.
The lobby is dark, but moonlight glistens off polished
wood through a lofty circular window.
Norman shouts out from the other side of the lobby, where
he stands beside a door labelled "HALL OF RECORDS"..
NORMAN
This is it!
ParaNorman 61.
107 CONTINUED: 107
NEIL
This is?
NORMAN
Now we can find out where the
witch was buried!
Norman pushes his shoulder against the door and steps
inside.
108 108
The door swings open and reveals a labyrinth of shelves
and glass cabinets stretching out into the shadows in
front of him. Row after row of dusty cardboard file boxes
and ledgers stacked one on top of another.
Norman stops in his tracks, color draining from his face.
NORMAN
Uh-oh.
Courtney follows, faking enthusiasm.
COURTNEY
Great! I'm super psyched! This is
turning into the most fun night
ever!
The overhead light clicks on as Alvin steps into the room
behind her and GROANS.
ALVIN
Man. Zombies take over the world
and we lock ourselves in a
library. Are you kidding me?
There's an adult video store just
across the street!
Neil is more optimistic, and brightly makes his way over
to a shelf, and pulls down a slim ledger.
NEIL
This'll be a piece of cake, you'll
see.
He pauses, and frowns, squinting up his eyes as he reads
aloud, very slowly.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Page... One... Okay, page one.
Mitch hefts a particularly heavy box file off a shelf. He
seems to read the filing notes written across its front,
then ignores them and begins curling it like a dumbbell.
ParaNorman 62.
108 CONTINUED: 108
MITCH
I really hate these places.
Norman sizes up the masses of documents all around them,
face panicked. It would take days to go through them all.
NORMAN
Come on! No, that's not it. Time
is running out!
Perry drives into town in silence, his nose bloodied and
stuffed with tissues. Sandra sits beside him and Sheriff
Hooper is in the back seat, scouring the streets.
SHERIFF HOOPER
Would've been a quiet night too,
if it hadn't been for those
meddling kids. Huh!
As Perry and Sandra exchange uneasy glances, Hooper
suddenly points through the windshield to the riot in
progress on Main Street.
SHERIFF HOOPER (CONT'D)
Sweet baby jinkies!
105 105
Dozens of books and cardboard boxes lie scattered across
the floor. The glass cabinets around the room have been
ransacked as the kids drag documents off shelves and
rummage through binders.
Norman sits on the floor flipping through sheet after
sheet of records. Courtney wades through documents toward
him, holding up a fist full of old rolled-up papers.
COURTNEY
We're not going to find it in
here, Norman! This is useless!
ALVIN
Yeah, I know, and it's also really
boring.
MITCH
I thought I was driving the van.
No one told me I was gonna have to
do this other dumb stuff.
NORMAN
If I'd known there was so much
reading involved, I would have
brought a completely different
group of people who hate me.
Neil suddenly YELLS out victoriously. Everyone turns to
him, hardly believing he might have found the answer. He
waves a book triumphantly above his head and grins at
everyone.
NEIL
Yes! Book number one! Finished!
That is right, twenty six pages,
oh yeah!
Everyone GROANS and turns back to their bickering.
ParaNorman 65.
111 CONTINUED: 111
COURTNEY
I can't believe this is your plan!
I'm gonna get bitten and start
eating peoples' brains! I'm
supposed to be Vegan!
Mitch suddenly SHOUTS out from the doorway.
MITCH
Guys! There's something moving out
there! I think it's the zombies!
ALVIN
(HYSTERICAL)
Hide!
MITCH
Oh, no it's not. It's just grown-
ups.
ALVIN
(MORE HYSTERICAL)
Hide!
112 112
Blurry silhouettes move across the outside of the window,
occasionally SMACKING against them with their fists.
A brick SMASHES through a window and CLATTERS across the
floor between Courtney's feet.
114 114
The kids start to hurry toward the lobby, leaving Norman
sitting amongst the spilled documents.
MITCH
That sound. Y'know what that is?
That's not awesome... things...
NORMAN
Guys, come on!
ALVIN
Just give it up, weiner!
NORMAN
We have to keep trying!
ParaNorman 66.
114 CONTINUED: 114
COURTNEY
We tried and look what happened!
(SIGHS)
I'm scared, Norman, and I can't
listen to this any more.
Norman looks at the faces in front of him. The kids are
scared and confused and angry. Even Neil has nothing
encouraging to offer.
Norman's brow furrows.
NORMAN
You never listen! No one ever
listens! I'm scared too, but I've
still gotta do this.
COURTNEY
I do too listen! And whatever it
was you just said, it's not
working! You think you're going to
go out there and do your talking
to the dead thing and this is all
going to be okay? What are you
going to do, ask the zombies not
to eat you?
NORMAN
I should've known you wouldn't
understand! No one ever does!
COURTNEY
Norman, you need to stop all this
weird stuff and start living in
the real world!
NORMAN
Everyone in the real world thinks
I'm a freak! And you know what,
maybe they're right, maybe I am a
freak! But I never asked for your
help... just go! Get out!
Courtney, Mitch and Alvin back off a half step as Norman
advances on them.
MITCH
Jeez, that was dramatic.
Courtney shoots him a look as if she's about to fight
back, then shakes her head and shoves her way through the
door.
She turns to go, snapping at the other kids behind her.
COURTNEY
C'mon!
ParaNorman 67.
114 CONTINUED: (2) 114
One by one, the kids turn and file out, but Neil still
insists on remaining, folding his arms defiantly.
NEIL
I'm not going anywhere. You can't
make me.
Mitch shrugs and picks his brother up, scooping him under
one arm and carrying him out the door.
MITCH
Dude, you're really heavy.
NEIL
I'm not speaking to you. You can't
make me.
Norman watches the doors shut behind them, and his anger
begins to ebb. Alone in the archive room, he slumps to
his knees feeling useless and frustrated.
115 115
In the lobby, no one can hear him over the sounds of the
mob. The kids have nervously approached the barricade at
the front door, hoping to appeal to the figures outside.
COURTNEY
Um, excuse me? Hello?
Unmistakably living hands and arms suddenly SMASH through
the barricade, clawing into the Town Hall. The kids
recoil from the windows, SCREAMING as they bat
ineffectually at the grasping hands.
116 116
Neil SCREAMS as Slob Guy gropes at his chubby arm.
Norman notices his backpack on the floor in front of him,
the book of fairy tales poking out. He picks it up and
runs his hand absently over the embossed leather cover.
ParaNorman 68.
117A CONTINUED: 117A
Something CLATTERS behind him, and Norman hears someone
approaching.
NORMAN
Hello?
He turns around to face his friend and finds himself
staring up at a zombie, moving toward him along the dark
aisle, pale moonlight shining off its exposed bones.
Norman GASPS.
He realizes zombies are converging on him from all
directions, barring his way out through the door. The
Dead Judge GROANS as he approaches.
Norman backs away, clutching the book to his chest.
Out of the corner of his eye Norman spots another doorway
in the shadows of the wall behind him and moves toward
it, calling out desperately.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Help! Somebody help me!
118 118
Norman runs up a tight stairwell leading to the roof of
the building, the zombies just a few steps beneath him.
The kids manage to pull back just as a burning bottle
flies over their heads, SHATTERING glass. It lands in the
middle of the room and a puddle of burning alcohol
spreads across the floorboards.
Tendrils of black smoke are also beginning to creep under
the edge of the front door.
The kids stand in a group, terror-stricken as the smoke
thickens and flames begin to lick along the floor.
Courtney is quick to lose what remains of her composure.
ParaNorman 69.
120 CONTINUED: 120
COURTNEY
We're all gonna DIE!
Norman lies on the floor, shifting painfully. With some
effort he sits up, rubbing his head.
The book in his hand is now a blackened cinder with a
large smoldering hole gouged through the middle.
Norman realizes he is no longer inside the burning
building. Around him indistinct shapes begin to pool into
clarity. He is in the courthouse, but three hundred years
ago, and a trial is about to begin.
A crowd of onlookers gather around a platform at the head
of the room where officious-looking gentlemen in austere
Puritan clothing stand around a table. Two dour men in
black skull caps are seated, an empty chair between them.
Norman moves unnoticed through the crowd toward the
platform. The hubbub of the townsfolk dies down.
The imposing figure of Judge Hopkins, tall and august,
marches out of a side chamber, steps up onto the wooden
dais and seats himself silently between his solemn peers.
He glares down at Norman with cold, humorless eyes.
JUDGE HOPKINS
Agatha Prenderghast of his
Majesty's Province of
Massachusetts...
As the Judge's voice continues, Norman sees played out
against it a MONTAGE of the preceding court case.
The notary stands up, waving a wad of testimonies.
JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...on this day you have been
arraigned for the horrible crime
of witchcraft...
A pale woman fiddles nervously with the ribbon on her
bonnet as she is questioned by the Judge.
JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...witnessed by those whose
testimonies have been heard.
A wiry woman with a pinched face gestures fearfully with
her arms as she recounts her evidence.
ParaNorman 72.
126 CONTINUED: 126
JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You have, by this court, been
found guilty...
NORMAN
No!
A young farmhand bows his head shamefully, as he adds
further ammunition to the prosecution.
JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.)
...and it is passed on you,
according to your grievous
crimes...
Another village woman SOBS into a handkerchief as she
tells her story.
QUICK CUTS of the accusers, one after the other, as the
Judge finishes his verdict. The notary, the preacher, the
townsfolk. All point at Norman.
JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)
...execution.
Camera swings slowly around Norman to reveal AGGIE
PRENDERGHAST, standing in chains right behind him.
AGGIE
No!
Norman reacts with horror. The "witch" cowering next to
him is no more than eleven years-old. Her long hair is
unkempt and dirt on her face is streaked with tears from
her eyes. Her manacles have been specially made to fit
her tiny wrists, and weigh her to the floor. She SNIFFS,
scared and confused.
JUDGE HOPKINS
Do you have anything to say for
yourself?
AGGIE
I was only playing!
JUDGE HOPKINS
Aye, with fire! You were speaking
with the dead!
The crowd GASPS and MURMURS fearfully.
JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)
I'll not risk damnation on these
good people.
The town Sheriff grabs Aggie by the shoulder.
ParaNorman 73.
126 CONTINUED: (2) 126
JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)
You are to be taken to the place
of execution where you will be
hanged by the neck until you be
dead...
Norman shouts out but no one can hear or see him.
NORMAN
Wait! No! You can't do this!
The grim-faced Sheriff moves toward Norman and Aggie. She
backs away, tears flowing down her face.
AGGIE
I didn't do anything wrong!
A terrible panic comes over her face.
AGGIE (CONT'D)
Stop! Leave me alone or I'll make
you sorry! I'll make all of you
sorry!
Norman feels unsteady on his feet, the room seeming to
spin around him. The faces of the townsfolk, pale and
skull-like, swirl around and around, blurring together.
In the center of it all, glowing like a bonfire, Aggie
SCREAMS.
The world turns black and Norman collapses in a faint.
127 127
NORMAN'S P.O.V. - the high timbers of the hall roof swim
into focus, and then faces peering down at him. Skeletal,
rotting faces. The dead Puritans are standing around him
in a half-circle. He sits up terrified, and looks around,
shuffling back across the floorboards on his bottom. The
dead villagers stand where they are, staring intently.
Norman sits a moment, heart pounding, WHISPERING SHAKILY.
NORMAN
How could you?! She was just a
little kid! She was no different
than me!
The Dead Judge takes a step forward.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Keep away from me!
The Dead Judge stops, then opens his horrible mouth and
speaks in a guttural voice.
ParaNorman 74.
127 CONTINUED: 127
DEAD JUDGE
You... must... stop... the...
curse.
A beat. Norman is stunned.
NORMAN
What? You don't want to kill me?
The Judge shakes his head and points down at the book
beside Norman's feet.
DEAD JUDGE
You can speak to the dead. To us.
To her. We need you to read from
the book to send us all back to
the grave.
NORMAN
But it didn't work! It's a fairy
tale! Just a bedtime... story...
He narrows his eyes at the Judge.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
That's it, isn't it? A bedtime
story to keep a little girl asleep
for another year. And now you need
my help because I'm the only one
who can read it to her!
He bends down to pick it up. His eyes flash angrily at
the zombies and he hurls the burnt book at the Judge. It
hits him in the chest and falls to his feet with a THUD.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Here's your book! Try reading it
yourself!
The zombies stare down at the blackened lump of charred
paper, and several of them GASP. The Dead Judge's eyes
are filled with fear and desperation.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Why did you do it?
DEAD JUDGE
We were scared.
NORMAN
Of what?
DEAD JUDGE
Of her.
(GESTURES BEHIND)
I believed we were doing what was
right. I was wrong. Now this is
our punishment.
(MORE)
ParaNorman 75.
127 CONTINUED: (2) 127
DEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)
We thought we knew our way in life
but in death we are lost.
Norman knows they're telling the truth.
DEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)
Please help us.
Norman looks at the book of fairy tales, lying at his
feet. Its pages are curled and blackened, embers still
glowing around the hole blown right through it.
NORMAN
Every year someone reads the story
at her grave. Before me it was Mr
Prenderghast, and before him there
were others, but the curse doesn't
ever go away. Nothing gets better.
It's not enough.
Norman looks at it a moment, thinking. He knows what he
has to do.
DEAD JUDGE
What will you do?
NORMAN
Something nobody ever did before.
I've gotta go talk to her.
128 128
Smeared with soot and COUGHING, the kids are trapped in
the lobby. They cower together as burning wood CREAKS and
CRACKS all around them. The air is grey and caustic and
filled with flakes of charcoal and burning ash.
A burning timber GROANS as it splits from the ceiling and
tumbles toward the children. They SCREAM and scatter as
it hits the floorboards in a shower of glowing sparks.
Mitch shouts out from beside a heavy wooden counter top.
MITCH
Guys! Guys! Under here! Under
here!
The kids scramble beneath the shelter of the counter as
more glowing embers rain down around them.
Courtney grabs Mitch by the bicep and whispers weakly.
COURTNEY
Mitch, if we die tonight, this
might be the last chance I get to
tell you how I feel.
ParaNorman 76.
128 CONTINUED: 128
MITCH
Uh, well, no. Unless we get
brought back as zombies, and then
technically you'll have longer.
Courtney opens her mouth to continue, but her love train
is thoroughly derailed by the nearby CRASH of breaking
wood, and the archive door beside them CLATTERS to the
ground.
The cowering kids all watch in silent horror as several
dark figures limp and shamble out of the smoke and make
their way past them across the room. It's the zombies,
and they're being led by Norman.
COURTNEY
Norman?
NORMAN
Come on! This way!
COURTNEY
You've gotta be kidding me...
Norman, his mouth shielded by his sleeve, heads
purposefully toward the front doors.
131 131
The Dead Judge sits rigidly between Norman and Courtney
in the back of Perry's station wagon, Perry and Sandra in
the front.
Perry drives in silent discomfort following the Judge's
instructions through town, glancing in his rear-view
mirror at the passengers in the back seat.
Sandra takes a small perfume spritzer from her purse as
surreptitiously as she can and sprays the air around her.
135 135
Norman sits on the floor in front of the TV. A news
report shows the wrecked Main Street with the headline
"TOURIST TOWN HIT BY MYSTERY TORNADO".
Perry enters the room, and Norman quickly changes the
channel on the TV to a noisy monster movie.
ParaNorman 94.
148 CONTINUED: 148
PERRY BABCOCK
Son.
NORMAN
Hi Dad.
PERRY BABCOCK
What're you watching?
NORMAN
A scary movie.
PERRY BABCOCK
Your, uh, your grandma here is
she?
Norman looks around and sees his father and grandmother
sitting side by side on the sofa. He nods.
PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)
Right. Of course she is.
Perry tries his best to maintain his composure, and
wriggles a little in his seat.
PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)
Is she... Is she sitting next to
me?
Norman nods. Perry "hem-hems" and turns awkwardly to face
her, nose to ear. She doesn't seem to notice.
PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)
Hi Mom.
Perry tries to downplay his discomfort and turns back to
concentrate on the movie his son is watching.
Sandra and Courtney enter from the kitchen carrying
snacks. Sandra takes a seat on an armchair and Courtney
lies down on the floor beside her brother, munching
popcorn. They all settle in to watch the movie.
A beat, then Perry and Grandma speak at the same time.
PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D) GRANDMA BABCOCK
So what's happening now? So what's happening now?
Norman sits as he is, facing the TV, and grins.
THE END.
