CUT TO:
SEAN McGUIRE (52) sits, FORMALLY DRESSED, on the roof of his
apartment building in a beat-up lawn chair. Well-built and
fairly muscular, he stares blankly out over the city.
On his lap rests an open invitation that reads "M.I.T. CLASS
OF '67 REUNION."
While the morning is quiet and Sean sits serenely, there is
a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times. This
is a man who fought his way through life. On his lonely stare
we:
CUT TO:
A thirty year REUNION PARTY has taken over the lawn. A well
dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that
reads "WELCOME BACK CLASS OF '72." We find Professor Lambeau
standing with a drink in his hand, surveying the crowd. He
is interrupted by an approaching STUDENT.
STUDENT
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
LAMBEAU
Yes.
STUDENT
I'm in your applied theories class.
We're all down at the Math and Science
building.
LAMBEAU
It's Saturday.
STUDENT
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till
Monday to find out.
LAMBEAU
Find out what?
STUDENT
Who proved the theorem.
In the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys,
drinking and smoking cigarettes. Will pops open a beer. The
boys have been here a while and it shows.
Billy sees something that catches his interest.
BILLY
Who's that? She's got a nice ass.
Their P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a
beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA)
MORGAN
Yah, that is a nice ass.
CHUCKIE
You could put a pool in that backyard.
BILLY
Who's she talking to?
MORGAN
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
WILL
Yah, Bobby Champa. He used to beat
the shit outta' me in Kindergarten.
BILLY
He's a pretty big kid.
WILL
Yah, he's the same size now as he
was in Kindergarten.
MORGAN
Fuck this, let's get something to
eat...
CHUCKIE
What Morgan, you're not gonna go
talk to her?
MORGAN
Fuck her.
The boys get up and walk down the bleachers.
WILL
I could go for a Whopper.
MORGAN
(nonchalant)
Let's hit "Kelly's."
CHUCKIE
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's
Roast Beef" just cause you like the
take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes
out of our way.
MORGAN
What else we gonna do we can't spare
fifteen minutes?
CHUCKIE
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell
you why we're not going to "Kelly's."
It's because the take-out bitch is a
fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like
her but she's dumb as a post and she
has never got our order right, never
once.
MORGAN
She's not stupid.
WILL
She's sharp as a marble.
CHUCKIE
We're not goin'.
(beat)
I don't even like "Kelly's."
CUT TO:
Will comes jogging up towards BOBBY CHAMPA, calling out from
across the street,
WILL
(smiling, good
naturedly)
Hey, Bobby Champa! I went to
Kindergarten with you right? Sister
Margaret's class...
Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure
of Will's intentions. Just when it looks as though Bobby
might remember him, Will DRILLS HIM with a sucker-punch which
begins the
FIGHT SEQUENCE: 40 FRAMES OVER M. GAYE'S "LET'S GET IT ON."
Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the
hapless Champa out cold.
As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL.
Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground. The two
exchange messy punches on the sidewalk.
Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying
to avoid being overrun.
When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he
HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.
Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a
shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he
was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.
Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will
can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's
boys from the hood of a car.
Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a
fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.
The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown
wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone
throws a bottle.
In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's
friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will,
standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING
him.
ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT
Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking
them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious
Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away.
The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only
witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him.
A crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them.
CHUCKIE
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
WILL
Yeah, you're all invited over to
Morgan's house for a complementary
fish sandwich.
The Police slam Will into the hood of a car.
WILL
(to Police)
Hey, I know it's not a French cruller,
but it's free.
The cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood,
another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car.
The look of rage returns to Will's eye.
WILL
Get the fuck off me!
Will resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE
KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a
fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though
he struggles -- takes a beating.
CUT TO:
Sean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is
now loose and an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS is at his side.
He stares out over the City. A MATRONLY LANDLADY comes out
of a doorway on the roof.
LANDLADY
Sean?
Sean doesn't answer.
LANDLADY
Sean? You okay?
SEAN
Yeah.
A beat.
LANDLADY
It's getting cold.
After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs. Sean
doesn't move.
DISSOLVE:
The morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river.
CUT TO:
Will emerges from the courthouse. Chuckie is waiting for him
in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee.
He hands one of them to Will. This feels routine.
CHUCKIE
When's the arraignment?
WILL
Next week.
Chuckie pulls away.
CUT TO:
Students walk to class, carrying bags. More than any other,
students seem to be heading into one PARTICULAR CLASSROOM.
A crowded Harvard Bar. Will and our gang walk by a line of
several Harvard students, waiting to be carded.
MORGAN
What happened?
(beat)
You got fired, huh?
WILL
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
MORGAN
(starts laughing)
How fuckin' retarded do you have to
be to get shit-canned from that job?
How hard is it to push a fuckin'
broom?
CHUCKIE
You got fired from pushing a broom,
you little bitch.
MORGAN
Yah, that was different. Management
was restructurin'--
BILLY
Yah, restructurin' the amount of
retards they had workin' for them.
MORGAN
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
BILLY
Least I work for a livin'.
(to Will)
Why'd you get fired?
WILL
Management was restructurin'.
Laughter.
CHUCKIE
My uncle can probably get you on my
demo team.
MORGAN
What the fuck? I just asked you for
a job yesterday!
CHUCKIE
I told you "no" yesterday!
After two students flash their ID's to the doorman (CASEY)
our boys file past him.
ALL
(one after another)
What's up Case.
With an imperceptible nod, Casey waves our boys through. A
fifth kid, a HARVARD STUDENT, tries to follow. He is stopped
by Casey's massive, outstretched arm:
CASEY
ID?
Our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about
their bar-ball exploits. Across the street is another bar
with a glass front. Morgan spots Clark sitting by the window
with some friends.
MORGAN
There goes that fuckin' Barney right
now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip."
We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
WILL
Hold up.
Will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window
and stands across from Clark, separated only by the glass.
He POUNDS THE GLASS to get Clark's attention.
WILL
Hey!
Clark turns toward Will.
WILL
DO YOU LIKE APPLES?
Clark doesn't get it.
WILL
DO YOU LIKE APPLES?!
CLARK
Yeah?
Will SLAMS SKYLAR'S PHONE NUMBER against the glass.
WILL
WELL I GOT HER NUMBER! HOW DO YA
LIKE THEM APPLES?!!
Will's boys erupt into laughter. Angle on Clark, deflated.
The boys make their way home, piled into Chuckie's car,
laughing together.
Shot of car crossing over the Charles St. Bridge, overtaking
a red-line train.
Traveling through narrow back roads in Charlestown, passing
the Bunker Hill monument.
Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off.
DISSOLVE TO:
Will and Skylar on their first date. They watch a street
MAGICIAN doing tricks with a rabbit. The guy's tricks are
pretty good, but his on-stage persona could use some work.
He is incessantly repeating the phrase "this is the rabbit,
the rabbit really does the tricks." Will gives Skylar a look
and they move on.
CUT TO:
Establishing shot of the red-brick campus. Planes land at
nearby Logan airport. Will walks up the steps.
CUT TO:
Will and Skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run.
They ad lib teasing one another about England, Ireland, and
America.
SKYLAR
You grew up around here?
WILL
Not far from here, South Boston.
SKYLAR
How was that?
WILL
Pretty boring, I guess.
She smiles.
SKYLAR
I bet you have a great family.
WILL
You know, nothing special.
SKYLAR
You have a lot of brothers and
sisters?
WILL
Do I have a lot of brothers and
sisters?
SKYLAR
Yeah.
WILL
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you
think?
SKYLAR
How many?
WILL
You wouldn't believe me if I told
you.
SKYLAR
What, five?
Will shakes his head.
SKYLAR
Seven?
Will shakes his head. Smiles.
SKYLAR
Come on.
WILL
I have twelve big brothers.
SKYLAR
Not a chance.
WILL
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
SKYLAR
Bullshit.
WILL
I swear to God.
SKYLAR
Your house must have been a zoo.
WILL
It was great. There was always someone
to play with, give you advice.
SKYLAR
Do you know all their names?
WILL
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
SKYLAR
Well...
WILL
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey,
Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby,
Johnny, and Brian.
SKYLAR
(laughing)
Do you keep in touch with them?
WILL
All the time. We all live in Southie.
I live with three of them now.
Skylar smiles.
SKYLAR
I want to meet them.
WILL
We'll do that.
CUT TO:
Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park.
They look out over a small pond, in which a group of
schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats.
WILL
So what's with this place? You have
a swan fetish? Is this something
you'd like to talk about?
SEAN
I was thinking about what you said
to me the other day, about my
painting. I stayed up half the night
thinking about it and then something
occurred to me and I fell into a
deep peaceful sleep and haven't
thought about you since. You know
what occurred to me?
WILL
No.
SEAN
You're just a boy. You don't have
the faintest idea what you're talking
about.
WILL
Why thank you.
SEAN
You've never been out of Boston.
WILL
No.
SEAN
So if I asked you about art you could
give me the skinny on every art book
ever written... Michelangelo? You
know a lot about him I bet. Life's
work, criticisms, political
aspirations. But you couldn't tell
me what it smells like in the Sistine
Chapel. You've never stood there and
looked up at that beautiful ceiling.
And if I asked you about women I'm
sure you could give me a syllabus of
your personal favorites, and maybe
you've been laid a few times too.
But you couldn't tell me how it feels
to wake up next to a woman and be
truly happy. If I asked you about
war you could refer me to a bevy of
fictional and non-fictional material,
but you've never been in one. You've
never held your best friend's head
in your lap and watched him draw his
last breath, looking to you for help.
And if I asked you about love I'd
get a sonnet, but you've never looked
at a woman and been truly vulnerable.
Known that someone could kill you
with a look. That someone could rescue
you from grief. That God had put an
angel on Earth just for you.
And
you wouldn't know how it felt to be
her angel. To have the love be there
for her forever. Through anything,
through cancer. You wouldn't know
about sleeping sitting up in a
hospital room for two months holding
her hand and not leaving because the
doctors could see in your eyes that
the term "visiting hours" didn't
apply to you. And you wouldn't know
about real loss, because that only
occurs when you lose something you
love more than yourself, and you've
never dared to love anything that
much. I look at you and I don't see
an intelligent confident man, I don't
see a peer, and I don't see my equal.
I see a boy. Nobody could possibly
understand you, right Will? Yet you
presume to know so much about me
because of a painting you saw.
You
must know everything about me.
You're
an orphan, right?
Will nods quietly.
SEAN
Do you think I would presume to know
the first thing about who you are
because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I
don't buy the argument that you don't
want to be here, because I think you
like all the attention you're getting.
Personally, I don't care. There's
nothing you can tell me that I can't
read somewhere else.
Unless we talk
about your life. But you won't do
that. Maybe you're afraid of what
you might say.
Sean stands,
SEAN
It's up to you.
And walks away.
CUT TO:
Rain pounds South Boston. Chuckie sits with the Cadillac
fiddling, humming to the radio. Morgan and Billy sit in the
back, sharing a case of beer. Will is at a pay phone.
Chuckie drops Will off at his apartment, watches him [Will]
walk up the steps.
DISSOLVE TO:
Chuckie pulls up to the curb and walks up the steps to Will's
front door. After a beat, Will emerges. They get back in
[the car].
CUT TO:
Will and Chuckie at work. Chuckie shows Will how to be a
man.
Will is waiting outside the door for someone to come out --
so he can go in.
Will sits in an outdoor cafe, thinking. After a beat, he
leans over to two students working at a nearby table, borrows
a pen and paper and starts writing.
CUT TO:
Will is a solitary figure strolling across the lawn. He stops
at Skylar's dorm and knocks on the door.
CUT TO:
Everyone is walking out, saying good-bye. Chuckie goes over
to Will and Skylar.
CHUCKIE
I'm glad you came by, changed my
opinion of Harvard people.
SKYLAR
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight.
WILL
I don't know what the fuck you're
doin'.
You're givin' us a ride.
CHUCKIE
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?
(seriously)
You want to take my car, drop her
off?
WILL
I was countin' on it.
MORGAN
Chuck, let's go.
CHUCKIE
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin'
the car.
Morgan mumbles something and staggers off. Billy follows
with an indifferent shrug.
WILL
Thanks, Chuck.
CHUCKIE
Don't get too slap-happy, you're
takin' me home first.
WILL
I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta
the way.
CHUCKIE
Just 'cause you don't have to sleep
in the one room palace, don't start
thinkin' you're bad.
SKYLAR
(to Will)
I thought you said you'd show me
your place.
WILL
Not tonight.
CHUCKIE
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other
night.
He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped
like a bad habit.
SKYLAR
I wanted to meet your brothers...
Chuckie gives Will a curious look.
WILL
They're all sleepin' now.
(a beat, to Chuckie)
Let me get those keys.
CUT TO:
Will and Skylar sit in the open courtyard of this Harvard
Square eatery. Skylar is working on another O-chem lab. Will
sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work.
WILL
How's it goin'?
SKYLAR
Fine.
WILL
Want me to take a look?
SKYLAR
No.
WILL
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go
to the battin' cages.
SKYLAR
It's important that I learn this.
WILL
Why is it important to you? If I
inherited all that money, the only
thing important to me would be workin'
on my swing.
SKYLAR
Clearly.
WILL
You're rich. What do you have to
worry about?
SKYLAR
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's
two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.
That's exactly what it'll
cost me, minus about five hundred
bucks, to go all the way through med
school. This is what I'm doing with
that money. I could have done anything
I wanted. I could have expanded my
wardrobe, substantially.
WILL
Instead you're going to bust your
ass for five years so you can be
broke?
SKYLAR
No, so I can be a doctor.
A beat. Will nods. She looks down, then up.
SKYLAR
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me
ask you a question? Do you have a
photographic memory?
WILL
I guess. I don't know. How do you
remember your phone number?
SKYLAR
Have you ever studied Organic
Chemistry?
WILL
Some, a little.
SKYLAR
Just for fun?
WILL
I guess so.
SKYLAR
Nobody does organic chemistry for
"fun."
It's unnecessary. Especially
for someone like you.
WILL
Like me?
SKYLAR
Yeah. Someone like you who divides
his time, fairly evenly, between the
batting cages and bars.
Will laughs.
SKYLAR
How did you do that? I can't... I
mean even the smartest people I know,
and we do have a few at Harvard,
have to study- a lot. It's hard.
(beat)
Listen, Will, if you don't want to
tell me--
WILL
Do you play the piano?
SKYLAR
Come one Will. I just want to know.
WILL
I'm trying to explain it to you. So
you play the piano. When you look at
the keys, you see music, you see
Mozart.
SKYLAR
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
WILL
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked
at a piano and saw music. The fuckin'
guy was deaf when he composed the
Ode to Joy. They had to turn him
around to take a bow because he
couldn't hear the crowd going crazy
behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all
of that music in his head.
SKYLAR
So, do you play the piano?
WILL
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I
see black and white keys, three pedals
and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart,
they looked at it and it just made
sense to them. They saw a piano and
they could play. I couldn't paint
you a picture, I probably can't hit
the ball out of Fenway Park and I
can't play the piano--
SKYLAR
But you can do my O-chem lab in under
an hour, you can--
WILL
When it came to stuff like that I
could always just play.
Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will, the Robot-pimp.
So much so that Skylar has to kiss him, then push him away.
SKYLAR
I can't believe it's taken me four
years to meet you and I'm going to
California in two months, Will.
(beat)
Have you ever been to California? I
bet you'd like it.
Will freezes. A beat.
SKYLAR
Maybe not.
CUT TO:
Chuckie, still in his boxers walks with Skylar who is talking.
SKYLAR
See, now this doesn't feel right.
(beat)
When I made the decision to come
over here it felt right. I had all
these rationalizations... I just
don't understand why Will never tells
me anything, he won't let me get
close to him, he tells me these weird
lies--
CHUCKIE
You caught that, huh?
SKYLAR
I just wanted to find out what was
going on... But now that I'm here it
seems strange, doesn't it?
CHUCKIE
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
She laughs. A beat.
CHUCKIE
I know why you're here. Will don't
talk much.
SKYLAR
I don't care what his family's like
or if he doesn't have any brothers,
but he doesn't have to lie to me.
CHUCKIE
I really don't know what to say.
Look, I lie to women all the time.
That's just my way.
(beat)
Last week Morgan brought these girls
down from Roslindale. I told them I
was a cosmonaut. They believed me.
But Will's not usually like that--
MAN ON PORCH
Put some clothes on, Sullivan!
CHUCKIE
Take it easy father!
She laughs.
CHUCKIE
All I can say is; I known Will a
long time -- And I seen him with
every girl he's ever been with. But
I've never seen him like this before,
ever with anyone, like how he is
with you.
SKYLAR
Is that true?
CHUCKIE
Yeah, it is.
CUT TO:
Will leaves pulling on his clothes.
CUT TO:
Will is on pay phone talking to Skylar.
WILL
I just wanted to call before you
left.
(beat)
I'm takin' all these job interviews.
So I won't just be a construction
worker.
Will walks out carrying a brown bag. He is filthy, having
just knocked off work.
CUT TO:
Chuckie is sitting on the hood of his Cadillac, watching
Will across the street. Chuckie is covered in grime as well.
Will starts walking towards Chuckie. As he draws closer, he
heaves a can of Budweiser a good thirty yards, to Chuckie
who handles it routinely.
Will takes a seat next to Chuckie and they crack open their
beers. Other workers file out of the site. They drink.
CHUCKIE
How's the woman?
WILL
Gone.
CHUCKIE
What?
WILL
She went to Medical school in
California.
CHUCKIE
Sorry, brother.
(beat)
I don't know what to tell ya. You
know all the girls I been with. You
been with 'em too, except for Cheryl
McGovern which was a big mistake on
your part brother...
WILL
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of
us has herpes.
CHUCKIE
Some shows are worth the price of
admission, partner.
This gets a small laugh from Will.
CHUCKIE
My fuckin' back is killin' me.
A passing SHEET METAL WORKER overhears this.
SHEET METAL WORKER
That's why you should'a gone to
college.
WILL
Fuck you.
CHUCKIE
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal
pussy.
(beat)
So, when are you done with those
meetin's?
WILL
Week after I'm twenty-one.
CHUCKIE
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
WILL
Yeah, sit in a room and do long
division for the next fifty years.
CHUCKIE
Yah, but it's better than this shit.
At least you'd make some nice bank.
WILL
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
CHUCKIE
It's a way outta here.
WILL
What do I want a way outta here for?
I want to live here the rest of my
life. I want to be your next door
neighbor. I want to take out kids to
little league together up Foley Field.
CHUCKIE
Look, you're my best friend, so don't
take this the wrong way, but in 20
years, if you're livin' next door to
me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin'
Patriots' games and still workin'
construction, I'll fuckin' kill you.
And that's not a threat, that's a
fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
WILL
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
CHUCKIE
Listen, you got somethin' that none
of us have.
WILL
Why is it always this? I owe it to
myself? What if I don't want to?
CHUCKIE
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty
and I'll still be doin' this. And
that's all right 'cause I'm gonna
make a run at it.
But you, you're
sittin' on a winning lottery ticket
and you're too much of a pussy to
cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause
I'd do anything to have what you
got! And so would any of these guys.
It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if
you're still here in twenty years.
WILL
You don't know that.
CHUCKIE
Let me tell you what I do know. Every
day I come by to pick you up, and we
go out drinkin' or whatever and we
have a few laughs. But you know what
the best part of my day is? The ten
seconds before I knock on the door
'cause I let myself think I might
get there, and you'd be gone. I'd
knock on the door and you wouldn't
be there. You just left.
A beat.
CHUCKIE
Now, I don't know much. But I know
that.
CUT TO:
Will walking through South Boston. He cuts through a park. A
senior citizen is spearing trach for the city.
Will walks up to a nondescript building, he walks through
the glass doors, into the lobby.
CUT TO:
As they come out the door, rather than beating Will
mercilessly, they stop. Morgan goes into his own, personal
rendition of "Danny Boy." No one joins in.
CHUCKIE
Shut up, Morgan.
(to Will)
Here's your present.
Chuckie indicates an old CHEVY NOVA, parked illegally in
front of the bar.
WILL
You're kiddin' me.
CHUCKIE
Yeah, I figured now that you got
your big job over in Cambridge, you
needed some way to get over there
and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you
every day...
Laughter.
CHUCKIE
Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.
MORGAN
No I didn't...
Will approaches the car to take a closer look.
CHUCKIE
But you're twenty-one now, so--
BILLY
Yeah, now that you can drink legally,
we thought the best thing to get you
was a car.
More laughter. Will inspects the Nova.
WILL
You're kiddin' me.
(a beat)
This is the ugliest fuckin' car I
ever seen in my life.
Laughter, a beat.
WILL
(serious)
How the fuck did you guys do this?
CHUCKIE
Me and Bill scraped together the
parts, worked on it. Morgan was out
panhandlin' every day.
MORGAN
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose
fuckin' router you think sanded out
all that bondo?
CHUCKIE
Guy's been up my ass for two years
about a fuckin' job. I had to let
him help with the car.
WILL
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
MORGAN
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
WILL
(to Chuckie)
So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai
engine under there? Can I make it
back to my house?
CHUCKIE
Fuck you. I re-built the engine
myself.
That thing could make it to
Hawaii if you wanted it to.
Chuckie gives Will a look.
CHUCKIE
Happy 21, Will.
CUT TO:
Will sits alone, thinking. We hold on him for an extended
beat until he gets up and walks away.
OMITTED
Begin final sequence.
A wide, establishing shot of Sean's apartment complex as the
sun is setting. The lights are on in one unit. A tighter
shot reveals Sean, in his apartment, packing his belongings
in cardboard boxes.
The camera cranes down from Sean's window and onto the street,
where we pan to reveal Will, sitting in his car and looking
up at Sean as he packs his things. Will's car is packed full
of clothes and books.
Chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the Cadillac.
Morgan and Billy ride in the back, leaving the shotgun seat
open for Will.
Will holds an envelope which he slips in Sean's mailbox. He
puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at Sean in his
apartment who is still unaware that Will is there.
Chuckie pulls up in front of Will's house. He honks the horn,
waits a beat, then gets out and heads toward the house.
Will drives away from Sean's house. Sean hears the car pull
out and looks out the window. Sean sees Will's car pulling
away.
Curious, he investigates.
Chuckie walks up Will's front steps.
Sean walks out to the sidewalk and looks around. Seeing the
mailbox flag has been raised, he walks over to it.
Chuckie knocks on Will's front door. There is no answer. He
waits a beat, looks in the window. An incredulous smile slowly
starts to form.
Sean opens the card Will left for him. It reads:
WILL
(in writing)
Sean -- If the Professor calls about
that job, just tell him, "Sorry, I
had to go see about a girl."
Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the
broad smile. He knows Will is gone. He shrugs in explanation
to the guys. Morgan takes Will's seat as they pull away from
the curb.
We pan up from the letter to Sean. A broad smile comes over
him.
This is a look we haven't seen. Sean is truly happy.
Will is on the road, driving away. As we pull back and credits
roll, the car disappears into the horizon.
