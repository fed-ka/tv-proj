      FADE IN:

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (DAY ONE)

      ADAM and DERS are playing CHESS (though we don t see the 
      pieces yet).   

                                  ADAM
                    I see you re using the Sicilian 
                    defense.  Too bad it s no match for 
                    my King s Gambit. 

      Adam makes his move and slaps an ALARM CLOCK as if it were a 
      chess clock.

                                  ANDERS
                    You are just repeating terminology 
                    that you ve memorized.

      REVEAL:  Instead of chess pieces, they are using mini-bottles 
      of various liquors.  Adam moves a piece.  SLAPS clock.  Ders 
      makes a quick move knocking over one of Adam s pieces.

                                  ANDERS (CONT D)
                    Clearly you forgot that Crown Royal 
                    can move in any direction.  Now 
                    drink up.

                                  ADAM
                    Don t tell me how it works, I m 
                    basically the Bobby Fish of Booze 
                    Chess.

      Adam takes the fallen piece, opens it, DRINKS it.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Is it weird that I want to lose?

      BLAKE enters dressed in a policeman s uniform with the shirt 
      unbuttoned, exposing his chest.

                                  ANDERS
                    Whoa, can we help you, officer?

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, looking like L.L. on NCSI.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              2.

                                  BLAKE
                    I know, pretty dope, right?  It s 
                    for my pole dancing class at the 
                    rec center.

                                  ADAM
                    Now that s a smart way to meet the 
                    ladies.

                                  BLAKE
                    No, it s a smart way to get a great 
                    work out.  And yes, I ve made a lot 
                    of really cool friends.  I 
                      definitely plan on staying in touch 
                    with Cheryl, Penny, and Lori.  Just 
                    good gal pals.

                                  ANDERS
                    And people wear costumes to this 
                    class?

                                  BLAKE
                    I think they ll start after they 
                    saw how awesome I looked today.  
                    Check it out: Freeze!  I m going to 
                    need you to spread  em!

      Blake hums an R&B song while grinding against the banister. 

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                          (Doing a butt grab)
                    A little of this guy.  Then some of 
                    the nip-shaking.  My sex appeal is 
                    no big deal.

                                  ADAM
                    Keep going.

                                  ANDERS
                          (deadly serious)
                    He s really good.

                                  BLAKE
                    And this next move is called... 
                    Sexual Justice!

      Blake tears off his breakaway pants.  Now he s wearing MINI 
      POLICE BOOTY SHORTS and we SLAM TO:

      MAIN TITLES.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE - DAY (DAY TWO)

      Adam, Blake, and Ders crowd one of their computers ogling the 
      monitor.

                                  ADAM
                    Are you saying you wouldn t bang 
                    Tyra Banks in this fat-suit?

                                  ANDERS
                    I don t think that s a fat suit.  I 
                    can see her gunt.

                                  BLAKE
                    That s a faux-gunt.  Totally 
                      prosthetic.  Unlike my boner, which 
                    is so real.

                                  ADAM
                    Wait, what s a gunt again?

      BRADLEY, 25, mentally handicapped, enters wearing slacks, a 
      button-up shirt, and a NAME TAG.

                                    BRADLEY
                    It s a Gut-Cunt.  Hi, I m Bradley, 
                    the office ISP Supervisor.  I 
                    monitor your web activity.  A lot 
                    of porn, boys.  

      At this, the guys are confused.

                                  ADAM
                    Wait, you re our ISP guy?

                                    BRADLEY
                    What, you don t think I could be an 
                    ISP Supervisor? 

      He taps his name tag.  The guys suddenly feel terrible.

                                    ADAM/ANDERS/BLAKE
                    No!/Not at all./That s not what we 
                    meant.

                                  ANDERS
                    We just meant we don t watch any 
                      pornography.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              4.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ADAM
                    What is porn even?

                                  BLAKE
                    I think it s sexier when women 
                    don t show skin.

                                  ANDERS
                    You know what I find sexy?  A pair 
                    of beautiful eyes.  The curve of a 
                    neck.  A laugh.

      Bradley leans in conspiratorially. 

                                    BRADLEY
                    Cut the shit, jag holes.  I can 
                    keep this info from your boss... 
                    for a fee.

      The guys are relieved, and quickly start searching their 
      wallets for cash.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh, phew.  Cause we watch a lot of 
                      pornography.  Mostly the weird 
                    stuff.  DP, 3P, 4P, 5P.

                                  ANDERS
                          (shyly)
                    I like boo-cake.

                                  BLAKE
                    Mr. Chew s Asian Beaver.  The guy s 
                      a showman.

      Anders pools their money, and hands it to Bradley.  It s a 
      few bills and some change.

                                  ANDERS
                    Okay, here you go.  That is 
                      approximately fourteen bucks and my  
                    Barnes and Noble membership card.

      Just then, ALICE walks over. 

                                  ALICE
                    I see you met my brother, Bradley.  
                    Did he scam you for money?

      The guys look at each other -- they just got totally punked!  
      They nod at Bradley, impressed.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              5.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  BLAKE
                    So you re not an ISP Supervisor?

                                    BRADLEY
                    That s not even a real thing.  

                                  ADAM
                    I ll have to watch myself around 
                    this guy.

      Adam high-fives Bradley.

                                  ALICE
                    Give them their money back, Brad.

      WAYMOND peeks around the corner. 

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    You re not getting your money back, 
                    Waymond!  It s sixty bucks.  Jesus, 
                    let it go.

      Waymond sadly exits.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    Anyway, Brad, I gotta work late 
                    tonight.  But there are leftover 
                    calzones in the fridge.

                                    BRADLEY
                    Ugh, I m tired of being cooped up 
                    in your stupid widow-pad.

                                  ALICE
                    I m not a widow, Bradley, I got 
                    divorced!  I m an independent 
                    woman, in the prime of my life.

      Bradley rolls his eyes, as our guys snicker.

                                    BRADLEY
                    You re thirty-nine and alone.  I 
                    run train on chicks like you.

      The guys look at each other, amazed and impressed -- they 
      can t believe someone is talking to Alice like this.

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    Why don t I hang with these guys?

                                  ALICE
                          (to Bradley)
                    Really?  These guys, Brad?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              6.

      CONTINUED: (3)

                                  BLAKE
                    Yeah, let B-Rad come hang with us.

                                    BRADLEY
                    Come on, Alice.  For B-Rad.

                                  ALICE 
                    Fine.

                                      ADAM/ANDERS/BLAKE/BRADLEY
                        Yes!/Awesome!/Niiiiice!

      Blake and Ders pal with Bradley and Alice grabs Adam aside.

                                  ALICE
                    I love my brother more than 
                    anything.  I don t get to see him 
                    that much -- so have a good time, 
                    but don t do anything stupid, or I 
                    will be eating a 6-testicle 
                    omelette for breakfast tomorrow.

      Adam s eyes widen.

                                  ADAM
                          (terrified)
                    Okay.

      EXT. OFFICE - PARKING LOT - LATER

      Adam, Anders, Blake, and Bradley walk in the parking lot to 
      Ders  car.

                                  ADAM
                    So tonight, throwback video games. 
                    Goldeneye or MarioKart?

      Adam holds up the video games.

                                  BLAKE
                    Yes!

                                  ANDERS
                    I thought we could throw Bradley a 
                    Taste of Italy Night.  I ll fire up 
                    the Panini press--

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, maybe if our grandmothers 
                    were visiting from the old country.  
                    We re playing MarioKart and I call 
                    Bowser.  See you on Rainbow Road.

                    Yeah, all that sounds like it would 
                    be fun... If I was ten!  

      The guys look at each other, surprised.

                                  BLAKE
                    Well what do you want to do?

      INT. BAR - LATER

      MONTAGE of the guys getting fucked up with Bradley:

      1.  Adam lays on the bar as Bradley holds a bottle of Jack 
      Daniels like it s his dick and pours it into Adam s mouth.

      2.  Bradley and Blake sing karaoke for the entire bar.

      3.  Bradley and Anders do the electric slide (or the dance TI 
      and JT do in the My Love video).

      4.  Bradley does a flaming-shot with no hands.

      5.  Anders wins at foosball and the guys POUR A PITCHER OF 
      BEER on his head.

      EXT. BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Anders, Blake, Adam, and Bradley stumble out of a bar.  
      Bradley, who is smoking, finishes the rest of an almost empty 
      beer, and then throws the bottle against a brick wall.  

                                  BLAKE 
                    Wooo!  We are drunk!  Just a bunch 
                    of drunk guys!

                    Nice work in there, B-Rad.

                    This totally beats Alice and her 
                      two-dollar Chardonnay.

                                  ANDERS
                    Speaking of Alice, we should call a 
                    cab and get you home.

                    We re not calling a cab, you ve 
                    only had two beers.  We re not 
                    paying for a cab.

                                    BRADLEY
                    I m not going home.  It s Thursday 
                    night!  That s power hour night!

                                  ADAM
                    Um... we definitely have some mini-
                    bottles of Beefeater, but they re 
                    really for Chess.  Oh, and Blake 
                    bought some Vermouth, but hasn t 
                    figured out what to mix it with.

      Ders TURNS to the guys, having made his point.  REVEAL the 
      three other guys are sitting in the car waiting for Ders.  He 
      SIGHS, defeated and walks to the car.

      INT. GUYS' CAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Ders nervously drives with Adam shotgun and Blake and Bradley 
      in the back.

                                  ADAM
                    Punch it, they stop selling beer in 
                    like five minutes!

                                    BRADLEY
                    S go!

      Bradley grabs Blake while Adam and Ders stay in the car.  
      After a beat:

                          (to Ders)
                    It turns me on when you talk about

      INT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

      Blake and Bradley race to the CASHIER with a case of beer.

                                  BLAKE
                    One case of beers, please.

      The cashier shakes his head and taps the clock on the 
      register.

                                    CASHIER
                    I m sorry, it s 2:02.

                    C mon, man.  Be a king tonight.  
                    Make that choice.

      He shakes his head, and Blake and Bradley walk back to the 
      beverage aisle to put back the beers.  Blake is dejected.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    Once again, the rules of society

                    PUSSY!!!  Come on, man.  Watch and 
                    learn.

      He hands Blake the case of beers, then tears it open.  Blake 
      looks around, freaked.  Bradley takes a case of soda and 
      starts emptying it, and switching beers for sodas.

                                  BLAKE
                    Look at this dude.  Beer MacGruber.

                    This is  day one  shit, dude.

      Bradley finishes and they head back up to the cashier.

                    One case of sodas, please.

      The cashier suspiciously rings them up.  Blake looks to 
      Bradley who nods at him like,  We got this.   As they re 
      getting rung up, Blake nervously chats the Cashier.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    I like your weird tie.

      All set, they start to walk out.

                            change)
                    Keep the change.

      Just as they re almost out of the store, the case RIPS, and a 
      BEER falls out.  They make EYE CONTACT with the Cashier.  He 
      menacingly FLICKS OPEN an EXPANDING BATON.  Oh FUCK!!!

      FADE IN:

      INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

      We come back on Blake and Bradley, frozen as they stare at 
      the Cashier. 

                                  BLAKE
                    What?  That s not a soda at all.  I 
                    want my money back!

      The Cashier LUNGES toward them.  Bradley THROWS the change in 
      his face.

                                    BRADLEY
                    Run!

      EXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

      Ders and Adam standing outside the car (trunk open), playing 
      hackey-sack with their keys.  Ders holds up Blake s cop 
      uniform to his chest, before throwing it back in the trunk.

                    You always say you re not gonna

                    into the ride, you are opening 
                      containers like crazy.

                                  ADAM

      REVEAL Adam hanging brain through his fly (blurred out).

      Just then Blake and Bradley (with the case of beers) come 
      BARRELLING out of the store.

                    hanging out?!

      Ders and Adam are confused, but they jump in the car and 
      start it up.  The Cashier is nearing the car, but Blake jumps 
      in and LOCKS his door in time.  Bradley goes for the other 
      side, but he s blocked by the Cashier.  Bradley and the 
      Cashier go back and forth around the car, one way, then the 
      other.  He has no choice -- He dives into the trunk with the 
      beers, and Ders peels out.

                                  ADAM
                    Did B-Rad just jump in the trunk 
                    with a case of Diet Shasta?

      INT. GUYS' CAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Through the seat, Blake and Adam open the arm rest leading 
      into the trunk so they can talk to Bradley (who s still in 
      the trunk).  Ders is driving, looking crazy stressed.

      Blake and Adam shake their heads.  Bradley pops his head 
      through the arm rest.

                                    BRADLEY
                    All me, dogg.  Just hot-boxing with 
                    God.

      Bradley pulls the armrest closed.

                       Hot-boxing with God ?

                    This guy s savage.

      Ders brings the car to a stop.  They re in a long line of 
      traffic.  Now Ders is really starting to panic.

      But Ders is already GONE with the keys.  Adam and Blake share 
      a scared look.  Then they, too, bolt out of the car.

      EXT. GUYS' CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Blake and Adam jump out to follow Ders.  They get a few 
      yards, then:

                                  BLAKE
                    Wait!  Bradley!

      They turn back to see a COP approaching the car.  There s no 
      way they can go back.  

      EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

      Adam and Blake lie in the TALL GRASS, twenty feet from the 
      road with Ders.

      getting towed away!

      EXT. STREET - LATER

      We see Karl s weird van, with the word  Rape  written on the 
      side, parked outside of a tow yard.

      INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

      Our guys sit holding walkie-talkies.  KARL is wearing weird, 
      LOUD  No Limit Soldier -type camouflage.  He hands Blake a 
      pair of bolt cutters.

                                  KARL
                    Alright soldiers, so here s how it 
                    goes down: We ll break into two-man 
                    teams -- Blake and Ders are our men 
                    inside.  Me and DeMamp will stay 
                    here at HQ...

                          (as if it s obvious)
                    I wrote that on there.  The van 
                    doesn t have locks so that keeps 
                    the weirdos away.

                    Okay, now it s more fair.

      Ders comes on through the walkie, in Adam s pocket...

                                  ANDERS (O.S.)
                    Adam, where are you?  We re in here 
                    with the car, but--

      Adam futzes with the walkie.  Tow Yard Guy s onto him.

                                  ADAM
                    So you tow cars and stuff, that s 
                    cool.  Love your tatts.  What is 
                    that, Satan?  I got a nautical star 
                    on my calf.  Tatt brooooos.

      INT. TOW YARD - AT THE SAME TIME 

      Blake and Ders sit hunched in the car.  Into the walkie:

                    I bet listening to Sebastian s 
                    music really makes you want to 
                    blaze.  We have got to get an early 
                    cut of that album.

      Just then there is an OMINOUS TAP on the window.  The Tow 
      Yard Guy is standing there holding up the walkie-talkie.

      EXT. TOW YARD - MOMENTS LATER

      Adam, Blake, and Ders face the angry looking Tow Yard Guy.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                          (re: Ders  car)
                    You guys broke in here to steal 
                    this piece of shit?

                                  ANDERS
                    It s not a piece of shit, it s very 
                    reliable.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    Whores are reliable.  Now, you guys 
                    broke into my lot--

                                  ADAM
                    I was brought in against my will.

      Off the Tow Yard Guy s menacing look, Adam shuts up.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                      Regardless, you re here now, so I 
                    can do whatever I want to you.  

      He pulls out an EXPANDING BATON and FLICKS it open.  

                                  BLAKE
                    Why does everybody except me have 
                    one of those?

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    So who s asshole needs a baton up 
                    it?

      Our dudes look freaked.  Then from out of nowhere:

                                    BRADLEY (O.S.)
                    Hold it right there!

      The guys look over to see Bradley emerging from the shadows, 
      DRESSED IN BLAKE'S COP OUTFIT. 

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    This vehicle is part of an ongoing 
                      investigation, which makes it 
                    police property.  I ll be taking it 
                    and these gentlemen.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    You re a cop?

                                    BRADLEY
                    What, you don t think I could be a 
                    cop?  

      He taps his badge.  The Tow Yard Guy stammers.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    No, no, that s not what I meant.  
                    They re all yours.  Sorry about 
                    that, Officer.

      Bradley nods and the three guys walk toward the car.

                                    BRADLEY
                          (to Tow Yard Guy)
                    Don t make me come back here.

      As Bradley opens the Kia door for the guys to get in, his 
      pants get caught and they BREAKAWAY, revealing the tiny 
      STRIPPER SHORTS.  Tow Yard Guy realizes he s been fooled.

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    Go!  Go!  Go!

      They jump in the car and PEEL OUT.

      INT. GUYS' CAR - LATER

      They celebrate Bradley being awesome.

                                  BLAKE
                    B-Rad, strikes again!  You totally 
                    had him fooled until those pants 
                    got sexy on you.

                    going to be severely pissed when we

                                    BRADLEY
                    She might not have to know -- I 
                    just got a text from her, she s 
                    just heading home from the office

                    This is what I m talking about,

                                  BLAKE
                    What kind of work is she doing in 
                    the office this late?  Nothing

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Alice pulls up to a STOP LIGHT.  A car pulls up next to her, 
      she looks over.  It s our guys, but Blake has put his hair 
      over Bradley s head as a disguise.  Alice does a double take, 
      but when she looks back, they ve driven away.
