The CAMERA STARTS FROM THE CEILING, pointing straight
down, overlooking a table of twenty-five people dressed
in business casual, pretending to have a good time at
lunch in. this cookie-cutter crappy restaurant.
At the end of the table, a bowl of spinach dip is in.
front of Wesley,'and the CAMERA STARTS descending
directly for it, slowly, as we hear...
WESLEY (V.O.)
It was Rochelle's birthday, which meant
there was a certain amount of inter-
office pressure to go to Appleby's and
sit at a table of twenty-five with my
boss Janice presiding at the head even
though she's too tight to pick up the
bill. Which meant, the poor bastard
waiting on us had to split the check
twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing
to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf,
no less -- don't do us any favors,
Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of
extreme nachos and then polished off a
bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single-
handedly...
The CAMERA DISAPPEARS in the bowl of spinach dip and
we...
CUT TO:
.where Wesley drops his head down on his desk.
2.
WESLEY
.so by the time I got back to my
cubicle, my eyelids were so damn heavy, I
had to put my head down, even if it was
just for a wink.
SMASH CUT TO:
He heads to an elevator and presses a button for the top
floor.
And as his finger presses the button, just where the
thumb meets the forefinger, we see a TATTOO of a three-
headed dog.
Soon...
.the doors open again and he finds himself in an
opulent corridor -- sleek and expensively designed.
Only one office is at the end of the hall.
Expressionless, he makes his way toward it. Without
knocking, he steps inside...
.an office fit for a king. Or a queen. Because behind
a glass desk sits a beautiful Indian woman dressed
traditionally in a serape, with a red bindi on her
forehead, the holy third eye. Her name is PUJA.
Mr. X sits in the single chair opposite her.
After a moment, Puja looks up.
PUJA
I didn't expect for you yourself to come.
One of the heads, in the flesh.
MR. X
You're an important fence.
3.
PUJA
I'm flattered.
She reaches over to an attach case and removes a file.
PUJA (CONT'D)
The name of the target is Henry Helms.
Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a
few feet away from Mr. X, who rises so that they are both
standing. She really is quite beautiful, exotic even,.
with piercing eyes.
PUJA (CONT'D)
He's a journalist who stumbled on to a
story exposing a lot of powerful people,
people who don't like having their power
threatened.
MR. x
Poor Helms.
PUJA
There.have been five attempts on his
life, but he has been well protected...
and well hidden. Turns out his wife's
family has a lot of money. He's in town
to accept an award.
MR. X
We'll see to it that it never makes his
mantle.
PUJA
And for that, my clients will pay
handsomely.
Mr. X is looking at Puja when a curious thing happens...
.he notices that the red bindi on he r forehead tarts
to move a little, like a second dot is trying to emerge
from it, like an amoeba splitting.
It's a sh hooter's laser!
His eyes go wide as saucers.
MR. x
GET DOWN1!1
.but it's too late as bullets rip into her head.
splattering everything above her eyebrows into the wet
bar.
4.
Mr. X crouches, drops his hands behind his back, and a.
PAIR OF GUNS -- as technologically advanced as anything
we've ever seen -- spring into his hands.
The bullets .stop flying and he sprints at the window from
which they came, smashing t rough what remains of it,
disappearing from the demolished room...
.all this as Puja's dead body hits the floor, blood
seeping out of that holy third eye.
.Wesley Gibson, the guy from the opening scene, fast
asleep in his little cubicle. Some drool falls off his
lip and 'erks h' awake.
Just then, the shot FREEZE-FRAMES, and we see IN THE
BACKGROUND OF THE SHOT, his fat boss JANICE caught in mid-
stride coming toward him, looking like she's ready to
bring the wrath of God.
WESLEY (V.O.)
My name is Wesley Gibson. If you look at
the corner of my desk, you'll see the
billing reports I was supposed to hand in
to Janice an hour ago.
The BILLING ORT is highlighted on the screen for just
a moment.
.then the movie RESUMES normal speed and Janice reaches
Wesley's cube in no time...
BOSS JANICE
Oh my fucking god I hope that's not my
billing report sitting on your fucking
desk. Holy shit on an altar, it isl
A couple of the other OFFICE WORKERS look up at the
fireworks and smile... like they're actually enjoying
Janice's histrionics.
BOSS JANICE (CONT'D)
why don't you just take a dump in your
hands, fork it over to me and say, "this
is the best effort I'm gonna give to you,
Janice. This is the best you're ever
gonna get out of me." Hell, Rochelle on
her bbirthdav is doing a better a job than
your lazy ass and she's already left for
the day. Je-sus CHRIST!
Wesley looks like he'd rather be anywhere else.
WESLEY
I meant to...
BOSS JANICE
(imitating him)
I meant to... I meant to... Well I meant
to be a size four but meaning to doesn't
pick no cotton.
9.
She snatches up the report off his desk.
BOSS JANICE (CONT'D)
Tell you what. I'll just input the four-
ones myself.
(ANNOUNCES)
Look everyone, I'm gonna do Wesley's four-
ones for him! I don't have enough to do
with my own damn job so I'll do Wesley's
too!
Wesley grabs the report back.
WESLEY
I'll do it.
BOSS JANICE
Minimum for the maximum. That's all you
ever do. The minimum you can do to suck
the maximum from this company.
WESLEY
I said I'll get it done. I'm sorry.
BOSS JANICE
No, you're worthless. I'm the one who's
sorry I hired you.
She storms away, fuming.
Wesley looks over and sees some of the other workers
still staring at him, amused.
He sits back down to the semi-privacy of his little
cubicle.
CUT TO:
A CONSULTANT in a suit is droning on and on in front of a
nifty power-point presentation.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Wesley, bored to tears,
sitting at a long table with Janice and other corporate
minions.
The CAMERA FINDS Wesley's note-pad where it looks like
he's taking notes on the presentation. Instead, covering
every inch of the page, is the phrase "life sucks then
you die."
10.
WESLEY (V.O.)
My job title is Account Manager. I used
to be called an Account Service
Representative, but a consultant told us
we needed to "manage" our clients and not
" service- them.
Onemore "life sucks then you die."
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage
nor service.
CUT TO:
Wesley's GIRLFRIEND is currently riding some guy named
BARRY on her living room.couch. She's not very
attractive, sort of plain and ordinary.
WESLEY (V.0.)
Her name's Cathy. She works at Banana
Republic. The guy she's humping is my
best friend, Barry.
She's giving it her best. As her MOANS reach a
crescendo, we...
CUT BACK TO:
Wesley is still sitting there with his note pad, while
the consultant continues to rattle on and on about God
knows what.
Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley can spot
his company.'s hot intern, NICOLE, talking on the phone.
He zeroes in on her, until...
Wesley suddenly looks around the room and everyone ijL_
staring at him.
WESLEY
(HESITANTLY)
Yes. Uh... Well the 602 deals with
applications sent by prospective clients
and the 603 is when the client is...
Everyone is still just staring...
11.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, Jesus... uh... what was the
question?
CONSULTANT
I asked you about the effects of net
investment income with regards to
underwriting cycles.
WESLEY
Well, that's the thing.-
CONSULTANT
What's the thing?
WESLEY
(trying to redeem himself)
Cycles. Hard market, industry-wide
cycles differ from our firm's cycles so I
think it's amistake to apply...
JANICE
Good God a'mighty.
CONSULTANT
Son... everyone knows that net
investment income is inversely related to
both premium and loss reserves, making
firm cycles inherently dependent on
industry cycles!
Everyone snickers.
CONSULTANT (CONT'D)
In fact, to prove my point, I'd like you
to spend some time this afternoon adding
up the yearly differential responses.
JANICE
Get it to me by five.
WESLEY
Sure.
Wesley jots down on his pad: "ACTION ITEMS," and
underneath it: "Differential responses... then you die."
He underlines it three times.
Wesley sits at a small round table by himself, eating a
ham and cheese on white.
12.
A group of. other WORKERS sit at a table nearby, gossiping
and guffawing about whatever shit they have to discuss.
WESLEY (V.O.)
There are people, everyday you meet them,
who you wish could see you in a different
setting, a different place...
Just then, Nicole, the pretty intern, approaches and
starts fishing through the refrigerator.
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
.instead of where you are, what you've
become.
Wesley sits upright, glad now that no one is sitting at
his table. Nicole turns and smiles at Wesley, starts to
head his way, when...
LOUDMOUTH AT OTHER TABLE
Nicole! Get your ass over here and.tell
us what the hell is going on with you and
Whitcock the big cock!
He pulls a chair over from next to Wesley to make room
for her at his table.
Wesley just takes another bite of his sandwich.
Wesley is staring, at his monitor...
WESLEY (V.0.)
And you wish to god your eyeballs weren't
being sucked out of their sockets by
monitor fatigue. That you didn't spend
five years in college to do goddamn
differential responses.
see that he is actually i>laying solitaire on the
computer. He keeps checking over his shoulder for
Janice, but she is talking on the phone in her office
with the door shut.
He looks up and watches the computer clock turn from 4:59
to 5:00. He saves his solitaire game and then turns off
the computer, snatches up his jacket, waits for Janice to
turn her back to him as she is engrossed in her call, and
then sneaks away.
Wesley presses the down button and waits.
13.
WESLEY
C'mon, c'mon.
After an eternity, the doors open.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
But at least at the end. of the day...
Wesley steps in and turns around. Before the doors
close, he sees his boss Janice down the hall, looking at
him. She checks her watch and looks back at him,
pissed...
WESLEY (CONT'D)
(DEFEATED)
.you know that tomorrow it's going to
start all over again.
..and then the doors close.
He starts to head away when Barry pokes his head out of
the apartment door.
BARRY
(INSINCERELY)
You want me to go with you, buddy?
What a dick. Wesley doesn't turn around, defeated...
WESLEY
I got it.
A young Wesley, 10, sits at a table with a couple of
RELIGIOUS FOSTER PARENT WACKOS.
WESLEY (V.0.)
The nutjobs I had as foster parents
thought any book that didn't contain a
red-letter edition was the spawn of the
devil...
.is.
Wesley stands, looking over all the different kinds of
noodles. None of them just say "spaghetti."
16.
Suddenly, a woman's voice pops up behind-him...
FOX
There is a remedy for all things but
death.
She said it so fast he's not sure he heard it right.
He turns and sees the-hottest zQZM ever to ace
Kroger's aisles: ox. She's wearing barely enough
clothing to cover her tight body.
WESLEY
(like he.didn't hear)
I'm sorry?
FOX
You apologize too much.
WESLEY
(stammers again)
Sorry?
She looks him in the eye.
FOX
Spina bifida babies have more backbone
than you.
With that, she walks toward the end of the aisle, eyes
scanning the whole time.
Stunned, all Wesley can do is watch her walk.
on the sMll f her back is a tatt It'
tattoo we saw in the be i n n : a thKee-head2d dog.
She gets to the end and catches him looking at her.
Then she makes a very subtle gesture with her head... as
if to say "come here."
Wesley still isn't sure what the hell is going on.
Sheepishly, he makes his way to where she stands.
She leans in close, her lips just inches from his ear.
FOX (CONT'D)
I knew your father.
Whatever Wesley was expecting_ it wasn't that. He pulls
back from her.
17.
WESLEY
I think you got the wrong guy.
FOX
Can't say that I agree with you, Wesley.
WESLEY
(running it all together)
What is this? How d'you know my name?
FOX
Your father...
WESLEY
My father died in a car wreck the week I
was born...
FOX
,Your father died two days ago on the
rooftop. of the Metropolitan Building.
For a moment, just a moment, Wesley is stunned, but Fox
just keeps sizing him up.
FOX (CONT'D)
He'd be damn disappointed in what you've
become, too.
Wesley holds up his hands in a defensive gesture...
WESLEY
Lady...
FOX
I've been called a lot of things, but
"lady" ain't one of 'em.
Wesley starts to talk but Fox interrupts him...
FOX (CONT'D)
Damn, Wesley, how d'you ever learn
anything when you won't keep your mouth
shut and your ears open? I'm trying to
tell you about your father.
Wesley starts to open his mouth again, but then closes
it. He waits.
FOX (CONT'D)
Your father, Wesley, wits the great sit
assassin to ever live. Your father,
Wesley, worked for the Fraternity.
is.
WESLEY
The Fraternity?
FOX
(keeps right on going)
Your father, Wesley, was set up and
gunned down by a man he used to consider
a friend. And your father, Wesley...
Suddenly, s raises her hands and-LS fist' two blgck
PISTOLS.
FOX (CONT'D)
.taught me everything I know.
Wesley takes a step back.
WESLEY
(SLOWLY)
What is this?
FOX
This is what you've dreamt about all your
life.
Just then, Cross o s the corner to t e' e
also fisting a Da'r of alms.
Wesley's eyes go wide as Fox suddenly starts firing, BAM!
BAMI BAMZ BAMI BAM: forcing Cross to take cover on the
far side of the aisle.
FOX (CONT'D)
Move! Now!
She screams this, grabbing Wesley's wrist and jerking him
forward, just as Cross comes back up, firing, a killing
machine.
They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle
explodes in an avalanche of bullets! Glass bottles of
spaghetti sauce shatter, turning the aisle into a
rainstorm of red droplets -- we're not sure what is sauce
and what is blood.
Then... Cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas
and up to the top of the freezer section, so he can have
a better angle of attack at the fleeing Fox and Wesley.
He starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section,
smashing over styrofoam coolers, as his bullets barely
miss Fox and Wesley, but slam into the freezers behind
them, sending ice and glass exploding everywhere.
19.
But Wesley and Fox are too quick.. She still has a.hold
of Wesley's wrist and she propels him through the
swinging doors of the stock room.
.t where Mr. Sloan stands next to a hucre man, THE
BUTCHER, who is slicing beef off of hanging cow
ca f es. There are flies buzzing around and blood
draining into the center of the floor.
If Wesley wasn't nervous before, he is now.
FOX
Mr. Sloan.
The Butcher looks up from his work and lays down the
knife, right next to where Mr. Sloan has a pair of silver
pistols and a magnifying glass resting on a rolling
table.
FOX (CONT'D)
(PROUDLY)
This is Wesley Gibson. He needs his life
changed.
The Butcher looks him over.
THE BUTCHER
We all end up where we belong, don't we?
The Butcher snickers. Sloan speaks up...
SLOAN
Fox told you about your father?
Wesley looks from Sloan to Fox to the Butcher and back to
Sloan.
23.
WESLEY
(STAMMERS)
Like I told... um... the lady here... I
think you might ha
ve me mixed up with
someone else. I'm just an... um...
account serv... uh..that is... account
manager... and... my father died...
He hesitates.
SLOAN
When?
They look at him, imploringly, waiting for an answer.
WESLEY
I... I guess I'm not sure.
Sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the
gun in Wesley's hand.
SLOAN
Shoot the wings off the flies.
WESLEY
What?!
SLOAN
(GROWLS)
Shoot... the wings... off the flies.
For. the first time, Wesley notices flies buzzing all
around.
WESLEY
I don't...
In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun
off the rolling table and ',s
-pointing it at Weslev's temple. He begins to count...
SLOAN
You have three seconds. Three... two...
Before he can say one, Wesley reacts... blindly firing
the pistol in his hand, indiscriminately, B,AM! BAM!
BAM! BAM! CLICK...CLICK...CLICK... until his finger is
just jamming on the trigger over and over.
After a moment, he looks up, unsure why he isn't dead.
24.
Sloan smiles, drops his pistol on the rolling table and
picks up the magnifying glass. He stoops down and
signals Wesley to do the same.
THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS:
Four flies lie on - the floor. crawling o d... their
wings actually separated from their bodies!
IN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
Wesley jerks upright, trying to process this.
FOX
Like I said, you got the skills.
SLOAN
And after we fine tune those skills...
His eyes lock on to Wesley's, holding them in a vice-like
grip...
SLOAN (CONT'D)
.you're going to hunt the man who
killed Your father.
Wesley is as stunned as we've ever seen him... he blinks
a couple of times.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
Walk with me.
He drapes his arm around Wesley and leads him out the
door.
The CAMERA moves over a diner's counter...
SLOAN (V.0.)
We stay in the shadows.
.. to the kitchen, where a massive man with a three-
headed dog tattoo on his hand, flips burgers. THE CHEF.
CUT TO:
The CAMERA moves down a gun display case...
SLOAN
Because the easiest place to hide is in
plain sight...
.until it finds a GUN SALESMAN holding out a weapon to
an Italian customer. He also has the tattoo. He's THE
GUNSMITH.
BACK TO:
The Chef loads plates of food up on the warmer, where a
WAITRESS picks them up and delivers them to a group of
prominent looking BUSINESSMEN.
The lead businessman digs into his steak, and immediately
his left arm starts to curl up, like he's having a heart
attack. His cohorts look on as he spills over, knocking
all the plates off the table, gasping for breath, his
throat closed.
When the CAMERA PANS OVER AGAIN, the Chef is gone.
CUT TO:
Sloan and Wesley enter a normal looking pharmacy. They
pass through the small front room and head directly to
the back.
SLOAN
We have been active for centuries,
Wesley... outlasting rulers, governments,
nations, kings. We recognize no borders;
the entire globe is our killing field.
They are buzzed through by THE PHARMACIST, and enter...
.a sophisticated back room, where a trio of flat screen
monitors are mounted on the wall.
SLOAN
We are the baddest of the bad, the three-
headed dog that guards the gates of hell.
We show no mercy, we destroy the weak, we
have absolute power.
(BEAT)
But recently, a fallen angel, one of our
own, has challenged that power.
The screens in the room come to life with the face of
Cross.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
This man left the Fraternity and decided
to strike down those who had befriended
him, trained him, made him who he is.
29.
SLOAN (V.0.)
..a son whose mother died in
childbirth...
They reach the baby's bed and a pair of strong arms lift
up the child. But the CAMERA FINDS the face of the
second man...
SLOAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
..he took the boy to an orphanage so his
true identity would never be discovered.
.and now we see that the other man is a YOUNG MR.
SLOAN.
SLOAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
And I helped him.
Wesley is still absorbing the story, his life so
different than when he got up in the morning.
WESLEY
Why would you do that?
Sloan puts a hand on Wesley's shoulder, gently.
Paternally.
SLOAN
Your father was like a brother to me.
(BEAT)
I will do anything to avenge his death.'
Sloan turns off the monitors and pulls over a wooden
chair from where it rests by a wall.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
So Wesley... you have a choice. Would
you like to go back to your job, your
girlfriend, your life, just as it was
before?
(BEAT)
Or would you like to begin your training
with an assassin's Fraternity that writes
the world's history in blood and bullets?
Wesley doesn't know what to say. Sloan moves to a back
door .
SLOAN (CONT'D)
If the answer is the latter, then have a
seat in that chair.
(MORE)
30.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
If not, you're welcome to head out this
door here and we'll never see each other
again.
With that., Sloan leaves through that back door. But...
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR:
He stops. He pulls out a gun and waits for Wesley to
make his decision, pointing his gun at the door.
BACK IN THE ROOM:
Wesley is still standing there, unaware of what is on the
other side of the door, thinking, thinking, thinking. He
takes a step toward the door...
FLASH: His boss Janice, yelling at him, mocking him.
Wesley hesitates, looks at the chair, then the door
again...
FLASH: His girlfriend on the couch, riding high on
Barry, loving every minute of it.
Wesley stands frozen, staring hard at the chair as THE
CAMERA STARTS to swirl around him.
FLASHES: The consultant haranguing, the other employees
laughing, eating.alone in the break room, riding his
bike, all the aspects of his shitty life...
.. as the CAMERA CONTINUES to swirl around him, his face
going hard...
WESLEY (V.O.)
Fuck consultants and fuck action items
and fuck differential responses. Fuck it
all.
He takes a seat in the chair, which creaks when he sits
in it.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
(out loud)
Fuck it all.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BACK DOOR:
Sloan hears the creak of the chair and lowers his gun.
He smiles and walks off down an alley.
31.
IN THE ROOM:
Wesley waits in the chair for what seems an eternity.
starts to bite his thumbnail, nervously.
In comes the Pharmacist. The man is built like a
mountain, with muscles rippling out of his white smock.
.He's got a British accent and is extremely polite.
THE PHARMACIST
'Ah, made your choice, did 'ja, of boy?
WESLEY
(UNCOMFORTABLY)
Yeah.
THE PHARMACIST
Very good, very good.
He walks behind Wesley.
THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
The weather's been lovely the last couple
o' days-- would you mind putting your
hands back here for me?
Wesley does, and the Pharmacist binds his hands with some
rope.
THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
There, that's it. Very good.
WESLEY
Is this the beginning of my training?
THE PHARMACIST
Quite right.
The Pharmacist cracks his knuckles and then,
WHAM!!! He hits Wesley so hard right in the cheek
that it almost knocks him out of the chair.
WESLEY
What the fuck are...
WHANIlM 4!!!1 The Pharmacist smashes him again.
Wesley struggles against the ropes but isn't going
anywhere. The Pharmacist rears back. and WHAM! WHAMMM!
WHAMQ! keeps hitting him over-and over again until
Wesley's eyes roll to the back of his head.
32.
FADE TO BLACK.
CUT TO:
WESLEY (V.O.)
You know how when you have a dream and
wake up unexpectedly...
Wesley jerks awake in his bed...
WESLEY (V.O.)
...and the dream is still. on the fringe
of your brain but you can't quite
remember the details?
He looks up at his ceiling fan, barely turning, a few
blades missing...
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
But then you see that same old busted
ceiling fan over your bed and you are so
damn glad it was just a dream?
He sits up on his bed and checks himself in the mirror.
His face has been pummeled; it looks like a piece of
squashed fruit.
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
This was nothing like that.
.that little spinning wheel on a monitor tbAt indicates
your computer stuck. Wesley sits in his cubicle,
staring at it.
Then...
33.
NICOLE
What happened to your face?
Wesley turns in his chair, surprised. Nicole stands
there, looking as pretty as ever, way out of -his league.
WESLEY
(SHEEPISH)
I... uh...I got hit by a man much bigger
than me.
Nicole smiles, flirtatiously.
NICOLE
Was this over a girl?
WESLEY
Something like that.
NICOLE
I had no idea you had such a secret life
outside of here.
She cocks her head and studies him.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
Is there something different about you?
Besides the... face?
WESLEY
No. Not really. Same old Wesley.
NICOLE
I don't think so.
She puts her hand on top of his; he can only stare at
it... this kind of thing just doesn't happen to him.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
You aren't like these people Wesley.
I've always thought you were different.
WESLEY
Would you consider me to be an observant
person?
NICOLE
What's that mean?
Wesley's about to say something, when he spots Janice
heading their way.
Wesley nods at her and Nicole frowns.
34.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
Uh-oh, here comes the wicked bitch of the
west...
With that, she steps away, just as Janice walks up.
Wesley stands to face his boss, as Janice launches into
him...
BOSS JANICE
Jesus H. Fucking Popscile, you don't have
time to get me the differential responses
but you got time to chitty-chatty with
the intern? Why do I even keep you
around, Wesley? Well I know one thing,
your review is coming up next week and I
can't wait to start checking me off some
boxes... attitude: poor, performance:
poor, management skills: poor, works well
with others...
Wesley just focuses on that mouth. Fat lips over fat
gums over yellow teeth. But now all that's coming out of
it is JIBBERISH.
' I Jibberish that goes straight from her larynx to Wesley's
ears where it imbeds in the soft flesh of his brain and
BURNS... It's so goddamn loudl if only...
...if only it would just...
WESLEY
(ROARS)
SHUT THE FUCK UP11!!1111
It's so unbelievably stunning coming out of Wesley's
mouth that it hits Janice like a slap in the face.
Heads all over the office start to poke out of the tops
of their cubicles like gophers coming out of holes.
Nicole watches, pleasantly stunned, from a few feet away.
Janice looks around, shocked. Wesley likes the way that
felt, so...
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Just because you have one single iota of
tenuous power, you think you can push
everyone around?
(MORE)
35.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
.I understand, Janice, that junior high
must have been particularly difficult
being called Tubby all the time, but that
doesn't give you the goddamn right to
treat your workers like horseshit. Sure
we laugh at you behind your back and sure
we know you keep a stash of jelly
doughnuts in the top drawer of your
desk...
Janice looks down at her fingers, which still have a
little grape jelly on them...
WESLEY (CONT'D)
.and sure everyone takes their lunch an
hour before you so we can get an extra
hour away from you, and I know that must
sting sitting by yourself in the White
Castle parking lot every day gnawing on
your third burger thinking up ways to
humiliate us...
Janice's eyes fall to her feet.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
.you know, if you weren't such a bitch,
we might actually feel sorry for you. As
it is, I feel I can speak for the rest of
the office when I say... FUCK YOU!!!
With that, he throws all the papers off his desk, sending
them flying!
Empowered, Wesley marches toward the elevators as
everyone watches him go, admiration plastered on their
faces.
The loudmouth from the break-room steps out...
LOUDMOUTH
That was great dude!
He holds up his hand for a high-five, but Wesley just
WALLOPS him with a right cross, not breaking stride on
his way to the elevators.
They return to the butcher shop. Sides of beef hang from
hooks next to a cutting table. The Butcher is sharpening
a knife.
FOX
You need to get used to the blood and the
muscle and the meat and the sinew and
what a single blade of steel can do to a
chunk of flesh.
The Butcher turns and slices a chunk of tenderloin off of
one of the hanging carcasses, then slaps it on the table.
FOX (CONT'D)
Take care of him, Butcher.
THE BUTCHER
Will do, Fox.
The Butcher measures Wesley, then starts to talk in a
steady, almost bored voice...
THE BUTCHER (CONT'D)
Remember, it's the body we are killing.
Know it like a surgeon.
Wesley nods, half disgusted, half enthralled.
THE BUTCHER (CONT'D)
Okay, we'll start at the beginning. To
cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife
ice-pick style and thrust down behind the
clavicle, cutting side to side.
He jabs the blade into the beef... and just as he does...
37.
FLASH - PARKING GARAGE:
.we smash cut to a BUSINESSMAN walking to his car just
as the Butcher comes up behind him and performs the exact
same move he was just demonstrating. Just as quickly,
we...
FLASH - BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
.and the Butcher performs the next move...
THE BUTCHER -
To slice the diaphragm, first whip your
wrist into the target's trachea to
prevent screaming, then drive the knife
at a forty-five degree angle upward just
below the rib cage.
Just as the knife hits the side of beef, we smash cut
to...
FLASH - LUXURY HOTEL SUITE:
. a DRUG KINGPIN coming out of his hotel bathroom
wearing a bathrobe. Suddenly the Butcher is on him,
performing what he just described on this poor bastard,
who can no longer scream because he's missing his
trachea, and just as quickly...
FLASH - BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
.we are right back to the hanging side of beef as the
Butcher performs the next move...
THE BUTCHER
If you want the jugular, pull your
enemy's head to the left and jab your
knife well into his sterno-cleio-
mastoideus muscle, here, then cut down
and left.
Just like before, we smash cut to...
FLASH - DIRTY ALLEY:
...a MAN moseying down an alley, carrying a briefcase,
when suddenly, the Butcher comes out of nowhere, pulls
the enemy's head to the left and then WHAM!, jabs the
knife into the neck, matching the move-he was just
demonstrating.
38.
7 FLASH - HACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:
The butcher continues to hack away at the hanging meat,
describing more and more ways to kill with a blade...
WESLEY (V.O.)
They never show you this shit on the
McDonald's commercials.
.. as the CAMERA FINDS Wesley, who is completely absorbed
in the lesson. The Butcher hands him the knife, and
Wesley starts to make his first chops at it, wanting to
please the Butcher, wanting to get it right...
the empty morgue examining room. Empty except for a
d d ozen dead b s laid out on slabs, covered by white
sheets.
FOX
This is the Roach Motel, Wesley.
Wesley looks around, disgusted.
39.
FOX (CONT'D)
All right, find us some skinny bitches.
Wesley uncovers the first body... it's a. black male.
FOX (CONT'D)
Nahh, let the brother rest. Find us some
white meat. And nothing too fat.
Wesley covers the black male and moves over to a second
body. He unveils it to reveal... what looks like a dead
suburban housewife.
FOX (CONT'D)
Perfect. Load up soccer mom.
Fox and Sloan stand next to a paper target -- the kind of
thing you see in a police target range. It shows the
outline of a head and torso with concentric rings for
where you're supposed to aim.
The Gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on
to a hook that hangs ten feet in front of the paper
target. Sloan flips a switch and a motor takes the mom
and target to the end of the range.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Wesley is with them
standing in one of those firearm booths at the opposite
end of the range.
SLOAN
Selecting your weapon and then disposing
of it is the most pivotal aspect of every
assassination.
An array of firearms are on a shelf next to Wesley.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
Pick one.
Wesley eyes all the weaponry. Finally, he settles on a
short-barreled black handgun. Sloan takes it from him
and inspects it.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
Excellent. This is an Imanishi 18. It
holds seventeen bullets in the clip and
one in the chamber. It's made of a
composite material unrecognizable by
metal detectors.
(MORE)
40.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
And the Imanishi's bullets have
microchips that communicate with similar
ones in the gun.
WESLEY
Computer chips?
SLOAN
(NODS)
Sometimes the closest distance between
two points is not a straight line. What
if soccer mom here is between you and
your target?
WESLEY
I suppose you're going to tell me to
shoot her first.
SLOAN
How'd you do in Physics class?
WESLEY
Mostly B's.
Fox cocks her head at Wesley, knows he's lying.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Okay, I got a D.
SLOAN
Why?
WESLEY
I couldn't remember all the rules --
SLOAN
That's it. Rules. What if I told you
there weren't any?
He nods at Wesley, like he's on to something.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
People live by the rules set before them.
We take them on faith that they are
right. But how many times in your life
have you thought you had a better way,
against-the rules that was simply laughed
at.
WESLEY
Every day.
41.
SLOAN
Because you use your brain differently
than other people. All Fraternity
members do.
WESLEY
I don't get it.
SLOAN
Humans use neurons to think. But most
people can only handle a small percentage
of those neurons firing at once without
suffering a seizure or an aneurism. Not
us. And not you. We have the ability to
think differently than other people.
WESLEY
So we set our own rules.
SLOAN
That's right.
Sloan hands him back the weapon.
SLOAN (CONT'D
Try it.
Wesley aims the pistol at the target in front of him. He
FIRES...
..and the bullet plugs soccer mom in the shoulder.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
Have you ever shot a gun before?
WESLEY
Just the flies.
SLOAN
So you have no pre-conceived habits we
need to break. Shoot the target. Don't
hit mom.
WESLEY
You mean curve the bullet? How?
SLOAN
This isn't about "how." It's about
"what." If you'd never been told a
bullet flies straight and I handed you
this and said hit that target... what
would you do? Allow your instincts to
guide you. Just like the flies.
(MORE)
42.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
The technology is only here to assist
your natural instinct.
Wesley lifts the gun, his mind racing...
SLOAN (CONT'D)
It's not 'will' that makes the physical
react how we wish, it's 'control.' You
are in control...
BAM BAM BAM!
The bullets blast out of the gun, like they are on a
track set up by Wesley's brain. He flicks his wrists
and...
.they arc qUickly, Just missing the body i e th2
center of the target!
Sloan smiles.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
Rules are made to be broken, Wesley. No
one was better at that than your father.
He had a pair of pearl-handled revolvers
with which he could conduct a symphony.
L i
Wesley nods proudly, and squeezes off some more shots,
all chasing through the same hole in the target.
DISSOLVE TO:
Cathy jumps up from the couch when Wesley comes in.
CATHY
Oh my god, Wesley, where have you been?
I've been so worried!
But Wesley just pushes past her and starts to throw
clothes out of drawers into a black duffel bag.
CATHY (CONT'D)
What're you doing? Are you leaving? You
.owe rent!
But Wesley just keeps packing.
CATHY (CONT'D)
You can't leave! This is bullshit,
Wesley. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
43.
Wesley just zips up his bag and turns back toward the
door...
.where Egx is now standing, wearing outf' that
would make the devil blush.
CATHY (CONT'D)
Who the fuck are you?
But Fox doesn't even acknowledge her presence, and just
watches Wesley do his business.
Wesley walks out the door and Fox follows. Cathy chases
them out on to the landing...
CATHY (CONT'D)
You're nothing, Wesley! And you will
always be nothing! You think you're
gonna be happy.with that skank...
Uh-oh...
Fox stops and turns around -- fisting her pistols.
She unloads... BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
The CAMERA SWINGS OVER TO CATHY, who is about to pies
herself, standing in the door frame, with bullet holes
placed expertly around her head.
Wesley and Fox keep moving, down the steps. Barry is
coming up the steps, but he takes one look at them, does
a U-turn and hurries out of their path.
Wesley tosses his bag into the corner of this
immaculately furnished penthouse apartment, overlooking
the skyline.
FOX
You can take the couch until we find you
someplace better.
WESLEY
Okay.
She moves toward a separate bedroom.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Fox?
She stops.
44.
C WESLEY (CONT'D)
What was my father like?
For a moment, she thinks about it. Then...
FOX
Come on.
They stand in a dark corner of a decrepit morgue, where a
couple of urns rest on a counter. The place doesn't look
like much more than a crack-house.
FOX
We cremate our dead. I'd like to say
it's to honor them, but it's mainly to
keep anyone from identifying them after
they're gone.
WESLEY
These are my father's ashes?
FOX
Yeah.
48.
WESLEY
Sloan said his heart stopped but there
was no entry wound?
FOX
That's right.
WESLEY
Can I have a minute?
FOX
Sure.
She leaves and Wesley approaches the urn holding his
father's'remains.
He runs his finger over it, and just when we think he's
going to have an emotional moment...'
..he smashes the urn on to the stand, the ashes spilling
out everywhere.
Wesley runs his fingers through the decay: what a
mess... there are pieces of bone intermingled in the
cremains.
But then hisfingegs find something in the dust... a
BULLET with a hole running down its center. He holds it
up to the light for a closer look.
As he studies it, we start to hear... WHAM! WHAMI...
WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
Wesley site with his hands tied behind his back, taking
another beating from The Pharmacist, who spouts
assassination techniques while he pummels Wesley.
THE PHARMACIST
If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on one
and find yourself the one, remember that
each foe will likely move at the same
steady speed away from each other,
allowing you to keep a gun on each.
WHAM! WHAM!
THE PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
Now, if you find yourself one ' on three,
that poses a real bit a' ball ache...
49.
The sound of the Pharmacist's voice fades to the
background as Wesley's voice-over comes up...
WESLEY (V.0.)
There are two kinds of pain. One is an
object. A living thing that crawls
around the outside of your body. Cuts,
broken bones, bruises... all deliver the
kind of pain you can learn to ignore, and
they soon disappear to nothing but the
sound of a gnat in your ear.
Wesley's eyes are starting to lose consciousness.
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I've lived with a different kind of pain
all my life... the kind that comes from
two decades of being passed over, pushed
around, ignored. But you can't hide from
that kind of pain either...
Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face.
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
.because it finds you.
He involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his
head.
Sloan sits across from Wesley at a skinny table in an
otherwise bare room.
SLOAN
Watch the eyes. Look for a slight
swelling of the pupil. You can train
your body to stay a constant temperature,
you can control your heartbeat, but you
can't control the center of your eyes.
That's how you know when someone is lying
to you.
Sloan looks right at him. Wesley narrows his eyes,
trying to fend off his stare.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
Do you want to fuck Fox?
WESLEY
No.
50.
SLOAN
I know that's a lie without even seeing
your eyes.
WESLEY
Fine. Try something else.
SLOAN
Okay. What are you hiding from me?
Wesley looks down, then focuses on Sloan.
WESLEY
Nothing.
Sloan waits. Wesley realizes it's useless to try to keep
something from this man. He reaches into his pocket and
pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center...
places it on the table.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
You told me to hunt down my father's
killer. That's what I'm doing.
SLOAN
What's this?
WESLEY
The bullet that killed him. You said his
heart stopped but there was no entrance
wound. This bullet has a hole cut into
its center...
SLOAN
Yes?
WESLEY
You know how a mole buries into the earth
by pushing the dirt back around it? I
think this bullet does what the mole
does... Splits the skin and pushes it
back through its center, filling the
space it just passed through.
Sloan looks at him, like he might have been
underestimating him until now.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Fox was telling me that my father used
special bullets. It looks like Cross
does too... which means these are custom
made. If we find who makes them, then we
find someone who has access to Cross.
51.
Sloan picks up the bullet and leans back.
SLOAN
You put this all together on your own?
Wesley taps his head.
WESLEY
Firing neurons.
(BEAT)
Whatever happened to my father's guns?
The pearl handled ones?
SLOAN
Don't know. But whoever has them isn't
long for this place.
Sloan reaches down and picks up a binder which he drops
on the desk.
WESLEY
What's that?
SLOAN
Cross. The details of his life.
q Continue your hunt.
WESLEY
No rules, right?
This stops Sloan for a second.
SLOAN
No rules.
Wesley lies on Fox's couch, trying his damndest not to
peek at her through her bedroom door. It's cracked just
enough that he can see her draping a towel around her
body as she heads to take a shower.
Wesley site up and looks at the binder sitting on the
table. Slowly he opens it and sees a picture of Cross
staring back at him. The man who took Wesley's father
from him.
Wesley studies the face, wanting to know every detail.
52.
IN THE BATHROOM:
Fox peers out the door and looks at Wesley, watching him
absorb more of Cross with every page.
CUT TO:
Sloan leads Wesley into a gigantic room lined from floor
to ceiling with leather-bound books.
SLOAN
We keep a record of every assassination
mission, going back to the Ides of March.
Maps, diagrams, logistics, complications,
weapons of choice... it's all there.
Wesley nods, impressed. Sloan just keeps leading him
through a set of double doors, into...
.a large room, the size of an auditorium. On the floor
is a gigantic model of the entire city, built to scale,
showing all the buildings, skyscrapers, churches, the
waterfront, the city streets. Everything the city has to
offer laid out in miniature.
Sloan and Wesley stand like giants in the middle of the
model city...
WESLEY
What's all this?
SLOAN
Where we plot our local hits. This city
is one of the Fraternity's major
headquarters.
WESLEY
(looking around)
This room. The books. Seems low-tech.
SLOAN
Part of mastering technology is knowing
when to use it. Models can't be hacked.
Your father built this room himself.
Most of the buildings are white, but interspersed amongst
them are a few vainted red. Some of the model street
lamps are also red.
53.
The color red appears sporadically throughout the entire
model city: on the sides of buildings, on mailboxes, on
some of the manhole covers.
WESLEY
What's with the red ones?
Sloan just smiles...
.and THE CAMERA MOVES TO HIS FEET, then PUSHES'IN on
one particular street on the map, further in on one RED
STREETLIGHT and we...
DISSOLVE TO:
Fox making coffee as Wesley sits, studying the binder,
his mind racing.
WESLEY
Cross and my father were tight. But
Cross thought he should be one of the
heads of the Fraternity so he left and
vowed to kill the three heads. Which
means my father is dead because of petty
jealousy.
FOX
More reason for Cross to die.
Wesley flips to the picture of cross.
WESLEY
But I don't see jealousy in those eyes,
do you?
Fox walks over and slams the binder shut.
56.
FOX
Listen .to me, Wesley. In two weeks, we
have to kill Henry Helms. Do-you know
who that is?
WESLEY
The journalist who's got a price-tag on
his head.
FOX
A price-tag that we're going to collect.
Your father was meeting with a fence
about the job when Cross took him down.
So we can only assume Cross knows about
the target too. We... you... have to
take Cross out before we prosecute this
mission. We can't have him out there as
a wildcard, wreaking havoc, do you
understand?
WESLEY
Yeah.
FOX
We've never defaulted on a job and this
1k one won't be the first.
Sloan fires at the target, the bullets following his
every command. Wesley does the same, equally skilled.
Fox sits, watching the two of them. Is it becoming
competitive? One shoots and then the other follows,
neither one ever missing.
Finally, Gunsmith runs the target back in to change out
the body.
Fox leans back, impressed.
FOX
May have found your match, Sloan.
Sloan smirks and turns to instruct Wesley.
SLOAN
Pick the weapon, make the kill, destroy
the weapon. No other rules.
Wesley nods as Gunsmith returns.
57.
WESLEY
(to the Gunsmith)
Close the gap. Push the body closer to
the target..
THE GUNSMITH
It's already at four feet.
WESLEY
Closer.
THE GUNSMITH
Here's two. Your father couldn't even do
that.
WESLEY
Closer.
THE GUNSMITH
Wesley, at some point --
WESLEY
Closer. I'll say when.
WN
Gunsmith starts sliding the target closer to the body,
until it's actually touching the back of the dead
business man!
THE GUNSMITH
How you gonna -- ?
FOX
Just run it out there. Let the kid work.
The Gunsmith shrugs and runs the target down the range.
Wesley looks at Sloan.
WESLEY
You wanna go first?
SLOAN
There are limits to everything, Wesley.
At some point the body becomes a shield.
Wesley pulls his gun and lets loose five rounds,
lightning fast.
The Gunsmith brings the target back to them...
..a the business man is riddled with es.
THE GUNSMITH
I guess not every rule can be broken.
58.
WESLEY
Check the target.
The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five
bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found
it's mark on the target.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
You'll find one entry below the shoulder,
missing the major blood vessels there,
exiting the back. Second shot went
through the abdomen, clipped only the
bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the
upper right quadrant of the abdomen,
which is partially protected by the
ribcage, and passed through the liver and
probably part of the gallbladder. Upper
left abdomen is a good place, where
number four ruptured the spleen before
continuing down main street. And
finally, what I like to call "the ,7FK."
Number five entered the mouth, was
redirected downward by the upper jawbone
ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's
the shot you'll find in the middle of the
target.
Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
(to Sloan)
Fuck the rules.
With that, he turns and walks away, a look on his face
that is his fiercest, a far cry from the kid in the
cubicle. That same expression is on his face as we...
CUT TO:
Wesley strains against the ropes that bind his hands as
The Pharmacist waylays him. But is t' e. Wesley counts
out the punches as he takes the shots.
WESLEY
One!
There is a look in Wesley's eye we, haven't seen before, a
burning, searing fire.
As he continues to take punches and count them out...
59.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Two! (WHAM!) Three! (WHAM!) Four!
(WHAM!) FIVE!! (WHAM!!)
..he pulls his arms tight, and his muscles start to
twitch and bulge -- muscles we didn't know he had until.
now -- and as he continues to take punches, WHAM!, WHAM!,
WHAM!!, the rope strains against the wooden chair, and we
can HEAR the wooden legs start to pop, until...
CRACK!!! Wesley Jerks his arms ee and comes
swillcrincr with the broken of leg of the chair.
SMASH! SMASH!! The Pharmacist goes down hard and Wesley
stands over him, out of control,. furious, SMASH! SMASH!,
beating him with that broken chair leg.
The CAMERA PUSHES THOUGH one of the walls...
OBSERVATION ROOM:
.. to where Fox and Sloan are watching Wesley pummel the
pummeler through a one-way mirror.
SLOAN
He's ready.
the los2k on Fox's face becomes more and more and
sexual until...
..she leans on top of Wesley, straddling him on too of
her bed.
They unleash on each other, and from the looks of it, Fox
makes Cathy seem like a nun.
FOX
Don't you quit now, baby! Don't you quit
now!!
Wesley didn't know it could be like this.
After they finish, Fox gets up and heads to the shower
and he watches her go the whole way.
In the doorway, she turns around...
FOX (CONT'D)
Sloan says you're ready.
60
Wesley site in a chair as Fox crouches next to him with
an advanced tattoo machine, inking his hand.
WESLEY
Do you like being the only chick in the
Fraternity?
FOX
(COYLY)
Who said I was the only sister? Maybe
you just haven't met any others yet.
Wesley laughs.
WESLEY
(playfully back)
Maybe I have and I'm just not telling
you.
FOX
(GRINNING)
Hold still.
He settles down.
WESLEY
How did you end up here, Fox?
FOX
Same way you did, sugar. They found me.
WESLEY
What did you do before?
Fox looks at him, a wry smile on her face.
FOX
Sold perfume. At the mall.
WESLEY
No shit?
FOX
No shit.
WESLEY
I can't see it.
FOX
Get in line.
61.
WESLEY
What made them come after you? I mean, I
know why I'm here.
FOX
Fraternity members all have something in
their lineage that shows they'll be good
at this.
WESLEY
And yours is?
FOX
My great-great-great-grandfather on my
mother's side. He was on a slave ship
coming over from East Africa and as it
was pulling into Charleston, he killed
every white man on the ship and swam to
shore. They caught him and hung him four
days later.
WESLEY
That's terrible.
FOX
I Nah. Motherfucker deserved it. Be raped
eight women in those four days. One of
them was my great-great-great-grandmama.
She pushes her chair back, done with her work.
The CAMERA PUSHES IN as Fox removes the device so we can
take a look: the three-headed dog has been tattooed into
his hand.
Wesley and Fox walk down a long hallway toward a single
doorway. They open it, revealing...
. a large office with a single desk and a roaring fire.
Sloan turns from the fire to greet them.
He holds up the "mole" bullet, and smiles.
SLOAN
The mole bullet is made by a midget
t Filipino named Pek War. His fingers are
so small that they can shape and smooth
the metal better than anyone.
WESLEY
You've known all along. You knew before
I ever broke the urn...
SLOAN
I had to let you figure it out for
yourself.
WESLEY
Part of my training.
SLOAN
Part of your quest. To get to know your
father.
(BEAT)
And his killer.
Wesley nods, a grave expression on his face, like he
knows what he is going to do next.
67.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
Pek War charges exorbitant prices, as
much as ten-thousand dollars for a single
round, but his craftsmanship is
unparalleled.
He heads over to Wesley, hands him a slip of paper.
'SLOAN (CONT'D)
You can find him at this address.
CUT TO:
A three-foot-seven-inch Asian man site at a worktable
with his little legs dangling over the end of his chair.
PEK.WAR is concentrating hard on the metal in his hands.
The diminutive man looks up from his worktable when he
hears a loud THUMP.
PEX WAR
Andey?
He gets no answer. He remains perfectly still,
listening.
PEK WAR (CONT'D)
Andey?l
Two louder THUMPS and a GUNSHOT jerk his head around.
Then he's up out of the chair, faster than we thought a
little man could move.
Breathing ragged, shimmying across his work space, Pek
War hurries over to a chest of drawers.
He gets to it and throws open the bottom drawer to reveal
a stash of handguns. He reaches for one...
...but the muzzle off a pistol comes _ uE to the back of his
head and the hammer clicks as it is pulled back.
Pek War throws his hands up.
PEK WAR (CONT'D)
Alam man lamangl Alam man lamangl
Wesley signals for him to turn around. After he does...
400
68.
PER WAR (CONT'D)
Alam man lamang!
Wesley measures him with eyes that have gone hard. Fox
stands over Wesley's shoulder, loving every moment of
this. Then...
WESLEY
There are two things about you I'm sure
of right now, little man. One is that
you can speak English...
Pek War sees that Wesley means business.
PER WAR
(perfect English)
And what's the other?
WESLEY
That my nutsack is bigger than you.
Fox snickers.
PER WAR
(SPITS)
What do you want?
K
FOX
A bullet you made killed his father.
The bullet maker looks as though he knew a day like this
might eventually come. His face falls and he looks.at
his feet.
PER WAR
I only mold the ammunition... I cannot be
responsible for the way it is...
Wesley SMASHES him in the face with the butt of his gun,
then grabs a long, metal STILETTO-type tool from the work
table.
WESLEY
Bullshit. You're as responsible as if
you pulled the trigger yourself.
PER WAR
(WHIMPERS)
I didn't...
ARIV
WESLEY
I'm only going to ask you one question
and I want you to think very hard how you
want to answer.
With that, Wesley sticks the stiletto into Pek War's
side!
PEK WAR
OWWW1
WESLEY
Relax. The blade is in only an inch or
so.
The little man starts jabbering to God in some foreign
language.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
See I've learned a thing or two about
human anatomy recently. In fact, this
blade is stuck just beneath the coastal
cartilage of your tenth rib. Just a
little push and it will deflate your
lung. That's called a pneumothorax.
V Helluva way to go, suffocating in a'room
full of fresh air. Plus the sound, the
sound of all that oxygen hissing out of
your lung... pssssssh, like a balloon at
a birthday party. Enough to make a man
beg for a second chance.
(BEAT)
But you're only going to have one.
Pek War waits, trying not to writhe from the pain...
WESLEY (CONT'D)
So my question is... how do I find Cross?
Pek War's eyes go wide, pleading...
PEK WAR
(DEFENSIVE)
My clients use middlemen, I don't meet
them in person, I know so little about
them...
Wesley twitches the handle just a bit.
PEK WAR (CONT'D)
Okayl Okayl Dammitl God damiaitl I'll
tell you!
70.
Wesley lets up a little bit.
PEK WAR (CONT'D)
Prearranged meets.
Fox snatches up a nearby phone.
WESLEY.
Start prearranging.
Fox eats in a small restaurant in the heart of Koreatown,
the kind of place that has the hot hibachi grills on the
S table tops.
85.
The place is mostly empty, quiet, with mainly Korean
faces both dining and serving. It's the kind of place
where you can eat and not be bothered.
The doors swing open and Fox looks up. The silhouette of
e I URE IN THE DOgJLWM is disturbing, a familiar
person in a long black coat...
FOX
Jesus.
She squints, the setting sunlight nearly blinding her as
all she can see is a silhouette...
FOX (CONT'D)
For a second there I thought you looked
just like Cross.
Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table
as Fox lights up a cigarette.
WESLEY
Skipped the hospital?
FOX
He picked me clean and I don't care much
for needles.
She blows out a lungful of smoke and watches as it rises
toward the ceiling.
FOX (CONT'D)
Sloan's on his way.
One of the waiters waves to her to put out her smoke and
she just stares him down. The man backs off, nodding and
smiling.
FOX (CONT'D)
You want something to eat, baby?
WESLEY
I'm all right.
FOX
They got some good shit. Ostrich,
chicken... won't fill you up too much if
you're watching your calories.
WESLEY
Naah.
8.
FOX
Well, the big man should be here any
minute...
WESLEY
Yeah.
(BEAT)
Listen, can I ask you a :question?
FOX
Baby, you can ask me anything you want.
He focuses on her eyes, zeroing in on the pupils.
WESLEY
Did you know Cross was my father?
FOX
What?
WESLEY
Did you know?
Closer, closer... tight on those pupils...
FOX
O AW
What're you talking about Wesley? Cross
killed your father.
EXTREME CLOSE-UP:
We see her pupil swell, just a tiny bit.
KOREAN BAR-B-QUE:
He saw it... exactly what Sloan told him to look for when
someone is lying.
And from the look on Fox's face, she knows he saw it.
FOX
Goddammit, Wesley...
She stabs out her cigarette, crushing it on the hot grill
so that it SIZZLES.
FOX (CONT'D)
Why'd you have to ask me that?
With that, she kicks back from the table, holding a huge
black Smith and Wesson revolver.
$7.
Wesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by
kicking over the table, which sends food and utensils
flying, but also shields him from Fox's bullets.
Just as quickly, Fox leaps up on top of one of the other
tables, trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her
feet don't touch the hot grill. If she's wounded, we
wouldn't know it.
Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots
at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding
the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no
bullets find their mark.
Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously
fast. She's like the animal she's named after, and she
launches off one of the tables...
.and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a
form tackle on to a table...
..where he lands Quare on the oven top... PSSSSBHH...
and his guns go flying across the room as...
.the table to starts to burn through his clothes!
%AW
WESLEY
Arrrh!
FOX
You shoulda known better, baby...
But he rolls over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven-
is burning into her back.
With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips
herself backwards off the table. With another kick, she
sends the hot table flying at him. It rips free from its
wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the
restaurant... SSSSSSSSS...
Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not
before it burns his arm as he blocks it.
Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a
hailstorm of bullets.
But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor
Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment
where his hands come u holSling his weapons.
In.one fluid motion, he flips back over and EAM! BAM!
BAM! BAM! BAM!
88.
shoots bullets up in the air and then flicks his wrists
so they arc over at the open gas nozzle!
The bullets strike it, sparking, and then BOOM!!!:
fireball b sts from nozzle, while a great Riume of
sweltering fire keeps pouring out!
Fox dives to get out of the way, which gives Wesley the
opening he was looking for. He FIRES again, and one of
his bullets knocks her crun away and another nicks her in
the side of the face.
She stops, seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off
her chin. This only seems to enrage her.
Pissed, she produces two S R GUNS out of the small of
her bac -- where she had them hidden we have no idea --
and charges Wesley like an unleashed Pit Bull...
FOX (CONT'D)
(SCREAMS)
Aaaaahhhh!
She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks
this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from
where he lies flat on the floor.
She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless...
.and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face
bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's
face...
FOX (CONT'D)
I gotta admit, baby...
She starts to squeeze both the triggers...
FOX (CONT'D)
I thought we might have a future...
But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she
reels...
In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her
toward him... taking her guns right out of her hands like
a quick-change artist.
Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the
last expression she'll ever have because...
BAM! BAM!!!
69.
Most of Fox's face is blown clean fr her head, and a
blood mess s ra s a oss the wall.
Wesley leans his head back and closes his eyes, the spume
of fire flickering brightly against his lids, the events
of the last several hours washing over him.
FADE OUT:
For several moments, there is nothing but darkness and a
silence as permanent as death. Finally...
WESLEY (V.0.)
There's a town in Germany called
Leverkusen that had a bear hunter named
Hans Koblenz.
FADE IN:
Sloan, the Butcher and the Pharmacist walk across the
parking lot toward the door of the smoking Bar-b-que
joint.
WESLEY (V.0.)
60 During his life, he was said to have
killed over four hundred bears and was
the pride of this small community on the
Rhine. You want to know how he died? A
pair of black bears singled out his house
from the entire village, mauled his wife,
killed his twin daughters, and then lied
in wait for him to get back from the
woods.
The fire is out, but it has blackened the inside of the
joint, so that it looks like an absolute war zone.
Fox is in the same position as when Wesley shot her, but
there's a sheet of paper folded on her chest.
The Butcher and the Pharmacist flank Sloan as he
approaches the body, frowning.
WESLEY (V.0.)
When the hunter opened the door, they
ripped his throat out before he could
scream.
(MORE)
90.
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
The two bears then curled up on the rug
LW in the middle of the floor -- the rug
that had once been their father -- and
proceeded to bite. each other till they
bled to death.
Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees
beneath it that pearl-handled revolver. The one with the
blood on the handle.
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
That's a true story.
He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper:
7'HE GATES OF T.T ARE OPEN
Sloan folds the paper back up and looks at the blood on
the gun.
SLOAN
He knows.
CUT TO:
Wesley stands in the slaughterhouse, holding two pistols,
looking around. The place has been cleaned out. There's
no sign of the Butcher.
Same thing at the Pharmacy, an empty store now...
.and in the Fraternity's library, nothing. All the
books are gone...
Wesley processes this, frowning. He keeps walking to
the...
MAP ROOM:
.where the entire model city has been destroyed, like a
Giant has trampled it beneath its feet.
Wesley stoops over and pulls one smashed building out of
the mess, looking at it, thinking, thinking...
.and then he's up and moving quickly.
CUT TO:
91.
Anna opens the door for Wesley, who looks like he is on
to something...
WESLEY
My father... he was working on a plan,
right?
ANNA
I don't know. There was so much he
wanted to keep away from us...
Wesley moves into Andrew's roan... where the boy is still
playing with the black model buildings.
Wesley moves over and crouches down next to Andrew.
WESLEY
Can I see that for a second?
The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is
painted jet black, except for one corner of the first
floor, which is painted red. Wesley looks up at Anna.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Do you know where he got this?
Anna leads Wesley down some wooden steps into Cross's
basement.
Sure enough, the entire floor of the basement has been
made into a model map, similar to the one that the
Fraternity used in the map room, but all the buildings
are black, with an occasional red mark.
The scale is larger, the model shows only one section of
the city, and a BLUE LINE indicates a route through the
streets.
And on the wall are PICTURES and CLIPPINGS of Henry
Helms.
Wesley squats over it, trying to figure out what his
father's plan was. He sees a missing place for a
building and puts Andrew's toy back in place, then
studies the map some more.
/'" ANNA
I-" Does this mean anything to you?
92.
There are large question marks painted on various
buildings along the Helms' route.
WESLEY
(AWED)
My God, he's been planning it from the
beginning.
(BEAT)
This is a Fraternity hit. Cross... my
fathar... set up Henry Helms as bait,
knowing Sloan would use his best men for
the job. He was going to take them all
out.
Wesley looks at it some more.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Only he didn't know where on the route
they would try and hit Helms. That's the
missing piece he was t rying to figure
out.
ANNA
Do you know the answer to that?
Wesley looks up at her, resolve on his face.
WESLEY
No. But I know who does.
CUT TO:
It's dark. Really dark.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
A lump in a bed stirs.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
The lump stirs a little more...
CUT TO:
NICOLE, the hot girl from Wesley's office, moves to her
peephole and looks out, but there's no one there.
She opens the door and gives a quick look down the hall,
then shuts it and hurries to her kitchen.
93.
She starts to open a cabinet but stops, GASPS and jerks
back, scared shitless.
Wesley is-in her kitchen, lust a few-feet away. She
looks at him.
NICOLE
Jesus...
(seeing who it is)
Wesley? Is that you?
He looks bruised and battered, but there is a hardness to
his eyes.
WESLEY
It's me, Nicole.
NICOLE
What happened to you?
Wesley wipes his eyebrow with his thumb, like he's
considering what he wants to say next.
WESLEY
I asked you once if you thought I was an
observant person.
She doesn't understand... but suddenly we...
CUT BACK TO:
.that meeting room from his old job. In fact, it's a
replay of that same scene. Wesley is still sitting there
with his note pad, the words "LIFE SUCKS AND THEN YOU
DIE" printed over and over, while the consultant
continues to rattle on and on.
Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley spots the
hot intern Nicole, still talking on the phone. And just
like before, he's zeroing in on her, but this time, we
keep zeroing in and zeroing in, until we see something we
didn't see before...
Nicole reaches up over the counter to grab a stack of
papers, and her shirt pulls slightly up from her back...
.and that tattoo of Cerberus. &)A- three-headed !log _is
,printed there, in the exact same place Fox had...-and we
keep zeroing in on it and zeroing in on it until we...
../
SMASH CUT TO:
94.
Where Fox is tattooing his hand again and we get another
taste of that conversation they had...
FOX
(COYLY)
Who said I was the only sister? Maybe
you just haven't met any others yet..
WESLEY
(playfully back)
Maybe I have and I'm just not telling
you.
.and now with the gift of hindsight, we see that Wesley
meant what he said, and we...
SMASH CUT BACK TO:
Wesley still stands there, just a few feet away from her.
WESLEY
Sloan didn't just have one person in my
office watching me, he had two.
NICOLE
What are you talking about?
WESLEY
What name do you go by? The Intern?
He points at her tattoo.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Because I know you have the mark.
Nicole's face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a
switch.
Like lightning, she grabs for a butcher's knife but
Wesley is faster. He pins her wrist back, twisting until
she drops the knife.
She lunges again, but a pistol comes up right below her
chin.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Where's the Henry Helms hit going down?
Where's Sloan?
95.
NICOLE
Sloan's not your biggest problem,
fuckface.
WESLEY
Yeah? Why's that?
She reaches over, slowly, so he knows she's not going to
go for a knife... and she turns on a small TELEVISION
sitting on the kitchen counter.
The screen comes to life, showing an inf mercial for the
F ob'e.
Nicole shakes her head and. flips up the channels... and
now we see what she wanted to show him...
ON THE NEWS:
Wesley's EMPLOYEE PHOTO fills the screen above a
reporter's head while the REPORTER babbles in a serious
voice...
REPORTER
.responsible for several recent
shootings, including one tonight at this
Korean restaurant downtown and another at
an outdoor mall. Details are sketchy,
but we repeat, if you see this man,
please contact...
IN NICOLE'S KITCHEN:
She starts cycling through the news channels...
...and each one shows. different REPORTERS standing
outside the smoking bar-b-que, or talking about Wesley,
or speaking with police. One is even interviewing
Wesley's old boss, Janice, who is very happy for the
forum...
ON THE NEWS:
JANICE
He was aggressive toward me and other
employees... a very negative person,
extremely negative. I can't even repeat
the words that came out of his mouth the
day we let him go...
96.
IN NICOLE'S KITCHEN:
WESLEY
Motherfucker. Dispose of the weapon...
(BEAT)
Me.
NICOLE
That's right. And the cops were told to
watch this place too. You have nowhere
to go. He's smarter than you. He'll
feed the cops evidence singling you out
for every hit the Fraternity has pulled
in the last ten years.
WESLEY
(ignoring her)
I'm only going to ask you one more time.
Where can I find him?
NICOLE
You won't get to him. You can't. The
cops will be here any second!
Wesley reaches over- -and cranks up a gas burner, the
menacing flame on high.
WESLEY
Then this is going to get painful
quickly.
She stares at that blue flame, fear in her eyes for the
first time.
He starts pushing her head toward it, closer and
closer...
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Henry Helms. Where is it going down?
The first SCREAM from Nicole is lost in...
THE FRONT DOOR:
BAM. BAM BAM!
POLICE OFFICER (0. S.)
Open up! Police!
The door to Nicole's apartment smashes open and four cops
burst through the door, guns ready.
97.
They spread out quickly, checking out the place. One of
the disappears into the kitchen...
POLICE OFFICER 2 (O.S.)
Oh, Christ.
CUT TO:
.where HENRY HELMS himself is tying a tie in a hotel
mirror. He's a handsome enough guy, distinguished even,
but he looks tired, like the weight of living under a
death threat has dragged him down.
A door opens, and we see his wife, SARAH HELMS, step past
two, huge BODYGUARDS to come in.
SARAH HELMS
The car is here.
A guy looks down at the street with his binoculars. It's
the Gunsmith!
THE GUNSMITH
(into a radio)
Nothing yet, sir.
Wesley bursts from the stairwell doorway and moves to the
front door of the building. He clicks the empty
cartridges out of his guns and is about to reload when he
hears a sickening sound behind him...
The sound of two knife blades being rubbed together...
.and Wesley turns to f' the Butcher there waiting for
The Butcher quickly hurls a knife, which buries in_the
fleshy part of Wesley's shoulder 1
Wesley ignores it and fires...
i L
SAM BAM! DING DING!
The Butcher deflects them with the knives in his hands:
Wesley goes to fire again but his firing chambers recoil,
showing that he is out of ammo.
The Butcher's eyes go wide...
THE BUTCHER
Like I told you... the blade will always
live on.
WESLEY
I remember some dumb shit like that
coming out of your mouth.
Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out
the kniZ2 in his shoulder.
They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging
off each other as each tries to gain an edge.
The fight spills out the front door, and into...
103.
THE STREET:
.the two men slashing, ducking, and moving in the
middle of the street. -
Wesley strikes three auick swipes acrosiLthe Butcher's
face And forehead, filling his eyes with blood.
The Butcher grabs his face and sees the blood streaming
on to his hands. He tries to wipe the blood from his
eyes, but it's just getting worse.
THE BUTCHER
I can't see!
WESLEY
But you can hear. So hear this: To cut
the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice-
pick style...
Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
...and thrust down behind the clavicle,
cutting side to side.
He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over
as his gore spills out into the street.
But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new
predicament...
He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end
is the chef, and at the other is the Gardener. To make
things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is
the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him.
THE PHARMACIST
Three on one, mate. You're out of ammo.
And you're in a part of the map with no
Fraternity stashes.
(LAUGHS)
That's what I'd call a real ball ache.
For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the
situation. His eyes swivel from the Gardener to the Chef
to the Pharmacist.
Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black.,
just like in cross's model! Wesley's eyes fall on the on
the red corner of the nearest building, a cement block
making up a decorative support column in front of it.
104.
Wesley smiles.
WESLEY
I'm working off of a different map.
With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and
he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a
Lexus parked at the curb. The three assassins fire
relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car,
smashing it to bits... as...
. on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just
as he reaches that cement block... affixed to it is a
small SILVER CROSSI Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross
and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new
pair of sophisticated MA ISHIS I
As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the
guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we...
SPLITSCREEN:
...to follow both of his bullets in flight.
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:
.THE BULLET from the left gun heads for the Chef. He
tries to drop down, but the bullet curves downward, it
pierces his body... and...
INSIDE HIS BODY:
We see the bullet ricochet off of one of his ribs-exit
his side and head for the Pharmacist, while...
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:
...the bullet from the right gun heads for the Gardener,
who moves fast to fire his own gun, but the bullet
catches him in the wrist, knocking his gun out of his
hand, and...
INSIDE THE WRIST:
. it hits the Gardener's scaphoid bone, ricocheting out,
also, right at the Pharmacist...
THE SCREEN RETURNS TO NORMAL:
.just as the two bullets come together...
THE PHARMACIST
Bugger.
105.
hitting the Pharmacist on both sides of-his head,
before he can even react.
Wesley watches a pink spray shoot out from both sides of
the Pharmacist's head as he falls to the asphalt, dead.
But Wesley's not through, he moves over to the Gardener
and rolls him over.
WESLEY
Where is he?
THE GARDENER
Where it started..
BAN! Wesley ends it for the Gardener.
Patrons stand in line at a post office, but the'CAMERA
PUSHES PAST THEM, finding a black and white "WANTED"
poster of Wesley, describing all the killings he's
responsible for. It holds tight on the picture.
WESLEY (V.0.)
I've learned that all of us are unique,
even though sometimes we're too fucking
blind to see it.
..Wesley sitting at a computer in the middle of another
cubicle maze, pecking away at his keyboard. A sign
attached to one wall reads: "SAN ANGELO INSURANCE
ASSOCIATES: Setting the Bar Highl"
Office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties,
wishing they were anywhere else.
A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley's desk.
RECEPTIONIST
You're the new guy, huh?
WESLEY
Just started last week.
RECEPTIONIST
Where'd you move here from?
WESLEY
All over the place, really. Nothing too
exciting.
RECEPTIONIST
Well, welcome to the team. Just watch
out for Brokaw. He'll stab you in the
back first chance he gets.
Just then, a harried man, BROKAW, comes storming up.
BROKAW
Jesus, Connie, don't you have some faxes
to get to?
The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does.
BROKAW (CONT'D)
Laziest skirt I ever hired. But nice fun
bags, I'll give her that.
110.
He leans over Wesley's desk, right in his space.
BROKAW (CONT ' D )
Jim, right?
WESLEY
Yes, sir.
BROKAW
Listen, Jim, I don't want to get started
off on the wrong foot here, but we.have
numbers to make and if we don't make
those numbers, it's my ass on the line.
And if my ass gets chewed out by
regional, I can guarantee.that your ass
is gonna be Purina doggy chow. Now I'm
not sure how they ran things...
Wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and--
further, until the words become gibberish, just like they
did with Janice.
Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it, just in time
to hear...
BROKAW (CONT'D)
.so do we understand each other?
WESLEY
Of course.
BROKAW
Good boy.
With that, he hurries away, his pants riding so high up
his ass that they look like they may burst at any second.
Wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor: it reads
11:15. He stands up, stretches, and makes his way to the
receptionist's desk. She looks up, bites her lower
lip...
WESLEY
You want to take a break with me?
RECEPTIONIST
Sure!
She stands and they move toward the elevators, waiting
for the doors to open.
RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
You know, we don't usually get breaks.
Just then, the elevator doors DING.
WESLEY
Well, you'll find there's nothing "usual"
about me.
They climb in.
THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Wesley's
face...
WESLEY (V.O.)
This life is ours, to make of it what we
can.
.until it fills the screen, looking just like the shot
of Wesley we started with. And then a sly smile spreads
across his mug...
WESLEY (V.0.)
I think I'll give it a shot.
.and as the doors close, we officially...
FADE OUT.
