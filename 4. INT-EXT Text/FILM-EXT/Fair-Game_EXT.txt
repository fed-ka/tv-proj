As they pull away, Valerie looks back. She spots TABIR
through a window --STILL AT THE PARTY -- She freezes.
CUT TO:
HAFIZ turns off onto a deserted road in the Lake Gardens.
VALERIE
Why are we stopping?
He looks at her. Undoes his seatbelt.
HAFIZ
Ms. Macdowall, my uncle believes
that trust is something you earn.
And he doesn't trust anyone until
he knows them very, very well..
He strokes her hair. She holds his eye. Composed.
VALERIE
But he trusts you, Hafiz..
The temperature in the car drops a hundred degrees.
HAFIZ
How do you know my name?
HAFIZ's brain does 0-60 in 0.06 Seconds. He flips open the
glove box. Nothing there.
VALERIE
Your car was swept an hour ago.
(He goes for the door.)
Do not get out. If you get out of
this car I can't protect you.

HAFIZ STOPS DEAD. LOOKS IN THE REARVIEW: A black car, 50
yards behind. He grabs her arm.
HAFIZ
Who are you?
VALERIE
Let go of my arm Hafiz. NOW.
HAFIZ
VALERIE
Who the fuck are you?
NOW!
He releases her arm. She holds his gaze. Breathing hard.
VALERIE
Listen carefully. Your uncle is in
business with Abu Domar Khan-

That's bullshit.
laundering and contraband
components.
VALERIE
Khan has made contact with a terror
organisation via an aid agency in
Pakistan. They are seeking
materials to build a weapon.
HAFIZ
Fuck you.
VALERIE
(She fixes him)
Your brother is in Kalutara jail in
Colombo facing execution for
trafficking. We can help him.
HAFIZ
VALERIE
Bullshit. You can't help him.
We can help him. Hafiz.
Listen to me. Listen.
VALERIE
You have to think straight here
Hafiz. Because I promise you one
thing... Right now, you have no
idea what we can and cannot do.
Hafiz looks in the rear view. At the floor. Deep inside
something stirred. She saw it..
7.
VALERIE
We need information about your
uncle. Contacts. Shipments. If you
help us, we help you. If you don't,
your brother dies and tomorrow
you're sitting next to your uncle
in a cell in Thailand and it won't
be me asking the questions.
Hafiz closes his eyes, head back. She watches him closely.
VALERIE
You will get a call at 8am. You'll
be asked if you need a cleaner. You
want her to come three mornings per
week. Do you understand? I said DO
YOU UNDERSTAND?
Two men (from the briefing) in a WHIPPED CHEVY watch a red
truck leave an industrial unit in the suburbs of Lowell.
VALERIE (V.O.)
The shipment is delivered to Goza
Tech in Secaucus, New Jersey...
The red truck turns into a low grey set of prefab buildings
in a business park. The CHEVY watches a forklift truck lift a
single pallet out and deliver it into the warehouse.
VALERIE (V.O)
There it's bundled in with a second
shipment of legitimate electronic
parts, and documentation attached
that masks its point of origin.

Joe, in the back of a hot, rickety Renault, rattling along
the highway into town. Low earthen dwellings. Camel trains.
Joe, unshaven, shakes hands with a 60 year old Nigerien.

vous, M. Bonzala ?
INSIDE - We subtitle the mixture of French dialect and Hausa.
MINISTER
Last time we met I was Minister,
you Ambassador. Now, thanks to
Allah, we are free men. You're
growing a beard, no?

JOE
So it would seem.
MINISTER
So tell me. How can Niger help its
old friend, America?
Joe rides shotgun, in a 4X4, driven deep into the Sahara.
JOE V/O
Niger has two Uranium mines in the
Sahara desert. One's flooded. The
other's run by COGEMA, a French
subsidiary, jointly controlled by
the Japanese and Germans.
A collossal earthworks defacing the flat, hot moonscape. Joe
is escorted around the mines by a small team.
JOE
500 tons of Yellowcake is not an
off the books size transaction, it
represents a 40% production
increase in the nation's annual
output of uranium. A sale that size
would leave a huge paper trail.
The long road back from the mines the previous day, Joe's
Land Rover pulls over. Everyone comes out to see them.
JOE (V.O.)
How do you hide the transportation
of 500 tons of anything, let alone
lightly refined uranium?

28.
JOE (V.O.) (cont'd)
You're talking fifty semi tractor
trucks on one road through villages
where nothing passed for months
except maybe one bush taxi. It
would be the biggest event for
months. To say they forgot, it's
like kids forgetting Christmas.
ESTABLISHING-- JOE AND VALERIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
INSIDE -- Joe sits at the dining room table, debriefed by two
CIA agents, over Chinese take out.
JOE
The droughts of the 80s and 90s
were met by millions of dollars of
U.S Aid, which continues to this
day. It just doesn't make sense
Niger would compromise this
lifeline. For that reason, and the
others I've given, it's my opinion
that the sale couldn't happen.
CUT TO:
Joe shows them out. Shuts the door. Valerie appears.
JOE
What happens next?
VALERIE
They write a report. Give it to the
analysts. It'll be re-written, then
kicked upstairs where it'll be
thrown in with whoever else's
report they got-
Joe snorts derisively.
JOE
You guys are hysterical. I can't
believe you're actually gonna send
someone else all the way out there
to ask exactly the same questions.
VALERIE
You can't compile Intelligence from
a single source? That's not
Intelligence. That's an opinion.
JOE
I can save the CIA some air fare
here. There isn't a snowflakes
chance in hell this thing happened.
29.
VALERIE
Say who?
JOE
Says me.
VALERIE
What if you're wrong? One guy says
it's true. It's not true. Lots of
guys say it's true, it's still not
true. It's intelligence. It's slow.
Painstaking. But it works. Checks
and balances.
JOE
What am I, a check or a balance?
VALERIE
Probably neither. You're a teeny
tiny weeny cog in a giant machine.
But you did your job. You should
feel good. They count on that.
That's why they don't pay you.
JOE
I'm not feeling that 007 right now.
She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him sexily.
VALERIE
I can get the kids to make you a
medal, if it'll help.
JOE
Us double oh's are more about the
gratuitous sex.
VALERIE
I'll see what I can do.
They start making out.

TELEVISION FOOTAGE OF A PRESS CONFERENCE.
JOURNALIST
Mr. President, in your speeches now
you rarely talk or mention Osama
bin Laden. Why is that?

The streets throng with traffic. Somalian taxi drivers.
Central Africans ferrying exotic produce. Egyptians smoking
apple tobacco. Colors. Bustle. A different world.
Valerie, head shrouded in a scarf, puts the notebook in her
bag and pushes her way along the crowded street, buzzing with
scooters and pedestrians. She steps through an archway into --
An ancient cloister filled with an excited clamor. Fresh
faced students pile into a lecture theater. She follows.
PROFESSOR AZIZ(V.O.)
The warping of the extra dimension
is analogous to the warping of
spacetime in the vicinity of a
massive object eg: a black hole.
The prof walks with Valerie talking excitedly.
PROFESSOR AZIZ
I was unable to attend your String-
Gravity seminar at MIT but I read a
transcript. Truly groundbreaking
work.
VALERIE
Thank you.
PROFESSOR AZIZ
The Faculty have just moved me, so
you must excuse the mess.
He shows Valerie up a stone staircase and through a door.
Sunset. Traders are packing up. Valerie hurries into --
Full military funeral, in the rain. A hundred mourners from
Langley. Some uniformed. A coffin draped in the flag

A hymn is sung. In the bleechers, the analyst from the
meeting earlier, pauses in the break between verses and
squints through the rain at the bank of seats across the
grave.
OVER THERE is THE LANGLEY TOP BRASS. JIM PAVITT. Next to him,
GEORGE TENET, DCI. Next to him...... of all people.... JOE
TURNER, (the analyst from WINPAC).

Didn't you hear? Friday the DCI

You're fucking kidding me.
Turner is over there, singing the hymn, rubbing shoulders
with the good and the great.
AT THE BACK -- Valerie stands with a number of other agents,
MIKE and BILL, her Chief. A lone bugler and marine drummer
beat out a last post. A widow weeps.

BILL (V.O.)
Its a dead end.

Valerie walks with the Chief and other senior agents away
from the graveside.
BILL
So we've got a list of names. The

BILL
You get through the checkpoints and

with an armed tac team ask me to
help out Uncle Sam? I'm going to
react unpredictably.
TACTICAL COMMANDER
What about forcible extraction of
two or three of the main targets?
VALERIE
No. We've got 29 names. I want to
get to them all.
TACTICAL

You can't use tac.

Dr. Al Haddad? Is there somewhere

A taxi cab stops and SAWSAN is helped out by the driver.
From a car across the street -- Valerie watches:
Sawsan rolls her suitcase into the terminal. At the door she
glances behind her...and disappears inside.
Ali and Valerie get out the car looking every bit like
tourists, suitcases, sunglasses, guidebook etc.
Sa'ad drives a battered dusty mercedes through the streets.
SA'AD
I've a friend in security services.
I've been a government employee for
25 years, there has to be some
advantage. You can wait all day.
Sawsan smiles at her brother.
An extended family of great uncles and aunts, grand children
and cousins greet Sawsan's arrival. Getting out of the car
she is surrounded by hugs and tears and laughter.
Sawsan removes the framed photograph of her and her daughter.
It is cooed over then given pride of place on the mantel.
Sawsan and her brother speak low. He seems very nervous.
SAWSAN
They can help you if you get out to
the Kurdish zone.
SA'AD

I am watched Sawsan. If I drive
even twenty minutes north of
Baghdad they will stop me.
SAWSAN
They've given me questions for you.
SA'AD
What questions?
SAWSAN

How close is your program to a

SA'AD
The program was destroyed in 1991.
The Americans destroyed it, they
know that. My god..what else?
SAWSAN
How advanced is the centrifuge
facility? Which method are you
using to separate fissile isotopes?
SA'AD
This is insane. We don't have spare

Valerie walks outside. In the window across the street, her
neighbour stares straight at her.
Valerie looks ahead. Her eyes flick to the Paper on a
neighbours lawn: The Wall Street Journal.
NEIGHBOUR (O.S.)
Morning Valerie!
Another neighbour getting in his car waves. He's thrown when
she doesn't reply. Val starts her car and drives. He watches.
Valerie stares straight ahead, hands gripping the wheel. We
watch her. Close. Her driving intercuts with her thoughts.
FLASH - The Associated Press news bureau add her story to the
bullet-feed.
FLASH - An AP feed winds around a newspaper news room.
FLASH - The Reuters office in Geneva picks up the story.
FLASH - A Bloomberg tickers her name.
BACK TO:
VALERIE, death white, drives along the Georgetown reservoir.
FLASH - Huntingdon Valley Public Library, a man tears the
page out of a high school year book.
FLASH - Microfiche search of photos of embassy events with
Joe and Valerie as guests. A grease pencil marks ones where
she can be seen.
BACK TO:
Turning away from the canal and speeding over the Potomac,
she fishes in her glove compartment. Finds a pad. A pencil
and starts writing names on a pad. Still driving.
FLASH - Valerie next to her husband in black tie shakes hands
with a visiting dignitary. A camera bulb goes off. She
eyeballs the cameraman for a moment.
Valerie turns onto the 120 freeway. The pad falls into the
footwell. She reaches down and her --

SAME HAND - reaches to shake hands with
FLASH - different people in different countries, dinners with
diplomats, meetings with captains of industry, conferences in
far flung corners of the world.
Hands. Faces. Smiles. EACH BECOMING A PHOTOGRAPH on a file.
FLASH - Valerie shaking hands with Mr.Tabir in his Kuala
Lumpur mansion. Him smiling, mouthing words silently.
FLASH - A stock market ticker. In his office, Tabir is shown
a blow up of a grainy photograph of Valerie and Hafiz.
Valerie drives home past the Capitol, still.
THE CAR PULLS UP AT THE PLAYGROUP.
Valerie gets out and sleep-walks into the building.
She joins a small group of mothers watching through glass
door, their children playing. One of the mothers nudges
another and whispers something. They both look at Valerie,
who tenses.
THROUGH THE GLASS
Her kids put their coats on and come out. Valerie puts on a
bright smile. Kneels to hug them.
VALERIE
(Brightly)
Hey guys. How was your day?
She carries them out, watched by the other mothers.
Valerie bussles the kids out of the car. A neighbor is mowing
his lawn. She tenses as he slows his pace to study her.
Another neighbor, searching for his keys stops and watches
her too, as she takes the kids into the house.
Valerie's boss MIKE is watching TV with his wife and kids and
her mother, when the doorbell rings. He gets up.
The front door opens. Valerie is standing there.
MIKE
Valerie. What are you doing here?
Mike steps forward and closes his front door. Mike glances up
and down the street.

A garage door opens. Valerie and Mike step into his garage
and fluorescent light flickers on to reveal boxes of
Christmas decorations etc-

Falli. Habbuck. Who else?
MIKE
Valerie-
VALERIE
Who else Mike?
MIKE
I don't know what you're talking
about.
She fixes him. Eventually he shrugs.
MIKE
(He shrugs)
You were right. It's all about the
scientists. We made a call.
VALERIE
A call?
MIKE
We passed your case files to
liason. You know yourself we're not
great at this stuff.

Val, Mossad were already on the
same page.

MIKE (cont'd)
They've been trying to hunt these

MIKE

VALERIE
You'll drive them underground.
They'll run straight to Iran.
Pakistan.
MIKE
Valerie. This isn't your problem
anymore.
VALERIE
It's not my problem. It's not my
problem. How can you sleep when you
know-
MIKE
(With purpose)
I sleep just fine. Now Carol's
mother is here. I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.
VALERIE
It's called counter-proliferation,
Mike.
She turns and walks out.
Valerie gets in her car. Shaking. Shuts the door. She holds
her head in her hands and starts to sob.
We hear the sound of a crowd cheering..
A bright DC day. Joggers. Lunchtime office workers.
Valerie walks alone through the park. She sits down on a
bench next to JIM PAVITT.
PAVITT
Thank you for coming here today.
I wanted to convey my outrage to
you in person. In all my
experience, nothing has disgusted
me like this business.
(MORE)
91.
PAVITT (cont'd)
I know it's not easy for you, but I
want you to know how much the
agency appreciates your silence in
the light of this matter. We know
how damaging this has been to you.
We can't afford for this knife
fight to go on any longer.
VALERIE
I get death threats every day.
People threatening to kill my
husband. Hurt my children. I went
to the agency and I requested
security to protect my family. It
was declined. Because quote "My
circumstances fall outside budget
protocols." If this is a knife
fight, right now, Sir - we're
fighting it alone.
Pavitt starts to chuckle.
PAVITT
Joe Wilson versus the White House.
Well, all I can say is Good Luck.
But as a friend, I feel I should
tell you that those men..
He points down the hill at the White House.
PAVITT
Those few men in that building over
there, that small white house, are
the most powerful men in the
history of the world. How much of a
stretch do you think it would be
for them to take on Joe Wilson?
He looks at her.
PAVITT
Joe's out there on his own Valerie.
But I know we can trust you. Speak
to your husband.
He turns and walks off, leaving her alone, looking at the
White House.
A military parade. Three hundred eighteen year old recruits.
Fresh. Immaculate. Shining in the morning sun.
TREVOR
Look at the soldiers mommy. Look!
VALERIE and the twins join the small crowd and watch. Valerie
watches the American flag lowered, folded, and stowed.
CUT TO:
The twins are playing on a slide. Valerie sits on a bench.
When she looks back, she sees Joe approaching across the
playground. He greets the kids, hugging them..
JOE
Go and play now.
And he walks over to Valerie on the bench.
95.
VALERIE
Hey.
Joe carries a heavy brown manilla envelope. From it he
removes a thick wad of paper and drops it on the bench.
VALERIE
What's that?
JOE WILSON
That is the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. On page thirty six
it says "the former ambassador's
wife offered up his name" and
includes a memorandum written by
Valerie Plame which says quote "my
husband has good relations with
both the prime minister and the
former Minister of Mines, both of
whom could possibly shed light on
this sort of activity." I've spent
a whole year denying just this.
VALERIE
Joe wait-
JOE WILSON
Telling everyone who'll listen, on
TV. In the press. My wife did not
send me on a junket.
VALERIE
Joe. I didn`t send you. I didn't
have that power.
JOE WILSON
You sent an email. The SSCI found
the email.
VALERIE
JOE WILSON
I write hundreds of emails.
Why didn't you tell me? At no
time in the past twelve
months you never thought-
VALERIE
I didn't make the decision. I was
asked to write a recommendation.
What am I supposed to do. Not say
my husband knows about this.
JOE WILSON
They have this now. They will call
me a liar. It will stick. They have
all the power here, what do I have?

JOE WILSON (cont'd)
My word. You have to speak up. You
have to go on record.
VALERIE
Joe-
JOE WILSON
You have to defend us. Now.
She's cornered. Shakes her head in frustration.
VALERIE
So what do you want me to do Joe?
Go to the papers like you did?
Write a piece in the New York
Times? You know I'd have to submit
it to the Agency, and they'll-
JOE WILSON
(Interrupting)
The agency? The.. Wait.. Is this
the same Agency which won't give
you protection for your children?
Is this the same CIA that's erased
your pension? Where's your loyalty
Val? To your husband or the CIA?
VALERIE
(Shouts louder)
It's to MY FAMILY. I put my family
first. ALWAYS. Were you putting
them first when you wrote that
fucking article?
People are looking over. The children notice. JOE is stung
into silence.
VALERIE
I'm taking different routes to and
from school. I'm looking in empty
rooms..under the beds every time I
come home. A home we're going to
lose because your work has dried up
and your clients are running for
cover. What has all this achieved?
What changed Joe? Who won?
JOE WILSON
(nods)
Maybe you're right. Maybe I should
have kept my mouth shut. Is that
what your dad taught you Valerie?
That what Colonel Sam Plame said?
(MORE)
97.
JOE WILSON (cont'd)
A good American doesn't rock the
boat. A good American looks the
other way.
They are both terribly wounded. He looks at her, levelly.
JOE
Did you send me to Niger?
(Silence)
"His business is struggling. He's
on the slide. I'll throw him a
bone." Was that it Val? You pull
some strings for me? You help your
old man out?
VALERIE
How dare you?
JOE WILSON
Did you send me?
VALERIE
You think I'm lying to you.
JOE
Could I tell if you were?
Utter silence.
VALERIE
You fucking bastard..
She stops. SAMANTHA is watching them. She has tears in her
eyes. Valerie goes over and scoops her up. And Trevor. And
carries them off. Joe is alone.

No comment.
Joe gets into his car. The questions roaring around him.
Valerie gets out of the car. The kids run to hug Grandma and
Grandpa.
Valerie's father is teaching the kids how to lassoo a pole.
They both want to go first. He tries to keep the peace.

Those yellow fellas. See `em..

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
OK. Listen.

You hear that? Ain't that
beautiful. They suddenly showed up
last year. They're called..

What are they called? I know their
name. They're called something.

Anyway. They were here last year.
And the year before. God they're
beautiful. Look at that.

They watch the birds.

The sun setting. Samantha playing below. He nods slowly.
LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

Tears come to her eyes.
LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
I'm the same way. And I've said
that too. Those exact same words.
July 1972. Your mother and I were

England. Heck I can remember the
day you were born in a freezing
cold airbase outside Anchorage
Alaska. You must have been to

chances to introduce yourself. Be
someone new. But you turned out OK.
Responsible. A little too serious.
Always looking down the road.
Worrying where life was going to
drag you next. But it made you
tough. Real tough. Maybe tougher
than I, or your mother, or anyone
knows.
VALERIE
He wants me to go on the record.
Speak out. Like that would suddenly
make this all go away. We can't
even speak to each other.

I can't see how this comes round. I
just can't see it, pop. Not

He looks at her. With a serious intent. He speak low.

the pole.
