We move with an intense woman down the street. She is
nervous. Checks she is not being followed.
She is TAMORA, an extreme figure on the political landscape.
To the Roman elite she is a dangerous anarchist -- to her
supporters she is an ardent patriot and democrat.
As she moves, we take in Rome.
It might be Mexico City. Or Chechnia. Or El Salvador. Or
Detroit. Or Baghdad. Or London.
This Rome is a modern place. It is our world right now:
immediately recognizable to us. Elements of classical
architecture loom over decay. Monolithic modernism and brave
public monuments are lost in a sea of brazen advertising
billboards, neon shopping plazas and drab super-highways.
Splendor and squalor sit side-by-side.
It is a volatile, dangerous world.
William Shakespeare's Rome.
She comes to a graffiti-covered apartment building. Looks
around. Enters.
Tamora, Cassius and the others are now in the midst of the
protest march. The crowd has become a mob, with a life and
will of its own. The crowd surges forward--
They round a corner and suddenly stop--
For a formidable sight awaits them-
RIOT POLICE.
Rows of black uniforms. Full riot gear with plexiglass
shields and dangerous truncheons.
6.
A few soldiers on horses as well.
The crowd starts and shifts nervously, unsure how to proceed.
Should they launch themselves against this monolithic
military force?
A long, tense beat.
Then...
One of the horsemen trots forward...
He rides a beautiful white horse...
It is CAIUS MARTIUS. (Soon to be given the honorary title
Coriolanus.) He is intense and patrician. Uncompromising. A
man of steel. A soldier. He wears a crisp, military uniform.
From his position on the horse, Martius looks over the
rioters...
His gaze is ice...
A long beat...
Then he dismounts...
He slowly walks to the unruly mob...
With no hesitation, unarmed...
He stops before them...
And speaks with absolute disdain.
MARTIUS
What's the matter, you dissentious
rogues,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your
opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?
CASSIUS
(SARCASTIC)
We have ever your good word.
MARTIUS
(SNAPS)
He that will give good words to thee will
FLATTER
Beneath abhorring.
The crowd is hushed. Taking in his every word.
7.
We note a TV news crew has moved into position and is filming
eagerly. Some in the crowd film with cell phone cameras.
Streaming video. We intercut some of these perspectives.
MARTIUS
What would you have, you curs?
He that trusts to you,
Where he should find you lions, finds you
HARES;
Where foxes, geese.
He walks along the front of the crowd. Some are frightened by
the great Martius. Some are even awed. Others glare at him
with loathing.
MARTIUS
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate...
Hang ye! Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your
mind,
And call him noble that was now your
hate,
Him vile that was your garland.
He continues along the crowd, his cold eyes taking in face
AFTER FACE:
MARTIUS
What's the matter,
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble Senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which
ELSE
Would feed on one another?
He stops and glares at the mob with seething anger.
He climbs back onto his horse. Stares down at them.
AN ULTIMATUM:
MARTIUS
Go GET YOU HOME, YOU FRAGMENTS!
A tense beat.
The riot police shift nervously.
The crowd is unsure.
The TV news crew films everything.
8.
Cassius looks around. He sees the police ready with tear gas.
He sees old men, women and children in his crowd. He doesn't
want this to explode.
He exchanges a few whispers works with Tamora. Word is passed
and the crowd begins to disperse. Some run off in a panic.
Others walk away.
The danger has passed.
Senator Menenius, who has been watching from nearby, gestures
for Martius to join him. He is an old family friend of
Martius' as well as his mentor and chief political advisor.
Menenius is relieved bloodshed has been avoided.
MENENIUS
These are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they lack
discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly.
MARTIUS
They are dissolved. Hang 'em.
Senator Menenius watches the crowd. Disturbed.
MENENIUS
I would they were abed.
MARTIUS
I would they were in Tiber.
They move off.
Rome's military headquarters. A high security building like
the Pentagon.
A beautiful butterfly. Catching the light perfectly, almost
iridescent.
It floats before a palatial mansion in the suburbs of the
great city. Manicured lawns. Formal gardens. Classical
architectural lines.
This fine home of aristocratic privilege seems a world away
from the urban blight of Rome.
In the immaculate front gardens YOUNG MARTIUS, Martius' son,
is playing. The boy is about ten. There is something grim and
lonely about him, without charm.
Young Martius chases after the butterfly, trying to catch it.
He fails. The butterfly flits away. Young Martius leaps after
it. Again he misses.
Finally the frustrated boy manages to catch the butterfly. In
his rage he tears it to pieces, brutally shredding it.
We realize he is being observed...
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! A series of explosions jolt us.
Corioles is a small urban center. Smoke billows up from areas
of the city. The steady crack and rattle of gunfire. The
occasional thud of explosions.
We see urban street-to-street fighting. The images are
startling in their familiarity: this could be Basra or
Belfast.
The battle is photographed in a gritty exposure. Color is
drained out -- blood is a darker red like oil. Soldiers are
dark forms moving through shadows and smoke.
Martius and Titus, leading a platoon of around twenty Roman
SOLDIERS, run into view and take cover. Bullets zip and snap
around them.
The Roman soldiers wear modern battle fatigues and body
armor, tricked out with all the latest tech gear. The
Volscians, being a poor guerilla force, wear thrown together
uniforms that look almost tribal.
Martius calls over the incessant din of battle to Titus and
THE SOLDIERS:
17.
MARTIUS
They fear us not, but issue forth their
city.
Sniper bullets slam into a wall near him. He coughs away the
smoke and debris. This only makes him more angry:
MARTIUS
They do disdain us much beyond our
thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath!
He that retires, I'll take him for a
Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge!
Martius leaps up and races on. The others follow in military
order.
The Roman soldiers move along the street -- it is chaotic --
explosions, smoke and sniper fire -- they duck into doorways
and behind abandoned cars -- returning fire as best they can--
Martius leads -- firing stead bursts from his machine gun--
It is slow and bloody going--
Finally the Romans turn a corner and are stopped by a
roadblock: a burning bus that fills the entire street--
The Volsces use this roadblock to ambush the Roman soldiers--
We see glimpses of Volscian soldiers darting for position --
firing from rooftops and from inside shops--
BLISTERING CROSSFIRE--
In the face of the crossfire, the Roman soldiers start
FALLING BACK--
Martius refuses to yield -- pushing and shoving his men
toward the burning bus -- screaming in fury over the noise:
18.
MARTIUS
You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men! PLUTO AND
HELL!
All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces
PALE
With flight and agued fear! Mend and
charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave
THE FOE
AND MAKE MY WARS ON YOU!
An EXPLOSION -- dirt and brick shards slash across Martius'
face -- blood--
This only pushes his fury to white rage--
MARTIUS
Look to it. Come on!
FOLLOW ME!
He leaves his soldiers behind--
Moves alone to the burning bus and fights his way through the
FLAMES--
Martius is in his own world now. He doesn't even realize he
is alone. He has become a sort of killing machine. A shark
moving through the ocean. Ruthless and efficient.
We become the warrior.
From Martius' POV:
We move through disorienting curtains of smoke...
Continue down the street...
Firing a heavy machine gun...
Volscian soldiers contort and die, torn to pieces by the
bullets...
The heavy machine gun is empty, we drop it and use a sidearm,
firing strategic shots...
Volscian soldiers dart up -- fire -- and die...
We keep moving steadily forward...
Shadowy shapes moving nearby, we fire. Killing civilians. The
fortunes of war...
19.
Strange surreal images. We smash into a house. An OLD MAN
crouches, terrified, in a corner. He reaches forward. He is
offering us water. An act of kindness amid the carnage...
We move on...
Panicked civilians, scattering in terror...
Volscian soldiers rush us, attacking, we slam them aside...
We duck down, roll under a car, emerge and fire...
More Volscians die...
We continue forward...
Then the pistol is empty, we drop it and pull a machete-like
knife...
Still moving relentlessly forward...
Slashing and killing...
Hand-to-hand now...
Carnage.
Aufidius and his aides are racing down an alley, trying to
get to Martius--
Roman fire stops them--
They return fire as they divert down another alley, trying
for a better strategic position, running flat out--
Titus and the soldiers are still pinned down at the burning
bus. Two soldiers race back to Titus to report, they dive for
cover.
TITUS
What is become of Martius?
SOLDIER 1
Slain, sir, doubtless.
SOLDIER 2
He is himself alone,
To answer all the city.
20.
TITUS
Thou art lost, Martius...
Titus has no time to mourn. He looks over the hopeless
situation. Scanning the rooftops, windows and shops.
Then he stops He sees something Past the burning bus
Through the smoke and flames...
He glimpses a ghostly figure...
TITUS
Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flayed?
0 gods! He has the stamp of Martius.
It is indeed Martius.
A shocking sight.
Drenched head-to-toe in blood.
His face splattered with gore.
His eyes wild.
Lost in something like rapture.
MARTIUS
Come I too late?! Come I too late?!
TITUS
Ay, if you come not in the blood of
others,
But mantled in your own.
Martius laughs wildly and embraces Titus, who comes away
splattered with blood:
MARTIUS
0, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I wooed, in
HEART
As merry as when our nuptial day was
done!
SUDDENLY -- a deafening explosion -- and RPG EXPLODING from
nearby. Then gunfire. Bullets shatter windows. The Volscians
are attacking again.
The Romans instantly begin diving for cover and taking up
DEFENSIVE POSITIONS--
21.
Martius scans the location. Sees the attack is coming from an
old Hilton hotel. Now pockmarked with bullets and artillery
shells. Most of the windows shattered.
This is the Volscian stronghold. The last stand. He sees
flashes of Volscian soldiers moving on the roof and
balconies, and snipers firing from windows.
There is an open plaza, littered with bodies and debris, in
front of the hotel.
Martius stops scanning with his binoculars--
Sees Aufidius moving in the hotel, directing the battle--
MARTIUS
There is the man of my soul's hate--
AUFIDIUS--
Piercing our Romans.
TITUS
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise hath been too violent
For a second course of fight.
MARTIUS
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath yet not warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal
Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
I will appear and fight.
He turns to some soldiers, imploring them to join him. His
bloody visage and intensity are strangely inspiring, his
FEROCITY INFECTIOUS:
MARTIUS
(TO SOLDIERS)
If any such be here-
As it were sin to doubt - that love this
PAINTING
Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad
life,
And that his country's dearer than
HIMSELF;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
AND FOLLOW MARTIUS!
The soldiers are pumped up -- like Marines straining for
COMBAT--
22.
MARTIUS
0, ME ALONE! MAKE YOU A SWORD OF ME!
THEY BOLT--
Zigzagging across the plaza toward the hotel--
Titus and the others provide covering fire--
Martius zigzags with his men across the dangerously exposed
PLAZA--
They return fire at the hotel as best they can, but the
barrage from the Volscians is murderous--
Roman soldiers contort and fall, blood spraying--
Bullets snap and ricochet everywhere around them--
But still they keep up a steady pace, reloading and firing as
THEY GO--
Then Martius is hit--
BLOOD SPRAYS--
But still he keeps on--
The front of the hotel is closer now--
Martius and his soldiers race to the hotel and crash into the
LOBBY--
Aufidius and some of his Volscian soldiers, bloody and
filthy, are on foot.
They are moving through the outskirts of Corioles, leaving
the city. Exhausted after the long and failed battle.
Fires burn from blasted shops and homes. The Romans have
clearly laid waste to this part of the city.
There is a minivan stopped ahead of them. Bullets holes
everywhere. Bodies inside.
They walk to it. Aufidius looks in. A dead family. Father,
mother, kids in the back. Bloody toys on the floor of the
minivan.
Roman atrocities.
Aufidius gazes at the bodies. His face hardens.
He whispers to himself:
AUFIDIUS
Five times, Martius,
I have fought with thee; so often hast
thou beat me,
And would do so, I think, should we
ENCOUNTER
As often as we eat.
He becomes aware some of his men are looking at him,
disturbed at his fervor.
AUFIDIUS
FOR WHERE
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll stab him some
way,
Or wrath -- or craft -- may get him.
27.
SOLDIER
He's the devil.
AUFIDIUS
Bolder, though not so subtle.
A beat. Aufidius continues with prayer-like intensity:
AUFIDIUS
My valor, poisoned with him,
Shall fly out of itself ...
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked,
Sick, the prayers of priests,
Nor times of sacrifice,
Shall lift up their rotten privilege
And custom,
Against my hate to Martius.
In the shattered glass of the minivan window, Aufidius
suddenly sees himself.
He studies his own face, nurturing his dark thoughts.
AUFIDIUS
Where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even
there,
Will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
The Roman Senate is constructed with classical symmetry and
clean, square lines. Probably the most striking and beautiful
building in Rome.
The commercial heart of Rome. A large town square, since
antiquity used as a marketplace.
But now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses
and knock-off watches. Paltry fruit stands alongside shabby
souvenir stalls.
Advertising billboards surround and pollute the square --
SONY. COKE. NIKE. MCDONALDS -- obscuring any classical
architecture that might have survived.
Tamora and Cassius, the political activists, are in the
crowd. They watch closely.
Coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace. He
stands, feeling ridiculous and not at all humble.
He looks around.
Waiting for something to happen.
The CUSTOMERS and SHOPKEEPERS just look back at him. Some are
curious. Some are amused. Some hostile and most indifferent.
But no one approaches.
Then Coriolanus understands. He must g to them: beg for
votes.
He prepares himself and then slowly moves through the various
stalls, weaving in and out. Trying to maintain his dignity.
He sees the Citizens from before and goes to them. We glimpse
Brutus and Sicinius amongst the crowd.
CORIOLANUS
(TO CASSIUS)
You know the cause, sir, of my standing
here.
CASSIUS
We do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you
to it.
CORIOLANUS
Mine own desert.
TAMORA
Your own desert?
CORIOLANUS
Ay, but not mine own desire.
42.
TAMORA
How not your own desire?
CORIOLANUS
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble
the poor with begging.
CASSIUS
You must think, if we give you anything,
we hope to gain by you.
CORIOLANUS
Well then, I pray, your price of the
Consulship?
WAR VET
The price is to ask it kindly.
CORIOLANUS
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it. I
have wounds to show you, which shall be
yours in private Your good voice,
sir. What say you?
WAR VET
(IMPRESSED)
You shall have it, worthy sir.
CORIOLANUS
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy
voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu.
Business done, so he thinks, Coriolanus crisply moves on.
Cassius is not convinced.
CASSIUS
But this is something odd.
Coriolanus continues on. He sees a large JAMAICAN WOMAN with
her CHILDREN, carrying plastic grocery bags, talking to a
SHOPKEEPER. He goes to them:
CORIOLANUS
Pray you now, if it may stand with the
tune of your voices that I may be Consul.
JAMAICAN WOMAN
You have deserved nobly of your country,
and you have not deserved nobly.
CORIOLANUS
Your enigma?
43.
JAMAICAN WOMAN
You have been a scourge to her enemies;
you have been a rod to her friends
You have not indeed loved the common
people.
CORIOLANUS
You should account me the more virtuous
that I have not been common in my love
Therefore, beseech you, I may be
Consul.
SHOPKEEPER
We hope to find you our friend, and
therefore give you our voices heartily.
JAMAICAN WOMAN
You have received many wounds for your
country.
CORIOLANUS
I will not seal your knowledge with
showing them. I will make much of your
voices, and so trouble you no farther.
JAMAICAN WOMAN
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
Coriolanus is warming to the task, it's easier than he
thought. He moves to a central, open area and declares
PUBLICLY:
CORIOLANUS
Your voices! For your voices I have
FOUGHT;
Watched for your voices; for your voices
BEAR
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice
SIX
I have seen and heard of!
A crowd is gathering. We note Brutus and Sicinius in the
crowd. Menenius, too, has moved in.
CORIOLANUS
For your voices
Have done many things, some less, some
more.
Your voices! Indeed, I would be Consul.
WAR VET
He has done nobly, and cannot go without
any honest man's voice!
44.
RACE TRACK TOUT
Therefore let him be Consul!
JAMAICAN WOMAN
The gods give him joy, and make him good
friend to the people!
The Citizens applaud and give their support:
CITIZENS
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble Consul!
CORIOLANUS
Worthy voices!
Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius, goes to him:
MENENIUS
You have stood your limitation, and the
TRIBUNES
Endue you with the people's voice.
CORIOLANUS
Is this done?
SICINIUS
The custom of request you have
discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned
To meet anon upon your approbation.
CORIOLANUS
Where? At the Senate?
SICINIUS
There, Coriolanus.
MENENIUS
I'll keep you company.
(TO BRUTUS)
Will you along?
BRUTUS
(DECLINES)
We stay here for the people.
Coriolanus and Menenius go, relieved the trial is over.
Brutus and Sicinius, however, have work to do. This has not
gone as they wanted. They are urgent:
SICINIUS
How now, my masters! Have you chose this
man?
45.
CASSIUS
(RUEFULLY)
He has our voices, sir.
BRUTUS
We pray the gods he may deserve your
loves.
TAMORA
Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
He mocked us when he begged our voices.
CASSIUS
CERTAINLY
He flouted us downright.
JAMAICAN WOMAN
No, it is his kind of speech; he did not
mock us.
TAMORA
(SHARPLY)
He should have showed us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's
country.
SICINIUS
Why, so he did, I am sure.
TAMORA
No, no! No one saw them!
CASSIUS
(inciting the crowd)
Was not this mockery?
Brutus presses hard:
BRUTUS
When he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties.
SICINIUS
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves, and do you
THINK
That his contempt shall not be bruising
TO YOU
When he hath power to crush?
46.
Cassius and Tamora carefully lead the crowd in expressing
growing alarm and resistance to Coriolanus:
CASSIUS
He's not confirmed; we may deny him yet!
TAMORA
And will deny him!
I'll have five hundred voices of that
sound.
CASSIUS
I twice five hundred and their friends!
The crowd roars approval. A frightening, animal sound.
SICINIUS
Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election.
BRUTUS
Enforce his pride,
And his old hate unto you!
SICINIUS
And presently, when you have drawn your
number,
Repair to the Capitol.
CASSIUS
We will so!
TAMORA
We will so! All
Repent in their election!
Cassius and Tamora lead the crowd. It is a terrifying
spectacle of sudden mob rage, only a razor-thin edge to
violence.
Brutus and Sicinius watch, satisfied, like Robespierre and
Saint Just looking over the bloody guillotine.
Coriolanus launches himself into the crowd with blistering
ANGER:
CORIOLANUS
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented crowd,
Let them regard me as I do not flatter,
And therein behold themselves. I say
again,
In soothing them, we nourish against our
SENATE
The cockle of rebellion, insolence,
sedition,
Which we ourselves have ploughed for,
sowed, and scattered,
By mingling them with us!
50.
MENENIUS
Well, no more!
TITUS
No more words, we beseech you--
The mob has surrounded them all by now.
The police are getting nervous, eyes darting uneasily from
the unruly crowd to the volatile men.
This all has the potential of sparking to violence.
We note a TV news crew moving into position, covering the
action. Others film with cell phone cameras. We intercut some
of this footage.
BRUTUS
(to Coriolanus, provoking)
You speak of the people
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.
SICINIUS
It were well we let the people know it.
CORIOLANUS
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, it would be my mind!
SICINIUS
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.
CORIOLANUS
(EXPLODES)
"Shall remain"!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark
YOU
His absolute "shall"?
BRUTUS
Why, should the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?
CORIOLANUS
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices!
Menenius tries to pull him away, Coriolanus shakes free and
continues the attack:
51
CORIOLANUS
By Jove himself,
It makes the consuls base; and my soul
ACHES
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion,
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.
The crowd roars angrily -- Coriolanus spins on them:
CORIOLANUS
Thus we debase the nature of our seats,
and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks of the Senate, and
BRING IN
The crows to peck the eagles!
MENENIUS
Come, enough!
BRUTUS
Enough, with over-measure.
SICINIUS
(calls to the mob)
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall
ANSWER
As traitors do!
At the word "traitor" Coriolanus loses all reason, he is
FIRE:
CORIOLANUS
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
BRUTUS
Manifest treason!
SICINIUS
This is a Consul? No!
CORIOLANUS
Hence, old goat!
Coriolanus grabs Sicinius roughly and flings him aside--
At this -- the crowd ROARS in outrage -- the TV crews hustle
FOR POSITION--
Menenius pulls Coriolanus off:
52.
MENENIUS
On both sides more respect!
SICINIUS
(calling to the crowd)
Here's he that would take from you all
your power!
The crowd reacts angrily -- surging forward against the
restraint of the police.
We see grim RIOT POLICE marching into position. The crowd is
not intimidated, they are spoiling for a fight.
The Tribunes provoke the crowd even more, escalating and
building the fever:
BRUTUS
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you, Martius,
Whom late you have named for Consul.
SICINIUS
What is the city but the people?!
TAMORA
True! The people are the city!
SICINIUS
We do here pronounce, upon the part of
the people,
Martius is worthy of present DEATH!
A huge roar from the mob. Panic and violence building. Fast
AND OVERLAPPING:
BRUTUS
Guards, seize him!
CORIOLANUS
No, I'll die here!
BRUTUS
Lay hands upon him!
SICINIUS
(to the crowd)
HELP, YE CITIZENS!
At his cue--
The civil violence threatened from the opening moments of
this story finally EXPLODES--
53.
With Cassius and Tamora in the forefront, the crowd attacks
THE POLICE--
Riot Police march in, slamming ahead with riot shields and
TRUNCHEONS--
The mob fights back with anything at hand -- some are armed
with clubs and knives, others snatch up garbage cans and
newspaper vending machines, throwing them, smashing windows,
battling the police, kicking and punching and screaming--
It is civil disobedience. But it is also drunken, thug
violence. Terrifying in its intensity--
Menenius gets Titus and Cominius to hustle Coriolanus away--
MENENIUS
Go, get you to your house! Be gone, away!
All will be naught else--
COMINIUS
Come, sir, along with us--
They hurry Coriolanus away--
The Riot Police, outnumbered, start firing TEAR GAS into the
CROWD--
SCREAMS--
TV news crew filming--
Chaotic, flurried violence--
Shaky TV images, cell phone video--
Choking, acrid gas--
It is a terrifying descent into public madness as all order
breaks down.
Rome is bloody.
The outskirts of Rome are an urban wasteland. Abandoned
factories. Rusting cars. Overgrown vacant lots. Collapsing
advertising billboards.
There is a lonely gas station in the distance, its neon sign
glowing a lurid green in the gray dawn light.
We are at a Roman checkpoint on the highway into the city. A
guardhouse and barrier. Some barbed wire barricades. Bored
soldiers.
Several cars pull up to the checkpoint. Two Roman security
SUVs. Menenius' familiar limousine. And Volumnia's enormous
Bentley.
Security Guards climb out of their vehicle, light cigarettes
and chat with the soldiers manning the checkpoint. Menenius,
Titus and Cominius climb from Menenius' limousine.
Coriolanus takes his leave:
CORIOLANUS
(EMBRACING TITUS)
Bid me farewell.
TITUS
Farewell, Martius.
CORIOLANUS
(EMBRACING COMINIUS)
Cominius, droop not, adieu.
I'll do well yet.
He goes to Menenius, who is genuinely distraught. For all his
political machinations, he truly cares for Coriolanus.
Coriolanus is moved to see Menenius so emotional.
CORIOLANUS
Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are salter than a younger
man's,
And venomous to thine eyes.
MENENIUS
(DEEPLY)
If I could shake off but seven years
I'd go with thee every foot.
They embrace.
Then Coriolanus knows it is time to go. He picks up a
traveling bag and slings it over his shoulder.
Looks back at his friends and family.
A beat.
A certain darkness creeps into his expression. An ominous
resolve.
CORIOLANUS
You shall hear from me still.
He turns and looks to the distance.
Miles and miles of wasteland and desolation.
70.
His future.
CORIOLANUS
I go alone,
Like to a lonely dragon.
He strides off.
The soldiers manning the checkpoint raise the barrier.
Coriolanus walks under it. And begins walking down the long
highway away from Rome.
The only sound is the cold, lonely moan of the wind.
We fade to...
Coriolanus' exile.
We see his long odyssey. It is a grueling physical journey --
and also something of a spiritual challenge. He is solitary
and without comfort: vulnerable to the elements and also to
the demons of his own psyche.
We see him as...
He walks along the barren highway. Trash piled along the
road. A car zooms past. Whoosh. He is lost in dust...
Blazing heat, like a furnace, as he trudges over desert
terrain. Burning oil wells blacken the sky in the distance...
Isolated, within himself, as he walks past the detritus of
war a burned out tank a mountain of rusted artillery
shells skeletons bleached in the sun...
His clothes are dusty and dirty now. A sandstorm. He wraps a
scarf around his head, like a burnoose. Only his eyes visible
now...
A gypsy boy in tattered clothing riding a white horse passes
him. The boy looks at him intently as he passes...
We get a sense of him moving into different terrain, up into
a mountain range, climbing...
Then descending. Pouring rain. Lightning sparking. He is
almost a Romantic figure now. Byronic. Wrapped in a cloak
against the wildness of nature; the chiaroscuro flashes of
light illuminating his haunted eyes...
71.
We end at...
Coriolanus stands. Like a statue. All his life in his blazing
eyes. He is staring at a small town in the distance.
We see a sign: ANTIUM.
His destination since he began. The home of his nemesis, the
hated Aufidius.
He begins to walk to the town.
Antium is an old Volscian city gone to seed. It is Latin in
flavor, something like Havana.
There is life to the place, a certain humid vitality. Someone
is singing in a bar. Old men are playing dominos on a patio.
Flickering TV and radio babel from terraced apartment
buildings.
74.
Coriolanus, his face still shrouded in the burnoose, like a
Hamas soldier, moves through the streets.
He takes in the life of the town as he walks. Studying the
faces of the Volscians around him.
Coriolanus sees a heavily-guarded apartment building at the
end of the street. Jeeps and SOLDIERS.
Coriolanus approaches with stealth, moving in and out of
shadows along the street, ducking into doorways and alleys,
taking advantage of the darkness.
He stops. Steps into the shadows. For he sees...
Aufidius.
Walking with a few of his officers.
Aufidius is beloved in Antium. He has an easy manner with the
people. He stops and chats. Laughs with them. He dances for a
moment with a little girl.
Coriolanus watches from the shadows, his expression complex.
There is real envy . Aufidius has such a comfortable way
with the common people, he's natural, unaffected.
Aufidius jokes with the little girl's parents for a moment
and then moves on.
Coriolanus watches Aufidius and his men go into an apartment
building.
He scans the building with the eye of a Special Forces
soldier. He sees that the soldiers guarding the building are
bored, it is perfunctory work.
Two YOUNG WOMEN, perhaps hookers, move past the front of the
building, flirting with the soldiers. The soldiers call and
whistle to them, delighted.
Coriolanus uses this distraction to slip into the shadows
behind the soldiers and sneak into the building...
Urban industrial wasteland. Old factories and abandoned
warehouses. Broken asphalt. Smashed windows.
The Volscians have set up camp here. On the decaying fringes
of the city. We see military hardware. Guns. Missile
launchers. Armored vehicles.
Soldiers are cleaning weapons, cooking meals, sleeping,
playing video games.
Then...
84.
An incongruous sight...
An old barber chair floats past. Moving across the blue sky.
Carried overhead by a group of Volscian soldiers.
But there is something different about these Volscian
soldiers. They have altered their uniforms into something
pagan and primitive. All have shaved heads. Many have face
tattoos or wear striking war paint.
It is like something from LORD OF THE FLIES.
They set the barber chair down outside an abandoned factory.
This shattered and abandoned factory is Coriolanus' domain.
It is decorated with human skulls.
The CAMP BARBER, a fat man in a greasy butcher's apron,
begins to strop his razor.
Hard core young soldiers line up to have their heads shaved.
They are Coriolanus' ACOLYTES.
There is no sign of Coriolanus himself.
Aufidius and his LIEUTENANT stand on the fringes, disturbed
by the strange cult of personality that has grown up around
Coriolanus.
AUFIDIUS
Do they still fly to Coriolanus?
LIEUTENANT
I do not know what witchcraft's in him,
BUT
Your soldiers use him as the grace before
meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at
end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
AUFIDIUS
He bears himself more proud,
Even to my person, than I thought he
WOULD
When first I did embrace him.
They turn and walk to the building where Aufidius is
QUARTERED:
LIEUTENANT
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry
Rome?
85.
AUFIDIUS
(GRIM)
I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes
IT
By sovereignty of nature.
Aufidius nods to the guards outside his quarters and enters
with his Lieutenant...
The Roman checkpoint on the desolate highway. A formidable
military presence here now: soldiers, heavy weapons, tanks.
Volscian troops and a jeep can be seen down the highway.
We see Menenius' limousine pull up.
He and General Cominius climb out. Menenius is out of place
in his trim business suit: a politician among soldiers.
Menenius steels himself then passes through the Roman
checkpoint.
He walks down the highway toward the distant Volscian troops.
Menenius is blindfolded, roughly pulled by two Volscian
soldiers.
We hear some of the soldiers hooting at him. We stay close on
Menenius' blindfolded face, sharing his feeling of
disorientation and suspense.
The Volscians drag him into the abandoned factory--
89.
Back at the Roman checkpoint, Menenius strides toward his
limousine. He has been deeply shaken by his interaction with
the transformed Coriolanus.
General Cominius follows urgently, Menenius doesn't stop:
MENENIUS
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings; he's more than a creeping
thing.
He stops at his limo.
91.
A beat.
He turns back to Cominius. We see the pain in Menenius' eyes.
MENENIUS
There is no more mercy in him than there
is milk in a male tiger.
He climbs into his limo. Shuts the door.
The limousine drives off, sending up a cloud of dust that
swirls around Cominius.
Menenius' limousine pulls over by an isolated set of railroad
tracks. Weeds springing up. Battered advertising posters. An
old chain link fence.
Menenius climbs out of the car and walks along the tracks.
Thinking.
He stops.
He sits on the railroad tracks.
Pulls out a little pocket knife and, in the Roman fashion,
efficiently slits his wrists.
He stares out over the hideous landscape.
Blood begins to pool around his stylish shoes.
From afar we see him, sitting on the railroad tracks, alone
and forlorn in this surreal urban wasteland, like a Samuel
Beckett character.
He slumps over.
92.
Menenius is dead.
Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius stride past the soldiers
and mountains of military hardware. Volumnia leads, pulling
the others by the hand.
Some of the soldiers whistle. Some spit. Others laugh and
make lascivious noises. Many just watch with grim dislike.
Volumnia appears to be completely impervious to the whistles
and cruel taunts. Her head is high, back straight, eagle eye
forward. She was never more a Roman patrician.
93.
She is magnificent.
A rundown Truck Stop in an industrial wasteland.
Garish, buzzing neon. Filthy 18-wheelers refueling. Music
droning from a radio.
Aufidius, his Lieutenant and seven of his men are waiting
outside the dusty diner.
The men with Aufidius are thugs and killers, the most brutal
Volsces he could find. We note a couple of Coriolanus'
Acolytes among them. They have turned with great venom on
their hero.
They are like a mafia hit squad, waiting for Coriolanus to
return with the peace treaty.
Aufidius is deep in thought.
His Lieutenant breaks the silence:
LIEUTENANT
How is it with our general?
AUFIDIUS
As with a man by his own charity slain.
LIEUTENANT
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's difference; but the
(MORE)
102.
LIEUTENANT (CANT'D)
fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.
AUFIDIUS
I know it,
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction.
A beat. He continues more to himself than them, almost
convincing himself.
AUFIDIUS
I raised him, and I pawned
Mine honor for his truth; who being so
heightened,
He watered his new plants with dews of
flattery,
Seducing so my friends.
(BITTERLY)
At the last
I seemed his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with his countenance as if
I had been mercenary.
LIEUTENANT
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it; and in the last,
When he had carried Rome and that we
LOOKED
For no less spoil than glory--
Aufidius works himself into an intense, neurotic rage:
AUFIDIUS
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched
upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which
ARE
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and
LABOR
Of our great action -- Therefore shall he
die,
And I'll renew me in his fall.
LIEUTENANT
Therefore, at your vantage,
Ere he express himself or move the people
With what he would say, let him feel your
sword,
Which we will second.
103.
AUFIDIUS
(SEES SOMETHING)
Say no more.
In the distance they can see a Roman military truck
approaching. Clouds of dust billow up.
They exchange a look. This is what they have been waiting
for. They stand, stretch and prepare.
The truck stops across the highway from them and Coriolanus
gets out. He holds a copy of the peace treaty in a leather
portfolio. He is unarmed.
He stops.
He sees Aufidius and the thugs. Waiting for him. Like a death
squad.
Coriolanus looks at them.
He knows exactly what's going to happen.
He is ready.
He nods and the truck drives off.
Coriolanus slowly crosses the highway to the truck stop, like
a gunslinger walking down Main Street.
There is something new to Coriolanus here. A sort of
acceptance. He knows his time is past.
Aufidius and the thugs go to meet him. The thugs spread out a
bit, strategically, getting ready to strike. Coriolanus'
experienced eyes miss none of this.
They meet in the parking lot.
CORIOLANUS
(TO AUFIDIUS)
I am returned your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence, but still
SUBSISTING
Under your great command.
He hands the treaty portfolio to Aufidius:
CORIOLANUS
We have made peace
With no less honor to the Volscians
Than shame to the Romans.
104.
AUFIDIUS
(handing the treaty to
LIEUTENANT)
Read it not,
But tell the traitor, in the highest
DEGREE
He hath abused your powers.
Coriolanus is ready for Aufidius' ploy. He is amused at the
obvious attempt to anger him:
CORIOLANUS
Traitor? How now?
AUFIDIUS
Ay, traitor, Martius.
CORIOLANUS
"Martius"?
AUFIDIUS
Ay, Martius, Caius Martius! Dost thou
THINK
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy
STOLEN NAME
"Coriolanus"?
He spins to the others, making the case against Coriolanus
with cutting bitterness:
AUFIDIUS
PERFIDIOUSLY
He has betrayed your business and given
up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome-
I say "your city" - to his wife and
MOTHER;
Breaking his oath and resolution, like
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
Counsel of the war, but at his nurse's
TEARS
He whined and roared away YOUR VICTORY!
Coriolanus tries to contain his anger:
CORIOLANUS
Hear'st thou, Mars?
AUFIDIUS
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
105.
CORIOLANUS
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart
Too great for what contains it. "Boy"? 0
slave.
Coriolanus' eyes miss nothing a Volscian thug shifting
a bead of sweat on another one secretly reaching into
his coat for a weapon.
Some of the Volscian thugs are clearly nervous.
Coriolanus is ready. He prepares himself mentally to die. He
is acutely controlled:
CORIOLANUS
Cut me to pieces, Volsces.
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me.
It is a dare. A challenge.
CORIOLANUS
"Boy"? False hound.
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis
THERE
That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I
Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
His gaze burns into Aufidius:
CORIOLANUS
Alone I did it "Boy."
AUFIDIUS
Let him die for it.
At this command, his men move--
Aufidius steps back as--
The Volscian thugs attack--
With knives, machetes and tire irons--
Coriolanus fights bravely -- disarming two, grabbing their
weapons, killing them, fighting back--
Slashing and cutting his way through the killers-
Closer and closer to Aufidius, who just watches--
Blood spattering and spraying-
But the thugs overpower Coriolanus, there are just too many--
106.
They stab him -- slicing with knives -- battering with chains
and clubs -- finally emptying pistols him into him--
It is graceless and brutal carnage.
Slaughter.
But still he comes on. Body riddled with bullets and cut to
bits. He refuses to fall. Like something immortal. An obscene
demon of blood.
Finally the thugs move away.
Coriolanus still stands. Teetering. His face is a swollen
mask of blood and gore. Blood flows from his body, pooling
around his feet, spreading across the parking lot.
Aufidius steps forward.
What is left of Coriolanus glares at him through blood.
Aufidius slowly pulls his knife. The same knife he was
sharpening so carefully at the opening of the story. It has
finally found its purpose.
Coriolanus looks at him.
Then slowly Coriolanus tries to raise one bleeding arm
this requires superhuman effort his slashed fingers
clutch his shirt he rips it open exposing his breast.
Ready.
He locks eyes with Aufidius.
Aufidius steps to him. Takes his neck. Pulls him onto the
knife. Driving it into him. Cradling his head like a lover.
They stand like this.
Then Coriolanus falls.
A pause.
AUFIDIUS
Take him up.
No one moves.
AUFIDIUS
Assist.
Abrupt cut to--
107.
Coriolanus' body is awkwardly tossed into the back of an open
truck. Like a sack of potatoes.
A crowd of Volscians are gathered around the back of the
truck. They have come to see Coriolanus' body.
We watch their faces. Normal people. A range of grim emotion.
One raises a cell phone. Takes a photo.
More phone cameras come out. Streaming video. Recording the
moment.
