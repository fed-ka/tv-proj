                                                                              FADE IN:

      EXT. CITY - NIGHT

      Sikes' car barrels down the street, passing a billboard for 
      NU-SHEEN -- Newcomer spot enhancer.

      INSIDE THE CAR

      Sikes drives. Cathy sits next to him, looking anxiously out 
      the window. Suddenly, Sikes brakes.

      HIS POV - A NEWCOMER MAN

      Dressed in a suit, walks aimlessly in the middle of the 
      street, directly in Sikes' path.

      Sikes hits the horn.

                                  SIKES
                    Hey! Move it!

      The Newcomer man stops, staring blankly at the car.

      SIKES

      Turns the wheel to go around him.

      SIKES' CAR circumventing the man, continuing down the 
      street.

      EXT. TAYLOR MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      A sign reads: A DUAL HUMAN/NEWCOMER HEALTH CARE FACILITY.

      Sikes' car SCREECHES to a stop. Sikes and Cathy leap out.

                                  CATHY (pointing)
                    The Newcomer wing is over here.

      Following Cathy, Sikes rushes toward the building.

      INT. NEWCOMER WARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Staff is both human and Newcomer. A few ambulatory Newcomer 
      patients walk the corridor. Cathy and Sikes appear from 
      around corner.                                  CATHY (pointing)
                    They're in the secure area.

      She and Sikes continue toward a set of swinging doors 
      marked AUTHORISED PERSONNEL ONLY. Cathy and Sikes flash 
      their I.D. to a security guard. He waves them through.

      INT. SECURITY WING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      George is at the far end of the hall with Buck who holds 
      Vessna to his chest. They peer through a glass window into 
      a room. Sikes and Cathy approach.

                                  SIKES
                    George...
                          (as George turns)
                    How are they?

      Shaking his head, George points to the glass window.

                                  GEORGE
                    The doctor's in with them.

      THEIR POV - THE HOSPITAL ROOM

      Where Susan and Emily lie bathed in eerie U.V. light and 
      therapeutic mist. A Newcomer doctor, Quinn, evaluates their 
      signs which flash across monitors above their beds. 
      Newcomer lab technician draws a pink blood sample from 
      Susan's shoulder while another doctor, a human woman, 
      examines Emily with a laryngoscope. Quinn exits, followed 
      by the other doctor.

      RESUME SCENE

      George distraught, turns to Sikes.

                                  GEORGE
                    Flowers came to the house... I should've 
                    been more careful... I shouldn't have let 
                    Susan and Emily near them...

                                  QUINN (approaching)
                    Mr Francisco... We've got them on life 
                    support. For now, it seems the intensive 
                    ultra violet and nitrogen are keeping your 
                    wife and daughter stable. 
                                  (MORE)                                  QUINN (approaching) (CONT'D)
                    But their condition is still critical.

                                  BUCK
                    Can we go inside?

                                  QUINN
                      I wouldn't recommend taking the baby -- she 
                    might be more vulnerable.

                                  CATHY (to Buck)
                    Go.
                            (reaching out)
                    I'll take her.

      Vessna CRIES, clinging to Buck.

                                  GEORGE
                    She senses something is wrong... she'll 
                    only let Buck or me hold her.

                                  BUCK
                    You go in, Dad. I'll be in the waiting 
                    room.

      He exits as George starts for Susan and Emily's room. 
      Sikes, feeling terrible for his friend and guilty over 
      their earlier fight, stops him.

                                  SIKES
                    George... if there's anything I can do...

                                  GEORGE
                            (conscious of the unresolved 
                            friction)
                    Thank you, Matthew.

      George enters the room.

      INSIDE

      The Newcomer lab technician, who has moved to Emily, 
      finishes taking a blood sample from her shoulder. The 
      syringe fills with Emily's pink blood. George approaches 
      through the purple mist, pausing to watch his daughter's 
      laboured breathing as she sleeps. He turns toward Susan 
      who, sensing her husband's presence, opens her eyes.                                  SUSAN (weak)
                      Stangya...

      Putting his finger to his lips, George signals Susan not to 
      tax herself. He tenderly touches her temple with his fist. 
      In the back ground the lab technician exits with his 
      samples.

      OUTSIDE THE ROOM

      Cathy observes through the window. Sikes stands next to 
      her.

                                  CATHY
                    I'm putting together a team to find an 
                      antitoxin. Your scientific investigation 
                    division knows as much about the bacterium 
                    as anyone so we're setting up in their 
                      laboratory.

      Sikes' attention is caught by the Newcomer lab technician. 
      Holding the blood samples, the technician stands dazed, 
      immobile, in the middle of the hall.

                                  SIKES
                    Is he all right?

      Concerned, Cathy approaches the Technician.

                                  CATHY
                    {Excuse me...}

      The technician turns to her, still dazed.

                                  TECHNICIAN
                    {The suns were eclipsed... darkness... only 
                      darkness...}
                          (to Sikes)
                    The night would last a thousand years.

                                  CATHY (gently touching his 
                                  arm)
                    Take these samples to the lab.

      The technician nods numbly and moves off. Cathy turns to a 
      puzzled Sikes.                                  CATHY
                    It's a Tenctonese legend... before we were 
                    taken into slavery, there was an eclipse of 
                    the suns. The Tenctonese sensed the end of 
                    their world.
                            (seeing Sikes doesn't 
                            understand)
                    This bacterium, Matt... it could destroy 
                    our entire species.

      She walks off. Sikes watches her a moment, then turns back 
      to the window.

      HIS POV - INSIDE THE ROOM

      George stands vigil over his wife and daughter.

      INT. POLICE STATION SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      Busy. A glassy-eyed Newcomer woman is being led to the 
      holding cell by a human uniformed cop. They pass Zepeda 
      who's taking a file to her desk.

                                  COP
                    Hey, Zep, get this...
                            (re: Newcomer)
                    We caught her on her way up Trumo tower 
                    west.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    So?

                                  COP
                    Outside. She was climbing it.

                                  NEWCOMER WOMEN
                      A thousand years... a thousand years...

                                  COP
                      Something's going on with these Nukes.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Yeah. We've been bringing 'em in all night.

      The cop leads the woman off. Zepeda heads for her desk 
      where the phone is RINGING. She answers it.                                  ZEPEDA
                    Detective Zepeda.
                            (listens)
                    Sir, I sympathise -- I've been against it 
                    myself since the early 90's. But L.A.P.D. 
                    has nothing to do with the renewed 
                    Malathion spraying.
                            (listens)
                    I'm sorry your dog's asthmatic, but I 
                    really can't help you. Try the Mayor's 
                    office.

      She hangs up as Sikes approaches.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    How're Susan and Emily?

                                  SIKES
                    They don't know. What's going on here?

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Crazy. Newcomers are losing it all over 
                    town and Rampart pulls half the first watch 
                    for that Malathion protest in --

                                  SIKES (cutting her off)
                    Whoa -- whoa. What do you mean Newcomers 
                    are losing it?

                                  ZEPEDA
                    They're not sleeping. The milk taverns were 
                    packed all night. We got Nukes chanting in 
                    the streets -- others are completely zoning 
                    out -- one guy left his rig in the middle 
                    of the San Bernardino Freeway -- just 
                    walked away.
                            (handling him her file)
                    Here's the S.I.D. report on the flowers 
                    that were sent to George's house. The 
                      handwriting on the note was the same as on 
                    those sent to Judge Kaiser and Peter Boggs. 
                    We also found similar traces of sea salt.                                  SIKES
                    So, Parris must've sent them to George 
                    before he was killed.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    But who killed Parris? And why?

                                  SIKES
                    I know a guy we can talk to about that.

      INT. S.I.D. LAB - DAY

      CAMERA PANS the large, partitioned lab to bomb squad 
      technician Max Jullian. Late twenties, T-shirt and jeans, 
      Max tosses a couple exploding caps -- metal balls, coated 
      with gun powder that SNAP when they hit each other.

                                  SIKES (O.S.)
                    Hey, Max.

      Max doesn't hear him. CAMERA WIDENS to show Sikes and 
      Zepeda entering the lab. Sikes taps his ear, indicating 
      that Max is hard of hearing.

                                  SIKES (louder)
                    Yo, Max!

      Max looks up, smiling when he sees Sikes.

                                  MAX
                    Hey, Sikes.

                                  SIKES
                    Zep, meet mad Max -- numero uno bomb tech. 
                    Max -- Zepeda. She made D-one last month.

                                  MAX (shaking her hand)
                    Geppetto? Like Pinocchio's dad?

                    Zepeda.

                    Plug it in.

                                  MAX (to Zepeda)
                    Got to close to a pipe bomb.

                    I usually keep this off -- that way I can't 
                    hear people complain.

                                  SIKES
                    What'd you get on the Parris homicide?

                                  MAX (grabbing a file)
                    The explosive was Kentex. It's manufactured 
                    with a chemical tracer, so I've been able 
                    to determine the batch number. 
                      Unfortunately, it's a big batch.

                    Find out who can't account for twenty grams

                                  CATHY (O.S.)
                    Over here with that.

      Sikes turns to see Cathy entering with a mover who's 
      dollying in boxes of her equipment. She directs him to a 
      corner of the lab. Zepeda notices Sikes looking at Cathy. 
      She pulls the file from his hands.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Petrosian and I can start on this.
                    She walks off.

                                  MAX
                    If you're through with me...

      Max turns off his hearing aid as Sikes moves to Cathy who's 
      already unpacking feverishly.

                                  SIKES
                    Hi...

      Absorbed in her work, Cathy nods.                                  SIKES
                    Cathy... back in the hospital -- you 
                    mentioned a legend --
                            (beat)
                    What I mean -- a lot of Newcomers are 
                    acting weird.

      She turns, holding an empty beaker, her hand shaking.

                                  CATHY
                    I feel it, too. I can't eat -- can't sleep.

                    Cathy, only two Newcomers have died. Susan 
                    and Emily are sick, but that doesn't mean 
                    all of you are in danger. The man who made 
                    the bacteria is dead. For all we know, the

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      A small human in prison fatigues, Elliot Riley, sits 
      shackled to a desk. He scowls as Sikes enters.                                  SIKES

      The door opens and a massive Newcomer, Moe Goodluck, is 
      escorted in by a guard.

      The purple mist is gone -- the beds are made -- the room is

      creatures.

      HIS POV - THE HOSPITAL ROOM

      As it is. George sings at Susan's side. Listening, Albert 
      pets the dog.

                                  GEORGE
                    "I was born and raised in San Jose -- I'm 
                    goin' back to find some piece of mind in

      Sikes moves near George.

                                  GEORGE
                    "Fame and fortune is a magnet. It can pull 
                    you far away from home."

      Sikes joins in the singing.

      Sikes and George move close together as they finish the 
      song.

      INT. WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

      Purist leader Darlene Bryant is led into the warehouse by 
      her field commander, Mark her bodyguard follows.                                  BRYANT
                    What was so important? Is there a problem 
                    with the bacteria?

                                  GUERIN (urgent)
                    You have to see this.

      He pushes through a set of swing doors into:

      THE WAREHOUSE LAB

      A group of white-coated technicians cluster, their backs to 
      Guerin and Bryant.

                                  BRYANT (concerned)
                    What?

      Turning, the group parts, revealing a technician holding a 
      cake with a half dozen birthday candles.

                                  ALL
                    Happy birthday, Miss Bryant.

      Bryant smiles and laughs in relief.

                                  BRYANT (to Guerin)
                    You had me scared.
                            (admiring the cake)
                    This is very sweet. Thank you. All of you.

      She blows out the candles. Everyone APPLAUDS. The 
      technician sets the cake down on a table as Bryant picks up 
      a spatula.

                                  BRYANT
                    Here goes my diet.

      She begins slicing the cake.

                                  GUERIN
                    Miss Bryant, we have the best birthday gift 
                    you can imagine.
                            (re: Technician)
                    They found a way to replicate the bacteria 
                    twice as quickly. We'll be ready to spray 
                    in two days.                                  BRYANT
                    That's wonderful.
                            (handing him a piece of 
                            cake)
                    Tell me about the Franciscos -- I hear 
                    they're still alive.

                                  GUERIN
                    Only because they're on life support.
                            (taking a bite)
                    You can't put two hundred and fifty 
                    thousand slags on life support.

                                  BRYANT
                    What about the investigation into Parris's 
                    murder?

                                  GUERIN

                    Here's the man to ask.

      She turns to see the police bomb squad tech, Max Julian.

                                  MAX
                    Happy birthday, Miss Bryant.
                            (beat)
                    I'm part of the investigation -- we don't 
                    have a thing to worry about.
                            (re: cake)
                    Can I have the flower?

      INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

      School is over - just a few students linger in the hallway. 
      A janitor sweeps the floor with a broom. Carrying Vessna in 
      her snuggly, Buck enters and heads toward a classroom. He 
      is spotted by principal Fisher, who intercepts him.

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco...

      Without pausing, Buck acknowledges the Principal, his 
      enemy, with a nod.

                                  FISHER (louder)
                    Mr Francisco.

      Sighing, Buck pauses. The Principal motions Buck over.

                                  FISHER
                    I was sorry to hear about your family. How 
                    are they?

                                  BUCK
                    Nobody knows.

      Fisher leans in to peer at Vessna.

                                  FISHER
                    Is this your little sister?

      Vessna responds with an irritable howl.

                                  FISHER (backing away)
                    She's very pretty.

                                  BUCK
                    I gotta go.

                                  FISHER
                    If you're picking up your assignments, I 
                    have them in my office.                                  BUCK
                    I'll get them from...
                            (being discreet)
                    ...Ms. Houston.

                                  FISHER
                    Ms. Houston isn't here. She elected to 
                    transfer schools.

                                  BUCK
                    She wouldn't go - She wouldn't go without 
                    telling me.

                                  FISHER
                    I think she's somewhere in the bay area.

                                  BUCK
                    I don't believe you.

                                  FISHER (indicating)
                    You're welcome to see for yourself.

                                  BUCK
                            (beat)
                    You did this. You made her go.

                                  FISHER
                    I thought it was in everyone's best 
                    interest yes.

                                  BUCK
                    You blackmailed her. Marilyn told me.

                                  FISHER
                    MS. HOUSTON'S relationship with you was at 
                    best, inappropriate.

                                  BUCK
                      Inappropriate - yeah! That's right! Any 
                      relationship with you terts is 
                      inappropriate.

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco. I won't have that kind of 
                    language.                                  BUCK
                    Terts? You don't like the word terts? My 
                    mother and sister are dying because of you 
                    terts!

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco, you are still under 
                      probation.

                                  BUCK
                    We could all be dead soon - what do I care 
                    about your probation!?

      He starts to walk off, comforting Vessna with CLICKS.

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco - come back here and get your 
                      assignments!

      Ignoring him, Buck continues off.

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco!

      Buck is gone.

      INT. POLICE STATION ROOM - DAY

      Entering Sikes moves to Zepeda at her desk. She throws up 
      her hands.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Nothing but dead ends. Nobody's missing any 
                    Kentex - I've gone through Max's entire 
                    list of local companies.

      At that moment, Max approaches.

                                    hearing aid)
                    When are you going to learn?

                                  MAX (handing Zepeda a paper)
                    Here are some out of state companies you 
                    can try.

                                  ZEPEDA (sighs)
                    It's gonna take some time.

                                  MAX (concerned)
                    How's George holding up?

                                  SIKES
                    'Bout like you'd expect.

                                  MAX
                    Give him my best.

      Sikes nods as Max exits. Weary, Sikes sits on the edge of 
      Zepeda's desk. Looking around, he realises there are no 
      Newcomers in the room. Zepeda notices him staring.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    I know - no Newcomers. It's wired.
                            (off Sikes look)
                    None of 'em came into work today. It's even 
                    in the papers.

      She hands Sikes a newspaper. One of the headlines reads: 
      NEWCOMERS EXPERIENCE MASS DEPRESSION. Next to it, another 
      reads: MALATHION SPRAYING TO RESUME. (PRODUCTION NOTE: Do 
      not feature this second headline.)

      Sikes puts the newspaper down.

                                  SIKES
                    You know, I never thought I'd get used to 
                    them. Remember when they made George my 
                    partner? I wanted to move to Alaska.
                            (pauses: thinking)
                    I'm still not used to them. I mean, let's 
                    face it - they're weird. But to think of 
                    life without them...

                    I can't Zep.

      After a beat, something catches Zepeda's attention. She 
      indicates over Sikes' shoulder.

                    There's nothing I can do at the hospital.

                    Sure. As long as you feel up to it.

                    If you mean the "PAPAYELA", I will try to

                                  SIKES
                    Okay. We traced all the calls that went in 
                    and out of Parris' boat phone - nothing. 
                    There's one guy - Floyd Norall - Knew 
                    Parris - has a boat slip next to him. The 
                    harbour master confirmed Norell and his 
                    wife were out sailing the day Parris was 
                    killed - I thought I'd go talk to him.

      They look at one another, remembering their argument over 
      George's going to the Marina.

                    No. We mostly talked about sailing -

      George cocks his head, listening to something.

                    the week.                                  GEORGE (to Sikes)
                    Parris' phone records showed no

      Norell. George taps his ear then points back at the boat.

      Susan sleeps. George stands at the foot of Emily's bed with

                                  EMILY
                    No.
                          (to her father)
                    Is mum going to be all right?

                                  GEORGE
                    Of course she is.

                    You must be hungry

      Emily nods.

                                  GEORGE
                    What would you like - you can have anything 
                    you want.

                                  EMILY
                    Anything?

                    Snout... earwigs... a frosty marrow

                    You love earwigs.

                                  EMILY
                    I used to...

                    ...I don't want to eat animals anymore.

      George looks curiously at his daughter. Finishing, Cathy         straightens.

                                  CATHY (RE: BLOOD SAMPLE)
                    I need to get this to my lab.

                    Bye, Emily.

      George follows Cathy out. Donning a double diaphragm 
      Newcomer stethoscope, Dr Quinn bends down to listen to 
      Emily's hearts.

                    Norell and his wife weren't on the boat, so

                    I want back-up.

      EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

      Two unmarked police cars and a black and white pull 
      silently up. Sikes and George get out of the first car, 
      followed by Zepeda and her partner. Two uniformed cops get 
      out of the black and white. All draw their guns. Sikes 
      signals Zepeda and her partner to take the back while he 
      and George go in the front. The uniformed cops remain 
      outside.

      Sikes and George flank the front door. George gives Sikes a 
      nod. Testing the door, Sikes finds it open. He and George 
      exchange a look, then cautiously enter.

      INT. WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

      The same corridor through which Guerin led Darlene Bryant. 
      Sikes and George move stealthily toward the lab door. Sikes 
      turns to George, taping his ear. George shakes his head - 
      no, he doesn't hear anything. Sikes tries the door - it, 
      too, is open. He and George burst into:

      LAB

      Empty, save for the larger lab equipment. Sikes and George 
      scan the room, which has clearly been evacuated in a hurry.

                    They left in a hurry.

      A NOISE attracts their attention. They turn, guns drawn, 
      but it is only Zepeda and her partner.

      Something on the floor catches Sikes' attention. He motions 
      George away.

      George freezes. Sikes points to A BEAKER broken on the 
      floor in a pool of viscous liquid. Sikes approaches the 
      pool to take a sample.

      They turn to see Zepeda standing over a desk, holding an 
        aeronautical chart.

      Susan appears comatose. A rabbit snuggles at her feet.

                    found probably means they intend an aerial 
                    spraying of L.A. We're having all private

                    go.

      He and Sikes start off.

      EXT. OCEANSIDE TRAILER PARK - DAY

      Sikes and George's car pulls up outside an old funky 
      trailer.

      INSIDE THE TRAILER

      Max Julian looking out the kitchen window, sees George and 
      Sikes get out of their car. Moving from the window, he 
      opens a cabinet.

      INSIDE THE CABINET

      A timer wired to plastique, Max sets the digital display 
      for three minutes. Max grabs an onion and hurriedly 
      chopping it.

      OUTSIDE

      Sikes and George approach the trailer.

      INSIDE

      Max pours olive oil into a heating skillet. There's a KNOCK       at the door.

                                  SIKES (O.S.)
                    Max?

                                  MAX
                    Hold on!

      Hurriedly throwing the onions into the skillet, he gives 
      them a turn with a spatula.

                                  MAX
                    I'm coming.

      The onions SIZZLE as Max goes to open the door.

                                  MAX (cheery)
                    Hey, guys, I'm off duty. Hope this is a 
                    social call.

      Sikes and George step into the trailer.

                                  SIKES
                    It's not.

      George recoils from the smell of onions.

                                  MAX (noticing)
                    Sorry, I'm making spaghetti sauce.
                          (to Sikes)

                    Max, somebody tipped off our warehouse

                            (touching his hearing aid)

                    You heard me. And you're not going 
                    anywhere.

      Max checks his watch, considering what to do next.

                                  GEORGE
                    The Kentex that killed Parris came from a

                                  MAX (aghast)
                    What? Hey, look, don't tell anybody until I 
                    recheck my data - I gotta reputation,

      George sniffs the air, puzzled. Noticing, Max moves to the 
      stove and stirs the onions.

      Again George sniffs the air.

                                  GEORGE (to himself)
                    Shoe polish?

                                  MAX
                    Maybe I should add some garlic.

      He reaches for some as George sniffs again.

                                  GEORGE (realising)
                    He's cooking to cover the odour - nitro 
                    benzene - there's plastique in here.

      George grabs the skillet and hurls it out the window. 
      Sniffing the air, he rushes to the cabinet and yanks it 
      open.

      HIS POV

      The timer is down to nine seconds.

      RESUME SCENE

      Sikes and George grab Max. Struggling, they heave him 
      through the door, then jump out after him.      OUTSIDE

      Sikes and George drag Max away from the trailer.

      The trailer EXPLODES behind them. Sikes and George hit the 
      ground with Max as debris flies over them. The TRAILER is 
      an inferno. Sikes and George safe, shield themselves and 
      Max from the heat.

      Max Julian sits handcuffed at Sikes' desk. Sikes and George 
      stand over him. A uniformed cop waits to take Max to lock-

      The cop pulls Max to his feet.

                    You're not going to stop us. It's too late.

      The cop leads Max out. Dazed, George rubs his temples with

      EXT. AIRFIELD - NIGHT

      Just outside the gated airfield, Darlene Bryant stands by 
      her limousine with Marc Guerin who wears a flight jacket. 
      Her bodyguard/driver stands a few feet away.

                                  BRYANT
                    Someday, Marc, when the world comes to its 
                    senses, humankind will honour what you're 
                    about to do.

      Marc humbly bows his head.

                                  BRYANT
                    God be with you.

      She kisses him on each cheek, then nods to her driver. He 
      opens the door for her. She gets in, and they dive off.

      TRACKING - GUERIN as he enters the airfield and crosses to 
      his helicopter. Two technicians from the warehouse 
      laboratory are hurriedly replacing Malathion canisters with 
      those holding bacteria. Guerin begins his pre-flight check.

                                  MAN'S VOICE
                    Marc! Hey, Marc!

      Guerin turns to see his supervisor jogging toward the       helicopter.

                                  SUPERVISOR (RE: TECHNICIANS)
                    What are they doing?

                    Something else -- this came from LAPD.

                                  GUERIN (grins)
                    Okay by me -- 'Long as I get paid.

                    Casey's.

      Turning he jogs away. The technicians look at Guerin.

                                  GUERIN
                    Go.

      The technicians back off and away as Guerin climbs into the 
      cockpit.

      INSIDE THE CHOPPER

      Guerin checks his oil pressure and sets his altimeter. He 
      turns the ignition switch. THE CHOPPER SPUTTERS to life, 
      its blades starting to rotate. Behind it, Sikes and 
      George's car ROARS onto the airfield.

      INSIDE THE CHOPPER

      Guerin sees the car heading toward him. It circles in front 
      of the chopper, SCREECHING to a stop. Sikes and George leap 
      from the car as the chopper's blades reach lift-off speed. 
      Sikes and George raise their guns.                                  SIKES
                    Police! Halt!

      ON GUERIN

      Sikes' command is inaudible above the chopper's DIN, but 
      the intent is clear. Pulling a gun, Guerin FIRES at the 
      officers. Then he pushes on the stick. Sikes and George 
      dive for the tarmac, returning FIRE as the chopper begins 
      to rise.

      Guerin wounded, drops his gun. Grimacing, he continues to 
      push forward on the stick. The chopper turning, continues 
      to rise. Jumping up, George grabs hold of the strut, 
      lifting himself.

                                  SIKES
                    George!

      Guerin feeling the drag, looks behind and sees George. He 
      hits a lever and THE CANISTERS spew the deadly bacteria. 
      George catches the spray full in the face.

      CLOSE - Sikes reacts with horror.

      WIDE - George drops twenty feet to the tarmac. Sikes 
      empties his gun as the chopper gains altitude.

      The CHOPPER, it's fuel line hit, EXPLODES.

      Sikes rushes to shield George with his body. Flaming debris 
      falls around them.

                                  GEORGE (weak)

      They struggle back toward the car.

      INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

      George has been given Emily's bed next to Susan. Sikes 
      watches Dr Quinn examine George while Cathy draws a blood 
      sample.

                                  GEORGE (opening his eyes)

      Sikes moves to his side.

      George looks over at his wife.

      George starts to close his eyes.

      George opens his eyes and looks at Sikes.

                    My friend... my dear friend...

      He drops into unconsciousness. Cathy finishes taking 
      George's blood sample. She and Dr Quinn move to the corner 
      to confer. Sikes follows them.

                    going through "NEESTAS"! Puberty! She's 
                    going through puberty.

      Cathy, followed by Quinn, rushes off, leaving Sikes still 
      trying to figure it out.

      INT SECURITY WING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Emily sits next to Buck who holds Vessna. They wait 
      anxiously. Sikes paces in front of them.

      Buck puts a free arm around her.

      Glancing at her. Sikes reads Lorraine's subtext: "I've been 
      worried about US." He looks down at the plant, discovering 
      a dead leaf.

      Lorraine gazes at him, nods, then walks away. Sikes picks

      Cathy injects George with her serum. Dr Quinn, Sikes,

      Susan's temperature rise also triggers an ALARM. George's

      Not knowing what to think, Sikes turns and leaves.
