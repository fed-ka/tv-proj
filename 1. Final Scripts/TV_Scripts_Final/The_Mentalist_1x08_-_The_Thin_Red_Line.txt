      EXT. DAVIS MOTOR INN. PARKING LOT - NIGHT (N/1)11

      It s a Midwestern town of Friday night football and the 4H 
      club, Applebee s and Wal-Mart.  But we find ourselves at an 
      outdated stucco motel that sits nestled along a bad ass 
      stretch of bars, cheap apartment buildings, used car lots, 
      and liquor stores off Highway 80 outside Davis, California.  
      ANGLE ON: A POLICE CRUISER skids to a stop in the parking 
      lot.  Davis County Police Officer, SAM BLAKELY (22), climbs 
      out of his vehicle as the frazzled motel MANAGER approaches.

                                    MANAGER
                    There was screaming, then gunshots.  
                    Upstairs.  Room 222.

      EXT. DAVIS MOTOR INN. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER22

      The Manager peers around a corner, watching Sam Blakely climb 
      the stairs, pulling his gun as he nears the room.  He 
      hesitates.  Looks terrified.  He bangs on the door.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    POLICE!  OPEN UP!

      Nothing.  Sam tests the door.  Unlocked.  He opens it 
      carefully.  Lights are off.  Shades drawn.  In the shadows, 
      TWO BODIES, a man and a young woman, brutally shot to death, 
      lying in a pool of blood.  

      EXT. DAVIS MOTOR INN. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING (D/2)33

      JANE, LISBON, VAN PELT and MINELLI climb the motel stairs to 
      Room 222, entering past UNIFORM COPS on the door.

                                    MINELLI
                    We have a young female, Patrice 
                    Matigan, and Joseph Purcell, who 
                    was going to be the star witness in 
                      California Versus Carris...

      INT. DAVIS MOTOR INN. ROOM 222 - CONTINUOUS44

                                    MINELLI
                    Which was one of the Attorney 
                    General s favorite upcoming 
                    narcotics cases...

      JANE S POV:  A motel kitchenette room in which an untidy man 
      has been living for at least a few weeks.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     2.

      CONTINUED:44

      JOE PURCELL S a handsome white male, late 20 s, with a thin 
      wiry frame, sinewy arms with several little scabs like 
      mosquito bites scratched raw.  He has a PISTOL still clutched 
      in one hand.  There s a bullet-hole in his forehead.

      PATRICE MATIGAN is a baby-faced twenty-year-old in jeans, 
      sneakers and a T-shirt.  A hoop pierces her lip and a dyed 
      streak of red hair runs across her bangs.  A keyring in her 
      open hand.  Shot through the heart. 

      A bag of spilled groceries lies between them.  

      Clothes are draped about the place, there s a CD player and 
      speakers set up, plates of half-eaten food.  A bag of white 
      powder on a counter.  A plastic scoop.  Another gun.  A 
      hunting knife.  Over in the corner, Jane notices an electric 
      kettle, a baby s bottle.

                                  LISBON
                    State s witness and no police 
                      protection?

                                    MINELLI
                    Davis PD had it covered.  That is 
                    until Purcell went awol a few weeks 
                    ago.  Didn t want to testify I 
                    guess.
                          (beat)
                    With Purcell dead, the case against 
                    Carris dies too. He walks.   
                    So obviously guys, for all our 
                    sakes, this is a must close.    
                    Davis PD is still running the 
                    Carris case so we have to work with 
                    them by the way.  Don t freeze  em 
                    out.

                                  LISBON 
                    Who is Carris and where s he or she 
                    at right now?

                                    MINELLI
                    Rick Carris is the man to know in 
                    the Davis County meth business.
                    Busted last month after a big 
                    expensive operation.  Out and about 
                    on a two million dollar bond.    
                    Purcell here was one of his top 
                    street captains.  Look at that.
                          (off the bag of white 
                            powder)

                                  MINELLI (CONT'D)
                    This fool is State s witness 
                    against the biggest cocaine dealer 
                    in the county and he s selling the 
                    same drug out of his own motel 
                    room.  Like Carris wouldn t hear 
                    about it.  Must ve had a death 
                    wish.

      Jane has seen a different picture.

                                  JANE 
                    That s not cocaine.

      Lisbon dips her finger into the powder to test it.  At the 
      same time, Jane takes the keys out of Patrice s hand and 
      exits the room.  Van Pelt catches this and follows.

                                  LISBON 
                    Powdered milk.

                                    MINELLI
                    Yes, that s often used to cut the 
                    product.  

                                  LISBON
                    Jane?

      Puzzled, Lisbon follows Jane.  Off Minelli s puzzlement...

      EXT. MOTEL BALCONY - CONTINUOUS55

      Jane scans the motel s forecourt and the street, and the back 
      alley behind the place.  Lisbon steps out.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What are you looking for?

                                  JANE
                    The girl had her keys in her hand.  
                    She was only planning on stopping 
                    by.

      Jane sees what he s looking for and hurries away.  Minelli 
      exits Room 222 in time to look puzzled again, as Lisbon and 
      Van Pelt follow Jane.

66EXT. DAVIS MOTOR INN. PARKING LOT - DAY 

      Jane crosses the lot to an early nineties hatchback.        
      He opens the door with Patrice s key.  






                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     4.

      CONTINUED:66

      There s a pack of diapers on the front passenger seat, which 
      he folds forward to reveal, strapped into her carseat -- a 
      BABY GIRL OF ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OLD.  She smiles and gurgles 
      happily at sight of Jane. 


                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. DAVIS MOTOR INN. FORECOURT - DAY (D/2 CONT D)77

      Jane holding the baby girl.  Van Pelt trying to make her 
      smile.  Lisbon and a SOCIAL SERVICES LADY waiting.  In BG a 
      pair of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES confer with Minelli.  

                                  JANE
                    What happens to her?

                                  LISBON 
                    Social Services has foster moms who 
                      specialize in babies.  She ll be 
                    okay until they find Patrice s 
                    family.   

                                  JANE
                    If she has family.

      Van Pelt looks to Lisbon at this.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.

        Reluctantly, Jane hands the baby to the Social Services lady.   
      Everyone stops to watch the baby be taken away, crying as she 
      goes. 

      Also watching the baby go is Minelli, accompanied by  
      DETECTIVE BLAKELY and DETECTIVE PRECIADO of the Davis PD.  
      (Both 40 s), Blakely is a big, sad, bullish man.  Preciado, 
      an intense skinny triathlete type.  Both in classic cop 
      business suits.   

      They approach Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt. 

                                    MINELLI
                    Lisbon, Jane, Van Pelt, Detectives 
                    Blakely and Preciado, Davis 
                    Homicide.  They ll be your liaisons 
                    with the Davis PD.  I speak for 
                    myself and your Chief when I urge 
                    you to work harmoniously.   

      Nods and appraising glances all around.

                                    MINELLI (CONT D)
                    Keep me posted.

      Minelli gets in the passenger seat of his car and is driven 
      away.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     6.

                                  JANE
                    Blakely s your name?  The first 
                    responder was a Blakely.

                                    BLAKELY
                    My son.  

                                  PRECIADO
                    Poor kid.  First time coming up on 
                    a body.  Puked his guts up later.

                                    BLAKELY
                          (dismissing the subject)
                    He ll be okay.  Listen, just so 
                    we re clear.  You can call us 
                    liaisons if you like, but this is a 
                    Davis PD case.  Our narcotics unit 
                    has been trying to bust Rick Carris 
                    for years. 

      Lisbon ignores Blakely s rudeness, seeking harmony.

                                  LISBON
                      I appreciate your position. 
                    Has anyone checked the liquor store 
                    there?  For security cameras?     

      QUICK ANGLE ON - A LIQUOR STORE near the entrance to the 
      motel.

                                  PRECIADO
                    Not yet.

      Lisbon nods to Van Pelt.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I ll get on it. 

      Van Pelt peels off.

                                  JANE
                    So, dumb question, how come you let 
                    Purcell slip away?  

      Lisbon gives Jane a cool it look.

                                  LISBON
                    Stuff happens, right?

                                  PRECIADO
                          (a serious glare at Jane)
                    Yeah.  Stuff happens.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     6A.

                    You re confident it s Carris who 
                    did this?  Purcell looks like the

                    start the investigation.  She was

                    So I figured she had a rich

1212EXT. RUNDOWN DUPLEX - DAY 

      Rigsby and Cho are putting on kevlar vests when Blakely and 
      Preciado come striding by with two GOONISH UNIFORMED COPS 
      armored up and carrying shotguns. 

                                  RIGSBY

                    Wait.   

        Reluctantly, Blakely and Preciado pause.

                                  PRECIADO
                    What?  You want to help or you want 
                    to stand there and pick your nose?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Come on guys, play nice.  This is a

                    together, when our boss and the

                    This is our arrest.  Always has 
                    been.  We got no time to wait for 
                    your mommy.

      Rigsby glowers and Cho steps in to stop him from going 
      ballistic.

                                  CHO
                          (very calm)
                    There s always time.  Let s do this 
                    right.  Go in too quickly, and 
                    someone will get hurt.

                                  PRECIADO
                    This is real police work, sonny.  
                    People get hurt.  Go push some 
                    paper.  

      Blakely and Preciado push past Rigsby and stride toward the 
      duplex with the other two Davis PD Cops close behind.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Real police work?  You mean like 
                      protecting a State s witness?

      Preciado turns back to Rigsby; coming right at him.  Rigsby 
      makes a move toward him, and Cho has to physically grab hold 
      and haul him to a stop.

                                  CHO
                    -- Rigsby!  Walk away.  Look at me!  
                    Walk away.  We told them not to go 
                    in.  This goes South now, it s 
                    their necks.  We don t want to be 
                    involved in any way.    
                          (beat)
                    Be smart.  Leave it. 

      Right then, Lisbon and Jane pull up in a CBI car.  Lisbon 
      comes hustling over when she sees Blakely et al already 
      entering the duplex grounds...

                                  LISBON
                    What s going on?  What are they 
                    doing?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Blakely and Preciado refused to 
                    wait for the entry team.  We tried 
                    to stop them.  They wouldn t 
                    listen.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     15.

                    They re out for blood.

      Lisbon starts to go after Blakely, but fifty yards ahead, 
      Blakely and his crew are at the duplex door, kicking it in 
      and rushing inside.  GUNSHOTS ring out.

      Seconds later RICK CARRIS makes a run for it after bursting 
      through a back door.  He takes out an out-of-shape Davis PD 
      Officer.  Blakely and Preciado are after him, but Carris is 
      fast, breezing through an open fence as they struggle to keep 
      up.

      Jane looks up to see Carris and his pursuers heading right 
      toward him.

      JANE S POV: A gate in the side of the yard swings open in the 
      breeze.  A large stone sits on the ground nearby, remnants of 
        a half-finished construction job.

      Jane heads over, nonchalantly sliding the stone just a few 
      inches over so it now wedges in front of the gate, blocking 
      it.  Then he stands back to watch.

      Davis PD s running after Carris, guns drawn.  Lisbon s 
      yelling for Carris to stop.  Carris nears the fence, headed 
      for the street.  But instead of flying through the gate, he 
      smashes into it hard, knocking himself onto the concrete.

      Lisbon, Rigsby and Cho jump in to make the arrest.  As Lisbon 
      pulls Carris up off the ground, Jane walks over and casually 
      moves the stone back into place.

      The CBI team are around Carris before Blakely, Preciado and 
      their men get there.  Lions robbed of their kill.

                                  PRECIADO
                    That s our bust.  Hand him over.

                    The hell we will.  Walk away. 

        A stand-off.  Blakely pulls Preciado away.  Lisbon and the 
      team lead away their prize capture. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                    So Carris was at Del s Tavern.  
                    Sasha the cocktail waitress says 
                    she was with him at his residence 
                    at 12:45 AM when the motel 
                    shootings took place.

                    She s confident about the time 
                    frame because they were having sex 
                    with the TV on and it was the 
                    Scottish guy talking to that 
                    actress who married the country 
                    singer.

                    Carris would ve had someone else do 
                    the dirty work anyhow.  He was only 
                    boasting about how he d rip 
                    Purcell s heart out himself. 
                    He s a drug dealer, not an Aztec.

      edge of a glass.  Without looking up.

                                  JANE
                    Very good.  Not an Aztec.  
                    That s right.  Carris isn t 
                      responsible for these murders. 

                                  CHO

                    Carris told you himself.  This is 
                    not his style.  He wouldn t have

                    follow Patrice until she led him to 
                    Purcell.  If Carris had found her, 
                    he would have just jumped right in 
                    and hurt her until she gave up 
                    Purcell.

                    My colleague is on his way. 

      Jane enters eating a big sandwich.

                          (cheerily)
                    Hi.

      He puts down the sandwich and offers his hand to Preciado.  
      Preciado had been on his guard, but distracted by the simple 
      expedient of a sandwich, he lets Jane take his hand in both 
      of his.

                    Cop to cop.  We know you were 
                    giving her money.  We know she got 
                    off a meth bust last Christmas.  
                    The evidence was lost, right?  From

                    Yes.  And we can dig in and prove 
                    it, I m sure.  But I don t want to 
                    spend any time doing that.  I d 
                    rather just talk straight with you.

                    We figure you and Patrice were 
                    having a sexual relationship.   

                                  PRECIADO
                    She was, she was a confidential 
                      informant.  

                                  LISBON
                    We considered that.  But then she d 
                    be on file, wouldn t she?  You d 
                    have put in for the money as a CI 
                    expense.  But you didn t do that. 
                    Why not?  My guess, because you re 
                    an honest man.

                                  PRECIADO
                    We had a business relationship.  
                    I paid her for sex.  I don t know 
                    or care what she did when I wasn t 
                    there.

                                  LISBON
                    You paid her a lot of money.  
                    A lot.  A good looking man like 
                    you?  It must have been more than 
                    that.  Did she have something on 
                    you?  

                                  PRECIADO

                    Last Thanksgiving, when you said 
                    you were going back East to your 
                    brother s house.  I knew you 
                    actually planned to spend three 
                    days home alone, watching old 
                    movies and eating ice cream.

                    Thready.

                                  JANE
                    Hard to describe pulses, but a 
                    dishonest pulse feels different 
                    than an indignant pulse.  In this 
                    case, hard to say what he was lying 
                    about exactly.  He was signalling 
                    deception from first to last.  
                    There s something off about his 
                    whole story.

      Jane approaches the front door of the house in a suburban cop

      cars and boats and other motorized leisure craft in the 
      driveways.

      Sam Blakely -- in unbuttoned police uniform -- answers the 
      door to Jane.  He looks like he s still in shock.

                    He s done nothing.  Your father...

      She sits down, head in hands.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    My father what?  
                          (to Jane)
                    What did you tell her?  

      Off this, Katherine looks up at Sam with sudden new insight.

                                  KATHERINE
                    You knew.  You knew that s who she 
                    was, didn t you?  That s why you 
                    and him have been whispering in 
                    corners and acting so strange.  

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                          (anguished)
                    Mom, no.  You have it wrong.  You 
                    don t understand.  Dad wasn t 
                    cheating on you...

      The SCREECH OF BRAKES makes all turn, and takes us to:

      EXT. BLAKELY S HOUSE - DAY2828

      Blakely gets out of his car and storms toward his front door.

      He s met by Sam coming out the front door...

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    Dad, Mom thinks...

      Katherine comes out of the house, upset and betrayed and 
      furious all at once.  Followed closely by Jane.

                    him for assault.  We get to ask him

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY (D/3 CONT D)2929

      Rigsby and Van Pelt enter flanking Dale Blakely, and lead him 
      toward the INTERROGATION ROOM.  Watched by Minelli and 
      Lisbon.

                                    MINELLI
                    Now we re arresting them.  Hooray.

                                  LISBON
                    We have the right.  He assaulted 
                    Jane.  And he looks good for the 
                    murders.  

      Minelli sighs.

                                    MINELLI
                    Before you charge a cop with 
                    murder, he better look better than 
                    good.  He better look like the damn 
                    Mona Lisa.

                          (cutting her off)
                    Because if you re wrong, we ll have 
                    no murder suspect.  The Attorney 
                    General will have no narcotics case 
                    against Carris.  And we ll have

                    thousand bucks a month.  That s a

                    But how on earth were you making

                    So I guess if Patrice started 
                    asking you for more money, you d 
                    have been hard pressed, right?

      Blakely restrains himself.

                                    BLAKELY
                    I want a lawyer.

      Cho rises.

      Jane and Lisbon watch Blakely, who stares bleakly at the 
      glass, like a condemned man.

                    another bed, or on the floor if 
                    they like?  

      Van Pelt comes to the door.

                    Sam Blakely s here.

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY3232

      Sam Blakely is waiting, in Davis PD uniform, looking very 
      unhappy.

      Rigsby, smiling and laughing, walks by with Rick Carris, 
      offering him a stick of gum as they go.  Sam watches puzzled.  

      A beat later, Lisbon, Jane and Van Pelt appear.

                                  LISBON

      Van Pelt zips through A GRAINY SURVEILLANCE TAPE on a 
      COMPUTER SCREEN.  It s shot at night and it shows the ALLEY 
      behind a LIQUOR STORE and the DAVIS MOTOR INN PARKING LOT in 
      the BG.

                                  LISBON 
                    This is from the security camera at 
                    the liquor store in front of the 
                    motel.  We finally got to look at 
                    it today.  

      ONSCREEN at high-speed, cars and people coming and going.  
      Van Pelt switches to normal speed.

                    This is 12:40 AM.  That s Patrice 
                    Matigan. 

      Patrice Matigan s hatchback pulls into the motel entrance and 
      goes out of sight when she parks.  Then we see her walk 
      across frame headed toward the stairs to room 222, both just 
      out of view.  (What we don t see is the little jump cut in 
      the tape.)  Then, a SMALL ND CAR pulls into the motel 
      entrance. 

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    And that is Rick Carris  man.  

      The ND CAR parks in view in the motel entrance.

                                  JANE
                    We misjudged Carris.  He found 
                    Patrice, and had a man follow her.  
                    Watch now.  

      A MAN IN SUNGLASSES -- far too grainy and small to tell who 
      he is -- gets out of the ND Car and walks toward the stairs 
      to room 222 and out of view.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     43.

      ONSCREEN: A PASSER-BY outside the motel seems to duck 
      instinctively as if at the sound of Jane s pretend gunshots 
      then exits frame.

      Then the man in sunglasses reappears, runs back to his car, 
      gets in and makes a quick exit. 

                                  SAM BLAKELY

                    says Q-Tip was there to kill Joe,
                    but he got there too late.  Someone 
                    else got to him first.

                    Carris says his man Q-Tip saw who 
                    actually killed Joe and Patrice.  
                    Saw the whole thing.  So Carris is 
                    offering us a deal.  If we let him 
                    out, his man Q-Tip will tell us 
                    exactly what he saw, and ID the 
                    real killer.

                    Of course not.  It s a transparent 
                    con.  Q-Tip killed Joe and Patrice 
                    alright.  Carris is trying to save 
                    his skin by laying the blame 
                      elsewhere.

      silently toward Q-Tip s car.

      He comes up on the driver s side and without hesitation,  
      FIRES SEVERAL ROUNDS through the window at Q-Tip; instantly 
        obliterating him.  Sam peers into the car to make sure the

                    Facts.  Okay.  Mom suspected that 
                    Dad was having an affair.  He was 
                    spending too much money, and acting 
                    strange.  I said no way.  My dad?  
                    Cheat?  Never.  She said that one 
                    time a long time ago he already 
                    did.  So why not again.  I asked 
                    around on the street, and pretty 
                    soon I hear he s keeping this girl 
                    Patrice Matigan on the side.  I was

                    went and I asked him if it was 
                    true, and he said no.  I knew he 
                    was lying.  Knew it.  But when I 
                    went to talk to Patrice Matigan, 
                    she d disappeared.  Then last week

                    I thought for sure she was going to 
                    meet Dad.  
                          (laughs bitterly)
                      I thought, ah-ha!  I got him now.  

      EXT. MOTEL BALCONY - NIGHT5252

      Sam creeps stealthily along the balcony to Room 222.  The 
      door s open, people are talking inside.  Sam girds himself 
      for an emotional scene and shoves the door open.

      INT. DAVIS MOTOR INN. ROOM 222 - CONTINUOUS5353

      Patrice and Joe turn in alarm at the entry of Sam.  
      Instinctively Joe goes for his gun.  Seeing that, Sam goes 
      for his gun, too.  Patrice yells NOOO!  But too late.  
      BLAMABAMA BLAMALAM!!!  A BRIEF STORM OF GUNFIRE.  

      Sam finds himself standing in a roomful of smoke, two bodies 
      on the floor.

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - NIGHT5454

      RESUME SCENE: 

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                          (reliving it)
                      I panicked.  Drove away.  Then 
                    dispatch called.  Sent me right 
                    back to the motel.  I was the 
                    closest unit.  What could I do?  
                    Refuse the call?  I had to take it. 

      Sam Blakely breaks down in tears.  He can t go on.  Deep 
      horrible tragic pain is wracking him.  Blakely takes his 
      son s hand.

                                  JANE
                    Patrice wasn t your mistress, was 
                    she?   

                                    BLAKELY
                          (calmly)
                    No.  She was my daughter.   

      Sam knows this already, but just hearing the words still 
      hurts him.  Blakely pats his son s hand serenely, as if 
      beyond pain.

                                    BLAKELY (CONT D)
                    How did you know?

                    Sam told his mother you weren t 
                    cheating on her.  And I believed 
                    him.  But then who was Patrice?  
                    She had to be your daughter.  Once 
                    I knew that everything else fell 
                    into place.

                                    BLAKELY
                    I didn t know Patrice existed until 
                    four years ago.  Her mother was 
                    dying, so she got in touch.

                    Told me I had a sixteen-year-old 
                    child I never knew about.  Blew my 
                    mind.  Blew my mind.  I wanted to 
                    tell Katherine the truth, but you 
                    know, my God.  I couldn t do it.  
                    Couldn t hurt her like that.    

                                  JANE
                    Have you told her now?

                                    BLAKELY
                    Yes.  She knows.  She knows. 

      On Jane and Lisbon looking at father and son...

      EXT. BLAKELY S HOUSE - DAY (D/4)5555

      A quiet weekday afternoon.  Lawn sprinklers hissing.     
      Jane s car pulls up outside the Blakely house. 

      INT. BLAKELY HOUSE - DAY5656

      Katherine sits at the kitchen table.  In a housecoat, her face 
      is a tearful mess.  As is the once pristine house.  An electric 
      kettle comes to the boil and switches off, but she ignores it.

      Blakely sits on a couch in the LIVING ROOM, gazing blankly at 
      KOREAN WOMEN S GOLF on the TV.  Has he been crying too?

      The DOORBELL RINGS.  They both ignore it.  Then someone 
      KNOCKS.  They re not going away.

      INT. FRONT DOOR. BLAKELY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS5757

      Katherine goes to the door...

                                  KATHERINE
                    Sorry.  Busy right now. 

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                      Katherine, it s Patrick Jane.  Open 
                    the door.

                                  KATHERINE
                    I can t.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    You can and you will.  I have 
                    something I need to give you.

      Katherine s curiosity defeats her despair.  She opens the front 
      door.  Jane stands there holding Patrice s baby girl, Kaylee.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     52.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    This is Kaylee, your granddaughter, 
                    kind of. 

      Jane hands the baby to Katherine who, perforce, takes her.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    She likes Cheerios and takes her 
                    big nap at four.     

                                  KATHERINE
                    What?  But...

      Blakely joins his wife at the door...

                                  JANE
                    You are all she has.  You have no 
                    choice.  Social Services will be along 
                    later to get the paperwork signed. 

                                  KATHERINE
                    But --

      Jane s walking backward down the front yard path.  

                                  JANE
                    -- The name Kaylee doesn t really 
                    suit her if you ask me.  But if you 
                    want to change it, I don t think 
                    anyone will make a fuss.  Goodbye 
                      Katherine.  Goodbye, Dale.

      Jane walks away.  Katherine and Blakely look at Kaylee and 
      Kaylee smiles back, and gurgles.  Katherine smiles.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
