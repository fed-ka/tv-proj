Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE
OTHER, bows.
THE OTHER (V.O.)
The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a
little world. A human world. They would
wield its power,...
CUT TO:
THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the
CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem
encircled with silver blades.
THE OTHER (V.O.)
But our ally knows its workings as they
never will. He is ready to lead. And
our force, our Chitauri, will follow.
HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a
seething mass of neat rows and columns....the ground simply
QUAKES.
THE OTHER (V.O.)
The world will be his. The universe
yours. And the humans, what can they do
but burn?
CUT TO:
Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
in.
CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.
Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is
SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.
Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.
NICK FURY
How bad is it?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.
Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:
AGENT PHIL COULSON
You're clear, sir! You need to go!
Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.
NICK FURY
Sound the general call. I want every
living soul not working rescue looking
for that brief case.
AGENT MARIA HILL
(WALKIE TALKIE)
Roger that.
NICK FURY
Coulson, get back to base. This is a
LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at
war.
A beat.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
(WALKIE TALKIE)
What do we do?
Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
hope.
THE AVENGERS
Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
GENERAL along with his THUGS.
TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.
LUCHKOV
This is not how I wanted the evening to
go.
NATASHA
I know how you wanted this evening to
go. Believe me, this is better.
LUCHKOV
I'd like to know why they sent you to
carry out a carrier, a stained glass
and other random items.
TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
open floor. Natasha is now scared.
NATASHA
I thought General Soholob was in charge
of the export business.
LUCHKOV
Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
Nothing but a pretty face.
NATASHA
You really think I'm pretty?
LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.
LUCHKOV
We do not need the Lermontov to
transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...
(IN ENGLISH)
You may have to write it down.
Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.
WEASELLY THUG
Ya?
(looks at LUCHKOV)
It's for you.
LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.
LUCHKOV
Who the hell is...
AGENT PHIL COULSON
You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
the woman on the phone or I will blow
up the block before you can make the
lobby.
HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
back.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
We need you to come in.
NATASHA
Are you kidding? I'm working!
AGENT PHIL COULSON
This takes precedence.
NATASHA
I'm in the middle of an interrogation
and this moron is giving me everything.
LUCHKOV
I don't give everything.
Natasha gives him a look.
NATASHA
Look, you can't pull me out of this
right now.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
A beat.
NATASHA
Let me put you on hold.
She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
KICKBOXING him in the face.
Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then
KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK
AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
and her heels, like a boss.
NATASHA
Where's Barton now?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
We don't know.
NATASHA
But he's alive.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back. But
first, we need you to talk to the big
guy.
NATASHA
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
No, I've got Stark. You get the big
guy.
NATASHA
Bozhe moi.
A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way
through.
Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of
town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local
government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.
Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
left standing there like a dumbass.
BANNER
Should have got paid up front, Banner.
Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
around, quietly.
NATASHA
You know, for a man who's supposed to
be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
of a place to settle.
BANNER
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
NATASHA
Then, what is it? Yoga?
BANNER
You brought me to the edge of the city,
smart. I uh... assume the whole place
is surrounded?
NATASHA
Just you and me.
BANNER
And your actress buddy, is she a spy
too? Do they start that young?
NATASHA
I did.
BANNER
Who are you?
NATASHA
Natasha Romanoff.
BANNER
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
Because that's not gonna work out for
everyone.
NATASHA
No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
behalf of SHIELD.
BANNER
SHIELD. How did they find me?
NATASHA
We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
our distance, even helped keep some
other interested parties off your
scent.
BANNER
Why?
NATASHA
Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
need you to come in.
BANNER
What if I said no?
NATASHA
I'll persuade you.
BANNER
And what if the... other guy says no?
NATASHA
You've been more than a year without an
incident. I don't think you wanna break
that streak.
BANNER
I don't always get what I want.
NATASHA
Doctor, we're facing a potential global
catastrophe.
BANNER
Well, those I actively try to avoid.
NATASHA
This is the Tesseract. It has the
potential energy to wipe out the
planet.
She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
takes a closer look.
BANNER
What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
it?
NATASHA
Well, he wants you to find it. It's
been taken. It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.
There's no one that knows gamma
radiation like you do. If there was,
that's where I'd be.
BANNER
So Fury isn't after the monster?
NATASHA
Not that he's told me.
BANNER
And he tells you everything?
NATASHA
Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
BANNER
He needs me in a cage?
NATASHA
No one's gonna put you in a...
BANNER
STOP LYING TO ME!
The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.
BANNER
I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
this the easy way, where you don't use
that, and the other guy doesn't make a
mess? Okay? Natasha...
Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
and speaks into her earpiece.
NATASHA
Stand down. We're good here.
Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack
outside.
Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,
gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.
STEVE (V.O.)
There's not enough time! I gotta put
her in the water!
...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
appears from the steps.
THE OTHER
The Chitauri grow restless.
LOKI
Let them go at themselves. I will lead
them into glorious battle.
THE OTHER
Battle? Against the meager might of
Earth?
LOKI
Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is
as formidable as you claim.
THE OTHER
You question us? You question HIM? He,
who put the scepter in your hand, who
gave you ancient knowledge and new
purpose when you were cast out,
defeated?
LOKI
I was a king! The rightful king of
Asgard! Betrayed!
THE OTHER
Your ambition is little, born of
childish need. We look beyond the Earth
to greater worlds the Tesseract will
unveil.
LOKI
You don't have the Tesseract yet.
THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
scepter.
LOKI
I don't threaten, but until I open the
doors, until your force is mine to
command, you are but words.
THE OTHER
You will have your war, Asgardian. If
you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
us, there will be no realm, no barren
moon, no crevice where he can't find
you. You think you know pain? He will
make you long for something as sweet as
pain.
THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.
The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
Natasha.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.
STEVE
Ma'am?
NATASHA
Hi.
(TO COULSON)
They need you on the bridge. Face time.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
See you there.
Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
towards the railing of the ship.
NATASHA
There was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice. I thought
Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
to sign his Captain America trading
cards yet?
STEVE
Trading cards?
NATASHA
They're vintage, he's very proud.
Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
hisway.
STEVE
Dr. Banner.
Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.
BANNER
Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
coming.
STEVE
Word is you can find the cube.
BANNER
Is that the only word on me?
STEVE
Only word I care about.
BANNER
(takes in the sentiment)
Must be strange for you, all of this.
STEVE
Well, this is actually kind of
familiar.
NATASHA
Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in
a minute. It's gonna get a little hard
to breath.
Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
"sail."
STEVE
Is this is a submarine?
BANNER
Really? They wanted me in a submerged
pressurized metal container?
They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE
LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN
VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.
BANNER
OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.
The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the
entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then
camouflages in the sky.
Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century
attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to
the entrance of the gala.
Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One
of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a
THWACK!
He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He
raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
scanner instrument.
Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the
head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on
screen.
The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a
cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.
As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes
in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no
hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.
LOKI
Kneel before me.
The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.
Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their
spears, encircling the crowd.
LOKI
I said. KNEEL!!!
Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing
his arms out, smiling.
LOKI
Is not this simpler? Is this not your
natural state? It's the unspoken truth
of humanity, that you crave
subjugation. The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy in a mad
scramble for power, for identity. You
were made to be ruled. In the end, you
will always kneel.
As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN
refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.
ELDER GERMAN MAN
Not to men like you.
LOKI
There are no men like me.
ELDER GERMAN MAN
There are always men like you.
LOKI
Look to your elder, people. Let him be
an example.
Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS
blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN
AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast
with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
You know, the last time I was in
Germany and saw a man standing above
everybody else, we ended up
disagreeing.
LOKI
(STANDING UP)
The soldier. A man out of time.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
I'm not the one who's out of time.
From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed
towards Loki.
NATASHA
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the
QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time
to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's
tip on his helmet.
LOKI
Kneel.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Not today!
Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and
FLIPS him over.
Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into
the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJLNIR.
He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is
angry to see him alive in this fashion.
THOR
Where is the Tesseract?
LOKI
(LAUGHS)
I missed you too.
THOR
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!
LOKI
Oh, you should thank me. With the
Bifrost gone how much dark energy did
the Allfather have to muster to conjure
you here? Your precious Earth.
Thor drops MJLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
Loki. His brother.
Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is
everything to a man or god.
THOR
I thought you dead.
LOKI
Did you mourn?
THOR
We all did. Our father...
LOKI
Your father. He did tell you my true
parentage, did he not?
Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even
bigger wedge between them.
THOR
We were raised together, we played
together, we fought together. Do you
remember none of that?
LOKI
(TURNS AROUND)
I remember a shadow. Living in the
shade of your greatness. I remember you
tossing me into an abyss. I was and
should be king!
THOR
So you take the world I love as
recompense for your imagined slights.
No, the Earth is under my protection,
Loki.
LOKI
(LAUGHS)
And you're doing a marvelous job with
that. The humans slaughter each other
in droves, while you idly threat. I
mean to rule them. And why should I
not?
THOR
You think yourself above them.
LOKI
Well, yes.
THOR
Then you miss the truth of ruling,
brother. Throne would suit you ill.
Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up
to the ledge. Turns around.
LOKI
I've seen worlds you've never known
about! I have grown, Odinson, in my
exile! I have seen the true power of
the Tesseract, and when I wield it...
THOR
Who showed you this power? Who controls
the would-be-king?
LOKI
I am a king!
THOR
Not here! You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream! You
come home.
LOKI
I don't have it. You need the cube to
bring me home, but I've sent it off I
know not where.
Mjlnir flies back to his grasp.
THOR
You listen well, brother. I...
THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN
MID-FLIGHT.
LOKI
I'm listening.
THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.
IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet
opens up.
THOR
Do not touch me again!
TONY
Then don't take my stuff.
THOR
You have no idea what you're dealing
with.
TONY
Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother
know you weareth her drapes?
THOR
This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
will face Asgardian justice!
TONY
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
Until then, stay out of my way...
tourist.
The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick
move, Thor pulls Mjlnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear
across into a tree.
INSIDE THE SUIT
TONY
Okay.
From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
his hand. Mjlnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!
Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjlnir to his hand, raises
it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points
the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting
increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.
INSIDE THE SUIT
JARVIS
Power at 400% capacity.
TONY
How about that?
IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his
knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON
MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.
The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING
him into the side of a mountain.
THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.
THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every
tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both
HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
him and SMASH him down hard.
Thor summons back Mjlnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on
top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Hey! That's enough!
(comes down; looks at Thor)
Now, I don't know what you plan on
doing here.
THOR
I've come here to put an end to Loki's
schemes!
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Then prove it! Put the hammer down.
IRON MAN
Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his
hammer!
THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJLNIR.
Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,
raises the hammer.
THOR
(TO CAP)
You want me to put the hammer down?
THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.
CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR
brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION
OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE
SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.
IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right
next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks
at both men.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Are we done here?
THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.
Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel
down into a corridor.
BARTON
Get that engine down! Detention! Get
him through the dark! Come with me.
Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.
Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall.
TONY
Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's
IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.
CAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to
portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire
extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do
anything.
Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN
OFF.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Stark, I'm here!
TONY
Good. See what we got.
Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged
engine.
INSIDE THE SUIT
Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and
its layouts.
TONY
I gotta get this super conducting
cooling system back online before I can
access the rotors and work on
dislodging the debris.
IRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve.
IRON MAN
I need you to get to that engine
control panel and tell me which relays
are in overload position.
IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA
JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN
AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a
man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!
IRON MAN
What's it look like in there?
CAPTAIN AMERICA
It seems to run on some form of
electricity.
IRON MAN
Well, you're not wrong.
IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine
engine. It's bad, but still fixable.
CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
The relays are intact. What's our next
move?
TONY
Even if I clear the rotors, this thing
won't re-engage without a jump. I'm
gonna have to get in there and push.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Well if that thing gets up to speed,
you'll get shredded!
TONY
Then stay in the control unit and
reverse polarity long enough to
disengage mag...
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Speak English!
TONY
See that red lever? It'll slow the
rotors down long enough for me to get
out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He
sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.
ESCORT 606'S jet BANKS to the right, heading towards the
shuttle.
ESCORT 606 PILOT slowly makes his way in. sees the action going
between Thor and the HULK.
ESCORT 606 PILOT
Target acquired. Target engaged.
(pulls the trigger; fires
guns at HULK)
A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for
cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He
jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...
ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.
ESCORT 606 PILOT
TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!
HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK
tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but
HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!
THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.
ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK
PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.
IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS
on it, relieving the rotors.
On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN
AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as
they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.
CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with
Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as
throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.
CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word
for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing
down at them.
IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.
NICK FURY (V.O.)
Stark, we're losing altitude.
IRON MAN
Yeah. Noticed.
The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S
BOOSTERS get more and more bright.
On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at
Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA
loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto
a LOOSE CABLE.
Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell
pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,
but misses. Land draws closer.
In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto
the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit
the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out
into the meadow.
IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE
ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS
itself.
INSIDE THE SUIT
TONY
Cap, I need the lever!
STEVE (V.O.)
I need a minute here!
TONY
Lever. Now!
Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is
then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the
rotors, getting chewed up.
CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the
railing.
BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself
up and finally PULLS the lever.
A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit
heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.
BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the
wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.
OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking
Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.
Thor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJLNIR.
Selvig works around the CMS device that has already been set-
upon the rooftop of Tony's tower.
Cap, Widow and Hawkeye walk towards and into the QUINJET. A
YOUNG SHIELD PILOT looks and stands in their way.
YOUNG SHIELD PILOT
You are not authorized to be here...
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Son... just don't.
IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS
device, holding the Tesseract.
JARVIS
Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The
device is already self-sustained.
TONY
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
SELVIG
It's too late! It can't stop now. He
wants to show us something! A new
universe.
IRON MAN
Okay.
IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy
from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls
backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK
TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.
JARVIS
The barrier is pure energy. It's
unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready
to be deployed.
TONY
Skip the spinning rims. We're on the
clock.
TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits
him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into
the penthouse.
Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into
the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up
ANOTHER PORTAL.
A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS
out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on
the end.
INSIDE THE SUIT
TONY
Right. Army.
IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a
miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the
JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no
missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN
flies towards the city.
The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at
the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes
BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.
AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF
BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF
EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.
Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings
out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.
Loki turns to his ENEMY.
THOR
Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll
destroy it!
LOKI
You can't. There is no stopping it.
There is only the war!
THOR
So be it.
Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons
collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage
and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.
SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.
They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI
towards his tower.
The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.
BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
Stark, we're heading north east.
INSIDE THE SUIT
IRON MAN
What, did you stop for drive-thru?
Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out
for you.
IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going
at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to
crash.
Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the
QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the
CHITAURI.
INSIDE THE SUIT
JARVIS
Sir, we have more incoming.
TONY
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
IRON MAN heads back to the portal.
Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the
scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.
The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,
the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.
With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.
From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!
Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES
OVER the TRIO.
They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI
SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the
buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and
begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Stark, are you seeing this?
INSIDE THE SUIT
TONY
I'm seeing, still working on believing.
Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
Banner?
TONY
Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a
soft spot.
IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI
LEVIATHAN.
Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch
the city falling to ash.
THOR
Look at this! Look around you! You
think this madness will end with your
rule?
LOKI
(tries to look away)
It's too late. It's too late to stopit.
THOR
No. We can. Together.
Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki
stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.
LOKI
Sentiment.
Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then
SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor
looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of
CHITAURI follow his lead.
The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki
taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A
CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES
IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.
TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their
shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the
bridge.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Those people need assistance down
there.
CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at
them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.
BLACK WIDOW
We got this. It's good. Go!
CAPTAIN AMERICA
(AT HAWKEYE)
You think you can hold them off?
HAWKEYE
Captain.
(pulls a trigger on his bow;
a narrow is mechanically
CHOSEN)
It would be my genuine pleasure.
HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few
seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,
followed by an EXPLOSION.
Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING
cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.
HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL
CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out
to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.
People begin to run out.
BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the
ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.
BLACK WIDOW
Just like BUDAPEST all over again!
HAWKEYE
You and I remember Budapest
verydifferently.
The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty
pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.
YOUNG COP
We need to get out! They gotta bring
the National Guard!
POLICE SERGEANT
National Guard? Does the army know
what's happening here?
YOUNG COP
Do we?
CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this
ridiculous looking man.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
I need men in these buildings. There
are people inside that can run into the
line of fire. You take them through the
basement or through the subway. You
keep them off the streets. I need a
perimeter as far back as 39th.
POLICE SERGEANT
Why the hell should I take orders from
you?
Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST
is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops
watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The
Sergeant turns to his officer.
POLICE SERGEANT
I need men in those buildings, lead the
people down and away from the streets.
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI
LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher
and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The
CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.
IRON MAN
(TO JARVIS)
We got his attention. What the hell is
step two?!
IRON MAN flies away.
HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its
throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and
STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.
CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and
WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,
until...
Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,
firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.
They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI
SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
What's the story upstairs?
THOR
The powers surrounding the cube is
impenetrable.
IRON MAN (V.O.)
Thor is right. We gotta deal with these
guys.
BLACK WIDOW
How do we do this?
CAPTAIN AMERICA
As a team.
THOR
I have unfinished business with Loki.
HAWKEYE
Yeah, get in line.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight
focused on us and that's what we need.
Without him these things could run
wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna
need us...
Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he
looks around the city.
BANNER
So, this all seems horrible.
BLACK WIDOW
I've seen worse.
BANNER
Sorry.
BLACK WIDOW
No. We could use a little worse.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Stark? We got him.
IRON MAN (V.O.)
Banner?
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Just like you said.
INSIDE THE SUIT
TONY
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing
the party to you.
IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI
LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.
The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing
still.
BLACK WIDOW
I... I don't see how that's a party...
IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also
swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that
keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.
Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.
BANNER
That's my secret, Captain. I'm always
angry.
Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN
SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.
Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI
LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.
IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready
to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT  LARGE
CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the
CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and
withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA
raises his SHIELD to block them.
From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in
horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES
UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE
SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!
Loki watches below, motionless.
LOKI
Send the rest.
From the portal, THOUSANDS MORE OF CHITAURI SOLDIERS AND EVEN
MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!
THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.
BLACK WIDOW
Guys.
IRON MAN
Call it, Cap.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Alright, listen up. Until we can close
that portal up there, we're gonna use
containment. Barton, I want you on that
roof, eyes on everything. Call out
patterns and strays. Stark, you got the
perimeter. Anything gets more than
three blocks out, you turn it back or
your turn it to ash.
HAWKEYE
Wanna give me a lift?
IRON MAN
Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
that portal. Slow them down. You've got
the lightning. Light the bastards up.
(Thor flies up; to Natasha)
You and me, we stay here on the ground,
keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.
THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH
UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL
CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.
HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,
THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The
CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES
THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.
IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE
MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM
OUT OF ALTITUDE.
Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A
BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on
MJLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.
THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE
CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK
IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP
DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI
LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.
Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow
of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven
AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,
EXPLODING a RIDER.
HAWKEYE
Stark. You got a lot of strings
sticking to your tail.
IRON MAN
Just try and keep them off the streets.
HAWKEYE
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
Find a tight corner.
IRON MAN
I will roger that.
IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in
HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the
CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER
TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.
INSIDE THE SUIT
TONY
Nice call. What else you got?
HAWKEYE (V.O.)
Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down
on 6th.
TONY
And he didn't invite me?
We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit
around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then
another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,
mesmerized by what lies beyond.
WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.
Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK
CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,
POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI
LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO
WAVE OFF THE HULK.
BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a
CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its
throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands
there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.
BLACK WIDOW
Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
damn thing if we don't close that
portal.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
BLACK WIDOW
Well, maybe it's not about guns.
(gestures the flying
CHARIOTS)
CAPTAIN AMERICA
You wanna get up there, you're gonna
need a ride.
BLACK WIDOW
I got a ride. I could use a lift
though.
BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts
and angles his SHIELD.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Are you sure about this?
BLACK WIDOW
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.
BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR
MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S
SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A
FLYING CHARIOT.
[Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in
one extended shot.]
- BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret
shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS
her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a
building.
- IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS
following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who
fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND
BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as
a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.
- From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends
one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following
IRON MAN.
- Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the
CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK
BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE
SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,
THOR RAISES, DRAWING LIGHTNING TO IT FROM ALL SIDES, AND BRINGS
IT DOWN WITH A FINAL, TERRIBLE BLOW--
SELVIG WAKES UP FROM LOKI MIND CONTROL. He looks around,
confused where he is. He looks up at the sky, amazed.
Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,
FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a
SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap
BREAKS ITS LEG. He stands up, pickingup his SHILED.
HAWKEYE
Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,
they caught a lot of civilians there.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
I'm on it.
Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The
police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.
A WAITRESS looks back, thankful.
BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at
her side. She looks about, wondering whose ENERGY FIRE it was
she looks behind.
BLACK WIDOW
Oh. You.
LOKI FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing
between buildings. They RACE MADLY, driving and dodging.
HAWKEYE looks at BLACK WIDOW, astonished.
HAWKEYE
Nat, what are you doing?
BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
Uh... a little help!
HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it
at Loki, smiling.
HAWKEYE
I've got him.
FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S
HEAD...
SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE
AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...
BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO
THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.
BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of
the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the
edge.
As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS
LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He
COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to
attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,
STANDING UP TO THE HULK.
LOKI
ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH
ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND
I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...
HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR
REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,
FLATTENING LOKI.
HULK
PUNY GOD.
LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.
BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,
weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is
firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of
energy moving through the sky.
BLACK WIDOW
Doctor.
SELVIG
Loki's scepter, the energy...the
Tesseract can't fight. You can't
protect against yourself.
BLACK WIDOW
It's not your fault. You didn't know
what you were doing.
SELVIG
Well, actually I think I did. I built
in a safety to cut the power source.
BLACK WIDOW
Loki's scepter.
SELVIG
It might be able to close the portal.
(Selvig looks down. He sees a
GOLD GLEAM)
And I'm looking right at it.
THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the
hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes
through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting
off SOLDIERS.
IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his
LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.
JARVIS
Sir, we will lose power before you cut
through that shell.
IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster.
IRON MAN
JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of
Jonah?
JARVIS
I wouldn't consider him a role model.
IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY
ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.
IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the
CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The
wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming
sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,
holding out their rifles.
HAWKEYE turns to fire HIS LAST ARROW. Using his bow as a staff,
he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow
off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his
GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,
HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building
and CANNONBALLS in.
The HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them
down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER
OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES
THEM LIKE HE'S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. BLOCKING THE STREAM
OF STREAKING BLASTS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.
A lone pilot sits in his cockpit, listening.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
DIRECTOR FURY is no longer in command.
Override order, 7 ALPHA 11.
7 ALPHA 11 PILOT
7 ALPHA 11, confirmed. Prepare to
takeoff.
He ignites his engine.
NICK FURY RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG-
7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The
jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED.
Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there,
knowing he can't do anything about it.
NICK FURY
Stark, you hearing me? We have a
missile headed straight for the city.
IRON MAN (V.O.)
How long?
NICK FURY
Three minutes, at best. Stay low and
wipe out the missile.
IRON MAN fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain.
IRON MAN
Jarvis, put everything we got into the
thrusters!
JARVIS
I just did.
IRON MAN leaves the streets and flies up into the sky.
7 ALPHA 11 arrives outside the city. He flips the switch to
press the button. He presses it. THE MISSILE IS FLYING OUT TO
MANHATTAN.
7 ALPHA 11
Destination is in 2 minutes, 30 seconds
mark.
CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BATTLE, SIDE TO SIDE. Cap and Thor both
throw their respected weapons. Thor catches MJLNIR, but as Cap
turns, an ENERGY BLAST strikes him down hard. Thor runs over to
a broken car, swings the hammer and flips the car over and over
on its side, crushing a few CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
Cap tries to get up. Thor helps him back to his feet. Cap raises
his SHIELD back up.
THOR
You ready for another bout?
CAPTAIN AMERICA
What? You gettin' sleepy?
Selvig, back in scientist mode, CLACKS away at his laptop.
Henods. BLACK WIDOW grabs Loki's scepter, slowly breaks into the
FORCE FIELD, almost touching the Tesseract.
BLACK WIDOW
I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I
can shut the portal down!
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Do it!
IRON MAN (V.O.)
No, wait!
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Stark, these things are still coming!
INSIDE THE SUIT
TONY
I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow
in less than a minute. And I know just
where to put it.
IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The
missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it
tightly.
With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course.
Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight
up into sky, towards the portal.
INSIDE THE SUIT
CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?
TONY
(TO JARVIS)
Save the rest for return, J.
JARVIS
Sir. Shall I call Miss Potts?
IRON MAN
You might as well.
IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,
suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.
The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.
We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled
with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them
hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.
IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the
blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.
The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,
causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a
spectacular heavenly display.
Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS
KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE
AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it
through.
Still holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around,
waiting.
BLACK WIDOW
Come on, Stark...
Thor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to
Cap.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
(to BLACK WIDOW)
Close it.
Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the
TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.
A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed
portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
(SMILING)
Son of a gun!
TIGHT ON IRON MAN: He keeps falling. And falling. And falling.
THOR
He's not slowing down.
Thor swings Mjlnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK
SNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A
BUILDING.
HULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor
RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around
not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES
TONY AWAKE.
TONY
What the hell? What just happened?
Please tell me nobody kissed me?
CAPTAIN AMERICA
(A BEAT)
We won.
TONY
Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys.
Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's
just take a day. Have you ever tried
shawarma? There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here. I don't
know what it is, but I wanna try it.
THOR
(looking up at Stark Tower)
We're not finished yet.
A beat.
TONY
And then shawarma after.
The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled,
to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives
Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.
Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by
Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.
The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.
Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his
sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint
climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.
