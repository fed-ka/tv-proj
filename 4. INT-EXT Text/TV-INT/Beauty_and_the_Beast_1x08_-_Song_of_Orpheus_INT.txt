She has difficulty speaking, her words slurred by gravity, medication, and pain.



ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE ALAN LODGE

conversation, a heartline monitor BLIPS...

                        The truth?

                                      MARGARET
                        Yes.


Beat. Lodge smiles.

                                      LODGE
                      You look beautiful as ever.

                                      MARGARET
                        I look like hell.
                              (beat)
                      But that's what I get for asking an
                        attorney.


                                      LODGE
                        I'm also a friend, Margaret. An old friend.



Margaret regards Lodge affectionately.

                                      MARGARET
                        I know.


A new concern spreads over Lodge's face. He's tentative about bringing it up.

                                      LODGE
                        Margaret, I'm worried about this
                        business with Starr --

                                      MARGARET

                        Please& Alan. Not now.


Beat. Lodge nods, acquiescing to her weakening state, Margaret studies his face.

                                      MARGARET
                        Will you come closer?

  Lodge cranes closer. Margaret's race reveals only part of the pain that has seized her. She
  takes Lodge's hand - clutches it

                              I know he's still alive. I can feel him.


                                         LODGE

                              Don't do this to yourself...

                              Alan: promise me you'll do this.


  After a beat, Lodge nods. He means it. Then:

                                            MARGARET
                              I want it to say: "The wreck of my
                              memories."
                                  (then)

  LODGE'S POV - HENRY STARR





I                                                                                          5

expensively dressed. He stands, holding the door open-presumably for Lodge.

RESUME LODGE


who doesn't try to conceal his disdain for the man,

                                        LODGE
                            Goodbye, Margaret.

                            Remember, Alan.

Lodge nods and brushes past Starr, who steps into the room and moves to Margaret. He
regards her tenderly, sweeps some stray hair from her forehead. Gently. Smiles,


                                        STARR
                              (to Margaret)
                          How are you feeling?


Margaret manages a weak smile.

                                          MARGARET
                          Fine, fine.

                                        STARR
                            Good. Because we 're taking you home.
                          first thing tomorrow morning.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



 LOU, the bald barber, is finishing up with a CUSTOMER. Ceremonially, he whisks the tiny
hairs off the customer's neck, undoes the collar band, and, like a matador, lifts off the apron. The
man's a master haircutter.

                                        LOU
                            Voila',

                                        CUSTOMER
                                (admiring himself)
                            You do nice work, Lou.


  .....6



The customer stands, reaches for his wallet, and pays Lou. Lou rings up the sale on his
antique cash register. Over this:

                                  LOU
                    Do something forty years, you get good at
                    it. That's the problem with people today:
                    always changing occupations... no
                      perseverance.

                                  CUSTOMER
                        (leaving )
                    See you next week.


Lou gives a small wave and then settles into a waiting chair with the morning Times. He
expertly cracks and folds the paper down to manageable size. As if by ritual, he turns to the
Classifieds. His eyes scan the Personals. Something there hooks his attention. Suddenly, his
movements become urgent and invested. He crosses the shop and lays the paper down on the
counter beneath a mirrored wall. Using a pen, he circles an entry, writes three letters above it.




INSERT - NEWSPAPER

An ad in the Personals circled, whjch reads:  The wreck of my memories -- 500 East 77th
Street." Over this, in Lou's handwriting, the letters FTR.


BACK TO SCENE


Lou, with his able scissors, clips the ad. He opens a bottom drawer filled with empty hair-
tonic bottles and chooses one. Folding the ad, he inserts it into the bottle.




A large, cluttered chamber. Notes pinned all over cork board on the walls, paper everywhere --
like the floor of the Stock Exchange after the close. A WORKER is stationed at a desk in the
corner. Beside him, a large plastic laundry hamper is filled with bottles of every variety. Five or
six chutes reach down from the ceiling and merge into a single guideway, like miniature
toboggan run, which levels out and ends in a receptacle on the desktop. A gentle CLANKING
can be heard way above. It grows nearer. NEARER. And then, the bottle slides into the
guideway and presents itself at the worker's fingertips. He opens it and retrieves the message.
With practiced efficiency, he deposits the bottle in the laundry hamper and then attends to the
message. He places the ad in a worn envelope, writes the letters FTR on the front, and turns to
find MICHAEL, one of the young runners, at his side. He hands the envelope to the boy&
who's off to the races.





running down the long narrow passageways, bursting through clouds of steam, ducking into
short-cuts, etc.

                                                                          CUT TO:



Vincent sits playing chess with Father. His chessmen are in superior position. Vincent's
bishop takes Father's castle without reprisal. Father marvels at the move. Then it dawns on
him:


                                  FATHER
                      Fisher-Spassky. Fourth game.

                                  VINCENT
                    Seventh game.                                                                                          8



Father laughs.

                                        FATHER
                          I don't know what masochistic
                          impulse ever prompted me to teach
                          you chess.


Vincent smiles -- tentatively about the mouth, but fully in the eyes. Father sees this and
regards Vincent tenderly. A staccato knock at the door interrupts the moment.


                                        FATHER
                              (calling)
                          Come in.


Michael enters. Hands Father the envelope containing the clipping.

                                        FATHER
                              (to Michael)

~Thank you. Are those herbs helping your
                          mother?

                                        MICHAEL
                              (shrugs)
                            I guess...

                                        VINCENT
                          Are you hoping for a brother or a
                          sister?

                                        MICHAEL
                          Definitely not a sister.

Father smiles as Michael exits. Father returns to the game. studies the chessboard for a long
moment...

                                        FATHER
                          Let's see& if I recall the seventh game
                          correctly... Fisher vas saved by a pawn...


Father pushes one his pawns forward a square... then absently opens the envelope... slides out
the clipping... reads it... as some deep and distant anguish spreads over his face. Vincent is
immersed in the game, until he notices Father, still staring at the clipping...

                                        VINCENT

                                    Father...?                                                                                                  9



      Father raises his eyes to Vincent. He replaces the clipping into the envelope -- carefully --
      and tucks it into an inner pocket of his garment

                                                  VINCENT
                                  What is it?

                                                  FATHER
                                        (beat)
                                    I wondered when the day would
                                    come... now it has.

      Then:

                                                  FATHER
                                  I've never lied to you, Vincent. The things
                                  I've taught you about the world above... so
                                  much of it was to protect you.


                                                VINCENT
                                    I've seen that world...

                                                  FATHER
                                  ... And I have lived in it.


        Vincent is reminded of his own necessary exile. Father is sensitive to this.

                                                  FATHER
                                    Vincent... you see things as they are.
                                    Whatever I might have kept from you ...
                                    you're discovering for yourself.

                                                VINCENT
                                    Why are you telling me this?

      Beat. This is difficult for Father.


                                                  FATHER
                                    Because I must return. I must go above.


                                                VINCENT
                                      (stunned)
                                    Why?


      Father says nothing.                                                                                            10

                                            VINCENT
                              Father...

                                            FATHER
                              Vincent, please don't ask me anything more.


Pause& then Vincent nods.

                                            VINCENT
                              When will you go?

                                            FATHER
                              As soon as I prepare myself.

                                            VINCENT
                              The Common Meeting is tomorrow.
                              Your counsel is needed&


                                            FATHER
                                  (evenly)
                             I ll be back by then. And when I
                              return, we ll talk.


On Vincent's face, trying to hide his concern:

                                                                                    CUT TO:




Alan Lodge is seated behind his desk, distrustfully listening to Henry Starr.

                              That's my only secret. There's nothing
                              devious or illegal in the way
                              I raise money.


                                            LODGE
                              I never said there was.                                                                                    11

                                  STARR
                    Yet here I am defending myself.

                                    LODGE
                    You made the appointment...

                                  STARR
                    ... and you agreed to see me. What
                    was it? Curiosity?.


                                    LODGE
                      Something like that.


Starr needs to know if Lodge has anything on him and so now tries another tack..

                                  STARR
                      You're a hard man to draw out, Alan.
                          (beat)
                    But let me help you... You're worried. Six months
                    ago, Margaret is diagnosed with malignant
                      pancreatic cancer...
                    She has an enormous estate and not one living
                      relation. Simply put, you question the coincidence
                    of my arrival on the scene.


Lodge isn't denying that one.

                                  STARR
                    Well. I won't lie to you. It was Margaret's wealth
                    and unfortunate situation that attracted us. We're
                    a charity, Alan. We need money to survive. And
                    as callous as it may sound, dying rich people like
                    to be remembered for their good works. I'm sure
                      Margaret was approached by others. She happens
                    to have chosen us.



                                  LODGE
                    She chose you Starr, and that's what I'm
                    worried about.

                                  STARR
                          (laughs)
                    So you can be direct.


                                  LODGE

                    Very.

                                  STARR
                    Well so can I.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      12

                                    STARR (CONT'D)

                            (then, with menace) .

                      You ever slander my name in public, and I'll

                      hit you with a libel suit that'll land you right

                      in the street.

                                    LODGE
                      By the time you even think of filing, I'll
                      have enough evidence -


Lodge stops himself, realizes he's said too much.


MEDIUM CLOSE - STARR

a trace of a smile.

                                    LODGE
                      I won't let you take advantage of her.


                                    STARR
                      You're an old man, Alan. You don't want
                      to lock horns with me.


ON Lodge's face -- the concern. Has he played his hand too soon?

                                                                              CUT TO:


INT FATHER'S CHAMBER - DAY

CAMERA PANS the vast oil lamp lit room... the wall of books... one of Giacometti's
attenuated figures... until it FINDS Father, sitting before an antique dresser. Looking small in
the vast room. During this, he is pensive, almost meditative.


CLOSER ANGLE

as he opens the double doors of the dresser, and stares into it. The contents are barely
discernible because of thick shadow. But we glimpse with Father: clothing on hangers, shoes.
Father reaches in and pulls out an old tweed suit, circa 1950, immaculately preserved. He holds
it suspended for a long moment... before rehanging it on a caddy. Then, from the dresser he
removes a pair of wing-tipped shoes... places them carefully at the foot of the caddy... and a
fedora, which he holds up to examine. Hold on his face, betraying a faint, elegiac smile... a
trace of nostalgia.



                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                      13


INT TUNNELS - DAY

In the tweed suit and the fedora, Father turns a corner and takes a moment before this final
leg: a short tunnel with a bright light glowing at its end. Father takes a breath and walks the
length of the tunnel, his silhouetted back to us, receding, as...




A column of sunlight... the light we have just seen. It's remarkably quiet here. Only the
echoing sound of FOOTSTEPS, as:


FATHER

climbs into frame. He ascends slowly, step by step, following the light, until he exits
frame... and only the footsteps remain.


                                                                                  CUT TO:




(NOTE: Flashbacks should be shot in black-and-white or sepia-toned.)


Flashbulbs pop as the heavy oaken chamber doors open and a younger Father emerges, dressed
in the same suit., holding the same hat, flanked by plain-clothes Federal Marshals. A crowd of
Reporters pushes in toward him -- their voices become an amplified slur in his ears: "Can we
have a question?"&What do you make of the Committee's findings?" -- and remain unheeded
by him, as he pushes through them.


                                                                              CUT TO:



  Father crosses the threshold. Immediately to his right, though he doesn't see it, a tiny red bulb
  FLASHES on a SECURITY PANEL.


  CLOSE ON - SECURITY PANEL.


  A light pulses. The letters read: ''Silent Alarm."


  BACK TO SCENE

  In the entrance halt Father calls out:

                                            FATHER
                              Alan... ?

  His words are greeted with silence. Father looks into the living room before starting
  upstairs. MOVING WITH HIM, as the steps sag and creak under his weight. He reaches
  the second floor landing and starts toward the study...


  INT STUDY


  The room is wrecked -- books torn from the shelves and spilled on the rug, an overturned
  filing cabinet, a ransacked desk. Father's eyes scan the damage and come to rest on the
  prostrate figure of a dark-suited man, legs sticking out from behind the desk. Father moves
  quickly toward him, bends down. He turns the man over and sees it's Alan Lodge.



                                            FATHER
                              Alan ?

  But the lawyers neck is broken, twisted oddly to one side. Father feels for the non-existant
  pulse, then sags at the death of his old friend. A moment later he HEARS POUNDING
  FOOTSTEPS approaching. He pivots around.


  HIS POV                                                                                      15


FOUR uniformed POLICEMEN pour into the room, guns drawn and leveled. These are real
cops -- big-wristed men wearing diver's watches, maybe one with glasses -- and the adrenalin is
charging through their veins.


REVERSE ANGLE - FATHER


slowly rising to his feet, caught in this Kafkaesque nightmare.

                                    COP # 1
                            (barking)
                        Move away from the desk, please.

Father is frozen.

                                    COP # 1
                        Now!

Father shakily comes out into the open. COP #2 is on him in a second, pushing him against the
bookcase, kicking Father', legs apart.


                                    COP # 1
                            (noticing the body)

                        ambulance.

                                    FATHER.
                            (over his shoulder)
                        I'm a doctor. He' s already --


                                    COP # 1
                      Shut up.
                            ( to Cop#3)
                      Do it Larry.


Cop #3 exits. Father is shaken down, cuffed, and turned around to face Cop #1.

                                    . COP #1
                        You're under arrest. You have the right
                      to. remain silent...

CAMERA MOVES IN ON Father's face. The Cop's practiced words grow
unintelligible, swirling in the confusion and auditory terror that's gripping Father's
mind.


                                                                              CUT TO:





Vincent is walking alone, his head bowed, pensive and troubled. He turns into:



The Common Meeting is coming to order. Thirty or forty tunnels dwellers take their places on
theater seats arranged in concentric circles around a small speaking platform. Vincent makes
his way to the inner circle of benches and sits down beside an elderly white-haired black man
named NICHOLAS.


                                          NICHOLAS
                      Is he back yet?


Vincent looks into the man's eyes.

                                    VINCENT
                      I'm afraid not, Nicholas.

                                    NICHOLAS
                            (whispering)
                      Where could have gone? He's never missed
                      a Common Meeting. Not from the
                      beginning.

Vincent has no answer for Nicholas and now stands to address the gathering. Voices hush
all around.


                                    VINCENT
                      My friends... I have difficult news
                      to tell you... Many of you saw Father leaving
                      yesterday, and were worried ... and came to
                      ask me where he vas going. I could only say
                      that something important was calling him
                      from above, and that he would return to
                      preside, as he always does, over this Common
                      Meeting... But he has not returned.



This elicits some REACTION from the assembly. A VOICE calls out.


                                  VOICE (JONATHON)
                      Why did he leave, Vincent?

                                  VINCENT
                      I don't know, Jonathan.
                          (beat)
                    But if Father's taught us one thing, he's
                    taught us to depend on ourselves.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      17

                                      VINCENT (CONT'D)

                      To think our own thoughts, to have
                        strong opinions... and not be afraid to
                        express them. I know that he would want
                      us to follow that teaching in his absence.


Now Nicholas stands.

                                      NICHOLAS
                        I agree. I think we should hold the
                        Meeting even though Father isn't
                        here.


There is audible dissent from several members of the assembly.

                                      VINCENT
                        No: Nicholas is right.


The tone of Vincent's voice quiets the people.

                                      VINCENT
                        All we can do now is go on with our
                        lives...


The crowd seems to accepts the suggestion. Then:

                                      WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Vincent?

A pregnant woman, MARY, stands. She keeps one hand on her son, Michael, the runner,

who is seated beside her.

                        My family needs larger quarters...

                                  ACT TWO



FADE IN: .


Vincent enters the vault-like room. Without Father's presence, it's more like a shrine, and
Vincent has trouble overcoming the feeling that he's somehow trespassing. He pauses in the
center of the chamber, his eyes scanning for a place to begin his search for Father's past. His
gaze lingers on the:


VINCENT'S POV - ANTIQUE DRESSER

This is the logical place to begin, and Vincent knows it. But if the room is a shrine, this dresser
is the altar.


BACK TO SCENE - VINCENT

can't bring himself to approach it, and instead moves to a rolltop desk. Hesitates,

and then pulls open the first drawer...
                ..

                                                            TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE:


VINCENT

Hasn t turned anything up. Boxes are scattered on the floor, a filing cabinet stands open, etc.
Father has clearly destroyed anything that might remind him of his former life. Frustration and
sadness are part of what Vincent's feeling. He now moves reluctantly to the only place he hasn't
searched: the antique dresser...

Vincent turns the big key in the lock, and pulls open both doors at once. It's not what he
expected   only a couple of old suits, a shoe rack, some hats on an upper shelf. Vincent reaches
inside and lifts out a faded blue letterman's sweater with a golden "C' sewn on the pocket. He
hangs it back up, and in the process disturbs one of the suits, so that something plastic drops to
the floor. Vincent picks it up and examines it.




INSERT -SECURITY CLEARANCE BADGE

The laminated letters read "Rockefeller Research Insititute -- Starr."


VINCENT                                                                                        21


puts the badge into his pocket. Next, he runs his hand along the upper shelf behind the hats. He
pulls out an old shoebox and opens it. Beneath a stack of folded handkerchiefs, he removes a
framed, black and white wedding photograph of a younger Father and a Woman (Margaret),
radiant, in her wedding gown. He holds it up to the light and studies it. The image of Father in
love has a powerful effect on him...


Turning the photograph over he finds... an envelope, threadbare and shiny with age, tucked
into the frame. He starts to open it but again, his sense of betrayal prevents him from doing
so. He slides the envelope into the folds of his cloak.


                                                                                CUT TO:



CAMERA SHOOTS THROUGH a window: Father, now dressed in jail garb, his arms
crossed on the long table.

                        Guy still won't give his name, huh?

                                        STRACHER (OS.)
                          Nada. But check out the stuff we got from
                        his pockets.


WIDEN TO REVEAL

LIEUTENANT KYLE STRACHER, recently promoted from the field, and DETECTIVE
RINALDO MARTINEZ, early thirtie, physically slight, top-of-the-Academy bright, but
street-shrewd. Father is visible in b.g., framed by the large sound-proof window. Stracher
removes a bagged and tagged article from an evidence bin.


                                        STRACHER
                        Silver Certificates. They been outta
                        circulation now for what... twenty,
                        thirty years... ?

Martinez accepts the baggy from Stracher. It contains what looks like several dollar bills. He
.inspects the baggy closely, while Stracher lifts out something else.

                        Pair of ticket stubs from a Dodgers
                        Braves game...

He hands the bagged tickets to Martinez, who places the first baggy down to examine
this one. Stracher waits for a reaction.                                                                                              22


                                            MARTINEZ
                                  (reading)
                              Brooklyn and Milwaukee... Emmet's Field...
                              1952.

                                            STRACHER
                              Twilight Zone, huh?
                                  (beat)
                              So whatta you think?


                                            MARTINEZ
                              What I always think: why me?


  Martinez lays the tickets on the table and picks up a manila folder. He moves into the:



    INTERROGATION ROOM

  where he sits in the chair directly across from Father. Stracher follows him, closes the door.
  Martinez is silent as he opens the file on the table. Studies it for a long moment... before shifting
  his attention to Father, who does not lower his eyes  to Martinez' laser-like scrutiny. Finally:


                                            MARTINEZ
                                  (point-blank)
                              Why'd you kill Alan Lodge?

                                            FATHER
                                  (evenly)
                              I didn't kill Alan Lodge. When I found him,
                              he was already dead.

                                            MARTINEZ
                              So you know him.

                                            FATHER
                              I knew him.


                                            MARTINEZ
                              What were you doing in his house?

  Silence. Martinez takes the top sheet from the open folder. It's a Xerox of the classified ad.
He pushes it over the table to Father.

                                            MARTINEZ
                              Maybe this'll help you remember. It's got
                              Lodge's address. We found it in your
                              pocket.                .




                                                                                              23



      Father looks down at the paper, says nothing.

                                            MARTINEZ
                              'The wreck of my memories." What's it
                                mean?

    Martinez waits for a reaction. There is none.

                                            MARTINEZ
                                Maybe you wanna start by telling
                              us your name? Whatta you say?

  But Father remains impassive. Now Stracher leans forward, knuckles on the table. He doesn't
  have Martinez' patience. as:

                                            STRACHER
                              Hey. mister: who the hell are you?



  CLOSE UP - FATHER'S EYES


  as they look into the past

                                                                                DISSOLVE TO:





    A grim-faced INVESTIGATOR speaks into the microphone in a piercing monotone.
  On either side of him, a half dozen down-to-the-bone bureaucrats, all members of the
    inquisitional Un-American Activities Committee.

                                              INVESTIGATOR
                              Will you answer the question. please: Are
                              you now or have you ever been a member
                              of the Communist Party?

  ANGLE - FATHER

  seated at a long table. A microphone before him. He answers evenly, with dignity -- although he
  is obviously keeping his patience tethered.

                                            FATHER
                              No I am not -- nor have I ever been a
                              member or the Communist Party.                                                                                    24

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                      Let me remind you, sir, that you are under
                      oath.

                                    FATHER
                      I don't need reminding.

                                      INVESTIGATOR
                      What is your occupation?

                                    FATHER
                      I'm a research physician.

                                    FATHER
                      I was employed at the Rockefeller
                      Research Institute until several months
                      ago.


                                    INVESTIGATOR
                      Would you please tell the Committee under
                      what circumstances your tenure there ended?


                                    FATHER
                      That's a very good question.

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                    It is this Committee's understanding that your
                      security clearance was denied for subversive
                      activities --

                                    FATHER
                          (overriding)
                      Which to this date remain a complete
                      mystery to me.

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                      Please confine your answers to the
                      questions asked.

                                    FATHER
                      Perhaps if I knew the source of these
                      allegations -

                                    INVESTIGATOR
                      They were included in sworn testimony given
                      before this Committee.

                              Sworn lies is what they were.

                                              INVESTIGATOR
                              We are not interested in extraneous
                              matters. This Committee --


                                            FATHER

                                Extraneous?

                                              INVESTIGATOR
                              -- is interested only in any subversive
                                .knowledge you have.

                                            FATHER
                              Oh. I have knowledge of subversive
                              activities... .


  Father takes a moment. And as he scans the faces of the Committee, he speaks with
  crescendoing passion and intensity:

                                            FATHER
                              I know a group of fanatics who are trying to
                              destroy the Constitution of the United States
                              by depriving good people -- citizens -- of their
                              very livelihood without due process of law. I
                              can cite instances. I can name names. They are
                              anti-semitic, anti-Negro, antiminority, all
                              marching under the same crooked American
                              Flag, hating everyone -- most likely
                              themselves...




  ANGLE - INVESTIGATOR

  as he flicks a switch beneath the long table, shutting off Father's microphone, imposing
  silence, as:

                                            INVESTIGATOR
                                  (coldly)
                              You will limit your testimony, sir, to the
                                Committee 's agenda. And speechmaking is
                              not on that agenda.

                                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

Detective Martinez inhales, then exhales his frustration, as:

                                  STRACHER
                    Waste of time, Renny. I'm telling you.


Martinez looks Father squarely in the eye, trying to size him up, wondering what kind of nut
case he's got on his hands. as:


FATHER


maintains his serene silence... as though he has learned a lesson from history.

                                                                          CUT TO:



A) An immense and darkened reading room, empty, silent, the moonlight streaming in
through huge, paned windows.

B) THOUGH A METAL GRATING into an ornate room which houses a private
collection.

C) DOWN a long, shadowy corridor, stacks and stacks of books stretching to infinity.

D) TURNING INTO an aisle and coming suddenly upon the imposing and solemn figure of



VINCENT


in the half -light. He is taking a book down from the shelf. when:

                                  CATHY (V.O.)
                    Here's something.

Vincent stiffens, listening intently.

                              The Rockefeller Research Institute was
                              given a grant by the Defense Department in
                              June of 1951 to conduct studies on the
                              effects of nuclear fallout...



  She refers to some notes she's jotted on a yellow legal pad.

                                November of that year.

  Cathy begins cranking the machine.



  VINCENT

  moves a couple of rows closer to Cathy. He can see her through the stacks of books, as she
  slows her cranking and arrives at the correct page. He leans against the metal shelving and
  waits...

                                            CATHY (V.O.)
                              This might be it...

                              There was a doctor, Vincent... a

  Vincent's eyes close.

                              ... who claimed that the Rockefeller
                              Institute was misrepresenting his
                              findings...

  He can hear Cathy rolling the microfilm to another page.

runs her finger along her notes, then reaches for the microfilm handle.


ON ILLUMINATED SCREEN


As the images fast-forward -- a blur of history. They slow, then stop, jarring into focus.

cries: "ANTI - ATOMIC RESEARCHER NAMED A COMMUNIST: The sub-head:

                    I'm sorry, Vincent.

                                  VINCENT
                          (quietly)
                    I know. .. And it's happening again... I can feel
                    it happening again. Catherine. He's in danger.
                    The helplessness, the outrage...



Vincent reaches into his cloak and removes the envelope.

                                  VINCENT
                        (handing it to her)
                    I should have given you this sooner...

Cathy turns it over in her hands.


                                  CATHY
                    Who's it from?

                                  VINCENT
                    He had a wife...

                            .CATHY

                        (opening the letter)

                    What does it say?

                                  VINCENT
                    I don't know.


Cathy unfolds the letter and after a look at Vincent, begins reading:

                                  CATHY
                        (reading)
                    Dear Jacob, I am writing you from Paris,
                    where my father has sent me. Spring has
                    arrived early here, the time for lovers, and it's
                    as if the season mocks my sadness...


                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:




lying awake on his cot, eyes open and unblinking. It's now Margaret's voice reading the

letter:


                                            MARGARET'S VOICE
                            But I am beginning to understand that
                            loss is sometimes necessary. I know of
                            no gentle way to tell you that my father has annulled
                            our marriage. And I would be lying to you if I said
                            that I fought him. I can't even blame him. Forgive me,
                            Jacob, because I know you're innocent and still don't
                              have the strength to stand by you. But you are strong
                            and will rebound. Of that, I'm positive. Please don't
                            hate me... We knew each other so short a time.
                                  (beat)
                            All I can say seems useless... yet still I
                            cling to the wreck of my memories, before
                            they sink forever. Goodbye, Jacob. I'll
                            love you always.
                                    (beat)
                              Margaret.




                                                                                    CUT TO:




The place is decorated right out of Sotheby's. Cathy is sitting in an elegant love seat she sips
from a cup of coffee. Starr stands, indicating a huge oil portrait above the mantle of grim-faced
older man. He speaks with a strange kind of fascination&


                                          STARR
                            In fact, he tripled his fortune.

                                          CATHY
                              Margaret's father?





F                                                                                    31

                                    STARR
                      Biologically, yes. Emotionally, the
                      man did more to damage her...

Starr shakes his head. He seems genuinely disturbed by this. Then, as he turns his attention
back to Cathy, shrugging it off...

                                    STARR
                      Anyway, it's past history, right?


                                  CATHY

                      Possibly.

                                  STARR

                      Possibly?

Cathy shrugs, lets that one hang. This stops Starr, but only for a moment.

                                  STARR
                      Well, I'm sorry Margaret wasn't up to
                    it. Perhaps tomorrow.

                                  CATHY
                      Tomorrow's fine. Just tell me when.

                                  STARR
                      I wish I could, but Margaret's condition
                    doesn't allow me to be that specific.
                        (then)
                    Maybe I can help you with whatever
                    it is... ? .


Cathy sips her coffee, and:

                                  CATHY
                     I'm sorry. It's private.

                                  STARR
                    I thought you said you were with the
                    District Attorney's office...


                                  CATHY
                    I am.
                        (smiles politely)
                    It's still private.

Cathy puts down her coffee cup and fishes a card out or her purse. She places it beside the
saucer.                                                                                          32

                                        CATHY
                          My service number's on the card. So
                          you can reach me tomorrow...
                              (rises)
                          .whenever Ms. Sinclair is well enough
                          to see me.

                                        STARR
                              (nods)

                          or course.


As Cathy crosses, the room to leave:

                                        STARR
                          Miss Chandler...


At the door, she turns to face him.

                                        STARR
                          Are you always this mysterious?


                                        CATHY
                              (shrugs)
                          Occupational hazard. I guess.
                              (then)
                          Thanks for the coffee.


She lets herself out. Starr stand, for a moment in apprehensive silence. From another door,
CONNOR enters and approaches Starr. He's clean cut, late-twenties, a muscular six feet, and
dressed like an investment banker. But he's no investment banker.


                                        CONNOR
                          Miss Sinclair's awake. She s asking for
                          you again.


                                        STARR
                          I'll see her in a moment.
                              (then)
                          Connor. The woman who was just
                          here...

                                        CONNOR
                          Sir?

                                        STARR
                          Satisfy my curiosity. Find out what she
                          wants.
                                                                                CUT TO:                                                                                        33





Margaret is sitting up in her bed, gazing out the window and hugging herself, when Starr
enters.


                                      STARR
                            (full of concern)
                          Margaret...

She turns to him.

                                        MARGARET
                         Henry, I'd like to take a walk.

                                      STARR
                        I don't think that's such a good idea. You
                        should be resting.

Starr goes to the window and closes the blinds, shutting out daylight.


                                        MARGARET
                        What time is it?

He sits in the chair beside the bed, and takes several pills from an adjacent medication
tray. As he proffers them to Margaret:


                                      STARR
                        Time for your medication.

                                        MARGARET
                        Damn those things.

                                      STARR
                        You should be grateful for  those
                        things 


                                  . MARGARET
                        I hate the pain killers. A little pain is good
                        for the soul...

                                      STARR
                        Now come on. I have a meeting with the
                        Planning Commission that started five
                        minutes ago.

She looks at Starr before taking the pills. Starr hands her the glass of water on the night
table. She leans back heavily against the pillows.                                                                                          34



                                          MARGARET
                            I wonder why Alan hasn't called.

                                          STARR
                            You know Alan...


Margaret smiles wearily. Then:

                                          MARGARET
                            That's just it: I do know Alan.

Margaret's face reflects confusion and chemical fatigue. Long beat, as she inhales, then exhales.
Then:

                                        MARGARET

                                I m cold&.
                                        .

Starr pulls the covers up higher over Margaret. His expression is neutral. We can't tell what
he's thinking.

                                                                                FADE OUT.

                                ACT THREE



FADE IN:


CAMERA PANS the bustling squad room. Over the cacophony, we hear:

                                  EDIE (O.S.)
                    If Starr's a player, he's playin' by the
                    rules.


As we pick up Cathy and EDIE moving through the crowded squad room. Cathy is glancing
down at a computer printout, as:


                                CATHY
                    How far back did you go?

                                  EDIE
                    All the way. From his cushy childhood in
                    Shaker Heights, to four years in Cambodia
                    with the Peace Corps, to his latest project...


                                  CATHY

                                Which is&?

                                  EDIE
                    A ten million dollar shelter for the
                    homeless.


                                  CATHY
                      (flat)

                    Impressive.


Edie looks at Cathy: senses her disappointment.

                                    EDIE
                    But you're not impressed.

                                  CATHY
                    I don't know...
                        (then)
                    I just didn't think he'd come out so
                    damn... spotless.


                                EDIE .

                    I'm telling you: the man's Nobel

                                (MORE)                                                                                    36

                                  EDIE (CONT'D)
                    prize material. As in, look out Mother
                      Theresa. And if you have any doubt&
                    just ask his publicist. .


Just then, a couple of good-looking Police Officers pass. Smile at the women. Edie returns the
smile, and as soon as they pass, she stops and turns. Cathy watches her watch them, amused.
Edie turns back with a longing, seductive look on her face.


                                  EDIE
                      Mm-mmn...

                                  CATHY
                    Which one?


                                  EDIE
                    Both.


Cathy smiles.

                                  EDIE
                      Remind me to modem a thank you
                    note down to recruiting.
                        (indicating printout)
                    Anyway, it's all there. The guy may
                    be a creep, but he's a clean creep.

Cathy shakes her head and closes the printout, and as she looks up, something o.s. catches her
attention:



CATHY'S POV - FATHER

moving toward her, in handcuffs, escorted by a pair of uniforms. He is looking right at her, as:



BACK ON CATHY


who is watching this, trying hard to contain her surprise, and:

                                  EDIE
                    What is it?


                                  CATHY

                    Nothing...

As Father passes, he averts his gaze. Cathy does the same.                                                                                          37
                                        EDIE
                          You wanna go grab some lunch?
                              ( then)
                          There's a new Cajun place on Hudson.
                          Supposed to be great.


                                        CATHY
                            I don't think so. But thanks.
                              (re: printout)
                          And I appreciate this.

Cathy moves off, leaving Edie a little confused...



                                                                                  CUT TO:



A BALIFF ushers Cathy into the long, antiseptic room. The walls looked scrubbed. There are
two rows of chairs -- a visitor's side and a prisoner's side -- separated by a wire-mesh partition.
Both sides are now empty, and Cathy takes a seat against the far wall. She places her briefcase
on the counter, snaps the latch. She looks at the bailiff. He exits. Cathy waits...

Finally, on the prisoner's side, a heavy metal door pushes open, and Father, in grey prison garb,
steps into the room. He approaches Cathy. She now stands to greet him.




                                        CATHY
                          Are you okay?


Father, stares at her guardedly, with sleepless eyes, and then sits down.

                                        CATHY
                          I'm here to help.

No response. Cathy leans close to the wire, whispering:


                                        CATHY
                          If they ask why I came... tell them you read
                          my name in the newspaper and wanted me
                          as your lawyer.

This doesn't earn Father's trust either.

                                        CATHY
                          Dammit! You've got to help me, help you.
                          Don't you know? your secret is safe with
                          me. I'd never betray your

                                        CATHY (CONT'D)
                        world...
                              (then)

                        Jacob.

The impact of the name -- uttered for the first time in thirty years -- hits Father like a fist in the
gut.


                                      CATHY
                                (compassionately) .
                      Yes, I know who you were...
                      what happened...


Father regards her with immeasurable sadness.

                                      FATHER
                        And Vincent?


                                      CATHY
                        He knows too.


                                      FATHER
                        I never meant to keep it hidden... I only
                        wanted to forget... Does he understand
                        that?


                                      CATHY
                        I think so.
                              (then)
                        You have nothing to be ashamed of.

                                      FATHER
                                (matter-of-fact)
                        I'm not ashamed.


Long silence as Father tries to reconcile past and present.

                                      CATHY
                              (gently)
                        This morning, I tried to see Margaret.

                                      FATHER
                              (bursting)
                        Margaret? How is she? Is she all right?

                                      CATHY
                              (shaking her head)

                        They wouldn't let me see her.
                              (beat)

                        She's very sick.





                                                                                                =t                                                                                          39



                                        FATHER
                          What, she's in the hospital?


                                        CATHY
                          No. She's at home. Too weak to have
                          visitors.

                                        FATHER
                          Who wouldn't let you see her?

                                        CATHY
                          Does the name Henry Starr ring a bell?


Father shakes his head.

                                        CATHY
                          But you came for her, didn't you?


                                        FATHER
                                (hesitates; then)
                          She sent me a message. There was a line
                          we shared. From Byron: "the wreck of my
                            memories --

Cathy recognizes the quotation.


                                        FATHER
                          You saw the letter?


Cathy nods.

                                        FATHER
                          Then, you know everything.
                                (beat)
                          There was a time I couldn't even think
                          those lines without weeping.

Only now does Cathy truly comprehend the tragic finality of their separation:


                                        CATHY
                              (a statement)
                          You never saw her again.

Father shakes his head.

                                        CATHY
                          Tell me a little about her.                                                                                              40



                                            FATHER .
                              ... I can't really. It's the oddest thing. Distill
                                everything I remember... and it comes down to...
                                a couple of sentences -- sometimes a face,
                                vanishing as quickly as it appears... And yet. I
                              can still love her...



  Another pause.

                                            CATHY
                              Did her message to you mean she was in
                              trouble?

                                            FATHER
                              I didn't know. I took it to mean she wanted
                              to see me again.

                                            CATHY
                              And who was Alan Lodge?

                                            FATHER
                                A friend. He defended me during the witch
                              hunts, put his own reputation on the line.


                                            CATHY
                              Was he Margaret's lawyer, too?

                                            FATHER
                              Yes. He was the family lawyer. But
                                Margaret's father never realized he was
                              helping me.

                                            CATHY
                                    (doing the arithmetic)
                              So, if Margaret were sick... and wanted to
                              make, or to change her will, she would've
                              gone to him.


                                            FATHER
                                I suppose so.

  Cathy clicks her briefcase shut, and stands up quickly.


                                                     FATHER
                              What is it?



...                                                                                          41


                                        CATHY
                          I'm not sure... but if I'm ever going to get
                          you out of here, I have to know why Alan
                          Lodge was killed.


                                        FATHER
                          Be careful. Contact Vincent.

                                        CATHY
                          I will.
                                (leaving )

                          You sit tight... Jacob


A faint smile from Father.

                                        FATHER
                          I'm not going anywhere.

                                                                                CUT TO:




PANNING a file of men and women in loose, practical work clothes, as they hammer the frame
of this structure in a syncopated symphony of effort. WIDER and we have a better picture of its
eclectic design. (NOTE: our notion is that this might be like the adobe structures of the Grand
Canyon Indians, built into the rock wall -- say, with a geodesic dome for a roof -- but its only
limitations should be production constraints and the imagination of the Production Designer
and/or Art Director.) The general feeling is like that of an old-fashioned barn raising. And
many of the same people from the Common Meeting are assembled, including:


MARY


who's stirring a batch of lemonade, and:


VINCENT


perched high on the frame. He lifts and at the same time coordinates two other MEN as they
help him raise the last of four heavy wooden beams.


                                        VINCENT
                          A little higher... good.                                                                                                  42


    The men strain along with Vincent, lifting the beam until it's horizontal to a post hole that has
    been dug into the rock wall... into which the beam fits perfectly.
    .The Men smile and give Vincent the thumbs-up sign.

      tracing the progress of construction over time, as the THEME plays over:


    A) The older people sew burlap triangles onto the geodesic dome that will

      become the roof...

    B) Mary dispatches a Young girl with a trayful of glasses filled with lemonade&,


    C) Vincent shoulders a huge bag of dry cement, and empties the contents into a mixing urn,
    where a couple of Young Boys are stirring&

    D) A Surveyer takes a glass from the Young Girl and guzzles it thirstily...


    E) The music SWELLS as Vincent coordinates the dome being hoisted by a system

    of pulleys onto the finished structure. and:


      THE DWELLING

    is completed. It's magnificent. The tunnel denizens congratulate one another (AD, LIB.) --

      although Vincent' is the most notable object of their appreciation -- as they begin collecting their

      tools and equipment and leaving. Now Mary approaches Vincent, and&



                                                MARY
                                  Thank you, Vincent. It wouldn't have
                                    happened without you.

      Vincent accepts the compliment in humble silence. Mary turns to her new home,


                                                MARY
                                  It's beautiful.

                                        ( appraisingly)
                                  It is...

  MOVING WITH Vincent as he walks back to his chamber, his tools slung over his shoulder.
The TAPPING SOUNDS continue, but one particular rhythm stops Vincent... and as he moves
closer to the pipes to listen...

with the half -lie.

Cathy looks up, surprised at:



CONNOR


standing squarely in the doorway.

                                        CATHY
                          Who are you?


                                          CONNOR
                          Gim me that.


As Connor inches forward, Cathy backs away, and:


HER POV

angled past Connor, she can see through the lobby, into the hallway: the tip of the Officer's cap
on the floor.                                                                                            45


BACK TO CATHY

The red light in her head goes off as she looks around desperately for something to use as a
weapon. Nothing but a Xerox machine. And Connor is getting closer... when Cathy flips a light
switch, throwing the room into sudden darkness... when a FLASH from the xerox machine
illuminates the room and blinds Connor as Cathy darts past him into:



THE HALLWAY


she runs past the fallen cop to the:


  ELEVATORS

Cathy presses the buttons on both panels, hears FOOTSTEPS, and deposits the audit report in
the mail chut -- but she doesn't wait around for:


CONNOR

who's rounding the corner. Cathy dashes for the door to the stairway, and pushes through. into:



THE STAIRWELL

Twelve stories above ground level. Cathy takes the concrete steps three at a time, using the
hand rail to vault the last four of each landing. She doesn't look back but hears Connor's
  reverberating footsteps behind her...

                                                                                    CUT TO:




Starr is sipping a scotch. Behind him, the nightlights of the city appear as constellations
in the picture window. Cathy is flanked by Connor and Spano.


                                        STARR
                          Well, you don't look any the worse for wear,
                          Miss Chandler, I must say. .. now where's
                          that audit report? . .


Cathy remains impassive.

                                      STARR
                        Don't worry. I'll get it. I've spent a lifetime
                        getting things out of people.


                                      CATHY
                        Turn off the charm, Starr before you
                        blow a fuse.

                                      STARR
                              (angering).
                        You have a smart mouth --


                                        CATHY
                          And my smart mouth tells me you're
                          keeping Margaret Sinclair against her will,
                          embezzling her estate.

Starr fortifies himself with a swallow of scotch.

                                        STARR
                          Close, but not quite accurate.
                                (gesturing)
                          Margaret's in the very next room.
                          No rope is binding her hands or feet. She s
                          free to leave anytime she pleases. As for her
                          estate, you can read the newspaper. She s
                          willed everything to New York's homeless.


                                        CATHY .

                          Minus the forty percent that goes

                          into your pocket.                                                                                        48




                                      STARR
                              (smiling )
                        My commission...

                                      CATHY
                        Even though you had to kill for it.


                                      STARR
                        Especially because I had to kill for it.


Cathy stares at him, incredulous.

                                      STARR
                            (with bitter knowledge)
                        You see, Ms. Chandler, I've learned that
                        under the right circumstances, a man is
                        capable of anything.
                            (then)
                        And now, I'm going to offer you the. same
                        choice I did Mr. Lodge. I need that audit...



Cathy's face reflects the hopeless situation she's in, as we:

                                                                  MATCH CUT TO:




as elevator doors whoosh close, locking Cathy inside with Connor and Spano.



Typical elevator atmosphere -- going down. Tense, Cathy searches for a way out, a weakness
she can exploit. But she has no chance in these close quarters.




looking straight down at Vincent on top of the elevator, as it descends rapidly.


ANOTHER ANGLE - VINCENT

among the various moving cables and machinery. Big, white, floor-numerals "10", "9", "8", pass
by on the shaft walls beside him, he's searching for a way to disable                                                                                          49


the elevator, and finally, in a stupendous display of strength, grabs two of the moving cables
and forces them together, bending one around the other. The elevator shudder and then jolts
to a halt between floors.




Confusion -- and Cathy takes advantage of it. Bringing the point of her heel down on Spano's foot
and following through with a vicious elbow to the man's solar plexus. Groaning, Spano sinks to
his knees. Connor is moving toward her, when:





yanks open the emergency egress on the roof.



Connor's head cranes at the noise. In that instant, Cathy brings her knee up sharply between
his legs. Connor opens his mouth to scream, but no syllable emerges, as he folds in two and
drops to the floor.





Cathy looking up at him, both thugs temporarily subdued...


VINCENT

a' la Errol Flynn, thrusts his hand into the elevator compartment and pulls her to safety, slams the
emergency egress shut and bolts it. From inside, they hear commotion. and then a gun firing. A
bullet whizzes up through the roof inches away from Cathy. More shots blast through all around
them.


                                        VINCENT
                          Hold on, Catherine.


Cathy wraps her arms around Vincent's neck, and with her on his back, he begins to climb up

the cable.


NEW ANGLE

Vincent and Cathy - way up on the cable -- climbing as one into the gloom or the elevator shaft..


                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                        50






Vincent carries the blanketed figure of Margaret down the spiral stairway, as we:

  A beautiful day...

Edie regards Cathy now, a bit more serious. Then:                                                                                          52

      A SHEET OF NEWSPAPER


      scraping down the sidewalk like urban tumbleweed. We follow it until:



      Vincent is reading Shakespeare by the light of a six-branched candelabrum, when Father enters.
      Vincent greets him with a strong masculine embrace. They separate, holding each other by the
    arms.

                                                VINCENT
                                  I'm glad you're safe...

                                                FATHER
                                  It's good to be home.

    Father doesn't take long to get to the heart of the matter:


                                                FATHER
                                  Where is she, Vincent?




: ...                                                                                              55


                                            MARGARET (O.S.)

                              Over here, Jacob...

  Father looks around to see:


  HIS POV - MARGARET

  in the doorway -- the soft candlelight drawn to her, enveloping her in its healing glow. She's an
  angel in the doorway, a presence, a worshipful image for Father of both wild regret and ever-
  enduring beauty...


  BACK TO SCENE

  Father is nearly paralyzed with the vision of her. Slowly, he turns away from Vincent to
  face her... She doesn't wait for him but instead crosses to him and reaches out her hands.


                                            MARGARET

                              Jacob...

  Father takes her hands, looks deeply into her eyes, drinking in her radiance and life. He wants to
  include Vincent in his joy, but when he glances over, Vincent's... already gone. His gaze returns
  to Margaret.

                                            FATHER
                              You're too beautiful...

                                            MARGARET
                              No words... just hold me.


  They embrace...

                                            MARGARET
                              ... just hold me...


  ... and keep embracing; as we:

                                                                                DISSOLVE TO:



  Of Father showing Margaret his world.


  A) Holding her hand, he leads her into the large chamber where the Common Meetings are
  held...

  B) They stand, admiring the adobe dwelling that Vincent built...

C) He guides her along a high, narrow ledge. Behind them, a multi-level dwelling has been

carved out of the bedrock.

D) LONG FOCAL LENGTH. Father and Margaret steer down a tunnel towards a distant light,

and:



They emerge into an enormous cavern and stand on the shore of a magnificent underground
lake. As they make their way along the edge, she winces in pain and falters... leaning
heavily against the wall.

                                      FATHER

                        Margaret.

Father quickly goes to her... supports her, until her weight rests on a seat-like ledge.


                                        MARGARET
                        I'm all right. Jacob. Really...


And she smiles quickly to prove it.

                                      FATHER
                        We've done too much.

                                        MARGARET
                        No. no... I just need to rest.

This relapse reminds them both of her mortality. Father nods, and sits beside her. She puts her
head on his shoulder.

                                                                              CUT TO:




Margaret is sitting on Father's quilt-covered bed. Father is stoking a small fire in an ash can,
which casts its dancing light across the walls and over their faces.

                                        MARGARET
                        You've built a remarkable world,
                        Jacob. I've never felt more alive, or
                        been more at peace.

Father comes to sit beside her.                                                                                          57

                          All these years, this place has only wanted
                          for one thing...

                                          MARGARET
                            If I weren't such a fool. .

                                          FATHER
                            Please, Margaret. Don't...

                                          MARGARET
                          No, I have to say this... I've been
                            wanting to all along...

She's silent for a moment.. Laughs.


                                          MARGARET
                          ... and now I don't know where to begin.
                                (beat) .

                            I'm dying, Jacob, and sometimes I think it's so
                            damned unfair... That there's something in my
                            own body turned against me... And then I
                            think of what happened to you, and what I did,
                            and I get that same feeling all over again. Like
                            I'm somehow being punished.


                                        JACOB
                          Margaret &

                                          MARGARET
                            I know it's absurd. But I just can't stop
                            thinking it.


                                        JACOB
                          Then we're a couple of fools, because I've
                          long since forgotten it.


They stare into the fire...

                                        FATHER
                          I want to say something, too.



Margaret regards him.

                                          MARGARET
                            I know.                                                                                                  58



      Now Father looks at her, his eyes swimming with emotion. They share a lingering look of deep
      love. Then, with quiet intensity, his voice low and nearly choked:


                                                FATHER
                                  I will miss you, Margaret.


      Margaret's eyes are swimming too, as she falls into his arms in a long, clinging embrace.
      They hold one another as if onto life itself. After a long pause:

                                                MARGARET
                                  Come on, Jacob. Let's dance.


      Father breaks away, looks at her quizzically.

                                                FATHER
                                  What?

                                                MARGARET
                                  You know: dance.

                                                FATHER
                                      (laughing)
                ..You and I are past out dancing days.


                                                MARGARET
                                  Nonsense. As I recall, you were a
                                  wonderful dancer.

                                                FATHER
                                  Two left feet next to those Park Avenue swells
                                  you called your friends.

                                                MARGARET
                                  Do you remember that night we had? We
                                  were at one of my father's ridiculous
                                  stuffed shirt affairs at the Waldorf, and we
                                  snuck out during cocktails...

                                                FATHER
                                      (smiles, remembering)
                                  Yes... we walked down to University Place,
                                  and had oysters and beer at the Cedar
                                  Tavern.

                                                MARGARET
                                  And when we were good and loaded, we went
                                  to the 23 Club and danced until three in the
                                  morning.                                                                                        59




                                        FATHER
                          You know, I think I have some of those
                          seventy-eights somewhere...

He rises and moves to a Victrola across the room. Beneath it is a cabinet with a scattering of
records. Father pulls one out, puts it on the turntable. He winds the spring, then releases it, and
places the needle at the edge of the disk. From the scratchy noise emerges the soothing strains of
Glenn Miller's "Moonlight Serenade". Now he moves to Margaret, and extends his hand to her.
She accepts it. Rises. And they come together, dancing cheek-to-cheek to the romantic strains,
and we:



                                                          SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:


A FULL MOON


shining through the trees of Central Park, and as we PAN DOWN to:

                                        VINCENT (O.S.)
                          The last seven days, she said, were the
                          happiest days of her life.
