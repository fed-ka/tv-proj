FADE IN
The sky is pure blue, exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus
clouds, floating lazily. A single bird sails past. From the
sky the CAMERA MOVES TO earth. Here, too, all is tranquil.
The trees, bright green in the sunlight, move only to the
slight but constant breeze. Now the CAMERA MOVES DOWN,
revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside
the road. The wagon is at an awkward angle, but upright. It
is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it
as they tried to reach some forage. Its seat is empty. In
the bed of the wagon several sacks lie, bearing the legend:
From: Argus Mine - Rock Pass
To: U.S. Assay Office
San Francisco
The sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife. The ropes
that bound them are cleanly severed. The disorder in the
wagon indicates haste. Two horses are hitched to it, munching
grass or the high leaves of a tree overhead. All that is odd
or unnatural is that the reins have fallen askew and trail
the ground.
Now the CAMERA MOVES AWAY and ALONG tracks made by the wagon
when it left the road. ON THE ROAD two horses stand. These
are saddled, but riderless. The rifle holsters are empty.
CAMERA MOVES TO the ground. There on the road lies the rifle.
The dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the
persistent summery little breeze. From the rifle, the CAMERA
MOVES ON A LITTLE and STOPS ABRUPTLY ON the sprawled dead
figure of a soldier, then another, face down in the road.
CLOSE SHOT of the dead soldiers, as the CAMERA HOLDS ON them.
Near the hand of one a revolver lies, the fine dust coating
it. Dust blowing over the uniforms, as though seeking to
hide the shame of a murder. As it blows over their still
figures, the SOUND of BIRDS coming over:
FADE OUT
FADE IN
ROCK PASS - NIGHT
This is a western mining town of the Eighties that has
mushroomed up around a gold strike. On the streets prospectors
and miners mingle with merchants. As the CAMERA PICKS UP the
scene, a lumber wagon passes, bearing logs, a ten team wagon,
its trailer filled with ore from the stamp mills and bearing
the legend: ARGUS MINE. A stage coach comes in as we:
DISSOLVE
As Haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon, a well-
lighted, plush-looking spot, illumined by kerosene flares.
Sticking a pipe in his mouth, Haven saunters in.
The board sidewalk has given way to a rutty dirt road. Now
the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise,
the road dark and silent. Haven has emerged from the saloon.
He glances up the street. Fifty yards ahead, Stellman is
walking slowly. Stellman pauses, shoots a quick glance
backwards, then goes on. Haven follows, going leisurely up
the street after Stellman.
ANGLE on a corner as Stellman turns it, pauses and waits.
When Haven reaches it, Stellman goes on in silence.
As Stellman reaches it, pauses and glances behind him. Then
he rings a bell. Haven comes up and waits in silence, glancing
at the dark interior. A woman's face now peers through the
door window and then the door opens. Stellman enters quickly
and Haven follows.
As Haven saunters along. He pauses, glances up at a sign
that reads: HOTEL. Then he enters the dingy building.
As Mick and Haven come out; the crowd makes a noisy clearing.
There are bets going down. As soon as the crowd has formed
an open space, Haven wheels and smacks Mick across the face
hitting with the heel of the hand, so that Mick rocks back
almost going down. There is dead silence. Mick sets himself
for the Kill, as he peels his coat.
Bristow is shaking with excitement.
BRISTOW
Mick will kill him.
CHARLIE
That's ten to one.
BRISTOW
(grinning)
I don't like the other fellow's
chances, but I'm a sucker for odds.
CHARLIE
You should always bet on a champion.
Then you can only lose once.
BRISTOW
You give ten to one...?
(she nods)
I'll take it.
CHARLIE
You're down. A thousand to a hundred.
As they stare at the fight --
FULL SHOT - fight scene. As Mick is slowly advancing toward
Haven. He suddenly swings a haymaker which Haven easily ducks,
another and another that Haven evades.
HAVEN
Don't miss so much. You'll got tired.
Mick misses again, fiercely and Haven cracks him one in the
midriff. Then steps out fast and waits.
Mick charges and Haven catches him full in the mouth. It
stops Mick, and then Haven socks him again, this time with
the butt of his hand -- open palm -- on the nose. Mick is
surprised, tasting the blood on his hurt lips.
ANGLE on Charlie, Mark and Prince, as they watch. Charlie's
eyes are fixed with a kind of admiration on Haven. Prince
watches without interest. Mark is tense and excited.
BRISTOW
He can fight a little.
CHARLIE
A little won't be enough.
But you feel she wishes it might...
ANGLE on the fight.
MICK
Stand still and fight.
As Mick closes again, Haven stops quickly to one side,
clipping him behind the ear as he goes by. But this time
Mick keeps after Haven and finally connects. It is more of a
push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives
Haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. As Mick, sensing
victory, charges, Haven knows he can't get to his feet in
time, so he turns his body and springs at Mick's knees
shoulder first. The impact spills Mick on his face; before
he can recover, Haven dives on him, hands flat on his own
chest and palms turned out. His body crashes heavily, angling
across Mick's head, and Haven's savagely pushing hands mash
the other man's face into the hard ground. Then he rolls
clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. Mick
gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. As he
closes ponderously in on Haven, his booted foot suddenly
shoots out. Haven twists his knee cap away but takes the
blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that he
almost goes down. And now Mick gets to him. His great arms
close around Haven's waist, his hands locked in the small of
Haven's back. Haven braces himself against the crushing
squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine,
but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute
power of the other man.
The sweat stands out on Haven's face as Mick's great strength
bends him over farther and farther. He must do something,
and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave.
Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off
the ground. Mick, suddenly finding Haven's full weight pulling
him forward, crashes down on top of him. With all the strength
left in him, Haven brings his knee to the pit of Mick's
stomach; as Mick's hold breaks, Haven rolls clear.
Now they are both hurt. Haven's ribs and chest are so bruised
that it is agony to take a breath. He knows it has to end
quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. As Mick tries
to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws
pile-driver punches to Mick's midsection; as Mick finally
lowers his arms to cover his body, Haven shifts his attack
to the face. This is not Mick's style of fighting, but as he
lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches Haven
it is with punishing power. Toe to toe, they slug it out,
the belt now unwound and dangling from Mick's fist, both men
groggy but both refusing to go down. Finally Mick is helpless
to protect himself, but Haven hasn't got power left to knock
him off those sturdy legs. Gathering himself, Haven hurls
his body shoulder first at Mick's chest but he miscalculates,
glances off and falls flat on his face. As he rolls over,
dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight has
staggered Mick; the big man has taken a step back, and now
he starts to walk forward. Dazed and blind with pain, he
passes Haven, staggers forward until the tie-rail stops him.
There he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head from
side to side like a wounded animal.
The crowd is silent now, waiting. Haven gets to his feet,
drunk with weariness. He puts a hand on Mick's shoulder, but
hasn't the strength to whirl him around. He braces himself
with one hand against the tie-rail, and almost in slow motion
pulls Mick around and clips him one last time with his
remaining strength. Mick goes down.
MICK
(getting up very slow)
You can't do this.
Before he is up he goes down again, unable to make it.
MICK
(in the dirt)
Nobody can do this... to me.
The crowd is transfixed. They can't even cheer. The two
bouncers lean over the fallen Mick.
BOUNCER
Somebody just did.
They pick up Mick as Haven stupidly watches. Then as Haven
turns and goes away, swaying and weak, the roar rises. He
pushes aside people who try to assist him. They move aside
and watch him leave. The crowd goes back in the saloon behind
the vanquished Mick...
ANGLE on Charlie, Bristow and Prince. Prince watches the
beaten Mick go by with a smile of contempt. Charlie's eyes
are fixed on the vanishing lonely figure of Haven. Mark's
eyes are dancing.
BRISTOW
I can't believe it. Mick Marion losing
a fight and me winning a thousand!
CHARLIE
(to Prince)
Give it to him, Prince -- in chips.
Bristow follows Prince, wiping his forehead. Charlie remains,
looking down the now empty street where Haven vanished, a
strange soft look in her eyes, a slow smile mounting her
lips.
As Haven walks through the wide gate into a compound. There
are several unhitched stages and freight wagons, one or two
in partial disassembly and being serviced. A colored boy is
readying a horse and buggy and beside him, overlooking the
yard activities, is a bespectacled man with rubber sleeve
garters. He is the manager. He has eyes like Armadillo and
claw-like hands; otherwise, he could be your loan agency
man. Seeing Haven he crosses to him.
HAVEN
(looking him over)
Are you the manager?
MANAGER
I am.
HAVEN
My name's Haven.
MANAGER
I've heard about you. You're the
fellah who took Mick Marion apart.
(looking at him)
Almost knocked me off my feet. But
my feet ain't been any good since I
followed Stonewall Jackson.
(keenly)
What business you got with me?
HAVEN
(handing him the note)
I'm the new boss.
The manager glances at the note, after moving his spectacles
out of the way. He gives it back without a word, and turns
toward the rear office door. Haven halts him.
HAVEN
Wait a minute. You're not fired.
MANAGER
I got to be. There ain't enough work
around here for one man, let alone
two.
HAVEN
Two can loaf as easy as one.
Jim Goddard and Jerry enter from the rear office door. Jerry
is the younger. Goddard walks a little stiffly with the aid
of a cane.
JERRY
Mr. Leonard!
They halt and look at Haven. The Manager jerks a thumb at
Haven.
MANAGER
Talk to him. He just took the reins.
(indicating the two
lads)
This is Jim Goddard. He's a regular
stage driver. Jerry here runs freight
to the sawmill. Boys, your new boss.
HAVEN
Hello, boys.
JERRY
(with a grin of hero
worship)
I gotta start out of here for the
sawmill before daybreak. Is that all
right, Mr. Haven?
Haven nods, after a glance at the manager.
JERRY
I seen that fight last night. It was
sure a beauty.
HAVEN
Glad you enjoyed it.
JERRY
What I liked was the way you --
HAVEN
Let's not talk about it. Right now
it hurts my hands to listen.
JERRY
Yes, sir.
He walks out, looking back with an awesome smile. Haven looks
curiously at Goddard, who has been standing in silence, a
thin smile on his lips.
HAVEN
What happened to you?
GODDARD
My last run. I stopped a bullet.
HAVEN
Did you get a look at them?
GODDARD
I wish I had.
HAVEN
I think I'm going to need you and
not on one leg. So sit down and give
it a rest.
GODDARD
(slowly smiling)
Yes, sir.
He obeys. Haven watches and then turns to the manager.
HAVEN
I'm coming back later and sit behind
your desk. I'll need the keys.
MANAGER
(taking keys from his
pocket)
Only things here that work.
The manager, gives them to him. Then looks at him.
MANAGER
Son, I waste my time. I might as
well waste some advice. You're full
of blood and vinegar, but this whole
thing has got something wrong with
it. Goddard only got nicked in the
shin. You might not be so lucky...
HAVEN
I might depend on something besides
luck.
MANAGER
Like for instance?
HAVEN
Well the fact that they don't seem
to shoot too straight.
MANAGER
They don't need to when they shoot
so often.
He turns, takes a few steps -- and turns back to Haven.
MANAGER
Worry it over.
The manager turns to go, shaking his head.
Haven, whistling softly, crosses to the colored boy who is
polishing the last specks of dust off the buggy. It is a
beautiful buggy attached to a beautiful horse. Haven pauses
and gazes at it.
HAVEN
What's this?
The colored boy steps back and admires his work.
COLORED BOY
Sumpin', ain't it?
HAVEN
Who's it for?
COLORED BOY
Miss Charlie, Mr. Haven.
HAVEN
Where do you drive her?
COLORED BOY
Same places. Around the hills, down
the river, every afternoon.
HAVEN
I think I'll give you this afternoon
off.
COLORED BOY
I shouldn't let you do this, suh...
(looking Haven over,
especially the
bandaged hands)
But ah am.
Haven climbs in the buggy, and the Colored Boy watches him
go.
DISSOLVE
As Haven helps Charlie into the carriage.
HAVEN
I presume you're going shopping?
CHARLIE
I wouldn't wear anything sold this
side of Chicago. I'm going to call
on a gentleman.
HAVEN
At this hour?
CHARLIE
His name is Mark Bristow -- and any
hour, it would be strictly business.
He glances at her.
HAVEN
The way you say it -- he may need a
lawyer.
CHARLIE
He's a lawyer himself, but it won't
help him.
HAVEN
No?
CHARLIE
(with a smile)
What good is a lawyer if he never
gets in a court?
HAVEN
Like a doctor in a graveyard. Where
is this unlucky man?
CHARLIE
Across the street.
As Haven shrugs and turns the carriage to front of Bristow's
office.
The letters on the window read:
Mark Bristow, Lawyer
As Haven pulls up in front of it with the carriage. He goes
around and helps Charlie alight, making it a little slow for
the sake of added intimacy and causing her to smile as though
she didn't resent it.
HAVEN
Shall I take the horses back and rub
them down?
CHARLIE
Do you think they've gone far enough?
HAVEN
I haven't.
CHARLIE
Then maybe you better wait and come
with me.
As Charlie starts in, Mrs. Caslon comes out and they pass.
Mrs. Caslon pauses to smile and Haven tips his hat. Charlie,
flashing a backward look, sees this.
MED. SHOT of Haven and Mrs. Caslon. Haven is talking to her
with apparent casualness because he realizes that Charlie
can see him.
HAVEN
I wonder if you'd do me a favor?
MRS. CASLON
Why, surely.
HAVEN
It's a big favor, and I wouldn't
blame you if you refused.
MRS. CASLON
What is it?
HAVEN
I want to haul some gold from your
mine.
MRS. CASLON
That IS a big favor.
HAVEN
I know it seems impossible to you,
but that's one reason why I'm here --
to find cut what makes it impossible.
MRS. CASLON
Isn't that very risky?
HAVEN
That's why I couldn't go to anyone
but you.
MRS. CASLON
(hesitating)
I'm just wondering if we shouldn't
speak to Captain Iles first.
HAVEN
You know what he'd say.
(she smiles grimly
and nods)
He'd advise against it -- but if it
works my way, it may clear everything
up -- for all of us -- and for Iles
too. The War Department doesn't like
all that gold around an Army Post.
He watches her face as she thinks it over.
HAVEN
(softly)
We're working too much in the dark.
This may be the only way to see
something. It's a risk -- but someone
has to take it...
MRS. CASLON
(firmly)
Who else will know of it?
HAVEN
Just us. That'll be all who know --
and that's the idea.
MRS. CASLON
(simply)
I'll arrange it.
HAVEN
(grinning)
Don't look so grim. It's only your
gold and my skin. And smile when you
walk away as though we'd been talking
about what a dry summer it's been.
She smiles and Haven pats her shoulder.
Haven is finishing preparations for the ride. ANGLE ON Goddard
as he stands in shadow, watching. He carries a shotgun. As
Goddard moves from the shadow, Haven whirls, going for his
gun -- then relaxing as he recognizes the other man.
MED. SHOT of Haven and Goddard.
HAVEN
What brings you here?
GODDARD
(smiling)
I had a dream.
HAVEN
Yeah?
GODDARD
That you'd be back here tonight.
HAVEN
Why?
GODDARD
Maybe because you took the keys.
HAVEN
Don't they go with the job?
Haven stares at him a long moment; Goddard returns the stare
steadily.
GODDARD
You know how it is with dreams. I
got the crazy idea you were going to
try something --
HAVEN
How crazy?
GODDARD
Like running a shipment.
HAVEN
Then what happened?
GODDARD
I wanted to be some help with it.
HAVEN
All right -- you've been some help.
Now you can go back to sleep and
I'll finish the dream for you.
The coach is ready. Goddard doesn't move.
GODDARD
I'm riding with you, Haven.
HAVEN
You are?
GODDARD
(grimly)
I'm riding.
HAVEN
(slowly)
You got more than your leg hurt,
didn't you?
GODDARD
Maybe I just like to ride in the
moonlight if nothing happens.
HAVEN
And if it does?
GODDARD
Then I think I got a little better
right than you to be there.
HAVEN
(gazing at him)
I was just thinking -- a nice guy
like you probably has a nice girl
somewhere -- or a wife.
GODDARD
What are we gonna do -- have a little
chat about women?
Haven slowly grins at him; Goddard smiles back.
HAVEN
Some other time -- Let's go -- out
the back gate.
Goddard climbs up with his shotgun as Haven clambers up into
the driver's seat. As the coach turns and heads for the back
of the corral.
WIPE
FULL SHOT - the stagecoach, travelling across open flat
country, heading toward the distant hills.
CLOSE SHOT - Haven and Goddard in the driver's box, keeping
an eye about him as the teams gallop along in the moonlight.
HAVEN
What makes you so anxious to take
this chance?
GODDARD
What makes you?
HAVEN
I'm on commission. With me it's a
matter of money.
GODDARD
And you think it's something else
with me?
HAVEN
I can't think of anything else --
except curiosity.
GODDARD
(gazing out drily)
Some moonlight after all...
FULL SHOT as the stage rockets off into the darkness.
DISSOLVE
The stage is now heading uphill, the gentle slope at the
beginning of the foothills.
The road is steeper now, and winding.
ANOTHER ANGLE. The road is cut out of the side of the
mountain, leaving a sheer slope on one side, and high, thick
trees and brush on the other. As the stage follows a bend in
the road, a rider leaps out and grabs the lead horse. The
stage lurches crazily and almost overturns as it slows to a
stop. Before Haven can free his hands from the reins to go
for his gun, two shadowy figures, handkerchiefs helping the
darkness mask their faces, have jumped out onto the road
ahead and have him covered.
BANDIT
All right -- stretch!
Haven and Goddard raise their arms. Another bandit, from the
hillside, calls out:
SECOND BANDIT
Pile out with the hands up.
Two shotgun barrels cover the side of the stags. Goddard
gets off, hands in air.
FIRST BANDIT
(to Haven)
Get down.
Haven obeys, to join Goddard in the road, as the bandits
converge on the stage. There are five or six of them. Two
come up behind Haven and Goddard.
FIRST BANDIT
Turn around and keep 'em high.
The sacks are being loaded on a pack horse. Haven turns
around.
HAVEN
Take it easy. They hang you just the
same.
SECOND BANDIT
You, Goddard, start walking.
He gives Goddard a none too gentle shove. Goddard moves on
up the road in the darkness.
A FEW YARDS UP THE ROAD. Mick is waiting by his horse, his
gun drawn. We hear the steps of Goddard and the bandit.
SECOND BANDIT'S VOICE
That's far enough.
The footsteps halt. Mick aims and fires.
BY WAGON. There is a half grunt, half groan from Goddard.
Haven turns as if to protest and then crumples as a gun fells
him.
CLOSE SHOT - Haven, lying face down on the ground,
unconscious.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
As day breaks.
CLOSE SHOT - Haven. Haven comes to, gradually clearing the
cobwebs. Then suddenly he remembers Goddard and the shot. He
makes his way to where Goddard's body lies a few feet up the
road. Goddard's right hand is half in his hip pocket, as if
in his last dying moment he was reaching for something. As
Haven pulls the hand out, he sees that Goddard's fingers
have closed around his wallet. Puzzled, Haven opens the
wallet. There is a stiff-backed daguerreotype of his wife,
an expired Union Pacific Railroad pass, an express receipt,
a souvenir bank-note of the Confederacy, and a small, closely-
folded piece of paper. Unfolding this, Haven sees the top
line:
"To Whom It May Concern"
HE READS FURTHER:
"This certifies that the bearer, James Goddard, is operating
as a legally deputized detective for Wells Fargo Stage and
Express Company."
Haven replaces the papers and lifts Goddard's body, carries
it to the stage and places it on the floor. He removes
Goddard's gun and shell belt and straps it on, closing the
stage door. Haven's face is grim as he studies the ground
nearby. The sticky mud shows clearly the new tracks of the
bandits' horses. As he starts unhitching one of his horses
from the wagon traces, we
DISSOLVE
A tiny clearing on a brush-filled knoll, where the remains
of a cooking fire are still visible, the ashes scattered
over the tamped-down ground. CAMERA PANS OVER TO Haven, on
horseback, as he studies the scene. This is where he evidently
made camp for the night. He dismounts, sifts the ashes through
his fingers to feel their warmth. He cannot be far behind.
Then he turns his attention to the trail loading away.
Inspection reveals that it divides, one group of fresh tracks
heading towards town, another smaller group further into the
mountains. He decides to follow the latter. As he mounts and
rides off:
DISSOLVE
A high spot from which Haven can get a good view. Off in the
distance he sees:
LONG SHOT - FROM his ANGLE. A lone rider, leading a pack
horse, barely visible through the timber. He is heading away
from him.
CLOSE SHOT - Haven. He spurs his horse forward.
FULL SHOT - Haven, in pursuit of the man ahead.
The bandit, unaware of his pursuer, puts his horse and the
gold-laden pack horse through the stream. He comes out into
a meadow on the other side.
PAN SHOT - WITH Haven, as he comes to the stream. Half way
across, his horse momentarily loses his footing on the
slippery rocks.
MED. SHOT - bandit. Hearing the noise of Haven's horse, he
turns and sees his pursuer, takes a quick shot back at him,
then heads for the other side of the meadow where there will
be shelter, firing back as he rides.
MED. CLOSE SHOT - Haven. He takes careful and deliberate aim
and fires.
FULL SHOT - FROM Haven's ANGLE. The bandit is almost at the
edge of the woods when Haven's shot gets him. He tumbles
from the saddle. Haven rides forward, gun ready in case it
is a trick.
It is no trick. The bandit is down where he fell. When Haven
turns him over, the man's eyes are already glazed. Haven
puts his lips close to the dying man's ear.
HAVEN
Who sent you?
The man only glares up at him. Haven tries again.
HAVEN
You're a goner, brother -- you can
talk.
The man holds Haven's gaze defiantly and silently as the
life goes out of him. Haven lowers him back to the ground,
rifles his pocket. There are no papers on him, no
identification. He stands up. He has the gold back, but he
is no closer to rounding up the whole gang than he was before.
Unless -- he is looking at the horses, placidly grazing. He
goes up to them, ties up the loose lead reins, draws his
belt off, and gives them each a sharp crack on the rump with
the buckle. They take off across the meadow at a gallop.
Haven lets them get a good start before he mounts his own
horse, and follows after them.
DISSOLVE
As Haven rides up to the edge of a downslope, gazes over a
broad valley, and sees:
LONG VIEW of a sawmill, nestled in the valley. It comprises
several sheds and buildings, with a long rank of stacked
logs beside the biggest shed, and all this is serviced by a
dirt road along which the two horses canter up to the camp.
Haven observes several men come out of the main office and
snag the two horses.
As two men who have snagged the horses now take off the gold
bags. In front of the office Pete, the camp boss, Ben and
Sam, two tough-looking accomplices, stand watching and
glancing up the road down which the horses came. There is a
frown on Pete's face.
BEN
Where's Joe?
(as Pete doesn't answer)
Something's gone wrong, Pete.
Pete looks thoughtfully at Joe's horse, pats his neck, again
locks up the road.
PETE
I know one thing. He was born on a
horse and he didn't just fall off
this one... go and take a look.
Two men mount and start away.
CLOSE SHOT of Haven. As he moves back out of sight. Obviously
he can't move into the camp now. Glancing off down the valley
he sees in the distance a work wagon approaching. It is still
hidden from sight of the sawmill by high ground between. He
puts his horse down the slope towards the approaching wagon,
at a tangent to the camp.
DISSOLVE
As the work wagon lumbers along. Its markings identify it as
belonging to the stageline Haven now manages. We recognize
Jerry the driver as Haven rides up. Jerry gives him a grin
and a salute.
JERRY
Hello there, Mr. Haven!
HAVEN
Hello, Jerry. What's the haul?
JERRY
This is that load of grub for the
sawmill.
HAVEN
Want to ride my horse back to town?
JERRY
What about the wagon here?
HAVEN
I'll finish the haul.
JERRY
You're the boss.
He climbs down as Haven dismounts and turns the horse over
to Jerry.
HAVEN
(throwing it away)
Any excitement in town?
JERRY
(grins)
Don't know, Mr. Haven. I left before
daybreak.
HAVEN
(relieved)
Take him easy. He's tired.
JERRY
I'll give him a good rubdown.
(mounting)
Haven watches him ride away, then climbs aboard the wagon.
Picking up the reins, he notices the bandages on his hands
and, not wanting to be identified by them, rips them off.
Blowing on his still sore knuckles, he drives toward the
sawmill.
DISSOLVE
As Haven's wagon lumbers in. He looks curiously at the main
office. No one is in sight, but as he draws nearer, the
swarthy hard-faced man, Pete, comes out on to the porch.
PETE
Hey, you!
Haven looks at him.
PETE
You see a rider comin' up?
HAVEN
Nope.
PETE
You sure?
HAVEN
Haven't even seen a lizard. Where do
I put this stuff?
PETE
Where did you put it before?
HAVEN
I never did. I'm a new driver. I
think it's grub.
PETE
Take it to the cook shack.
Haven flicks the reins, moves on. Pete watches suspiciously.
Haven moves on to the cook shack outside of which the cook
is busy dumping a pail of slop.
HAVEN
(pulling up)
You the cook?
COOK
Nah. I just wear this hat to keep
the flies out of my hair.
HAVEN
It don't matter to me, brother. I
just haul this grub. I'd just as
soon haul it back.
COOK
Take it next door.
Haven pulls up by the warehouse next door and gets down.
There is nobody around, so he starts wrestling with the food
crates himself, taking the first one into the warehouse.
It is big, barnlike, piled with provisions and equipment.
Haven stares around; carries the crate to where a similar
stack of crates are piled. Lowering the crate he notes a
shiny object, picks it up. It is a button from an army
uniform. He pockets it as his attention is distracted by two
horsemen passing outside. Haven goes out to continue
unloading.
As the two horsemen ride up to Pete and dismount. Ben and
Sam are standing there.
PETE
(to the horsemen)
Any luck?
BEN
No sign of Joe. But there's the tracks
of another horse, circling the mill
and coming back on the road just
north.
(he points)
PETE
That's bad.
He glances toward the wagon where Haven is working.
PETE
Let's go and look at this guy again.
The five men move down to Haven's wagon.
ANGLE ON wagon and Haven, as he sees them come. His lip
tightens; then he relaxes and goes on lifting a crate. He
pauses as they come up and stand around him, their eyes fixed
on:
PETE
You --
Haven looks at him.
PETE
You sure you didn't see no rider?
HAVEN
Look -- you want me to say I saw a
rider? I'll say it. I'll say I saw a
ghost. It don't make any difference
to me.
PETE
When did you get this job?
HAVEN
Yesterday.
PETE
What for?
HAVEN
It's the system. If I don't work I
don't eat. I never been able to find
any way to beat it.
PETE
Who hired you?
HAVEN
(blandly)
Mr. Haven.
PETE
The guy that had the fight?
HAVEN
Same fellow.
It is a risky little moment; Haven eases both bruised hands
into his coat pockets.
PETE
Friend of yours?
HAVEN
(innocently)
Who?
PETE
This Haven.
HAVEN
Any man who gives me a job is my
friend. Look, I'm working, I haul
this stuff out here. Nobody wants to
tell me where to dump it. Everybody
wants to know what I'm doin' and
what I haven't seen. I don't know. I
get thirty cents an hour. How smart
does that have to make me?
PETE
Don't get hot.
Pete's face relaxes; as do the grim faces of the others.
HAVEN
(grinning)
I ain't hot. I'm just mixed up.
PETE
Forget it. I got a load for you to
take back when you're done here.
HAVEN
Sure.
PETE
How soon?
HAVEN
Well, I haven't eaten anything but
dust since sun-up.
PETE
All right -- grab it quick.
(to the others)
Work on this stuff.
They start unloading and Haven goes to the cook house. Pete
watches him go. Ben notes it.
BEN
What do you think?
PETE
We risk him, that's all.
BEN
He don't look right to me.
PETE
He don't look any worse than the
rest of it looks right now.
(turning)
Come on, get this junk out.
He lends a hand with Ben and Sam.
Pete, Sam and Ben are waiting beside the gear box as we see
Haven bringing the wagon up.
BEN
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
PETE
Who said it was? I just want that
gold outa here the easiest and
quickest way.
They watch Haven as he pulls up the wagon. Pete looks hard
at his face. Haven has the pipe in his mouth again, looking
very blandly at them.
PETE
You see this box?
HAVEN
Sure.
PETE
It goes to Prince. Know who Prince
is?
HAVEN
Nope.
PETE
He runs things for Charlie. Know who
Charlie is?
HAVEN
Sure.
Haven climbs aboard. They look hard at him. He has stuck his
pipe in his mouth. He smiles at them and he picks up the
reins.
PETE
One thing...
Haven pauses.
PETE
That's a gear box you're hauling
back and it's got to be repaired.
And you tell Charlie that if it ain't
repaired we might have to shut down
quick. You got that?
HAVEN
I got it.
PETE
All right -- then get out of here!
Haven flicks the reins, grins at them and drives off. Ben is
still worried and stares after the departing wagon.
DISSOLVE
This is deserted country on the way to town. When the land
slopes steeply from the road down into a kind of wash, Haven
halts the wagon. He glances around. No sign of life. He takes
a hammer and chisel out of the tool box beside the seat,
crawls to the crate and prys it open. His cargo is gold.
Satisfied, he replaces the pried board, then pushes the crate
over the side. It topples down the bank, vanishes in the
brush at the bottom of the wash. With one more glance around,
Haven resumes his seat in the wagon, puts a match to his
pipe, and sends the horses forward at a faster clip.
DISSOLVE
LONG SHOT OF POST - DAY
DISSOLVE
SHOT FROM Haven's ANGLE to include street activity. As Mark
approaches, opens the door and enters.
Mick is standing outside, holding the arm of Jerry as he
talks to the kid. Beside him stands Pete Yore's man, Ben.
MICK
You sure it was Haven you met?
JERRY
Don't I know my own boss?
MICK
(giving him a shove)
Go in and get a beer.
As iles rides up. He is just about to enter, after
dismounting, when Mark Bristow comes out of the office. Mark
smiles and nods at the officer.
BRISTOW
Good evening, Captain.
ILES
(grimly)
Any news about Haven in town?
BRISTOW
I just saw Haven.
ILES
(abruptly)
Alive?
BRISTOW
(smiling)
Very much.
Mark mounts his horse, drives away.
As Haven and Mark come out. They walk towards the saloon.
People look at them curiously. Suddenly, down the street,
the sheriff appears, approaching Haven slowly and ominously.
Sensing a gun fight, people vanish. Purely from instinct,
Mark deserts Haven's side in a hurried walk towards the
saloon, eyeing both. Haven comes on leisurely. The sheriff
has stopped in his tracks and has his gun out. A woman
clutches her child to her skirt. Men stand stockstill,
watching. A crowd forms at the entrance to Charlie's. Haven
walks slowly forward until he reaches the waiting sheriff.
He looks him over with a smile of contempt.
SHERIFF
You're under arrest!
HAVEN
(pausing)
For what?
SHERIFF
For the murder of James Goddard --
and robbery under arms!
HAVEN
(casually)
I've heard about you. You don't appear
to understand the functions of your
office.
(taking sheriff's gun
and breaking it open)
You've missed the whole point of
your profession.
(showing him)
Even your gun isn't loaded.
(Haven loads it as it
goes on)
I suggest that you start all over
again, with this point in mind: the
duty of a peace officer is to arrest
the culprit of a crime -- not the
victim.
Haven hands him back the now loaded gun and walks away towards
the saloon, leaving the sheriff standing there, a completely
dumbfounded and bepuzzled man.
DISSOLVE
Haven, driving a wagon and team of horses, is retracing the
road he took back from the sawmill looking for the place
where he dumped the bullion.
CLOSER VIEW of Haven, as he looks for the landmarks. He is
whistling softly the tune that Charlie always sings. At last
he stops, alights and makes his way down the steep slope, a
couple of gunny sacks slung across his shoulder.
Bottom of the gulley as Haven gets there and locates the
crate at rest in a clump of brush. The crate has broken from
the fall. Haven loads the buckskin bags of gold into the
gunny sack and scrambles back up the slope.
Side of slope as Haven scrambles to the top, he finds himself
looking into a six-shooter held in the unwavering hand of
Mrs. Caslon. Her eyes are hard and a grim smile plays at the
corners of her mouth.
MRS. CASLON
Drop it.
Haven obeys.
MRS. CASLON
Turn around with your hands up.
Haven turns. She takes his gun and tosses it in the wagon;
then glances inside the sack, sees the gold. She backs off a
step or two.
MRS. CASLON
All right -- put it in the wagon.
Haven turns to obey. He manages a smile at her.
HAVEN
Is this a hold-up?
MRS. CASLON
You want to put it in the wagon?
HAVEN
(looking at her hard
eyes)
Yes.
He struggles with the sack, swings it onto the wagon in which
he came. Then stands back, looking at her.
MRS. CASLON
Now was there something you wanted
to say?
HAVEN
I trailed one of the bandits here
where they cached it. I couldn't
haul it on horseback, so I came here
with the wagon.
MRS. CASLON
I know that's a lie.
HAVEN
Some of it's true.
MRS. CASLON
But not nearly enough.
HAVEN
I'll try it again. I cached it here
myself. I was going to turn it over
to them. I wanted to buy a membership
in their club. This was the initiation
fee.
MRS. CASLON
Fifty thousand dollars?
HAVEN
Well, you see, I thought it was worth
it.
MRS. CASLON
Well, you see, I don't.
She climbs to the seat of the wagon watching him warily.
Haven doesn't move.
HAVEN
(quietly)
What you're doing may get me into
serious trouble.
MRS. CASLON
If you're still in town in twenty-
four hours, I promise what I do may
get you hanged.
She grabs the rein of her own horse, flicks the reins of the
wagon team and rides away, leaving Haven on the road,
horseless and very much discountenanced. He watches grimly
as she rides away. At a distance from him she tosses his gun
beside the road.
DISSOLVE
As Haven leaves the saloon. He pauses, looks around, up at
the sky, then down the street. He takes out his pipe and
beginning filling it slowly with tobacco, as Mark Bristow
comes hurrying across the street.
MOVING SHOT of Haven as he walks very slowly, filling the
pipe, and Mark comes alongside and walks with him. Haven
hardly glances at him.
BRISTOW
I've been looking for you. Where
have you been?
HAVEN
I took a walk in the country.
BRISTOW
Did you get it for her?
HAVEN
No.
(pausing in front of
the hotel)
Sorry.
MED. SHOT of Haven and Mark outside the hotel. Mark is afraid
and puzzled. He keeps staring at Haven's face.
BRISTOW
But that was the deal. You agreed to --
He pauses as two men walk by.
BRISTOW
If you're trying to pull something --
HAVEN
(finished with the
pipe)
You want to listen?
BRISTOW
(calming himself)
All right.
HAVEN
(explicitly)
I can't deliver it because I no longer
have it. It was taken away from me
by Mrs. Caslon. I've told Charlie,
and she's very unhappy. I have two
hours to produce the loot. You haven't
any idea where a man could raise
fifty thousand quickly, have you?
Mark's mouth pops open.
HAVEN
I thought not.
Haven lights the pipe. Mark stands there, mouth open; fear
draining the blood from his face. His voice is a mere whisper.
BRISTOW
What are you going to do...?
HAVEN
Nothing, Mark. The boat just sailed.
BRISTOW
What about me?
HAVEN
You'll have to think of something
very good.
Mark stares at him, then looks off. His face becomes grim.
He almost glares back at Haven.
BRISTOW
I can think of something.
HAVEN
(patting his shoulder
with a slight smile)
Go ahead, Mark. Go ahead and do it.
Mark stares at him, then turns abruptly away. He hurries
across the street. Haven watches him as he goes off in the
direction of Mrs. Caslon. Haven smiles and walks inside the
hotel.
WIPE
As Mark hurries into the saloon, a desperate look on his
face.
As Haven emerges and the Sheriff holds a gun on him.
ANGLE on Mick as down the street, with disgust, he lowers
his gun.
ANGLE on Prince as from a doorway he watches. Stopping with
a shake of his head the intent of a man beside him to shoot.
FULL SHOT -- street -- as Haven surrenders to the sheriff.
SHERIFF
All right, you -- march.
Haven obeys, walking up the street -- the sheriff and the
sheriff's horse behind him. People watch, appearing now in
safety. The sheriff is pretty pleased.
MOVING SHOT -- of Haven and Sheriff. As they go, Haven's
hands still aloft.
HAVEN
You loaded your gun for this?
SHERIFF
No -- you did.
Back of them can now be seen the figures of Mick and Prince
and the other gunman, following at a little distance. Going
leisurely, now Haven slows his pace so that the sheriff is
closer behind him.
SHERIFF
Come on, you! Keep moving!
Haven suddenly drops to his knees. The sheriff almost walks
over him. The sheriff stumbles with an oath. Haven grapples
with him. Haven snatches his gun, drags him by a headlock to
the horse, flings him aside and then mounts. A second later
he is away. Shots RING OUT as Mick and Prince and the gunman
shoot. Haven rides on, bent low, out of town. The sheriff
hides his bulk in the dust as the bullets fly.
ANGLE from Charlie's office -- as she goes to the window,
stares out at the flying form of Haven. A slow smile comes
over her face, bitter and grim, yet somehow faintly
admiring... She sees Mick mount a horse and start after Haven.
Then she turns abruptly away.
WIPE
As Haven slows down his horse, but goes on at a fair clip
after looking warily back. He breaks open the sheriff's gun,
finds it loaded. He reacts and whistles softly. As he swings
his horse off the travelled road to head crosscountry for
the sawmill.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
As Haven sits on his horse at a point in the woods where he
can look down on the sawmill. Around the mill office there
seems to be signs of unusual activity. Haven sees Mick Marion
going by on the road towards the mill. Mick passes not far
away and is riding hard. Haven watches as Mick arrives and
Pete can be seen in conference with him. Other men -- too
many -- are gathered around. At last Haven dismounts and
makes his way carefully on foot towards the warehouse.
As Haven leaves his horse in the brush and trees and then
approaches the building. He finds a window in back, breaks
it with a stone; then waits tensely to see if the sound has
attracted any attention, gun in hand now. It doesn't. Haven
replaces the gun in his holster, opens the window and crawls
inside.
As the shot RINGS out. Pete and Mick, surrounded by many
men, turn swiftly. Flame and smoke emerge from the warehouse.
They start swiftly across, drawing guns. The man at the door
shoots again into the smoking interior. An answering SHOT
from Haven fells him.
As Haven starts for the woods. The flames now light the ground
around, and Pete appears around the side of the building.
Pete fires and Haven draws and shoots. Pete whirls away, hit
but still on his feet, driving forward, trying to shoot again
and this time Haven drills him clean and Pete goes down to
stay. Other men come up as Haven makes for the woods,
disappears.
Mick Marion and a dozen men appear, shooting. Mick suddenly
changes his mind, turns past the body of Pete, gets his horse
and heads back to town full tilt.
As Haven rides up, a detachment of men supervised by Stellman
is forming beside mounts in the parade ground. Haven dismounts
and starts inside. He glances at his wagon parked outside.
It is the one Mrs. Caslon took from him. He smiles slightly
as he notes it.
As Haven walks outside towards his waiting horse. He pauses,
pipe in mouth, lighting the pipe now, his face intensely
interested as he watches the men form on the parade ground
in front of the mounted Iles and Stellman.
FULL SHOT of soldiers. As they mount to a brisk command, and
the color bearer takes position. Iles barks out a command;
the column forms into marching order. On the double quick,
the cavalry company starts out and on the way.
CLOSE SHOT of Haven as he watches; his eyes lighting a little,
the pipe in hand. We feel that he'd like to go too in this
moment.
ANOTHER ANGLE from Haven's view, as the column of cavalry
departs. Haven waves his hand, a half salute, a half gesture
to Iles as Iles salutes him in passing. Then only the dust
remains and Haven's gaze lingers. His face changes. It becomes
grim. He slowly knocks the ashes from the pipe, pockets it.
He slowly mounts the horse. He takes out his gun and checks
it. Then slowly he rides away, like a man on a mission he
dislikes but cannot evade.
As Iles rides by at full gallop, followed by a troop of
cavalry, headed for the sawmill.
Haven, mounted, is coming up the street. Slowly and carefully
he progresses to the front of the saloon.
As Haven comes up to the saloon door.
As Haven pauses, pushes it open. Then walks slowly in.
