A REPORTER comes to us from the frontlines.

(to camera)
 that time again, the annual open It s
call for the Los Angeles Devil Girls. The 
premier dance team in professional 
basketball, Devil Girls are celebrities 
in their own right, tantalizing fans in 
the nosebleeds on down to the movie 
stars, recording artists and politicians 
in the front row. Some have even gone on 
to become megastars in their own right, 
from Grammy winners and supermodels to 
choreographers and fashion moguls. Some 
little girls love to play with them--

over the country for their chance to make 
that dream a reality.

Behind her, hopefuls ham for the camera.5.



MARISSA (25, White), a giant ball of energy, smiles and waves 
frantically at the camera before dropping into a split.

KYLE (25, White), sex on legs, does a twirl in a crazy-short 
skirt then runs up and kisses the camera.

Sizing up the crowd, current captain JELENA HOWARD (27, 
African American). Already in a Devil Girls warm-up jacket, 
she is the Barbie doll. Literally.

OLIVIA (O.S.)
Survey says?

Former Devil Girl-turned-basketball wife OLIVIA MICHAELS (40, 
white) joins her. Everything about her reeks excess, from her 
$80,000 Dolce & Gabbana sunglasses to her custom made 
Christian Louboutins.

nothing but a skid mark.

So tempting. She looks at him. Then back at the stadium. 


Raquel rummages through the action figures and pee wee soccer 
gear in her trunk, pulling out the change of clothes she was 
looking for. She slams the trunk shut, revealing JESSE READE 
 cover up the bare knuckle (30s). His suit and tie can t
brawler underneath.20.



RAQUEL
Jesus.

JESSE
Close. Looking good, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Thanks. I have to get back inside, they 
could call me--

He steps closer, blocking her way. 

JESSE

 girlfriend last time I had him. I don t
want to deal with that tomorrow.  
Whatever you told him about her, fix it.

RAQUEL

AHSHA
What kind of deadbeat dad drives a Lexus?

RAQUEL
The kind that manages half the players on 
this team.

Shaken, Raquel heads inside. Ahsha just follows.


Ahsha runs, the two other newbies in the distance. She rounds 
a corner, then hits a wall. A 6 7  broad shouldered wall that 
knocks her to the ground. 

Derek.

AHSHA
Oh my God.

DEREK
Are you okay?

She s legitimately dazed. He helps her to her feet, using his 
body to slide her up. They re close.

DEREK (cont d)
You got all these curves but no brakes.

Wow. Really?

AHSHA

and Devil Girls?

DEREK

She eyes him.

DEREK (cont d)

DEREK
Cold shower for me then.

He takes off his shirt, unveiling obscene abs. A little show 
 for her as he heads inside, and God damn it if it didn t
work. The dude is an Adonis.
