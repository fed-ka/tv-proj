                                          TEASER

  FADE IN:

  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

  Police helicopters hover above the city at night. They shine 
  their floodlights down on --

  EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - SAME MOMENT

  A crime scene, deep in the park. Police lights glow. Uniform 
  cops tape off the area. Detectives COTTON and GILMORE step from 
  their car, taking in the chaos. They walk toward a body. 

  Gilmore kneels over the dead man who has been badly beaten. He 
  checks the back of his head. Cotton watches.

                                COTTON
                Well?

                              GILMORE
                We need to call the FBI. It s 
                starting again. 

  As a spotlight washes over them, illuminating the lonely scene 
  and we --

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. NOE STREET - NIGHT

  BEN MARKS, 40, and his daughter JANE, 14, exit a building. The 
  sound of the police helicopters fills the air. They look up to 
  see the spotlights in the distance. They walk and talk. 

                              BEN
                Are you hungry? Do you want to grab 
                  something?

                              JANE
                Don t try and act like you care.

                              BEN
                I just want to know if you re 
                hungry. 

                              JANE
                No. I m not hungry. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  2.

    CONTINUED:

  Ben pauses, exasperated, then continues. Behind them, we see a 
  MAN walking. He slows his pace and falls in behind them. 

                              BEN
                I m not the enemy, Jane. 

                              JANE
                Of course not. My friends are, 
                right? And David. 

                              BEN
                You re fourteen. It s too young to 
                go on dates, especially with a boy 
                who s already driving. 

                              JANE
                Mom thinks you work too much. 

                              BEN
                What does that have to do with 
                  anything?

                              JANE
                It s not my fault if you two aren t 
                getting along. 

                              BEN
                I m not saying it is.

                              JANE
                No, you re just trying to ship me 
                off. 

                              BEN
                Your mom and I love you. 

                              JANE
                Don t even. 

  On Ben. The noise and spotlights of the helicopters seem to add 
  to the father-daughter stress. A beat. 

                              BEN
                Okay. You want to be treated like 
                an adult, fine. Let s have an adult 
                  conversation... 

  When Ben notices that the man following has stopped too. 

                              BEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                Can I help you?

  The man, our UNSUB, stares at Jane. We don t see his face. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  3.

    CONTINUED: (2)

                              UNSUB
                Hi, Jane. 

                              BEN
                How do you know my daughter s name?

  He raises a gun. 

                              UNSUB (CONT D)
                You come quiet or you both die. 

  The sound of the helicopters rises as we --

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - DAY

  A flash of daylight as the front door opens, briefly letting 
  sunlight into the dank surroundings. HOTCH steps in. He sizes up 
  the dive and walks toward --

  INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - BACK BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

  A booth. SAM COOPER sits drinking coffee and reading from a 
  batch of files. He s 50, intense, quiet and dressed like he 
  belongs in the place. His head is in a file as he HEARS --

                              HOTCH
                You never were one for offices. 

  Cooper looks up to see Hotch. They shake. 

                                COOPER
                Thanks for coming. 

                              HOTCH
                I don t have long. I m leaving on a 
                case. 

                                COOPER
                I know. San Francisco. 
                          (off Hotch)
                I hear things. 

  Hotch sits. 

                              HOTCH
                What s going on?

                                COOPER
                How much do you know about the case 
                you re working?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  4.

    CONTINUED:

                              HOTCH
                I m on my way in to look at the 
                files. 

                                COOPER
                Let me give you a preview. 

  And Hotch now realizes these files are all his case. Odd. Cooper 
  opens one. He flips through CRIME SCENE PHOTOS as --

                                COOPER (CONT D) (cont d)
                Two years ago a male body turned up 
                in Golden Gate Park. Massive amount 
                of blunt force trauma, defensive 
                wounds, single gunshot to the back 
                of the head. Over the next three 
                days, three more bodies, same M.O. 
                After that, nothing. Until ...
                          (opens second file)
                Exactly one year later. Dead male, 
                badly beaten, shot execution style 
                followed by three more vics over 
                the next three days. 

                              HOTCH
                Until last night. 

                                COOPER
                One year later. 

                              HOTCH
                Which means we have three days to 
                crack this thing before the trail 
                goes cold again. 

  Cooper nods. Takes a sip of coffee. 

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                So, why all the interest?

                                COOPER
                San Francisco PD sent us the file a 
                year ago after the trail went cold. 
                  I consulted on the phone.  

                              HOTCH
                And?

                                COOPER
                I have a theory. It might be 
                nothing. 

  A beat. Cooper waves over a WAITRESS. She pours coffee. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  5.

    CONTINUED: (2)

                                COOPER (CONT D) (cont d)
                You want coffee?

                              HOTCH
                How is it?

                                COOPER
                When was the last time you had a 
                tetanus shot?

                              HOTCH
                          (to waitress)
                I m good, thanks. 

  She walks away. Cooper opens a third file. CSPs of --

                                COOPER
                Two years ago, the day after the 
                murders stopped, a single dad and 
                his fifteen-year-old brunette 
                daughter were found dead in their 
                car. He d been badly beaten and had 
                  defensive wounds. They were both 
                shot multiple times. 

  And, file number four. We see photos of --

                                COOPER (CONT D) (cont d)
                Last year, again one day after the 
                dead males stopped showing up, 
                another father and his brunette 
                  daughter. This one was fourteen. 
                Same wounds on the dad. They were 
                found in their home. Unsub killed 
                the wife as well. All were shot 
                multiple times. 

                              HOTCH
                You think it s all connected?

                                COOPER
                I think it s a hell of a 
                  coincidence. 

                              HOTCH
                The police disagreed?

                                COOPER
                  Ballistics didn t match. Neither 
                set was dumped like the male 
                victims. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  6.

    CONTINUED: (3)

                              HOTCH
                Which is why my team caught the 
                case this year instead of yours. 
                San Francisco PD wants a team with 
                no preconceptions. 

  Cooper nods. But --

                                COOPER
                The fathers and daughters? Turns 
                out both sets had been awol for 
                days before they turned up dead but 
                no one ever reported them missing. 
                  Something s not right. 

                              HOTCH
                  I promise we ll check it out. 

                                COOPER
                That s not what I m saying. You 
                only have three days. You don t 
                have time to go chasing this.

                              HOTCH
                Then, what?

                                COOPER
                Bring my team in. You work the 
                bodies in Golden Gate Park. We ll 
                test my theory about the fathers 
                and daughters. If I m right, each 
                half of the case helps solve the 
                other. 

                              HOTCH
                I ll call the Director. Tell her 
                you re working the case with us.

  He puts out his hand to shake but ... nothing. 

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                You already asked her...

                                COOPER
                She s not what I d call strong at 
                thinking outside the box. 

                              HOTCH
                What d she say?






                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  7.

    CONTINUED: (4)

                                COOPER
                  Something about not authorizing an 
                  investigation when we don t even 
                know if there s a father and 
                daughter missing. 

  A beat. 

                              HOTCH
                If you ignore her order, it s your 
                career on the line. 

                                COOPER
                Won t be the last time. 

                              HOTCH
                I m serious. 

                                COOPER
                So am I. 

  A beat. Hotch considers. 

                                COOPER (CONT D) (cont d)
                I m telling you. Right now, there s 
                a father and daughter missing in 
                San Francisco and, for whatever 
                reason, no one s looking for them.

                              HOTCH
                Don t bring your whole team. It ll 
                be harder for her to know you re 
                defying orders if you leave a 
                couple behind. Can you set up shop 
                on your own?

                                COOPER
                Are you kidding me?

                              HOTCH
                I ll see you in San Francisco. 

  They shake. Hotch exits. Cooper picks up the files. As he looks 
  at one of the CSPs of the father-daughter murders --

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. CELL - DAY

  It s cold, dark, wet. Ben and Jane are each chained separately

                Stop it... Please... Just stop.

  And Ben stops, exhausted. The door opens. The UNSUB enters. 

                              UNSUB
                Are you okay?

                              BEN
                Get away from her.

                I heard screaming. 

                              BEN
                I said get away from her. 

  The Unsub just stares down Ben. Ben is powerless. 

                              BEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                What the hell do you want?

                It s simple. You give her to me, 
                you both live. 

                              BEN
                Go to hell. 

  The Unsub stares at Jane. A beat. 

                              UNSUB
                If that s your answer. 

  He exits. As Ben and Jane watch the door slam behind him.

                Mother Teresa said:  I have found 
                the paradox, that if you love until 
                it hurts, there can be no more 
                hurt, only more love. 

  INT. BAU JET - DAY

  Hotch with ROSSI, PRENTISS, MORGAN and REID. Files out. JJ steps

                              JENNIFER
                San Francisco police already have a 
                war room set up for us. They know 
                we only have a three-day window. 

                              ROSSI
                What do we know about the past 
                years  victims?

                              REID
                The Tenderloin District has a high 
                  concentration of drug addicts and 
                homeless people. The victims were 
                all transients from the area. 

  They look at the CSPs of past victims. 

                                MORGAN
                So, the Unsub s choosing easy 
                targets that won t be missed. That 
                tells me he s not concerned with 
                the challenge of the hunt. The 
                victims are part of a larger plan. 

                              PRENTISS
                Which he executes on the same few 
                days every year.

                              HOTCH
                Have we found any significance to 
                the dates?

                Nothing historically. It must be

                              JENNIFER
                I ll have Garcia run the last ten 
                years of crime records for the days 
                in question. Maybe it s some kind 
                of anniversary. 

  Hotch nods. Good. And --

                              HOTCH
                You and Reid get set up in the 
                police station. Dave and Morgan, 
                head to the coroner s office. 
                Prentiss and I will go to the dump 
                site. I don t think any of us 
                should plan on getting much sleep 
                the next three days. 

                              ROSSI
                What about Cooper s team? You said 
                he had a theory. 

                              HOTCH
                They ll work it themselves. If they 
                get a lead, they ll bring it to us.

                                MORGAN
                Why not come along for the ride? 

                              HOTCH
                They re working off the clock. 

  The others share a look. That s weird.

                They ve got their own way of doing 
                things. I m sure you ve heard the

                So, they won t be at the police

  INT. STORE FRONT - CONTINUOUS

  A small travel agency. We move past a pair of WOMEN, quietly 
  going about their business until we reach --

  INT. BACK ROOM HQ - CONTINUOUS

  A dark, dusty back room. Cooper drags a chalk board as MICK 
  FLEMING and PROPHET carry in an evidence board. Mick is 30, 
  British. He s scruffy and charming. He also knows it. Prophet is 
  in his 30s. His edge is street smart but he has a layer of calm.

                              MICK
                When we finish setting up, remind 
                me to tell the ladies out front the 
                travel agency business is dead. 

  A light comes on. Reveal GINA LaSALLE on a ladder. She s hooked 
  a makeshift light up with an extension cord. She s 28, equally 
  tough, pretty and smart in the same no-nonsense way. 

                              GINA
                Leave them alone. 

  Gina descends and begins dragging a table across the floor. 

                              MICK
                Turns out there s this thing called 
                the internet. You can actually book 
                tickets on your own now. 

                              GINA
                Don t think I won t hurt you. 

                              MICK
                Don t think I won t like it. 

  She picks a pile of laptops and extension cords off the ground.

                                COOPER
                Don t look at me. She s the one who 
                told me to drag the chalk board.

                 Least we re blessed with a nice 
                setup. 

  The others nod. And now we get a good look. It s a shithole. 

                              PROPHET (cont d)
                How d you hook it up?

                                COOPER
                You know how it goes. I know a guy 
                who knows a guy who knows a 
                  slumlord.

                              MICK
                You pack a crystal ball? 

                              GINA
                Don t be a smartass. 

                              MICK
                  Seriously. How are we supposed to 
                conjure potential victims of a 
                crime that might not have been 
                  committed out of thin air in a 
                major American city?

  Cooper takes chalks and writes: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3.

                  forty-five percent is white. What

                And physical enough to haul a body 
                a long way on his own. The closest 
                parking area is a good half mile 
                away.

                What can you tell us about the 
                victims?

                                COTTON
                Not much. They were all living on 
                the street. No witnesses. Our guess 
                is he s managed to lure them by 
                  promising food or drugs. 

                              HOTCH
                Were any reported missing?

                                COTTON
                No. But, honestly, once you re 
                living in the Tenderloin, you re as 
                good as gone already.

  INT. CORONER - DAY

  A drawer pulls out, revealing a dead body. The CORONER stands 
  with Rossi and Morgan. The body is horribly bruised.  

                              CORONER
                His internal organs had a lot of 
                damage as well.

                If he hadn t been shot, he probably 
                would have died eventually from 
                internal bleeding. 

  Rossi lifts up the man s hands. Each are bruised and swollen.

                              ROSSI
                He definitely landed a few shots of 
                his own. 

  Morgan takes note of scratch marks on the dead man s chest. 

                                MORGAN
                There s not a lot of junkies who 
                have this much fight in them. Did 
                you run a tox screen?

                              CORONER
                He was clean. 

  A beat. Weird. Rossi tilts the man s head sideways to see --

                              ROSSI
                There s powder residue against his 
                skull. He had to have been subdued 
                when he was shot. 

                                MORGAN
                So, he gets abducted off the street 
                quietly enough that we ve got no 
                  witnesses then fights for his life, 
                only to let the Unsub shoot him 
                  execution style?

                              ROSSI
                In other words -- what the hell s 
                this guy doing with them?

                                                                              CUT TO:

  And the door opens. The Unsub steps in.

                One more chance. Will you give her

  a set of keys to Ben.

                Walk. 

  Ben walks. Once he s past the Unsub and Jane, the Unsub falls in 
  behind him, his gun on Ben. They exit, leaving the door ajar as 
  they enter --    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  19.


  INT. FIGHTING AREA - CONTINUOUS

    A warehouse-style space. A square area seems to have been taped 
  off, on the ground. Across the way, Ben sees --

  A MAN, shirtless, chained to a pole. His body is covered in 
  welts. Behind the man, Ben can just make out TWO other MEN, 
  locked in separate rooms. The Unsub keeps the gun on Ben. 

                              UNSUB
                Unchain him. 

  Ben walks to the other man and unlocks him. The moment he does -- 
  bam -- the other man punches Ben. He drops to a knee. 

                              UNSUB (CONT D) (cont d)
                Not yet. 

  Ben stands. He s trying to clear his head from the punch. 

                              UNSUB (CONT D) (cont d)
                Keys. Slide them.

  Ben slides them. The Unsub keeps at a distance, gun raised.

                I kill your daughter and I kill

  Ben looks at the other man, waiting to fight. Ben nods and the 
  Unsub steps back, giving way to --

  The other man. He lunges. Ben manages to sidestep but the man 
  kicks at Ben. The pain seems to awaken Ben to the reality. The 
  man swings. Ben ducks then lands a punch. The man s mouth 
  bleeds. Ben grabs his own hand. Landing the punch was painful. 

  The other man lands a shot to the body. Ben winces but head-
  butts the other man. He reels then takes a swing. Blood pours 
  from the cut. As they stand, trading blows --

  Jane, watches through the half-open cell door. Off her.

                Ma am? Are you okay?

                Just get inside. Please. 

  They step in. She nervously scans the street as --

  Leslie closes the door. Hotch and Cooper watch. 

                                COOPER
                We re trying to determine whether 
                your husband and daughter are 
                missing. 

                                LESLIE
                Oh, god. 

                              HOTCH
                Mrs. Marks?

  She looks through the window, to the street. 

                                LESLIE
                The man who called said he was 
                watching me. 

                                COOPER
                So, someone has abducted them?

                                LESLIE
                He said if he saw anyone from the 
                police or FBI step foot in my 
                house, he d kill Ben and Jane. 

  A beat. Hotch and Cooper process as Leslie says --

                                LESLIE (CONT D) (cont d)
                You just got my family murdered. 

  Off Hotch and Cooper.

                                        ACT TWO

  FADE IN:

  INT. MARKS  HOUSE - DAY

  A grainy video tape. A badly beaten man kneels against a plain 
  white wall. His feet and hands are bound. The Unsub, approaches, 
  his faces covered by a ski mask. He puts a gun to the back of 
  the man s head. Fires. He falls. 

  Leslie watches, shaken, along with Hotch and Cooper. 

                              HOTCH
                That s the victim from the park. 

                                LESLIE
                The man on the phone told me he had 
                Ben and Jane and he d kill them if 
                  I brought in the police. He said if 
                I needed proof, I should check my 
                front porch. When I opened the 
                door, this tape was there. 

                                COOPER
                He s careful. There s nothing to 
                  distinguish him or his location. 

                              HOTCH
                Did he give any other instructions?

                                LESLIE
                He said he d call with more. 

                                COOPER
                I ll have the tape analyzed. We ll 
                also need access to your phone 
                records to see if we can determine 
                where he called from. 

                                LESLIE
                Do you think he s watching? Is he 
                going to kill them?

                              HOTCH
                This video was shot from a tripod 
                which means he probably doesn t 
                have a partner. It would be almost 
                  impossible to hold your family 
                prisoner and do surveillance on you 
                  simultaneously. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  25.

    CONTINUED:

                                LESLIE
                And he s done this before? Why 
                didn t someone come forward later 
                to say what happened?

                                COOPER
                The first time was a single father 
                and his daughter. The second time, 
                he brought them home and also 
                killed the wife. He doesn t leave 
                anyone with knowledge alive. 

  A beat as Leslie processes this. 

                              HOTCH
                Where were your husband and 
                daughter before they were taken?

                                LESLIE
                On Tuesdays, Jane always goes to a 
                friend s after school then meets 
                Ben at his office to drive home.

                                COOPER
                Who else knows that routine?

                                LESLIE
                I don t know. No one. A few 
                friends, maybe?

                                COOPER
                We re gonna need you to write down 
                names of anyone who might even 
                possibly know. Can you do that?

                              HOTCH
                We ll post agents here with you, to 
                keep you safe. 

  She nods. Hotch moves, guiding Cooper away as he says --

                              HOTCH (cont d)
                Can you excuse me a moment. 

  INT. MARKS  HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

  Hotch and Cooper enter the living room. A private conversation.

                              HOTCH
                Your theory was right. Now, let us 
                work it. If you get back to D.C. 
                now, the Director will never know 
                you ignored her orders. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  26.

  A beat. Cooper takes a photo of a young BOY from his wallet. 

                                COOPER
                Do you know who this is?

                              HOTCH
                No. 

                                COOPER
                Wanna know why? ... Cuz no one 
                knows the name of a dead kid from 
                some case we didn t actually work.

  A beat. Hotch waits him out. Cooper looks at the photo.

                                COOPER (cont d)
                There s no chance I m gonna leave 
                until we know if Ben Marks and his 
                daughter are safe. If anyone has a 
                problem with that they can go to 
                hell. 

  Hotch considers this. A beat.

                              HOTCH
                We can pair up your team with mine. 
                Anything we investigate will have 
                to be documented. So, we ll have my 
                people on the record and use yours 
                to double the manpower. 

  Cooper nods. Thank you. Hotch s phone rings. He answers.

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                  Hotchner... Where? ... Are we sure 
                it s our Unsub? ... Okay. Yeah. 

  Leslie enters. She s caught the end of the Hotch s conversation. 

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                They found another body.

                                LESLIE
                Is it my husband?

                              HOTCH
                I m afraid we don t know yet.

  EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

  Prentiss and Mick exit an SUV. In the distance, we see a crime 
  scene. They walk and talk toward it. 

                              PRENTISS
                So, how does a Brit --

                              MICK
                  A handsome Brit?

                              PRENTISS
                How does a Brit end up in the FBI?

                              MICK
                I was in Her Majesty s Special 
                Forces. Cooper and I bumped into 
                each other a few times. Ten months 
                ago, they told him he could hand-
                pick a new team. He called, I came. 
                Passport didn t matter.

                              PRENTISS
                You know, there s a lot of rumors 
                about your boss. 

                              MICK
                Yeah?

                              PRENTISS
                One I heard, when he first left the 
                BAU, he was running psychological 
                ops overseas. 

                              MICK
                I ve never been big on rumors. 

                              PRENTISS
                So, I suppose you won t say just 
                where you two  bumped into each 
                other? 

  He stops. 

                              MICK
                I ll tell you I trust him with my 
                life. I ll tell you I d die for the 
                man. 

  A beat and he keeps walking. Prentiss watches him a moment then 
  catches up at the crime scene. Mick walks to the dead body. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  28.

  He pulls a photo out of his pocket. Tilts the victim s head to 
  get a good look. A beat. As he looks back up at Prentiss --

                                                                              CUT TO:

  Hotch on the phone. Cooper tries to guide Leslie away. She holds 
  a piece of paper. 

                                COOPER
                Mrs. Marks, please. 

                              HOTCH
                Are you certain? Okay. Thanks.

  -- And Morgan and Gina enter from the opposite direction. Leslie 
  looks at Cooper. Her world is spinning. 

                                COOPER
                Don t worry. They parked on a side 
                road and entered through the back. 

  As Hotch hangs up. Leslie turns. 

                              HOTCH
                The body in Golden Gate Park is not 
                your husband. 

                                LESLIE
                You re sure?

                              HOTCH
                One of the agents there has your 
                  husband s license photo. He s sure. 

  And the weight of this hits Leslie. They give her a moment. 

                                COOPER
                These are Agents LaSalle and 
                Morgan. They re going to stay here 
                with you and make sure you re safe. 

                                LESLIE
                Thank you. 

  As Hotch and Cooper exit, Gina pulls Cooper to the side. 

                              GINA
                I won t be any use here.

                You re someone s daughter. Talk to 
                her. See what we can learn about 
                the girl. Every bit helps. 

                              GINA
                I m not good at sitting still. 

                                COOPER
                Then get better at it. 

  A beat. He exits, toward Hotch. Gina walks to Morgan and Leslie. 
  Gina s conversation has been private but Morgan has noticed. 
  Leslie hands over the piece of paper. 

                                LESLIE
                This is everyone who might know Ben 
                and Jane s routine. 

                                MORGAN
                Good. We re going to set up a trap 
                and trace on your phone in case the 
                man who took your husband and 
                daughter calls again. 

                              GINA
                We also need to ask you some 
                  questions. Do you feel up to that?
                          (she nods)
                Is there anyone you can think of 
                that might want to harm your 
                  daughter?

                                LESLIE
                I don t know. Honestly, lately 
                she s felt like a stranger. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. CELL - DAY

  Ben is badly beaten. Across the cell, Jane sits huddled, not 
  speaking. You get the sense it s been like this for hours. 

                              BEN
                I need you to listen to me because 
                it might be the last time I ever 
                get to talk to you.

  We see Jane, not facing him but listening.

                  I haven t been a good enough 
                father. You re fourteen and you 
                have no idea how terrifying that 
                is. And, instead of listening to 
                you or remembering my own fights 
                with my dad, I ve tried to control 
                what you do and who you see because 
                I wanted to keep you safe and I 
                wanted you to go off to school and 
                get a good job and maybe some day 
                fall in love and ask me to walk you 
                down the aisle. But I never 
                bothered to ask you if that s what 
                you want and I m so sorry. I m 
                still your dad, it s my job to look 
                out for you, but I should have been 
                a better listener too. 

  A beat. Ben pauses. Jane listens. 

                              BEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                I know you can hear me. I m not 
                asking you to say anything. I just 
                want you to know that I understand 
                I can t control everything. But I 
                also need the last words you hear

  Quiet. Prentiss and Mick examine the victim. Finally --

                              MICK
                So, let s start with what s really 
                weird. The Tenderloin is full of 
                junkies who d be easy to control 
                but the first victim had no drugs 
                in his system and this geezer looks 
                pretty healthy too. You know, 
                except for the whole dead thing.

  Prentiss nods. True. Mick checks the victim s fingernails.

                              MICK (CONT D) (cont d)
                He s got skin under his nails. 
                Didn t the first victim have 
                scratch marks on his chest?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  31.

    CONTINUED:

                              PRENTISS
                We assumed he fought back against 
                the Unsub but the victims might 
                actually be fighting each other.

                              MICK
                Exactly. 

                              PRENTISS
                I take it you re about to wow me 
                with a theory. 

                              MICK
                The first victim is dumped before 
                the fathers and daughters are 
                taken. Why?

                              PRENTISS
                He needs to prove to the wife that 
                he means business. He has to make 
                sure she doesn t call the police. 

                              MICK
                And it also sends a message to the 
                  prisoners he already has. You lose 
                a fight, you die. It s easier to 
                control them if their aggression is 
                focused on each other...  What do 
                these welts look like to you?

                              PRENTISS
                My guess, they re wounds from 
                rubber bullets. 

                              MICK
                Like they use to control rioters or 
                prison inmates. 

                              PRENTISS
                Okay. 

                              MICK
                Go with me here... I think the 
                Unsub s been locked up. It s where 
                he learned to control his own 
                  prisoners. 

                              PRENTISS
                So, why are they fighting?

                Romans used inmates for gladiator 
                  competitions? 

                              PRENTISS
                And the losers get executed. 

                              MICK
                They were special events. Certain 
                times a year. Only for a few days. 

  Mick nods. Holds out his hands: well?

                Admit it. I m starting to grow on

  Prentiss takes out her phone.

                Hotch, it s Emily. We have an idea 
                what he might be doing with them. 
                We might be ready to give a

  Mick is dialing his phone. Prentiss says to him --

                We think the Unsub most likely 
                spent time in prison. If he s 
                local, that means San Quentin. With 
                his level of organization and his 
                  obsession with these specific 
                dates, there s a chance someone 
                who s still inside might recognize 
                him from the profile. 

                              REID
                Can we get prisoners to cooperate?

                The Unsub we re looking for very 
                likely has a prison record. 

                              REID
                He s white and, judging by the age 
                of the men he abducts, probably in 
                his thirties. 

                              HOTCH
                  Considering the terrain in which he 
                dumps the bodies, we believe he s 
                  physically imposing or, at the very 
                least, extremely fit. 

                              REID
                He also has access to a space 
                that s large enough to house and 
                control a number of prisoners 
                without disturbing any neighbors.

                I don t understand what any of this 
                has to do with Ben and Jane. 

                              GINA
                We think the man who took them has 
                  a daughter of his own. She s most 
                likely a brunette, like Jane. 

                                MORGAN
                The dates he chooses probably 
                  correspond to an event involving 
                his daughter. We just have to 
                figure out what that is. 

                                LESLIE
                And you think he s making these men 
                fight each other?

                                MORGAN
                Our guess is he lost his own 
                daughter in some way and it s 
                symbolic of him not fighting for 
                her in the first place. 

                                LESLIE

                A lot of times, killers choose 
                victims that are surrogates for 
                someone else, like a wife or 
                mother. In this case, we think his 
                own guilt is making him choose 
                  surrogates that represent himself.

                              TRE
                I ll have to ask around. You know 
                how it breaks down. White brothers 
                stick with white brothers

                              PROPHET
                Just press your connections. We ve 
                only got one more day. 

  A beat. Prophet keeps staring until Tre nods. Rossi watches.

                              PROPHET (CONT D) (cont d)
                You re better than this life, you 
                know that. 

  They stand. Prophet looks to the guard then hugs Tre goodbye. As 
  they separate, Tre says to Rossi --

                              TRE
                Y all got yourself someone special.

                Yeah. I think you re right. 

  As Rossi and Prophet walk away.

  INT. BACK ROOM HQ - NIGHT

  Cooper, Mick and Prentiss study piles of paper. Hotch enters. 

                                COOPER
                You give the profile?

                They ll get it to local merchants. 
                Triple patrols in the Tenderloin 
                and Golden Gate Park. We ll see.
                          (then, re: papers)
                What s that?

                              PRENTISS
                Violent crime data Garcia sent over 
                for the murder dates. 

                                COOPER
                We should also have her run the 
                dates against teenage girls dying 
                or being removed from their 
                fathers  care. 

                              HOTCH
                I ll get her on it. 

                              MICK
                I want to be on the street. 

                                COOPER
                I need you rested. 

                              MICK
                We ve got barely over a day before 
                this guy disappears again. If we re 
                wrong about him keeping multiple 
                  prisoners, he could be out there 
                right now, looking for his next 
                victim. 

                              PRENTISS
                He s right. 

                              MICK
                Am I?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  39.

  She addresses Hotch and Cooper. 

                              PRENTISS (CONT D) (cont d)
                It s worth a shot. It can t hurt 
                having extra eyes to look for 
                possible abductions on the street.

  A beat. Cooper says to Hotch --

                                COOPER
                The kid s the best sniper I ve ever 
                seen. He could view a lot of ground 
                from a rooftop vantage.

  Mick gives a pleased smile to Prentiss as Hotch asks her --

                              HOTCH
                Are you comfortable on the ground 
                solo?

                              PRENTISS
                  Absolutely. 

                              HOTCH
                Get mic d up. Make sure you re in 
                constant communication. 

  As Prentiss and Mick hurry off. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

  A view of the Tenderloin District. Mick hunches above it all, 
  watching through a scope. His POV --

  The streets are filled with zombie-like junkies and meth heads. 
  As he watches, we see he has an earpiece. He says --

                              MICK
                So, what are you wearing?

                                                                    INTER-CUT WITH:

  Prentiss. She has her own ear piece as she walks the streets.

                A gun.

  Mick can t help but smile appreciatively.

                Tell me again why I m walking the 
                streets while you sit on your butt 
                on some roof. 

                              MICK
                You heard the man. Are you really 
                gonna make me expound on my own 
                prowess? It s undignified. 

  And now it s time for Prentiss to smile. A beat. 

                              PRENTISS
                You see anything?

                              MICK
                From up here -- nothing but 
                  potential victims. No Unsubs. 

  Prentiss looks around. She agrees. And as she scans the faces of 
  the men walking the streets, we --

  INT. FIGHTING AREA - HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

  One of the men taken from the streets. He stares at the Unsub. 
  He slides the keys to the chained man as we --

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

  Prentiss. Walking the streets, eyes alert.

  INT. CELL - NIGHT

  Ben and Jane. As the door opens and the Unsub enters. 

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

  INT. MARKS  HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

  Another open door. Gina stares at Leslie as she sleeps. 

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  41.


  INT. FIGHTING AREA - NIGHT

  Ben and the other man, fighting. Each are shirtless. Bloody. As 
  they trade punches, we --

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

  EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

  Mick, staring down through his scope, desperately searching for 
  a lead. As he views the drama below him --

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

  INT. FIGHTING AREA - NIGHT

  Bam. Ben lands a hard punch. And suddenly everything is loud, 
  fast, ugly. Bam. Ben lands another shot. 

  The other man scratches at Ben s face but Ben lands another 
  shot. The man falls and Ben drops, immediately, onto the man s 
  chest. One. Two. Three. He hammers him with punches until --

  Ben tilts sideways and staggers off. The other man is defeated. 
  The Unsub immediately points a gun at Ben. 

                              UNSUB
                To the death. 

  Ben pauses. His POV --

  Jane watches the scene through the door to their cell. 

                              UNSUB (CONT D) (cont d)
                To the death or your daughter dies. 

  Another beat. Finally, Ben drops back on the man. He glances 
  once toward his daughter but then raises his hand and punches 
  the other man. Again. And again until --

  Sunrise. As --

  EXT. ROOFTOP - MORNING

  Mick sits crouched, watching the streets through his scope. He 
  lowers it a moment, bleary-eyed when --

  Prentiss approaches. They meet eyes. No luck. She offers him a 
  hand. As she pulls him up --

                                                                              CUT TO:

                I can lay it out for you. 

                                COOPER
                Good. We need to cross-reference it 
                against the potential suspect pool. 

  JJ walks to a table and begins laying out folders. As she does, 
  Prophet s phone RINGS. He answers. 

                              PROPHET
                Hello... Yeah. We can be there. Out 
                the door now. 

  He hangs up. Turns to Rossi --

                You up for a ride to San Quentin?

                              ROSSI
                Always. 

  They exit, passing Prentiss and Mick, who walk toward where the 
  others begin going through four stacks of papers.

                daughter in some way that 
                  corresponds to the dates he abducts 
                and kills his victims.

                We have the dates in question 
                divided into four subsets. This 
                pile is teenage girls ages thirteen 
                to sixteen who were removed from 
                their father s care. These are 
                deaths of girls the same age. The 
                last two are men arrested for 
                violent crimes or who began serving 
                prison sentences during the same 
                window.

                We have to be invited in by the

  They each hang up. Stay with Cooper. As the others look to see

  Ben is in horrible shape. Jane watches as he tries to lift a 
  dirty cup of water from the ground but his hands are too 
  mangled. He tries to maneuver the glass with his arms.

  Gina on Jane s bed. She reads from a diary. Morgan enters.

                Any clue that might connect her to

                          (no)
                It s mostly about a boy name David 
                and a few rants about how horrible 
                and unfair her parents are. 

  A beat. Leslie steps in. She s missed the last exchange but 
  there s still an awkward moment. She notices the diary.

                  I thought about reading that but I 
                was too afraid.

                There s nothing in here that can 
                help us find her. 

                                LESLIE
                You analyze these things, right? 
                Can you tell ... does she still 
                love us?

                              GINA
                I can tell you absolutely. She 
                loves you both so much. 

  A beat. Leslie exits. After she does, Morgan looks at Gina.

                              GINA (cont d)
                You grow out of being fourteen. But 
                a parent who feels like their kid 
                hates them? With no chance to make 
                things right? I won t let her take 
                that on. 

  A beat. Morgan studies her.

                                MORGAN
                I get it. You work deep cover, you 
                lose yourself, you lose 
                  relationships, you lose time. So, 
                when you finally come out, you feel 
                like you gotta keep moving a 
                million miles an hour to make up 
                for it all. 

  A beat. Gina suddenly looks at the diary.

                Jane s diary only goes back nine 
                months. What made her start keeping

                We were having problems with her. 
                It was causing tension between me 
                and Ben. We went to see a family 
                  counselor. She suggested Jane keep 
                  a journal.

                He s trying to prove to himself he 
                did what any father would do.

  INT. FIGHTING AREA - NIGHT

  Our Unsub, John Vincent Keel. For the first time, we truly see 
  him. He s large, imposing. He walks through his crumbling gym. 
  Blood stains mark the ground where he s forced his prisoners to 
  fight. He looks from the ground to --

  An old locker room. As he stalks toward it --

                                                                              CUT TO:

                Time to fight. 

  Ben tries to sit up. Jane watches. Keel takes out his keys as --

                              JANE
                I want you to take care of me. 

                              BEN
                Jane, what are you doing?

  But she keeps talking to the Unsub. It s OVERLAPPED, FAST.

                              JANE
                He lied to me. He was going to send 
                me away. 

                              BEN
                Janey, stop.

                Stop this. 

  The Unsub stares. Jane implores --

                I ll go anywhere you want. Just get 
                me away from him. 

  The Unsub walks to Jane. 

                              JANE (CONT D) (cont d)
                Please. 

  He unlocks her. As Ben THRASHES against his chains. 

                              BEN
                Stop. No. 

  And the Unsub walks to Ben. Puts a gun against his head but --

                              JANE
                No. You said if I go with you, we 
                both live. I need to know you re 
                not a liar too. 

                              BEN
                Janey, stop. Don t do this. 

  And the Unsub grabs Jane by the arm. As he half-drags her from 
  the cell, Ben screams --

                              BEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                Jane.... Janey ....

  And they disappear out the door, leaving Ben chained alone.

  A sketchy street in the Tenderloin. Two SUVs and a SWAT truck 
  pull up outside. People scatter. 

  Hotch, Prentiss, Reid and JJ exit one SUV. Cooper and Mick hop 
  out of the other. Everyone is vested up and ready. They reach --

  An office. A cot rests against a wall. Food wrappers everywhere.

  Keel drags Jane down the street. He has a gun pressed closely to

  EXT. SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

  A second street. Keel freezes. His POV --

  COPS surround a beat-up car, examining the license plate. Keel 
  immediately spins and pulls Jane back in the opposite direction.

                Keep it on them. Make sure you 
                don t blind our agents. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. JONES STREET ROOFTOP - NIGHT

  Prentiss, Morgan and Gina, guns drawn. It s fast, overlapped.

                                MORGAN
                John Keel. FBI. Drop the weapon. 

  And we see Keel holding Jane close, gun to her head. 

                              PRENTISS
                Drop the gun. 

  The helicopter shines its light on him. He backs up toward the 
  edge of the building. The agents keep moving toward them. 

                              GINA
                You got nowhere to go. Drop it. 

                              UNSUB
                I ll shoot her. 

  He creeps back to the edge of the building. 

                              GINA
                Look around. It s over. 

  And Keel SHOVES Jane forward, toward the agents. As he does, he 
  turns and jumps. Prentiss races to the edge of the building. 

                                                                              CUT TO:    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  62.


  EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

  POV SHOT -- Looking up to the edge of the building as Prentiss 
  races over. She stares down at us and we --

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. JONES STREET ROOFTOP - SAME MOMENT

  What she sees. Keel didn t fall to the street below. He s on a 
  fire escape, ten feet down, and his gun is pointed straight at 
  Prentiss. In that instant, she knows she s a dead woman and --

  BAM. Keel falls. A perfect head shot. Prentiss follows the path 
  of the bullet to see --

  Mick, on a nearby rooftop. He lowers his rifle. He and Prentiss 
  meet eyes. The helicopter hovers above as --

  Gina holds Jane. Morgan watches. Off the scene. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

  Lights. Cop cars. Two ambulances. Paramedics treat the other 
  abducted man in one. Ben is loaded into the second. Reid and JJ 
  are here, as --

  Prentiss, Morgan and Gina approach with Jane. JJ walks to them. 

                              JENNIFER
                They have to take him to the 
                hospital but the paramedics say 
                he s going to be okay. 

                              JANE
                Can I talk to him?

                              JENNIFER
                Of course. 

  Gina steps away, allowing Jane to walk to Ben. He holds up a 
  hand for the medics to wait. Jane hurries to him. She hugs him. 
  The medics seem concerned. She eases off. 

                              JANE
                I m sorry. Did I hurt you? 

                              BEN
                Not possible. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  63.

                              JANE
                I m so sorry. 

                              BEN
                Shh. 

                              JANE
                I didn t mean any of those things.

                              BEN
                I know. 

                              JANE
                You would have died.

                              BEN
                Come here. 

  He holds her. As he hugs her for dear life --

                              JANE
                I love you, daddy. 

  GINA

  Watches with Prentiss and Morgan. Hotch approaches. Their POV --

  A squad car arrives. Leslie gets out. She meets eyes with Gina. 
  A beat. Leslie mouths: Thank you. 

  Gina directs her with her eyes to Ben and Jane. Leslie hurries 
  to them. As her daughter sees her and throws her arms around 
  her, go back to the agents, watching. And up the block, at a 
  distance, they notice --

  Cooper. He watches the family reunion. As Gina says to Hotch --

                              GINA
                Did he tell you about the case -- 
                the boy s picture he keeps in his 
                wallet?

                              HOTCH
                No details.  

                              GINA
                It was  98, I think -- a series of 
                child murders in Dallas. Cooper got 
                the guy but told the police he 
                thought they had a second killer. 
                The victim preferences were too 
                varied. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  64.

    CONTINUED: (2)

                              HOTCH
                The police closed the case, anyway?

                              GINA
                Cooper kicked and screamed but the 
                FBI brass told him to get his butt 
                home. He did as he was told. 

  A beat. 

                              GINA (cont d)
                The boy in the photo s name was 
                Colby Hall. Cops caught his killer 
                dumping the body out by DFW 
                Airport. Turned out he was 
                  responsible for two of the other 
                murders as well. 

  Hotch glances at Cooper who walks off. Alone. Satisfied. 

  Hotch turns back to see the family reunion. Off them --

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. BACK ROOM HQ - NIGHT

  Beers on ice out on a table. Both teams assembled. Prentiss 
  grabs two beers and walks to where Mick stands with Morgan, Reid 
  and JJ. She hands a beer to Mick. 

                              PRENTISS
                Thank you. 

  Mick smiles then glances toward the others. 

                              MICK
                Look out for her. She s gonna have 
                a hard time getting over me. 

                              PRENTISS
                Like trying to kick a virus. 

                              MICK
                You know, I could have just missed 
                him. 

                              PRENTISS
                With your ego? No chance.  

  He smiles. They drink. Rossi and Prophet approach. Grab beers. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  65.

                              ROSSI
                I think San Quentin was actually 
                nicer.  

  Mick and Prophet share a look. 

                              REID
                What?

                              PROPHET
                We re used to a whole lot worse. 

  JJ glances at Gina, across the room alone, staring at something.

                              JENNIFER
                Is she okay?

                                MORGAN
                She will be. 

  And we angle on --

  Gina, staring intently at the paper in her hand. She stands and 
  walks across the room to Cooper. She hands the object over. 

                              GINA
                I asked her mom for it. I think you 
                should have it. 

  And Cooper looks at what he s been given. It s a photo of Jane. 

                              GINA (cont d)
                It s about time you had a reminder 
                to trust your gut that had a happy 
                ending. 

  He nods, appreciative. Gina walks toward the others. Stay with --

  Cooper, staring at the photo. He puts it in his wallet, on top 
  of the photo of the boy he couldn t save. His phone RINGS. 

                                COOPER
                So, you re calling me directly now. 

                                                                    INTER-CUT WITH:

                Don t get insolent. I still plan on 
                reading you and Agent Hotchner the 
                riot act when you get back. 

                                COOPER
                Well, that s something to look 
                forward to. 

                              GRIFFITH
                You did good work. Now, don t be an 
                idiot. Get on the jet with his team 
                and get home. 

                                COOPER
                          (goodbye)
                Ma am. 

  Stay with Cooper, as Hotch approaches with beers. 

                              HOTCH
                Was that the Director?

                                COOPER
                She wants to buy us a steak dinner 
                when we get back. 

  A beat. They look at their team members, unwinding together. 
  They each take a drink of their beers.  

                                COOPER (cont d)
                I was thinking about catching a 
                ride home with you.

                Good. 

                                COOPER
                You sure there s room for another 
                team?

                              HOTCH
                  Positive. 

  Off them, watching their two teams.
