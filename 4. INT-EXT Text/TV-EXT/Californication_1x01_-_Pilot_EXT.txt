      Birds chirp.  The sun shines.  Blue skies for miles.  In 
      short, a damn fine day to be alive.  And then:

      A DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE

      Jerks to a stop in front of the holy edifice.  Out of the 
        beat-to-shit Carrera convertible climbs:

      HANK MOODY

      A man in his thirties.  A figure in black.

      He's good-looking, yeah, but the thing that's always helped 
      Hank with the opposite sex is the fact that he simply doesn't 
      give a rat s ass what anyone thinks about him.

      He removes his sunglasses.  Winces in disgust.

      Hank is not a guy who appreciates the birds and the sun and 
      tranquility of nature and whatnot.

      INSIDE THE CHURCH

      Hank saunters in, immediately at odds with the holy vibe.  

      The place is dark.  Cold.  Empty.

      He snuffs his cigarette in a nearby bowl of Holy H2O.  His 
      footsteps loud as hell as he makes his way down the center 
      aisle.  He arrives at the altar.  Looks up.  And there he is:

      THE MAN HIMSELF

      Up on the cross.  Hanging out.  Doing his thing.

                                  HANK
                    Alright, big guy.  You and me... we've 
                    never done this.  But desperate times 
                    call for desperate measures.  My name is 
                    Hank --

                                  A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello, Hank.

      Hank reacts, startled, as

      A YOUNG NUN

      Emerges from the holy green room.  Full habit, headdress, and 
      everything.                                                                                      2.


                                  HANK
                    Oh, hey.  Sorry about that.  I was just 
                    having a little chat with the guy on the 
                    wall up here.

                                  YOUNG NUN
                    Is there something I can help you with?

                                  HANK
                    Oh, I wouldn t want to bother a real, 
                    live person.  I was just --

                                  NUN
                    -- It wouldn't be a bother, Hank.  In 
                    fact, that's what I'm here for.

                                  HANK
                    You're very pleasant, sister.  Very 
                      agreeable.

                                  NUN
                    I think you'll find that I'm very 
                    agreeable indeed.

      She smiles.  It s a pretty smile.  Some might say sexy.  
      Which weirds Hank out a little bit.  Or maybe it turns him 
      on.  Hard to say.

      He gives the Nun a closer look.  Pretty eyes, perfect skin.  
      Despite the holy garb and all that, the girl is attractive.  
      Who knows?  Maybe the holy garb helps.

                                  HANK
                    Here's the thing.  I've been having what 
                    you might call a crisis of faith.  Put 
                    simply, I m an addict.

                                  NUN
                          (a knowing nod)
                    Drugs and alcohol.

                                  HANK
                    A little bit, yeah.  But that stuff I can 
                    handle.  It s the sex that s killing me, 
                    sister.  You re looking at a goddamn 
                    fucking sex addict.
                          (catches himself)
                    Sorry about that.  I fucked up.  Once 
                    again.  My apologies.

                                  NUN
                    Well, normally I would suggest a bunch of 
                     Our Father s  and a couple of  Hail 
                    Mary s,  but I don't think that s gonna 
                    get it done.

      She ponders for a moment.  Looks up.  Smiles.                                                                                      3.


                                  NUN
                    What about a blowjob?

                                  HANK
                    Come again?

                                  NUN
                      A blowjob.  Would that make you feel any 
                    better?

                                  HANK
                      A blowjob...?  From you...?

      The Nun eyes Hank's crotch.

                                  NUN
                    Something tells me it's not gonna suck 
                    itself, Hank.

                                  HANK
                    But you're a nun.

      She pulls off her headgear.  Beautiful blonde hair spills out 
      all over.  Jenna Jameson in a habit.  Hank stares, gulps.

                                  HANK
                    A totally fucking hot nun.

      The Nun walks up to him.  Close.  Unzips his pants.  Proceeds 
      to go down on him.  Hank groans...

                                  HANK
                    Judas Priest...


      The camera descends, zeroing in on Hank's wounded Porsche, 
      rocketing towards home...


      Hank cruises down Main Street in Santa Monica, his stomping 
      grounds...


      Hank pulls up in front of a condo cluster somewhere in the 
      vicinity of Main Street.

      Finds his ex-wife, KAREN, 30's, very pretty, very no-
      nonsense, and their dangerously cute pre-teen daughter, 
      BECCA, 12, waiting for him.

      Hank winces, gets out of the car, still wearing just his 
      boxers and a T-shirt.  Karen gives him a look.

                                  HANK
                    Don't ask.

                                  KAREN
                    You're late.

                                  HANK
                    I'm sorry.

                                  KAREN
                    Again.                                                                                      7.


                                  HANK
                    I m very sorry?

                                  BECCA
                    Dad, are you crazy?

                                  HANK
                    Slightly, yes, but not dangerously so.

                                  KAREN
                    That depends on who you ask, sweetie.

                                  HANK
                    Would you like to join us for dinner?

                                  KAREN
                    Plans.

                                  HANK
                    Oh, it must be date night.

                                  BECCA
                    Come on, Mom...

                                  KAREN
                    Sorry, baby.

      Karen gives Becca a kiss.  Shoots Hank a look, says under her 
      breath:

                                  KAREN
                    You re a classy guy, Hank.

                                  HANK
                    That's funny.  Coming from you and all.

      Karen bites her tongue.  Gets in the car.  Becca waves.

                                  BECCA
                    Dad?

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, baby?

                                  BECCA
                    Can we watch  Anchorman ?

                                  HANK
                    Again...?
                          (off her look)
                       Anchorman  it is.


      Hank sits at the kitching table, staring at his Mac laptop.  
      He launches Microsoft Word, comforted by the familiar start-
      up screen.  And then there it is:

      THE BLANK SCREEN

      The cursor blinks.  Silently mocking him.

      He shifts in his seat, uncomfortable.  He types the word 
      "fuck" and holds down the "k" for a long time, filling the 
      page.

      He sighs.  Takes a sip of coffee.

      He launches the browser.  Starts perusing internet porn.                                                                                    14.



      Where the movie adaptation of Hank's novel is playing.   A 
      Crazy Little Thing Called Love.   Hank walks up, disgusted, 
      turns away, walks back, buys a ticket.


      Hank walks outside, where he is greeted with smiles and pats 
      on the back from other movie patrons.  The crowd parts, 
        revealing...

      A POLICE CAR

      Parked in front of the theater.  Cellphone Persian talking to 
      A PAIR OF COPS.  Cellphone Persian sees Hank, points him out.

      The Cops look at him.


      Hank walks out, formulating his first wisecrack, when he sees 
      the conservatively-attired BILL LEWIS, 40's, waiting for him.                                                                                    16.


                                  BILL
                    Hank.

                                  HANK
                    Bill.
                          (then)
                    Where's Karen?

                                  BILL
                    Home with Becca.

                                  HANK
                    She's funny, that one.

                                  BILL
                    Becca?  Yeah, she's a character all 
                    right.

                                  HANK
                          (irritated)
                    No -- Karen.  She knows exactly how to 
                    push my buttons.

                                  BILL
                    I don't think she was --

                                  HANK
                    -- Yeah, I'm really not that interested 
                    in what you think, Bill.  Thanks for 
                    sharing, though.

                                  BILL
                    Look, I wanted to come.

                                  HANK
                    Really?

                                  BILL
                    Yes.

                                  HANK
                    Well, this should be interesting.

                                  BILL
                    I wanted you to see that I'm not the bad 
                    guy here.

                                  HANK
                    Oh, you're not?  Okay.

                                  BILL
                    It's not that simple, Hank.  I mean, life 
                    is complicated, man.

                                  HANK
                    That's it?  That's all you got?  'Life is 
                      complicated, man."?  Jesus Christ... way 
                    to dip into the platitudes.                                                                                    17.


                                  BILL
                    I guess that's why you're the writer, 
                    Hank.

      The guy s trying to be decent, which only serves to piss Hank 
      off all the more.

                                  HANK
                    You know what?  Bill, is it?  Sometimes 
                    things are that simple.  That clear-cut.  
                    Someone is always the bad guy.  Someone 
                    has to be.

                                  BILL
                    So maybe it's you.

                                  HANK
                    Do you want to get hit?

                                  BILL
                    Do you want to hit me?

                                  HANK
                    Kinda, yeah.

                                  BILL
                    Then go ahead.  Take a shot.  I'm not 
                    gonna stop you.  If that's what you have 
                    to do.  But think about it for a minute.  
                    Would you want your daughter to see you 
                    like this?
                          (leans in close)
                    Get your shit together, man.  For Becca s 
                    sake, at least.

      Fuming, Hank takes a swing.  Bill ducks.  Quickly socks Hank 
      in the gut.  He goes down.  Comes up with a bloody nose.

                                  HANK
                    Fuck me --

                                  BILL
                      Racquetball.  Five times a week.  I'm a 
                    lot stronger than I look.

                                  HANK
                      Apparently.

                                  BILL
                    Maybe you re right, Hank.  Maybe 
                    someone s gotta be the bad guy.  You've 
                    been a shitty husband, a fuck-up father, 
                    but don't worry about it.  It's taken 
                    care of.  Go off and indulge in whatever 
                    little mid-life crisis you're dealing 
                    with.  Your family is fine.  I'm taking 
                    care of them.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    18.

                                  BILL (CONT'D)
                    I don't expect a Thank You or anything, 
                    but a little respect might be nice.

      Hank smiles.  Gives Bill the finger.  Bill just shakes his 
      head.  Tosses Hank a handkerchief.  Walks off.


      Hank walks down Sunset, aimless, lost in thought.  Passes 
      Book Soup.  Sees something.  Stops.

      IN THE WINDOW

      His book is on display.  GOD HATES US ALL by Hank Moody.  A 
      bunch of paperbacks.  The cover of which is the one-sheet for 
      the movie.  Hank frowns.  He walks inside.


      Karen s out front on her cell.                                                                                    23.


                                  KAREN
                    Where are you?

      SPLIT-SCREEN:  Karen, all dolled-up; Hank, all fucked-up.

                                  HANK
                    Where am I supposed to be?

                                  KAREN
                    At school.

      Hank winces:  Fuck.

                                  HANK
                      Parent-teacher conference.  Right.

                                  KAREN
                          (fucking asshole)
                    Right...

                                  HANK
                    I ll be right there.  I m just putting my 
                    face on.


      Hank and Karen walk out in mid-argument.

                                  HANK
                    I ll talk to her.

                                  KAREN
                    No.  You ll just get mad.  And that s 
                    just going to make it worse.

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, you talk to her.  She ll end up 
                    pregnant.  And that ll make everything 
                    fine and fucking dandy.

                                  KAREN
                    Oh my God -- you re such a fucking prick.

                                  HANK
                    What, I m not allowed to worry about her, 
                    too?

                                  KAREN
                    Sure you are.  But you re not allowed to 
                    criticize every parental move I make.

      Hank climbs into his car.

                                  HANK
                    Whatever.

                                  KAREN
                    What the hell happened to you, by the 
                    way?

                                  HANK
                    This chick... she punched me in the face.                                                                                    26.


                                  KAREN
                    Why?

                                  HANK
                    I don't know.  We were having sex.  Some 
                    fairly tremendous sex, if you ask me.  
                    There I was, about to pop.  And what does 
                    she do?  She hauls off and socks me in 
                    the kisser.

                                  KAREN
                    You re disgusting.

      He shakes his head, mock-sad.

                                  HANK
                    Oh, Karen... you used to mean that in a 
                    good way.

                                  KAREN
                    You know, you would think, the one day I 
                    actually need something from you, the one 
                    day we have to present a united front for 
                    our daughter, you could manage to get it 
                    together.

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, you would think, right?

      That said, he drives off.


      Hank pulls to a stop in front of a mammoth North of Montana 
      home.  Karen s waiting for him.  She gets in.  He tears off.

      INSIDE THE CAR

                                  HANK
                    Where to?

                                  KAREN
                    Somewhere up in the Palisades.

                                  HANK
                    Who took her?

                                  KAREN
                    Bill s daughter.

                                  HANK
                    What?  I didn t even know he had a 
                    daughter.  How old is she?

                                  KAREN
                    Sixteen.

                                  HANK
                    And you let Becca hang out with her?

      Beat.  Karen sniffs the air.

                                  HANK
                    What?

                                  KAREN
                    You smell like pussy.

      Beat.  Hank drives off.


      Parents are away.  Kids are playing.  Hard.  Hank pulls up on 
      the lawn, almost taking out a few teenagers.  He gets out, 
      followed by Karen.


      Hank pulls up in front of the North of Montana house.  
      Karen s next to him.  Becca s in the back, not talking to 
      either of them.  A beat.  Hank looks back.

                                  HANK
                    Becca... look...

      A beat.  Becca fixes him with an icy gaze.

                                  BECCA
                    I hate you.

      That said, she gets out of the car, runs into the house.

      Hank sags, a dagger through the heart.  Karen looks at him, 
        sympathizes.

                                  HANK
                    Guess I deserve that.

                                  KAREN
                    No one deserves that.
                          (then)
                    Wanna come in?

                                  HANK
                    What about...?

                                  KAREN
                    He s out of town.

      A beat.  Hank nods.

                                  KAREN
                    But only if you wash the pussy off.

                                  HANK
                    Deal.
