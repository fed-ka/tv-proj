      A family birthday dinner in the backyard of a modest tract home 
      in Beaumont, Texas. CHYRON reads: 2 Months Ago. Riley s fraternal 
      7-year-old twins TRAVIS (confident/athletic) and KATIE (watchful/ 
      sensitive) kick a soccer ball around as Riley and her husband 
      KYLE (handsome, ex-jock) sip margaritas with Riley's mom LINETTE 
      (plump but pretty/hard to please). We barely recognize Riley at 
      first. Fresh-faced, hair pulled back, barely any make-up now. A 
      happy and efficient, eager-to-please mother and wife.

                                  RILEY
                    Mama, I saw her at the dentist the 
                    other day. She seemed perfectly fine. 

                                    LINETTE
                    I hear her cocaine problem is just out 
                    of control. And she's pregnant again. 

                                  RILEY
                    That is total gossip. You don't know 
                    that for sure.                                THE RUB   7/31/11                         2


                                    LINETTE
                    I most certainly do. I heard it at 
                    church. It's not gossip when you're 
                      concerned.

                                  KYLE
                    I heard Bill's filing for divorce.

                                    LINETTE
                    There ya go. Thank you Kyle. I'm
                    puttin' 'em on top of my prayer list. 
                    No mistake's too big for the Lord. 

                                  RILEY
                          (to Kyle, playful)
                    That's good to know.
                          (yells to the twins)
                    Kiddos, time to open Daddy's presents. 

      The twins cheer and hustle over to jump into Kyle's lap.

                                    LINETTE
                    Riley, don't let 'em jump all over 
                    Kyle's hurt leg like animals.

                                  KYLE
                    I'm fine, Linette.

      Riley pulls them off anyway, handing Kyle a large, beautifully 
      wrapped gift with a smile. 

                                  RILEY
                    This one's from me and the kids. 

                                  KYLE
                    Someone sure knows how to make their 
                    presents look pretty.

                        TRAVISKATIE
      Happy Birthday, Daddy.We love you, Daddy.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                          (kisses them)
                    I love you both more.

      He opens the box. A beautiful leather jacket. His smiles fades.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Babe, you promised not to spend money 
                    on a fancy gift this year.

      Riley ignores this, holds the jacket up. Pleased.

                                  RILEY
                    It's not that fancy. You deserve 
                    something nice.

      Kyle doesn't even look at it. He gets up and huffs inside. Riley 
      glances at her mom, frustrated, and follows after him.                                 THE RUB   7/31/11                         3


                                    LINETTE
                    OK, who wants some of Mee Maw's famous 
                    German chocolate cake?

      The twins cheer as she dutifully distracts them. 


      Riley's on her cell, alone, cleaning up after the party. (Note: 
      She's hyper-organized and efficient, always cleaning things up.) 

                                  RILEY
                    No, everything's fine. Kyle's really 
                    sorry for stomping off like that. 


      Riley walks out after a discouraging interview. She crosses a 
      name off a long, detailed list as a spiffy Latina, SELENA RIOS 
      (pleased with herself) walks up. 

                                  SELENA
                    Riley? Ohmygod, girl, how are you?!

                                  RILEY
                    Selena. You cut your hair. Wow. 
                    What're you doing here?

                                  SELENA
                    Lunch with a friend. You?

                                  RILEY
                          (groans)
                    Job hunting. Frustrating as hell. 
                    Literally no one's hiring. I've been 
                    looking for months. Remember in school 
                    how they kept telling us massage was 
                    one of the top ten most in demand 
                      professions? Huge lie. I've been out 
                    of work since you and I got laid off 
                    at Beaumont Country Club a year ago.

                                  SELENA
                    Girl, that's awful.

      Just as a VALET delivers her sexy new red Mazda convertible.

                                  RILEY
                    Wow. Nice car.                                 THE RUB   7/31/11                         6


                                  SELENA
                    I got the most awesome job at a spa in 
                      Sugarland. The tips are insane.

                                  RILEY
                    Isn't that like an hour away?

                                  SELENA
                    Trust me, it's worth it. Tell 'em I 
                    sent you if you really need a job. 
                          (she hands her a card from 
                          her purse)
                    It'd be a kick to work together again.

      She gives a quick hug, hops in her Mazda and zips off. Riley 
      watches after her. Smiles. Maybe her luck is about to change? 


      Riley pulls up in her beat up  95 Nova to stare at a strip mall. 
      Bubba's Texas Barbecue. A dry cleaners. Beaumont Karate Academy. 
      Not impressive. She finds the address she s looking for--a 
      simple storefront with a drawing of a pair of women s hands 
      holding a sign: THE RUB. A HEALING CENTER FOR MEN AND WOMEN. 
      Riley frowns. This is the spa?


      Riley heads to her car as Georgia catches up, grabbing her arm. 
      Kendra and Dee Ann watch from the doorway. What the hell?

                                    GEORGIA
                    Would you hold on a minute?! That is 
                      absolutely not the norm here. 

                                  RILEY
                    You weren't kidding when you said this 
                    is a "full service" spa.

                                    GEORGIA
                    The majority of what goes on here is 
                      completely legit. I can't always 
                    control what the girls do when they're 
                    alone with their clients.

                                  RILEY
                      Obviously. I am so outta here.
                    Another total waste of my time!

      She gets in her car. Speeds off. OFF Georgia, watching her go. 


      Unmown lawn. Broken garage door. CHYRON reads: Four Weeks Later. 

                                  LINETTE'S VOICE 
                    Whatdaya mean the cable's off?


      Linette cuts the twins' hair as they eat popsicles. Riley's at 
      the island, going thru stacks of meticulously organized bills. 

                                  RILEY
                    They said they can't turn it back on 
                    till I pay the bill.

                                    LINETTE
                    I can't even watch my soaps when I'm 
                      babysitting now?

                                  RILEY
                    Mama, please. And I really need you 
                    tomorrow, too, so I can look for work. 

                                    LINETTE
                    I can't take another day off. I'm 
                    broke now too. 

      The phone RINGS. Riley grabs it in frustration. 

                                  RILEY
                    Hello?
                          (faux cheerful)
                    Mr. Andrews. Thanks for calling back. 

      She heads into the den for privacy. Hopeful.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         14

                    Did you get a chance to evaluate my-- 
                    Yes, I know we've already had one 
                      extension, but-- What happens if we 
                    can t pay the mortgage by then? 

      She s told something she doesn t want to hear. She glances back 
      into the kitchen where her mom is goofing around with the twins. 
      Her eyes fill with tears, completely overwhelmed. 


      Fun MUSIC. Tiki lamps. A casual party spilling out onto the 
      lawn. FIND Georgia, Riley, Jolene, Kendra and Dee Ann sipping 
      margaritas on the porch with Georgia's neighbors NADINE (70, 
      feisty) and JAKE and JOY (young couple) holding their BABY GIRL. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    "Black Swan" was amazing. Natalie 
                    Portman can do no wrong in my mind.

                                  NADINE
                    That movie was God awful! Last decent 
                    film I saw was "The Sound of Music".

                                    GEORGIA
                    Honey, that was fifty years ago.

                                  NADINE
                    Exactly. Point made!

      The group LAUGHS, as does the baby. Riley leans in to admire her.

                                  RILEY
                    Oh, she's so adorable. Look at those 
                    blue eyes.

                                  JAKE
                    You got any kids, Riley?

                          (taken off guard)
                    Oh, uh, yeah. Seven-year-old twins.

                                  NADINE
                    Photos. Cough 'em up! Let us see.

                    Oh please! Georgia, I think your new 
                    friend is pulling our leg.

      Riley, put on the spot, relents, pulls out her cell to show off 
      some PHOTOS of the twins. Georgia and the girls perk up. This is 
      the first they've heard Riley mention her children. 

                                  RILEY
                    That's Katie and Travis. In the cowboy 
                    outfits they're gonna wear at Spring 
                    Sing at school. They are so hyped up 
                    about it. 

                                  KENDRA
                    I can't believe you have 7-year-olds.

      They all press in to look at the photos, AD LIBBING how cute the 
      twins are. But we can't help but sense Riley feels a bit 
      exposed. She didn't plan on sharing anything about her personal 
      life with these women. 


      Riley walks out, exhausted from work. She heads to her car, but 
      stops when she sees Valerie Peters parked in a Lincoln across 
      the street. Their eyes meet. An obvious recognition from the 
      altercation a few nights before. But Valerie breaks the stare 
      and quickly drives away. OFF Riley--unsettled, watching her go.  


      Riley leaves after work in a great mood. 


      She parks and looks out at the bank with a smile.


      Georgia's working the front desk. (Dee Ann's in the background, 
      feeding the fish.) As Riley walks in and heads over to the desk. 

                                  RILEY
                    Georgia, can I talk to you a sec?

                                    GEORGIA
                    Hey, honey. What's up?

                                  RILEY
                    Look I think I'm starting to get the 
                    hang of this. Feel free to give me all 
                    the extra shifts you want. Pile 'em 
                    on.

                                    GEORGIA
                    Sure thing. Fellas can't seem to get 
                    enough of you. 

                                  RILEY
                    And you could do all the scheduling 
                    online instead of that tattered old 
                    book of yours. Much more efficient. 
                    Just so you know.

                                    GEORGIA
                    I'll keep that in mind, honey. 

      OFF Dee Ann, overhearing this. And not at all pleased about it. 


      Riley leaves work at the end of the day. Heads to the parking 
      lot, but stops in her tracks. The word WHORE has been spray 
      painted in red all over her car. PASSERBYS are gaping. Snapping 
      photos with their cells. 

      OFF Riley. Shit! 

      END OF ACT THREE.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         37


                                            ACT FOUR


      Riley s pissed as Georgia helps her clean off her car with rags 
      and a bucket of soapy water. Passerbys are still staring and 
      taking photos as Georgia suddenly snaps at them. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Never seen the word WHORE before?!

      The Passerbys quickly disperse, grumbling among themselves.

                          (so they can hear)
                    Your sister sure is gonna be glad we 
                    cleaned this off her car, Riley.

                          (hushed irritation)
                    Oh, that sounded convincing. Look at 
                    this mess! 

                                    GEORGIA
                    We'll have it cleaned off in no time.

                                  RILEY
                    What if someone I knew saw all this? 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Guess you'd have to make a big joke 
                    and act surprised.

                                  RILEY
                    I bet it was Valerie Peters. I saw her 
                    parked out here yesterday for no 
                    reason. Does she know I gave Jared a 
                    massage?

                                    GEORGIA
                    Not that I know of. That bitch is 
                    working my last nerve. I've gotta get 
                    security cameras out here to prove 
                    who's been doin' all this crap. 

                                  RILEY
                    What crap? It's happened before?

      Georgia just keeps scrubbing.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Ohmygod, and you've done nothing about 
                    it? Why didn't you tell me? I would've 
                    parked somewhere else. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    I don't like upsetting my girls.

                                  RILEY
                    So you ignore it? How can you be so lax? 
                    The place is a disorganized mess.

                    The girls do anything they want. I can't 
                    come out to my car like this. Unlike you, 
                    I have a family to worry about.

                                    GEORGIA
                          (offended)
                    My girls are my family and I really 
                    don't appreciate you telling me I'm 
                    not doing my job. In case you haven't  
                    noticed I'm not Martha friggin' 
                    Stewart, but I've been running a 
                    clean, successful business for the 
                    last three years--all by myself.
                          (on second thought)
                    Clean your own damn car! 

      Pissed, she heads inside. Riley watches after her with regret. 


      Evan is mowing her yard with his shirt off, chiseled, glistening 
      with sweat. The twins are nearby, making piles of cut grass, 
      enjoying his company. Riley parks in the drive, jumps out.

                                  RILEY
                    What the hell are you doing? 

      Evan turns off the mower, glad to see here.

                                  EVAN
                    I think it's called mowing. I dropped 
                    by to see if I could help out and your 
                    mom sent me out here.

                                  RILEY
                    That's sweet, but I can mow my own 
                    yard. And would you put on your shirt? 
                    The neighbors are staring.

      Evan looks around and sure enough NEIGHBORS are peeking out. 
      Who's this hunky guy mowing Riley's yard while Kyle is away? 

                                  EVAN
                          (putting on his shirt)
                    So, how've you been? 

                                  RILEY
                    Good, really busy.

                                  EVAN
                    I heard. How's your new job? 
                          (perplexed)
                    A friend at the bank said you came in 
                    the other day and paid your mortgage

                    Yeah. It's turning out better than I 
                    expected. It's super high end, the 
                    clients are really rich and generous.

                                  EVAN

                                  RILEY
                    Yeah, much more than Beaumont.
                    Ok, thanks for dropping by.

                                  EVAN
                    I'm only half done, silly. And I 
                    promised the kids we'd play later.

                                  RILEY
                    That's really not necessary. Bye!
                          (to the twins)
                    Come on kiddos. Time for dinner.

      The twins hustle over.

                                  TRAVIS
                    See ya Evan. We raked up all the grass 
                    in piles like you told us to. 

                                  EVAN
                    Thanks buddy. You did a great job.

                                  KATIE
                    We have fourteen piles now. 

                                  EVAN
                    OK, wow, thanks for counting 'em.

      A beat. Riley takes the kids inside. Evan watches, frustrated. 
      And just a little suspicious of this new job of hers. 


      Riley gets out of her car, marches across her yard and gets in 
      the passenger seat of the Lincoln to confront Valerie.


      Georgia s on her hands and knees, carefully planting vegetables 
      in her garden as Riley walks up. She watches a moment, surprised 
      to see this side of her, as Georgia looks up. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Hey, honey. Like tomatoes? Every year 
                    I have more'n I could ever give away. 

                                  RILEY
                    Sure. I love 'em.

                                    GEORGIA
                    So what in hell's name happened with 
                    Valerie Peters? She called this 
                    morning and apologized for barging in 
                    last week. She wants to pay for all 
                    the damages.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         54

                    She followed me home last night. I 
                    thought it was Fatal Attraction time, 
                    but we actually had a nice talk. 

                                    GEORGIA
                          (stands, taken aback)
                    About what? 

                                  RILEY
                    Let's just say she s gonna be the one 
                    giving Jared his massages from now on. 
                    She sent me roses this morning. He's 
                    taking her to Hawaii for a week.

                                    GEORGIA
                    ...you have a funny effect on people, 
                    don't you?

                                  RILEY
                    Yeah. They either love me--or haul ass.

      Georgia smiles. She knows the feeling. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Well, I'm sorry to lose Jared, but 
                    relieved to have that crazy bitch 
                    outta my hair. Thanks for taking care 
                    of that. And that Auto-Pay you set up 
                    on my bank account--loving it! I 
                    thought maybe we could discuss your 
                    idea of putting the schedule online. 

                                  RILEY
                    Actually, Georgia...that's what I came 
                    over to talk to you about. 
                          (no easy way to say it)
                    I can't work for you anymore.

      Unsure, Georgia shields her eyes from the sun to see her better.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    I took this job for the money, but it 
                    became some...insane attempt to 
                      understand why men do the things they 
                    do. What goes on in their minds. I'm 
                    guessing the girls told you my husband 
                    left me, not the other way around.

                                    GEORGIA
                    Yeah, they mentioned it.

                                  RILEY
                    Well, I've gotta let go of all that. 
                    And think of my kids now. I can't have 
                    crazy wives following me home at night.

                                  RILEY
                    No offense, but I want a life I can be 
                    proud of. 

      Georgia absorbs this. It stings, but she hides it well.

                                    GEORGIA
                    We all do, honey. ...I wish you 
                    nothin' but the best.

      Riley nods. Georgia nods back at her. It's painful and awkward. 
      There's a genuine affection between them. Riley smiles and 
      leaves. OFF Georgia, sad to see her go.   


      Riley, Linette and Katie (in her cowboy costume) are hurrying 
      about, getting ready to leave for Spring Sing when Travis (in 
      his cowboy outfit) enters in tears. 

                                  TRAVIS
                    I used too much hair gel!

      His hair is plastered with gel. A huge mess.

                                    LINETTE
                          (horrified)
                    Good Lord, you look like a wet possum!

                                  RILEY
                    Mama, that's not helping. 
                          (going to Travis)
                    Honey, I told you just a dab.

                                  TRAVIS
                    Daddy always helped me do it!

                                    LINETTE
                    OK, I'll fix this. It's nothing 
                    compared to the disasters I see down 
                    at the salon. Come with me, Possum.

      She leads Travis off to the bathroom as Riley turns to see Katie 
      standing there in her Cowboy outfit, vulnerable.

                                  RILEY
                    Honey, you look so cute. I'm really 
                    glad you decided to be in the show. 

      She kneels to make sure Katie's costume looks just right.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    What made you change your mind?

      She gives her a big hug and a kiss as the doorbell rings.

                    Oh God, what now? Check on your 
                    brother for me. We're running late.

      Katie heads off. Riley hustles to open the door. It's Evan. 

                                  EVAN
                    I just wanna say something in person 
                    real quick. I'm sorry about the other 
                    night. Kissing was...totally out of 
                    line. It won't happen again.

                                  RILEY
                    OK, well... I certainly hope not. 

                                  EVAN
                    I want us to be friends again. They're 
                    hard to come by around here.

                                  RILEY
                    Yeah. They are. Long as we're clear.

                                  EVAN
                    We are. I am.

      They both nod. But there's an entirely different energy between 
      them now. Whether they want to admit it or not, it's sexual.

                                  EVAN (CONT D)
                    Ok, bye then. But don't hesitate to 
                    call if you need help with anything.

                                  RILEY
                      Actually...the yard's only half mowed, 
                    last time I checked.

                                  EVAN
                    Damn, you're right. I'm on it. 
                          (he grins, cute)
                    And I'll wear a shirt this time.

      Riley smiles. Unsettled by her new feelings for him. 


      Riley and Georgia take a stroll after the performance as 
        refreshments are served in the background. 

                                  RILEY
                    Thanks for dropping by. They were

      Riley shoots her a look, knows better.

                    you full partner if you come back and 
                    run the place with me.

      Riley's taken aback, she wasn't expecting anything like this.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         59

                    We can pick and choose your clients. 
                    We could fix up the place, organize 
                    things like you said and make 
                    boatloads of money! 
                          (the truth)
                    You happen to be good at all the 
                    things I happen to suck at. 

                                  RILEY
                    Georgia, that's really generous, but  
                    I'm starting work at my mother's salon 
                    first thing tomorrow. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Honey, that sounds awful! Catering to 
                    a bunch of bitchy old women in a hair 
                    salon? Jesus, gimme a pack of horny 
                    men and a slew of women looking to 
                    relax any ole day!

      This makes Riley smile as she glances over to check on the twins 
      who are playing with Linette and some of their friends nearby. 

                                    GEORGIA (CONT'D)
                    Face it, Riley. You re not meant to 
                    work at some hair salon with your 
                    mama. You and I are the same. We want 
                    life on our own terms. 

      Riley considers it, it's true. But not like this. 

                                  RILEY
                    I've made up my mind. I better go 
                    check on my kids. Thanks again for 
                    coming today, Georgia. Really.

      Georgia nods. Riley smiles and heads off for the twins as 
      Georgia watches after her.
