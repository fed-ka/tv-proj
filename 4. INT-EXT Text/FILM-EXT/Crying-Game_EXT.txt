A loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a
Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris
Wheel turning round and round.
A black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with
blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings
around a bowling pin.
JODY
And that's cricket, hon.
An attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in
his huge hands. He gives it to the girl.
JODY
You want it?
GIRL
Sure.
JODY
Doesn't matter if you don't.
He puts his arm around her and drags her on.
JODY
Jody won't be offended. Jody's never
offended. What'd you say your name was?
GIRL
Jude.
JODY
Jude. Suits you, Jude.
JUDE
The teddy bear?
JODY
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And
it's June. Jude in June.
He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.
2.
JODY
Gotta piss, Jude.
He holds her hand.
JODY
Don't run off, Jude.
JUDE
You don't know me, do you?
Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We
can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the
canvas, looking bored.
JODY
(inside)
What if I did?
JUDE
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her
eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-
haired man in a dark jacket. He nods.
JODY
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
JUDE
You didn't?
JODY
And you know what?
JUDE
Tell me, Jody
He staggers out, buttoning up.
JODY
It's nice.
He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away.
JUDE
Not here.
JODY
Who gives a fuck.
JUDE
You never know.
3.
She pulls him over toward the water.
JODY
I never know nothing.
JUDE
People. They could be looking.
Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He
moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach,
under a train trestle.
JUDE
Come and get me, soldier --
JODY
Whatever you say, Jude...
He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms
around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her,
fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow
falls across them.
CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He
turns around, drunkenly.
JODY
What the fuck --
The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.
Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a
field.
Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing
among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around
him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.
Fergus follows Jude out a back door, holding her by the arm.
FERGUS
You all right?
6.
JUDE
Fucking animal.
She takes in huge gobs of air.
FERGUS
You don't know that.
JUDE
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
He touches her face.
FERGUS
Tough work, that.
JUDE
Someone's got to do it.
She rubs her hand on his chest.
JUDE
Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of
you.
She sidles closer, coming on to him.
JUDE
And you know what, Fergus? One of you
made me want it...
She puts her lips to his neck.
FERGUS
Which one?
She doesn't answer. They embrace.
A hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the
house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward
a greenhouse.
Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She
is carrying a pot of tea and two cups.
Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him.
FERGUS
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by
that tree.
JODY
Tree.
He walks toward it, breathing heavily.
JODY
You've got to loosen my hands.
17.
FERGUS
Can't.
JODY
Well then, you're going to have to take
my dick out for me, aren t you?
Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him.
JODY
Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants!
Fergus turns him around and unzips his fly.
JODY
Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying --
Fergus takes Jody's penis out.
Jody takes two steps toward the wall.
JODY
I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all
over myself. Will you hold my hands for
me.
Fergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward.
Jody now pisses with immense relief
JODY
Now, that was worth waiting for.
FERGUS
Hurry up, would you?
JODY
These things take time, Fergus.
He shakes his body.
JODY
It's amazing how these small details take
on such importance...
He steps back.
JODY
Now put it back in.
FERGUS
Give us a break.
18.
JODY
I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat.
For fuck's sake, it's got no major
diseases.
Fergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up.
JODY
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two
years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in
all it's served me well.
FERGUS
Shut up, would you?
JODY
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you,
Fergus.
Fergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse.
Maguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of
laughter.
Fergus, walking toward the house. He looks back and sees the
figures of Maguire and Jody in the dark, in absolute silence.
The sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse.
MAGUIRE
You'll have minimal contact with the
prisoner, do you hear me?
FERGUS
Yes.
MAGUIRE
And do you know why?
FERGUS
Why?
MAGUIRE
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot
him, that's why.
Maguire goes back to the house.
The farmhouse covered in mist. The sun coming through it.
Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the
chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand. He checks
the chamber.
Fergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his
back, by the elbow.
FERGUS
Stand up, now --
Jody rises. Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire.
MAGUIRE
I wish to say on behalf of the Irish
Republican Army --
Fergus turns with sudden fierceness.
FERGUS
Leave him be --
He pulls Jody through the fields.
Fergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his
back.
JODY
Take the hood off, Fergus --
FERGUS
No.
30.
JODY
I want to see a bit. Please, please.
Don't make me die like an animal.
Fergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a
cut lip where Jude struck him.
Fergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward.
Fergus is all cold and businesslike.
JODY
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know
that, Fergus?
FERGUS
Why?
JODY
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to
go to the Metro --
FERGUS
Stop that talk now --
JODY
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
FERGUS
The fastest.
JODY
Faster than cricket?
FERGUS
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
JODY
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat
you, is there?
FERGUS
You won't run.
JODY
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a
brother in the back --
Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands,
then freeing them, he is off like a hare. Fergus screams in
fury after him.
FERGUS
JODY!!!
31.
Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs.
FERGUS
You stupid bastard --
JODY
What you say, faster?
FERGUS
I said you bastard -- stop --
JODY
Got to catch me first --
Fergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody
sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him. He
laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing,
almost laughing.
JODY
Used to run the mile, you know -- four
times round the cricket pitch -- what was
that game called?
FERGUS
Hurling --
JODY
What?
FERGUS
Hurling --
Jody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him.
JODY
Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit
more wind --
Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on
him again.
JODY
Bit of fun, Fergus, eh?
And suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to
Fergus.
JODY
Told you I was fast --
Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody
32.
JODY
Don't do it.
And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits
Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air
and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt
and the huge wheels grind over him.
Fergus, screaming, "No-!" He almost moves forward, then sees
soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns
and runs.
Fergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as
he runs.
Fergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging
branches till eventually he is hidden from sight.
A forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields.
An old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car
appears; and Fergus gets out of it.
TOMMY
Fergus!
FERGUS
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're
you keeping?
The ferry, churning into the sunset.
FADE TO BLACK.
Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters
through a white door.
Fergus walking down a street looking for an address. Some
distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR
SALON.
Fergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looking in the
window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his
point of view, then Fergus walks inside.
Fergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through
the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her
hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He
walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway.
The doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of
high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy
clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door
and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub
called the Metro. Fergus follows.
37.
Fergus, standing across the road from the pub. He is
sweating. Dil comes out of the pub. She looks this way and
that, as if searching for Fergus. Fergus stands back into a
shadow.
Dave, the burly man, comes out. He grabs her by the elbow.
She shrugs him off. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by
the elbow again. The sense of an old argument. Dave suddenly
strikes her across the face with his open palm.
40.
She leans her head against a wall. Dave then puts his arms
around her, consoles her.
Dave walking, holding Dil by the arm. The street is
dilapidated, full of squats. They stop outside a door. Dil
opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk
inside.
Fergus stands there, observing.
A light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her
shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of
Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse.
She stands absolutely still as he does so.
Fergus backs away, then walks off.
Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball. He
imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a
voice interrupts him.
DEVEROUX
So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?
Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type
in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is
Franknum, the cockney foreman.
FERGUS
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
DEVEROUX
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as
you remember you're not at Lords.
Fergus resumes work.
Fergus comes out. A black bouncer is there, but there is no
sign of Dil. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an
alley. He looks up it.
P0V - ALLEY.
We see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her
roughly.
DAVE
Don't be like that --
DIL
You heard me --
She beats his arms away. Money falls on the ground. She
staggers away from him. He picks up the money, then runs
after her.
DAVE
Got very fucking grand, haven't we --
He tries to pull her back.
DAVE
Talk to me, you stupid bitch --
They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't
move an inch. She smiles.
45.
DIL
Hi.
FERGUS
Hi. You forgot your bag.
He holds it up to show her.
DIL
Thank you.
DAVE
Who the fuck is he?
DIL
Jimmy.
DAVE
It's him, isn't it?
DIL
Maybe.
Dave eyes Fergus. Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on
the ground.
DIL
See, they get the wrong idea.
DAVE
(from the ground)
Cunt.
Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck.
FERGUS
What was that?
DIL
They all get the wrong idea.
DAVE
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
DIL
Charming.
Dave grabs for her ankle. She kicks his hand away. Fergus
presses down his foot. He looks to Dil.
FERGUS
What'll I do?
46.
DIL
Break his neck.
Fergus presses his foot.
DIL
No, don't.
She bends low to Dave.
DIL
He's going to take his foot off slowly,
David. Then you're to go home, like a
good boy. You hear me?
DAVE
Cunt.
But his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs
his arm.
DIL
Come on, honey.
She draws him away.
They walk out of the alley.
FERGUS
You all right?
DIL
Yes, thank you.
FERGUS
What was that all about?
DIL
He wants me to perform for him.
FERGUS
Perform?
DIL
You know.
FERGUS
You on the game?
DIL
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
47.
Fergus looks back. Dave is rising.
FERGUS
He's getting up.
DIL
You can't leave me then, can you?
Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs.
DIL
You want me to ask you in, right?
FERGUS
No, I didn't --
DIL
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud,
but never cheap.
There is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave,
holding his neck.
DAVE
Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt.
Dil leans close to Fergus.
DIL
If you kissed me, it would really get his
goat.
She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly.
DIL
Now, if you asked me to meet you
tomorrow, it would really drive him
insane.
FERGUS
Where?
DIL
Half-five. At Millie's.
She goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down
at Dave, who turns to leave.
Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus.
48.
DIL
Give me that look again.
FERGUS
What look?
DIL
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She
holds them, with theatrical feeling.
DIL
Darling, you shouldn't have.
She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a
classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon
pull back a curtain, and they all clap.
FERGUS
What's that about?
DIL
They're jealous.
FERGUS
Why?
DIL
I wonder.
She takes his arm and walks off with him.
They are walking in an alleyway toward her house.
DIL
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
FERGUS
How special?
DIL
You want one?
And suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights
on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it.
FERGUS
Jesus Christ!
DIL
Jesus.
The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches
off.
FERGUS
That Dave?
DIL
The things a girl has to put up with.
She looks down toward where the car has pulled away.
DIL
I'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like
him.
A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus.
DIL
Piss off, Dave!
FERGUS
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all
right on your own?
DIL
I'm not on my own, am I?
She touches his cheek.
50.
DIL
Come on up, would you?
Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room
are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline,
pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We
hear the song "The Crying Game."
Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and
sticks it in the letter box.
A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with
a pole and replaces it with a number nine.
Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn
toward the building where Fergus is working.
Fergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off
her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling.
Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach.
FERGUS
Do they know?
DIL
Know what, honey?
FERGUS
Know what I didn't know. And don't call
me that.
DIL
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her
feelings.
FERGUS
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
67.
DIL
Details, baby, details.
FERGUS
So they do know.
DIL
All right, they do.
She takes his arm as they walk off.
FERGUS
Don't.
DIL
Sorry.
FERGUS
I should have known, shouldn't I?
DIL
Probably.
FERGUS
Kind of wish I didn't.
DIL
You can always pretend.
FERGUS
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't
he?
DIL
Absolutely.
FERGUS
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
DIL
Are you pretending yet?
FERGUS
I'm working on it.
Fergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look.
FERGUS
There's Dave. He knew too.
DIL
Stop it, Jimmy.
68.
FERGUS
Am I becoming repetitious?
DIL
A little.
FERGUS
Sorry.
They reach her door. The car stops.
FERGUS
Don't ask me in.
DIL
Please, Jimmy.
FERGUS
No. Can't pretend that much.
DIL
I miss you, Jimmy.
FERGUS
Should have stayed a girl.
DIL
Don't be cruel.
FERGUS
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
DIL
Only if you kiss me.
Fergus kisses her. He looks at her open lips as if in
disbelief at himself.
FERGUS
Happy now?
DIL
Delirious.
She goes inside.
Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand.
He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then
the chair turns and we see it is Jude.
Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling
brightly, then talking back to Dil
72.
Outside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away.
DIL
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong
--
FERGUS
Not here.
They pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising.
A figure standing down the alleyway, smoking. Fergus looks
toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting.
JUDE
She went that way --
Jude grabs his arm.
JUDE
But you come with me.
She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting.
They get inside.
ANOTHER CAR - BY THE PUB.
Dil, sitting inside a taxi watching Fergus and Jude getting
in the car.
76.
The car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors
down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative
club.
In the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the
building.
MAGUIRE
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
FERGUS
A hotel?
MAGUIRE
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh?
He visits his ladies on Tuesday and
Thursday nights and Saturday mornings.
His security's in the car beyond.
He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away.
Fergus looks from the window to the car.
FERGUS
Who is he?
MAGUIRE
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we
would call a legitimate target.
78.
FERGUS
Thank God for that.
MAGUIRE
You being cynical, Hennessy?
FERGUS
Hope not.
MAGUIRE
Good. So what do you think?
FERGUS
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men
are any good. And I presume you can't get
in.
MAGUIRE
Right.
FERGUS
So it's on the street.
MAGUIRE
Right.
FERGUS
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Jude turns around to look at him.
FERGUS
But, then, I don't have a choice.
JUDE
Och, you do, Fergie.
FERGUS
Of course. I forgot.
JUDE
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Jude and Fergus get out of the car. They walk down the
street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe-
bar with some tables outside.
Fergus and Jude, crossing the street.
JUDE
You keep your mind on the job, boy --
79.
FERGUS
And then you'll leave her out of it?
JUDE
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
They take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel
down the way.
JUDE
He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to
get to the door.
She checks her watch. Fergus is sweating.
FERGUS
And what if I say no?
JUDE
You know what. Go.
Down by the brothel, the door swings open.
Fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel.
There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it.
The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens.
Fergus quickens his pace.
Jude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking.
The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the
pavement, through the passersby, toward the car.
A burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward
the old gent.
Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes
between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes
Fergus's elbow.
GENT
Pardon me, young man --
Fergus walks on.
Jude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old
man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler.
Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off.
When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks
back.
80.
Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.
JUDE
You were made for this.
FERGUS
Was I?
JUDE
Perfect.
FERGUS
And what happens then?
JUDE
We'll be on the other side. We'll move
when you do.
FERGUS
And what if you don't?
JUDE
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
FERGUS
You may be right.
JUDE
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and
I'll bring you the gear.
Jude begins to walk away.
FERGUS
Jude?
JUDE
Yes?
FERGUS
Who's the old geezer?
JUDE
Some judge...
She walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car.
Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe. She goes
inside; he follows.
FERGUS
Why'd you follow me, Dil?
81.
DIL
Was jealous, Jimmy.
She downs a drink and motions for another. She seems high.
FERGUS
Shouldn't be, Dil
DIL
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand
and begins to wipe her face.
DIL
Don't. My makeup.
She sits down; he joins her.
DIL
She own you, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Yes.
DIL
She from Scotland too?
FERGUS
You could say that.
DIL
And you're not going to tell me more?
FERGUS
I can't.
He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the
tissue in her drink and wipes some more.
DIL
What you doing, Jimmy?
FERGUS
I'm not sure.
DIL
Do you like me even a little bit?
FERGUS
More than that.
Dil's face, staring at him.
82.
FERGUS
Come on, let's go for a walk.
She allows herself to be led out.
Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window.
FERGUS
You do something for me, Dil?
DIL
Anything.
FERGUS
You'd do anything for me?
DIL
Afraid so.
FERGUS
You got the keys to the shop?
They walk inside.
Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down
the street and inside.
DIL
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
FERGUS
Look on it like a honeymoon.
86.
A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel
in her hand.
Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in
her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil
walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her.
FERGUS
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing
here?
DIL
I'm going home!
FERGUS
Told you to stay in the hotel!
DIL
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you
was leaving me.
They are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very
drunk.
FERGUS
I had to go to work!
DIL
Stayed all day in that room thinking
every noise was you. There's something
you're not telling me, Jimmy.
He takes her arm.
FERGUS
Come on...
DIL
No! I'm going home...
Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat.
DIL
So tell me.
FERGUS
I was trying to get out of something.
DIL
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
Fergus looks at her.
88.
FERGUS
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
DIL
You mean that?
FERGUS
Yes.
And she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue.
FERGUS
Stop it, would you?
There is no response. He shakes her.
FERGUS
Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --
Still no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She
opens her eyes slowly.
DIL
Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood
condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy,
then I'll be all right.
Jude on the street. Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she
gets inside.
The figure of the judge in the window. Outline of a woman.
Jude and Maguire are in the car, parked across the street.
They look toward a paper seller.
MAGUIRE
Where the fuck is he? Christ --
Maguire's car driving round once more. No sign of Fergus.
MAGUIRE
That fucker's dead --
JUDE
No, we are.
The judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open
by his goon. Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand. The
goon sees him. Maguire shoots as he runs. Once, twice, three
times, four. The judge falls. The goon, hit in the arm, pulls
an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire hit, still shooting. Other
goons tear from the car. Mayhem, screaming. Jude hits the
pedal on her car and screeches off. Maguire, dead.
Two police cars, sirens wailing.
97.
