Carl Showalter is driving.
Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly
out.
After a long beat:
GRIMSRUD
Where is Pancakes Hause?
CARL
What?
GRIMSRUD
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
CARL
What're you, nuts?
We had
pancakes for breakfast.
I gotta
go somewhere I can get a shot
and a beer - and a steak maybe.
Not more fuckin' pancakes.
Come
on.
Grimsrud gives him a sour look.
CARL
...
Come on, man.
Okay, here's
an idea.
We'll stop outside of
Brainerd.
I know a place there
we can get laid.
Wuddya think?
GRIMSRUD
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
CARL
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin',
we'll stop for pancakes, then
we'll get laid.
Wuddya think?
GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE
Jerry is sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just
off the showroom floor.
On the other side of his desk sit
an irate customer and his wife.
CUSTOMER
We sat here right in this room and
went over this and over this!
JERRY
Yah, but that TruCoat -
CUSTOMER
I sat right here and said I didn't
want no TruCoat!
JERRY
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat,
you don't get it and you get
oxidization problems.
It'll cost
you a heck of lot more'n five
hunnert -
CUSTOMER
You're sittin' here, you're talkin'
in circles!
You're talkin' like
we didn't go over this already!
JERRY
Yah, but this TruCoat -
CUSTOMER
We had us a deal here for nine-
teen-five.
You sat there and
darned if you didn't tell me
you'd get this car, these options,
WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine-
teen-five!
JERRY
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
CUSTOMER
You called me twenty minutes ago
and said you had it!
Ready to
make delivery, ya says!
Come on
down and get it!
And here ya are
and you're wastin' my time and
you're wastin' my wife's time and
I'm payin' nineteen-five for this
vehicle here!
JERRY
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
He rises, and, as he leaves:
JERRY
...
See, they install that TruCoat
at the factory, there's nothin' we
can do, but I'll talk to my boss.
The couple watch him go to a nearby cubicle.
CUSTOMER
These guys here - these guys!
It's always the same!
It's always
more!
He's a liar!
WIFE
Please, dear.
CUSTOMER
We went over this and over this -
NEARBY CUBICLE
Jerry sits perched on the desk of another salesman who is
eating lunch as he watches a hockey game on a small portable
TV.
JERRY
So you're goin' to the Gophers
on Sunday?
SALESMAN
You bet.
JERRY
You wouldn't have an extra ticket
there?
SALESMAN
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
JERRY
Yah.
SALESMAN
Ya kiddin'!
JERRY'S CUBICLE
Jerry re-enters.
JERRY
Well, he never done this before,
but seein' as it's special
circumstances and all, he says I
can knock one hunnert off that
TruCoat.
CUSTOMER
One hundred!
You lied to me, Mr.
Lundegaard.
You're a bald-faced
liar!
Jerry sits staring at his lap.
CUSTOMER
...
A fucking liar -
WIFE
Bucky, please!
Jerry mumbles into his lap:
JERRY
One hunnert's the best we can
do here.
CUSTOMER
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my
goddamn checkbook.
Let's get this
over with.
WIDE EXTERIOR:
TRUCK STOP
There is a restaurant with many big rigs parked nearby, and
a motel with an outsize Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
flanking its sign:
BLUE OX MOTEL.
MOTEL ROOM
Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in the twin beds
having sex with two truck-stop hookers.
CARL
Oh, Jesus, yeah.
HIS HOOKER
There ya go, sugar.
GRIMSRUD
Nnph.
HIS HOOKER
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
LATER
The couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the
offscreen TV.
ED MCMAHON
-
Johnny's guests tonight will be
Lee Majors, George Wendt, and Steve
Boutsikaros from the San Diego Zoo,
so keep that dial -
LUNDEGAARD KITCHEN
We hear a morning show on television.
Jean Lundegaard is
making coffee in the kitchen as Scott eats cereal at the
table.
JEAN
I'm talkin' about your potential.
SCOTT
(absently)
Uh-huh.
JEAN
You're not a C student.
SCOTT
Uhn.
JEAN
And yet you're gettin' C grades.
It's this disparity there that
concerns your dad and me.
SCOTT
Uh-huh.
JEAN
You know what a disparity is?
SCOTT
(testily)
Yeah!
JEAN
Okay.
Well, that's why we don't
want ya goin' out fer hockey.
SCOTT
Oh, man!
The phone rings.
SCOTT
...
What's the big deal?
It's
an hour -
JEAN
Hold on.
She picks up the phone.
JEAN
...
Hello?
PHONE VOICE
Yah, hiya, hon.
JEAN
Oh, hiya, Dad.
WADE
Jerry around?
JEAN
Yah, he's still here - I'll
catch him for ya.
She holds the phone away and calls:
JEAN
...
Hon?
VOICE
Yah.
JEAN
It's Dad.
VOICE
Yah...
Jerry enters in shirtsleeves and tie.
JERRY
...
Yah, okay...
SCOTT
Look, Dad, there is no fucking
way -
JEAN
Scott!
JERRY
Say, let's watch the language -
He takes the phone.
JERRY
How ya doin', Wade?
WADE
What's goin' on there?
JERRY
Oh, nothing, Wade.
How ya doin'
there?
WADE
Stan Grossman looked at your
proposal.
Says it's pretty
sweet.
JERRY
No kiddin'?
WADE
We might be innarested.
JERRY
No kiddin'!
I'd need the cash
pretty quick there.
In order
to close the deal.
WADE
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk
about it.
If your numbers are
right, Stan says its pretty
sweet.
Stan Grossman.
JERRY
Yah.
WADE
2:30.
Click.
Dial tone.
JERRY
Yah, okay.
GUSTAFSON OLD GARAGE
Jerry wanders through the service area where cars are being
worked on.
He stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is
looking at the underside of a car that sits on a hydraulic
lift with a cage light hanging off its innards.
JERRY
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
SHEP
Mm.
JERRY
Say, ya know those two fellas
ya put me in touch with, up
there in Fargo?
SHEP
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
JERRY
Well, yah, but he had a buddy
there.
He, uh -
SHEP
Well, I don't vouch for him.
JERRY
Well, that's okay, I just -
SHEP
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his
buddy?
JERRY
Carl somethin'?
SHEP
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch
for him.
JERRY
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy
of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm
not worryin'.
I just, I was
wonderin', see, I gotta get in
touch with 'em for, I might not
need it anymore, sumpn's happenin',
see -
SHEP
Call 'em up.
JERRY
Yah, well, see, I did that, and
I haven't been able to get 'em,
so I thought you maybe'd know an
alternate number or what have ya.
SHEP
Nope.
Jerry slaps his fist into his open palm and snaps his
fingers.
JERRY
Okay, well, real good, then.
CAR
Carl is driving.
Grimsrud stares out front.
After a beat:
CARL
...
Look at that.
Twin Cities.
IDS Building, the big glass one.
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.
After the Sears, uh, Chicago...
You never been to Minneapolis?
GRIMSRUD
No.
CARL
...
Would it kill you to say
something?
GRIMSRUD
I did.
CARL
"No." First thing you've said
in the last four hours.
That's
a, that's a fountain of conversation,
man.
That's a geyser.
I mean, whoa,
daddy, stand back, man.
Shit, I'm
sittin' here driving, man, doin'
all the driving, whole fuckin' way
from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to,
you know, tryin' to chat, keep
our spirits up, fight the boredom
of the road, and you can't say one
fucking thing just in the way of
conversation.
Grimsurd smokes, gazing out the window.
CARL
...
Well, fuck it, I don't have
to talk either, man.
See how
you like it...
He drives.
CARL
...
Total silence...
JERRY'S CUBICLE
He is on the phone.
JERRY
Yah, real good.
How you doin'?
VOICE
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.
You're damned hard to get on the
phone.
JERRY
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here,
but that's the way we like it.
VOICE
That's for sure.
Now, I just
need, on these last, these financing
documents you sent us, I can't
read the serial numbers of the
vehicles on here, so I -
JERRY
But I already got the, it's okay,
the loans are in place, I already
got the, the what, the -
VOICE
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty
thousand dollars, you got the money
last month.
JERRY
Yah, so we're all set.
VOICE
Yeah, but the vehicles you were
borrowing on, I just can't read
the serial numbers on your
applicaton.
Maybe if you could
just read them to me -
JERRY
But the deal's already done, I
already got the money -
VOICE
Yeah, but we have an audit here,
I just have to know that these
vehicles you're financing with
this money, that they really
exist.
JERRY
Yah, well, they exist all right.
VOICE
I'm sure they do - ha ha!
But
I can't read their serial numbers
here.
So if you could read me -
JERRY
Well, but see, I don't have 'em
in front a me - why don't I just
fax you over a copy -
VOICE
No, fax is no good, that's what
I have and I can't read the darn
thing -
JERRY
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl
send you over a copy, then.
VOICE
Okay, because if I can't correlate
this note with the specific vehicles,
then I gotta call back that money -
JERRY
Yah, how much money was that?
VOICE
Three hundred and twenty thousand
dollars.
See, I gotta correlate
that money with the cars it's being
lent on.
JERRY
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax
that over to ya, then.
VOICE
No, no, fax is -
JERRY
I mean send it over.
I'll shoot
it right over to ya.
VOICE
Okay.
JERRY
Okay, real good, then.
CLOSE ON TELEVISION
A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a
kitchen set.
HOST
So I seperate the - how the heck
do I get the egg out of the shell
without breaking it?
Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of
coffee, watching the television.
HOSTESS
You just prick a little hole in
the end and blow!
Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio
audience.
She hears something else - a faint scraping sound
- and looks up.
HOST
Okay, here goes nothing.
The scraping sound persists.
Jean sets down her coffee cup
and rises.
From the studio audience:
AUDIENCE
Awoooo!
KITCHEN
We track toward the back door.
A curtain is stretched tight
across its window.
Jean pulls the curtain back.
Bright sunlight amplified by
snow floods in.
A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.
Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -
- a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.
We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.
The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.
She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps
her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites
down hard.
He drops her wrist.
As Carl enters, she races up the
stairs.
GRIMSRUD
Unguent.
CARL
Huh?
Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
GRIMSRUD
I need ... unguent.
UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
As the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming
shut.
A cord snakes in under the door.
MASTER BATHROOM
Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
phone.
The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
cord ripped free.
With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.
BEDROOM
Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
and frame, and is working it.
BATHROOM
Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
open.
Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
lightly in.
Jean steps up onto the toilet.
The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.
Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
the tank.
The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.
The door swings open.
Grimsrud and Carl enter.
THEIR POV
Room empty, window open.
Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out.
Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.
He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
something in the mirror.
The shower curtain is drawn around the tub.
He steps toward it.
As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
by thrashing limbs.
Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.
Grimsrud follows.
BEDROOM
Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
but awkwardly trying to push it off.
UPSTAIRS LANDING
Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
stairs.
Grimsrud trots down after her.
A PLAQUE:
WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED
Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry
enters.
JERRY
How ya doin' there, Stan?
How
are ya, Wade?
Stan Grossman shakes his hand.
STAN
Good to see ya again, Jerry.
If
these numbers are right, this
looks pretty sweet.
JERRY
Oh, those numbers are all right,
bleemee.
WADE
This is do-able.
STAN
Congratulations, Jerry.
JERRY
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
WADE
What kind of finder's fee were
you looking for?
JERRY
...
Huh?
STAN
The financials are pretty thorough,
so the only thing we don't know
is your fee.
JERRY
...
My fee?
Wade, what the
heck're you talkin' about?
WADE
Stan and I're okay.
JERRY
Yah.
WADE
We're good to loan in.
JERRY
Yah.
WADE
But we never talked about your
fee for bringin' it to us.
JERRY
No, but, Wade, see, I was
bringin' you this deal for you
to loan me the money to put
in.
It's my deal here, see?
Wade scowls, looks at Stan.
STAN
Jerry - we thought you were
bringin' us an investment.
JERRY
Yah, right -
STAN
You're sayin' - what're you
sayin'?
WADE
You're sayin' that we put in
all the money and you collect
when it pays off?
JERRY
No, no.
I - I'd, I'd - pay you
back the principal, and interest
- heck, I'd go - one over prime -
STAN
We're not a bank, Jerry.
Wade is angry.
WADE
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted
bank interest on seven hunnert'n
fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest
Federal.
Talk to Bill Diehl.
STAN
He's at Norstar.
WADE
He's at -
JERRY
No, see, I don't need a finder's
fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,
ten percent, heck that's not gonna
do it for me.
I need the principal.
STAN
Jerry, we're not just going to
give you seven hundred and fifty
thousand dollars.
WADE
What the heck were you thinkin'?
Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank
interest, I'd look for complete
security.
Heck, FDIC.
I don't
see nothin' like that here.
JERRY
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd
guarantee ya your money back.
WADE
I'm not talkin' about your damn
word, Jerry.
Geez, what the
heck're you?...
Well, look, I
don't want to cut you out of the
loop, but his here's a good deal.
I assume, if you're not innarested,
you won't mind if we move on it
independently.
PARKING LOT
We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly
out at his sides, his breath vaporizing.
He goes to his
car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper
and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
that has developed on his windshield.
The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.
Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the
windshield and the hood of his car.
The tantrum passes.
Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing
in particular.
Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
windshield.
FRONT DOOR
A beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.
The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,
holding a sack of groceries.
JERRY
Hon?
He shuts the door.
JERRY
...
Got the growshries...
He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.
He
frowns, pokes at it with his foot.
JERRY
...
Hon?
UPSTAIRS BATHROOM
Jerry walks in.
He sets the groceries down on the toilet
tank.
He looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts
in.
He shuts it.
He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,
frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.
He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.
FOYER
Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.
From another room:
JERRY
Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.
Then, slightly more agitated.
JERRY
...
Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's
Jerry...
Beat.
JERRY
...
Wade, it's Jerry, I - we
gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible...
Beat.
LIVING ROOM
Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a
telephone.
After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
a number.
JERRY
...
Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.
BLACK
Hold in black.
A slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
paper-mache figure into frame.
It is a flannel-shirt
woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.
As
we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing
tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a
pedestal.
A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:
WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.
The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
background.
The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.
Carl drives.
Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.
From the back seat we hear whimpering.
Grimsrud turns to look.
Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
tarpaulin.
GRIMSRUD
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw
you back in the trunk, you know.
CARL
Geez.
That's more'n I've heard
you say all week.
Grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.
At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
window.
Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
his gumballs.
Carl eases the car onto the shoulder.
CARL
Ah, shit, the tags...
Grimsrud looks at him.
CARL
...
It's just the tags.
I never
put my tags on the car.
Don't
worry, I'll take care of this.
He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
the gravel shoulder.
CARL
...
Let's keep still back there,
lady, or we're gonna have to, ya
know, to shoot ya.
Grimsrud stares at Carl.
CARL
...
Hey!
I'll take care of this!
Both cars have stopped.
Carl looks up at the rear-view
mirror.
The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,
writing in his citation book.
Carl watches.
We hear the trooper's door open.
The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly
on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night
air.
Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.
CARL
How can I help you, officer?
The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.
Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.
Finally:
TROOPER
This is a new car, then, sir?
CARL
It certainly is, officer.
Still
got that smell!
TROOPER
You're required to display
temporary tags, either in the
plate area or taped inside the
back window.
CARL
Certainly -
TROOPER
Can I see your license and
registration please?
CARL
Certainly.
He reaches for his wallet.
CARL
...
I was gonna tape up the
temporary tag, ya know, to be
in full compliance, but it, uh,
it, uh ... must a slipped my
mind...
He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-
dollar bill protruding from it.
CARL
...
So maybe the best thing
would be to take care of that,
right here in Brainerd.
TROOPER
What's this, sir?
CARL
That's my license and regis-
tration.
I wanna be in
compliance.
He forces a laugh.
CARL
...
I was just thinking I could
take care of it right here.
In
Brainerd.
The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
and hands the billfold back into the car.
TROOPER
Put that back in your pocket,
please.
Carl's nervous smile fades.
TROOPER
...
And step out of the car,
please, sir.
Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.
There is a whimpering sound.
The policeman hesitates.
Another sound.
The policeman leans forward into the car, listening.
Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair
and slams his head down onto the car door.
The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and
throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car.
With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.
He
brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
into the back of the trooper's head.
Jean screams.
GRIMSRUD
Shut up.
He releases the policeman.
The policeman's head slides out the window and his body
flops back onto the street.
Carl looks out at the cop in the road.
CARL
(softly)
Whoa...
Whoa, Daddy.
Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails
it out the open window.
GRIMSRUD
You'll take care of it.
Boy, you
are smooth smooth, you know.
CARL
Whoa, Daddy.
Jean, for some reason, screams again.
Then stops.
GRIMSRUD
Clear him off the road.
CARL
Yeah.
He gets out.
Grimsrud notices.
Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat.
He squeals into a U-
turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.
Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead.
The pursued car
churns up fine snow.
Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
his ashtray.
We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.
In the back seat, Jean starts screaming.
Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.
He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.
The red tail lights ahead start to turn.
With a distant
crunching sound, they disappear.
The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.
Grimsrud frowns and slows.
His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled
around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.
Grimsrud brakes.
Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.
Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his
door and gets out.
Norm sits back onto the bed, shrugging off his robe.
Off-
screen we hear the front door open.
FRONT DOOR
Marge stamps the snow off her shoes.
MARGE
Hon?
NORM
(off)
Yah?
MARGE
Prowler needs a jump.
HIGHWAY
Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of
the road, a pair of men inside each car.
The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka
emerges, holding two styrofoam cups.
His partner leans
across the seat to close the door after him.
The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car.
MARGE
Hiya, Lou.
LOU
Margie.
Thought you might need
a little warm-up.
He hands her one of the cups of coffee.
MARGE
Yah, thanks a bunch.
So what's
the deal, now?
Gary says triple
homicide?
LOU
Yah, looks pretty bad.
Two
of'm're over here.
Marge looks around as they start walking.
MARGE
Where is everybody?
LOU
Well - it's cold, Margie.
BY THE WRECK
Laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car, a
pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange
parka face down in the bloodstained snow, and one pair of
footsteps leading back to the road.
Marge is peering into the car.
MARGE
Ah, geez.
So...
Aw, geez.
Here's the second one...
It's
in the head and the ... hand
there, I guess that's a defensive
wound.
Okay.
Marge looks up from the car.
MARGE
...
Where's the state trooper?
Lou, up on the shoulder, jerks his thumb.
LOU
Back there a good piece.
In
the ditch next to his prowler.
Marge looks around at the road.
MARGE
Okay, so we got a state trooper
pulls someone over, we got a
shooting, and these folks drive
by, and we got a high-speed
pursuit, ends here, and this
execution-type deal.
LOU
Yah.
MARGE
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.
LOU
Yah.
Marge is studying the ground.
MARGE
Yah.
And I'll tell you what, from
his footprints he looks like a big
fella -
Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her
knees down near the snow.
LOU
Ya see something down there, Chief?
MARGE
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
LOU
Geez, you okay, Margie?
MARGE
I'm fine - it's just morning
sickness.
She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees.
MARGE
...
Well, that passed.
LOU
Yah?
MARGE
Yah.
Now I'm hungry again.
LOU
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
MARGE
Oh, yah.
Norm made some eggs.
LOU
Yah?
Well, what now, d'ya think?
MARGE
Let's go take a look at that
trooper.
BY THE STATE TROOPER'S CAR
Marge's prowler is parked nearby.
Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch,
again looking at footprints in the snow.
She calls up to
the road:
MARGE
There's two of 'em, Lou!
LOU
Yah?
MARGE
Yah, this guy's smaller than
his buddy.
LOU
Oh, yah?
DOWN IN THE DITCH
In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing
us.
Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and
knees, is Marge.
MARGE
For Pete's sake.
She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out
of the ditch.
LOU
How's it look, Marge?
MARGE
Well, he's got his gun on his hip
there, and he looks like a nice
enough guy.
It's a real shame.
LOU
Yah.
MARGE
You haven't monkeyed with his car
there, have ya?
LOU
No way.
She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the
shoulder.
MARGE
Somebody shut his lights.
I guess
the little guy sat in there, waitin'
for his buddy t'come back.
LOU
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
MARGE
Heck, yah.
Ya think, is Dave open
yet?
LOU
You don't think he's mixed up in -
MARGE
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some
night crawlers.
Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her.
MARGE
You look in his citation book?
LOU
Yah...
He looks at his notebook.
LOU
...
Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
Under the plate number he put
DLR - I figure they stopped him
or shot him before he could finish
fillin' out the tag number.
MARGE
Uh-huh.
LOU
So I got the state lookin' for a
Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.
They don't got no match yet.
MARGE
I'm not sure I agree with you a
hunnert percent on your policework,
there, Lou.
LOU
Yah?
MARGE
Yah, I think that vehicle there
probly had dealer plates.
DLR?
LOU
Oh...
Lou gazes out the window, thinking.
LOU
...
Geez.
MARGE
Yah.
Say, Lou, ya hear the one
about the guy who couldn't afford
personalized plates, so he went
and changed his name to J2L 4685?
LOU
Yah, that's a good one.
MARGE
Yah.
THE ROAD
The police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight-
ruled empty highway, cutting a landscape of flat and perfect
white.
EMBERS FAMILY RESTAURANT
Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit in a booth, sipping
coffee.
Outside the window, snow falls from a gunmetal sky.
WADE
-
All's I know is, ya got a
problem, ya call a professional!
JERRY
No!
They said no cops!
They were
darned clear on that, Wade!
They
said you call the cops and we -
WADE
Well, a course they're gonna say
that!
But where's my protection?
They got Jean here!
I give these
sons a bitches a million dollars,
where's my guarantee they're gonna
let her go.
JERRY
Well, they -
WADE
A million dollars is a lot a damn
money!
And there they are, they
got my daughter!
JERRY
Yah, but think this thing through
here, Wade.
Ya give 'em what they
want, why wont' they let her go?
You gotta listen to me on this one,
Wade.
WADE
Heck, you don't know!
You're just
whistlin' Dixie here!
I'm sayin',
the cops, they can advise us on
this!
I'm sayin' call a professional!
JERRY
No!
No cops!
That's final!
This
is my deal here, Wade!
Jean is
my wife here!
STAN
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin'
to Jerry's viewpoint here.
WADE
Well -
STAN
We gotta protect Jean.
These -
we're not holdin' any cards here,
Wade, they got all of 'em.
So
they call the shots.
JERRY
You're darned tootin'!
WADE
Ah, dammit!
STAN
I'm tellin' ya.
WADE
Well...
Why don't we...
He saws a finger under his nose.
WADE
...
Stan, I'm thinkin' we should
offer 'em half a million.
JERRY
Now come on here, no way, Wade!
No way!
STAN
We're not horse-trading here, Wade,
we just gotta bite the bullet on
this thing.
JERRY
Yah!
STAN
What's the next step here, Jerry?
JERRY
They're gonna call, give me
instructions for a drop.
I'm
supposed to have the money ready
tomorrow.
WADE
Dammit!
THE CASHIER
She rings up two dollars forty.
CASHIER
How was everything today?
JERRY
Yah, real good now.
PARKING LOT
Snow continues to fall.
Jerry and Stan stand bundled in
their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles.
Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for
Stan.
STAN
Okay.
We'll get the money together.
Don't worry about it, Jerry.
Now,
d'you want anyone at home, with you,
until they call?
JERRY
No, I - they don't want - they're
just s'posed to be dealin' with
me, they were real clear.
STAN
Yah.
Jerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold.
JERRY
Ya know, they said no one listenin'
in, they'll be watchin', ya know.
Maybe it's all bull, but like you
said, Stan, they're callin' the
shots.
STAN
Okay.
And Scotty, is he gonna
be all right?
JERRY
Yah, geez, Scotty.
I'll go talk
to him.
There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the
Lincoln.
STAN
We'll call.
The Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and
fishtails out onto the boulevard.
SCOTTY'S BEDROOM
Scotty lies on the bed, weeping.
Jerry enters and perches
uncomfortably on the edge of his bed.
JERRY
...
How ya doin' there, Scotty?
SCOTT
Dad!
What're they doing?
Wuddya
think they're doin' with Mom?
JERRY
It's okay, Scotty.
They're not
gonna want to hurt her any.
These men, they just want money,
see.
SCOTT
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
JERRY
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here.
Grandad and I, we're - we're makin'
sure this gets handled right.
Scott snorfles and sits up.
SCOTT
Dad, I really think we should call
the cops.
JERRY
No!
We can't let anyone know about
this thing!
We gotta play ball with
these guys - you ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell ya the same thing!
SCOTT
Yeah, but -
JERRY
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but
we gotta play ball.
Ya know, that's
the deal.
Now if Lorraine calls, or
Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in
Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Scotty starts to weep again.
Jerry stares down at his lap.
JERRY
...
That's the best we can do here.
Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an
elevated dance platform.
The club, not yet open for
business, is deserted.
MARGE
Where you girls from?
HOOKER ONE
Chaska.
HOOKER TWO
LeSeure.
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.
MARGE
Okay, I want you to tell me what
these fellas looked like.
HOOKER ONE
Well, the little guy, he was
kinda funny-looking.
MARGE
In what way?
HOOKER ONE
I dunno.
Just funny-looking.
MARGE
Can you be any more specific?
HOOKER ONE
I couldn't really say.
He wasn't
circumcised.
MARGE
Was he funny-looking apart from
that?
HOOKER ONE
Yah.
MARGE
So you were having sex with the
little fella, then?
HOOKER ONE
Uh-huh.
MARGE
Is there anything else you can
tell me about him?
HOOKER ONE
No.
Like I say, he was funny-looking.
More'n most people even.
MARGE
And what about the other fella?
HOOKER TWO
He was a little older.
Looked like
the Marlboro man.
MARGE
Yah?
HOOKER TWO
Yah.
Maybe I'm sayin' that cause
he smoked Marlboros.
MARGE
Uh-huh.
HOOKER TWO
A subconscious-type thing.
MARGE
Yah, that can happen.
HOOKER TWO
Yah.
HOOKER ONE
They said they were goin' to the
Twin Cities?
MARGE
Oh, yah?
HOOKER TWO
Yah.
HOOKER ONE
Yah.
Is that useful to ya?
MARGE
Oh, you bet, yah.
We track in on Jean Lundegaard, who sits tied in a chair
with the black hood still over her head.
As we track in, we
hear inarticulate cursing, intermittent banging and loud
static.
We track in on Gaear Grimsrud, who sits smoking a cigarette
and expressionlessly gazing offscreen.
We track in on Carl Showalter, who stands over an old black-
and-white television.
It plays nothing but snow.
Carl is
banging on it as he mutters:
CARL
...days ... be here for days with
a - DAMMIT! - a goddamn mute ...
nothin' to do ... and the fucking -
DAMMIT!...
Each "dammit" brings a pound of his fist on the TV.
CARL
...
TV doesn't even ... plug me
in, man...
Gimmee a - DAMMIT! -
signal...
Plug me into the
ozone, baby...
Plug me into the
ozone - FUCK!...
With one last bang we cut:
BACK TO THE TELEVISION SET
In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm.
TV VOICE-OVER
The bark beetle carries the worm
to the nest ... where it will feed
its young for up to six weeks...
A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's
house.
Marge and Norm are watching television in bed.
From the TV
we hear insects chirring.
After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs,
still looking at the set:
MARGE
...
Well, I'm turnin' in, Norm.
Also looking at the TV:
NORM
...
Oh, yah?
Marge rolls over and Norm continues to watch.
We hold.
BLACK
Hold.
A snowflake drops through the black.
Another flake.
It starts snowing.
BRAINERD MAIN STREET
The lone traffic light blinks slowly, steadily, red.
Snow
sifts down.
There is no other movement.
PAUL BUNYAN
We are looking up at the bottom-lit statue.
Snow falls.
HIGH SHOT OF MARGE'S HOUSE
Snow drops away.
HIGH SHOT IN MARGE'S BEDROOM
The bedroom is dark.
Norm is snoring.
The phone rings.
Marge gropes in the dark.
MARGE
Hello?
VOICE
Yah, is this Marge?
MARGE
Yah?
VOICE
Margie Olmstead?
MARGE
...
Well, yah.
Who's this?
VOICE
This is Mike Yanagita.
Ya know

Remember me?
MARGE
...
Mike Yanagita!
MIKE
Yah!
Marge props herself up next to the still-sleeping Norm.
MARGE
Yah, yah, course I remember.
How are ya?
What time is it?
MIKE
Oh, geez.
It's quarter to eleven.
I hope I dint wake you.
MARGE
No, that's okay.
MIKE
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities
and I was just watching on TV
about these shootings up in
Brainderd, and I saw you on the
news there.
MARGE
Yah.
MIKE

Olmstead?
I can't believe it!
MARGE
Yah, that's me.
MIKE

MARGE

MIKE
Oh, pretty good.
MARGE

MIKE

Yah, yah.
Geeze, Margie!

JERRY
What the heck're you talkin' about?
Let's just finish up this deal

CARL
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
Jerry sits dumbly.
The voice solemnly repeats:
CARL
...
Blood has been shed.
JERRY
What the heck d'ya mean?
CARL
Three people.
In Brainerd.
JERRY
Oh, geez.
CARL
That's right.

Jerry.
The price is now the whole

We want the entire eighty
thousand.
JERRY
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
CARL
Blood has been shed.
We've incurred
risks, Jerry.
I'm coming into town

Have the money ready.
JERRY
Now we had a deal here!
A deal's

CARL
IS IT, JERRY?
You ask those three
pour souls up in Brainerd if a
deal's a deal!
Go ahead, ask 'em!
JERRY
...
The heck d'ya mean?
CARL
I'll see you tomorrow.
Click.
Jerry slams down the phone, which immediately rings.
He
angrily snatches it up.
JERRY
Yah!
VOICE
Jerome Lundegaard?
JERRY
Yah!
VOICE
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC.
Sir, I have not yet recieved those
vehicle IDs you promised me.
JERRY
Yah!
I ... those are in the mail.
VOICE
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may
be.
I must inform you, however,
that absent the reciept of those
numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I
will have to refer this matter to
our legal department.
JERRY
Yah.
VOICE
My patience is at an end.
JERRY
Yah.
VOICE
Good day, sir.
JERRY
...
Yah.
WIDE ON THE CUBICLE
We are looking at Jerry's cubicle from across the showroom.
Noise muted by distance, we watch Jerry slam down the
reciever, rise to his feet, fling the phone to the floor,
raise his desk blotter high over his head with pens and
pencils rolling off it and slam it onto his desktop.
He stands for a moment, hands on hips, glaring.
He stoops and picks up the phone, places it back on the
desktop, starts picking up the pens and pencils.
TRACK
On steam-table bins of food, each identified by a plaque:
BEEF STROGANOFF, SWEDISH MEATBALLS, BROILED TORSK, CHICKEN
FLORENTINE.
A complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a
buffet line, piled high with many foods.
MARGE AND NORM AT A TABLE
They sit next to each other at a long cafateria-style
Formica table, silently eating.
A hip with a hissing walkie-talkie enters frame.
GARY
Hiya, Norm.
How ya doin', Margie?
How's the fricasse?
MARGE
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
GARY
No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought
you were goin' fishin' up at Mile
Lacs?
NORM
Yah, after lunch.
He goes back to his food.
MARGE
Whatcha got there?
Gary hands her a flimsy.
Marge takes it with one hand and
looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food.
GARY
The numbers y'asked for, calls
made from the lobby pay phone
at the Blue Ox.
Two to Minneapolis
that night.
MARGE
Mm.
GARY
First one's a trucking company,
second one's a private residence.
A Shep Proudfoot.
MARGE
Uh-huh...
A what?
GARY
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.
MARGE
Uh-huh.
GARY
Yah.
MARGE
...
Yah, okay, I think I'll
drive down there, then.
GARY
Oh, yah?
Twin Cities?
Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at
Marge with mild interest.
He stares for a beat as he
finishes chewing, and them swallows and says:
NORM
...
Oh, yah?
KITCHEN OF LUNDEGAARD HOUSE
Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table.
It is night.
The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging
fixture.
On the table are the remains of coffee and a
cinammon filbert ring.
WADE
Dammit!
I wanna be a part a
this thing!
JERRY
No, Wade!
They were real clear!
They said they'd call tomorrow,
with instructions, and it's gonna
be delivered by me alone!
WADE
It's my money, I'll deliver it
- what do they care?
STAN
Wade's got a point there.
I'll
handle the call if you want, Jerry.
JERRY
No, no.
See - they, no, see, they
only deal with me.
Ya feel this,
this nervousness on the phone there,
they're very - these guys're
dangerous -
WADE
All the more reason!
I don't want
you - with all due respect, Jerry
- I don't want you mucking this up.
JERRY
The heck d'ya mean?
WADE
They want my money, they can deal
with me.
Otherwise I'm goin' to
a professional.
He points at a briefcase.
WADE
...
There's a million dollars
here!
JERRY
No, see -
WADE
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin'
me a damn car.
It's my show here.
That's that.
STAN
It's the way we prefer to handle
it, Jerry.
THE DOWNTOWN RADISSON HOTEL
Marge is at the reception desk.
MARGE
How ya doin'?
CLERK
Real good.
How're you today, ma'am?
MARGE
Real good.
I'm Mrs. Gunderson, I
have a reservation.
The clerk types into a computer console.
CLERK
You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.
MARGE
Is there a phone down here, ya think?
LOBBY CORNER
Marge is on a public phone.
MARGE
...
Detective Sibert?
Yah, this
is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd,
we spoke -
Yah.
Well, actually
I'm in town here.
I had to do a
few things in the Twin Cities, so
I thought I'd check in with ya about
that USIF search on Shep Proudfoot...
Oh, yah?...
Well, maybe I'll go
visit with him if I have the...
No,
I can find that...
Well, thanks a
bunch.
Say, d'ya happen to know a
good place for lunch in the downtown
area?...
Yah, the Radisson...
Oh,
yah?
Is it reasonable?
A GREEN FREEWAY SIGN
Through a windshield we see a sign for the MINNEAPOLIS
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
ROOFTOP PARKING LOT
The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the
few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot.
It stops by one car and Carl emerges.
He quickly scans the
lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car
and starts unscrewing its license plate.
EXIT BOOTH
Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket.
CARL
Yeah, I decided not to park here.
The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket.
ATTENDANT
...
What do you mean, you decided
not to park here?
CARL
Yeah, I just came in.
I decided
not to park here.
The attendant is still puzzled.
ATTENDANT
You, uh...
I'm sorry, sir, but -
CARL
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not
taking the trip as it turns out.
ATTENDANT
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to
charge you the four dollars.
CARL
I just pulled in here.
I just
fucking pulled in here!
ATTENDANT
Well, see, there's a minimum charge
of four dollars.
Long-term parking
charges by the day.
A car behind beeps.
Carl glances back, starts digging for
money.
CARL
I guess you think, ya know, you're
an authority figure.
With that
stupid fucking uniform.
Huh, buddy?
The attendant doesn't say anything.
CARL
...
King Clip-on Tie here.
Big
fucking man.
He is peeling off one dollar bills.
CARL
...
You know, these are the limits
of your life, man.
Ruler of your
little fucking gate here.
There's
your four dollars.
You pathetic
piece of shit.
GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE
Jerry is staring up, mouth agape, at the underside of a car
on a hydraulic lift.
Bewildered, he looks about, then asks
a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the
shop.
JERRY
Where's Shep?
The mechanic points.
MECHANIC
Talkin' to a cop.
Jerry looks.
JERRY
...
Cop?
Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor
in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle.
MECHANIC
Said she was a policewoman.
Marge and Shep silently talk.
Jerry stares, swallows.
INSIDE THE CUBICLE
MARGE
- Wednesday night?
Shep is shaking his head.
SHEP
Nope.
MARGE
Well, you do reside their at
1425 Fremont Terrace?
SHEP
Yep.
MARGE
Anyone else residing there?
SHEP
Nope.
MARGE
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past three in the morning.
It's just hard for me to believe
you can't remember anyone calling.
Shep says nothing.
MARGE
...
Now, I know you've had some
problems, struggling with the
narcotics, some other entanglements,
currently on parole -
SHEP
So?
MARGE
Well, associating with criminals,
if you're the one they talked to,
that right there would be a
violation of your parole and would
end with you back in Stillwater.
SHEP
Uh-huh.
MARGE
Now, I saw some rough stuff on
your priors, but nothing in the
nature of a homicide...
Shep stares at her.
MARGE
...
I know you don't want to be
an accessory to something like
that.
SHEP
Nope.
MARGE
So you think you might remember
who those folks were who called
ya?
JERRY'S OFFICE
Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk.
At a noise he
looks up.
Marge has stuck her head in the door.
MARGE
Mr. Lundegaard?
JERRY
Huh?
Yah?
MARGE
I wonder if I could take just a
minute of your time here -
JERRY
What...
What is it all about?
MARGE
Huh?
Do you mind if I sit down
- I'm carrying quite a load here.
Marge plops into the chair opposite him.
MARGE
...
You're the owner here, Mr.
Lundegaard?
JERRY
Naw, I...
Executive Sales Manager.
MARGE
Well, you can help me.
My name's
Marge Gunderson -
JERRY
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
MARGE
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd investigating some
malfeasance and I was just wondering
if you've had any new vehicles stolen
off the lot in the past couple of
weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass
Ciera?
Jerry stares at her, his mouth open.
MARGE
...
Mr. Lundegaard?
JERRY
...
Brainerd?
MARGE
Yah.
Yah.
Home a Paul Bunyan and
Babe the Blue Ox.
JERRY
...
Babe the Blue Ox?
MARGE
Yah, ya know we've got the big
statue there.
So you haven't had
any vehicles go missing, then?
JERRY
No.
No, ma'am.
MARGE
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.
I'll
let you get back to your paperwork,
then.
As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on
the desk in front of him.
JERRY
...
Yah, okay.
He looks up at Marge's retreating back.
He looks back down
at the papers.
He looks over at the phone.
he picks up the phone and dials four digits.
JERRY
...
Yah, gimmee Shep...
The
heck d'ya mean?...
Well, where'd
he go?
It's only...
No, I don't
need a mechanic - oh, geez - I
gotta talk to a friend of his, so,
uh ... have him, uh ... oh, geez...
HOTEL BAR
Marge enters.
She looks around the bar, a rather
characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people.
VOICE
Marge?
It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising
from a booth halfway back.
His features are broad,
friendly, Asian-American.
MARGE
Mike!
He approaches somewhat carefully, as if on his second drink.
They hug and head back toward the booth.
MIKE
Geez!
You look great!
MARGE
Yah - easy there - you do too!
I'm expecting, ya know.
MIKE
I see that!
That's great!
A waitress meets them at the table.
MIKE
...
What can I get ya?
MARGE
Just a Diet Coke.
Again she glances about.
MARGE
...
This is a nice place.
MIKE
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson,
so it's pretty good.
MARGE
You're livin' in Edina, then?
MIKE
Oh, yah, couple years now.
It's
actually Eden Prarie - that school
district.
So Chief Gunderson, then!
So ya went and married Norm Son-of-
a-Gunderson!
MARGE
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
MIKE
Great.
What brings ya down - are
ya down here on that homicide -
if you're allowed, ya know, to
discuss that?
MARGE
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva
lot to discuss.
What about you,
Mike?
Are you married - you have
kids?
MIKE
Well, yah, I was married.
I was
married to -
You mind if I sit
over here?
He is sliding out of his side of the booth and easing in
next to Marge.
MIKE
...
I was married to Linda
Cooksey -
MARGE
No, I -
Mike - wyncha sit over
there, I'd prefer that.
MIKE
Huh?

CARLTON CELEBRITY ROOM
Carl Showalter is sitting at a small table with a tarty-
looking blonde in a low-cut gown.
Each holds a drink.
CARL
Just in town on business.
Just
in and out.
Ha ha!
A little of
the old in-and-out!
WOMAN
Wuddya do?
Carl looks around.
CARL
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room
before?
With other, uh, clients?
WOMAN
I don't think so.
It's nice.
CARL
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist.
You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no
complaints.
Waiter!
The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of
many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very
distant stage.
Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a
spotlit stool.
The acoustics are poor.
Carl grimaces.
CARL
...
What is he, deaf?...
So,
uh, how long have you been with
the escort service?
WOMAN
I don't know.
Few munce.
CARL
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
WOMAN
...
What're you talking about?
A DIRTY BEDROOM
Carl is humping the escort.
We hear the door burst open.
The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed.
CARL
Shep!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl!
Shep!
Jesus
Ch -
Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand.
SHEP
Fuck out of my house!
He hauls him up -
CARL
Shep!
Don't you dare fucking hit
me, man!
Don't you -
- punches him and flings him away.
Carl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he
flips back over it.
Shep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at Carl behind
it.
SHEP
Fuck outta here.
Put me back in
Stillwater.
Little fucking shit.
There is a knock at the door.
VOICE
Hey!
Come on in there!
Shep strides to the door, flings it open.
A man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway.
MAN
C'mon, brother, it's late -
Unghh!
Shep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts
banging his head against the wall.
The hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks
her in the ass as she passes.
He spins and goes back into the apartment.
Carl is hopping desperately into his pants.
CARL
Stay away from me, man!
Hey!
Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man!
Don't you dare fuckin' -
Unghh!
After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out
of his dangling pants and strangles him with it.
Carl
gurgles.
Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto
the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the
belt.
CHAIN RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH
Carl listens to the phone ring at the other end.
His face
is deeply bruised and cut.
Finally, through the phone...
VOICE
...
Yah?
CARL
All right, Jerry, I'm through
fucking around.
You got the
fucking money?
JERRY'S KITCHEN
Jerry is at the kitchen phone.
Through the door to the
dining room we see Wade picking up an extension.
JERRY
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
CARL
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.
I want you with this money on the
Dayton-Radisson parking ramp, top
level, thirty minutes, and we'll
wrap this up.
JERRY
Yah, okay, but, uh -
CARL
You're there in thirty minutes or
I find you, Jerry, and I shoot
you, and I shoot your fucking wife,
and I shoot all your little fucking
children, and I shoot 'em all in the
back of their little fucking heads.
Got it?
JERRY
...
Yah, well, you stay away from
Scotty now -
CARL
GOT IT?
JERRY
Okay, real good, then.
The line goes dead.
A door slams offscreen.
Wade's jaw works as he glares out at traffic.
He mumbles to
himself as he drives.
WADE
Okay ... here's your damn money,
now where's my daughter?...
Goddamn punk ... where's my damn
daughter...
He pulls out a gun, cracks the barrel, peers in.
WADE
...
You little punk.
JERRY'S HOUSE
Jerry sits in the foyer, trying to pull on pair of galoshes.
Scotty's voice comes from upstairs:
VOICE
...
Dad?
JERRY
It's okay, Scotty.
VOICE
Where're you going?
JERRY
Be back in a minute.
If Stan
calls you, just tell him I went
to Embers.
Oh, geez -
Thunk! - his first boot goes on.
RADISSON
Marge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off,
massaging her feet.
The phone is pressed to her ear, and
through it, we hear ringing.
VOICE
...
Hello?
MARGE
Norm?
MILLE LACS LAKE
It is late evening, blowing storm.
A leisurely pan across
the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of
the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it.
MARGE'S VOICE
They bitin'?
Norm has a cellular phone to his ear.
His feet are
stretched out to an electric heater.
The interior is bathed
in soft orange light.
NORM
Yah, okay.
How's the hotel?
MARGE
Oh, pretty good.
They bitin'?
NORM
Yeah, couple a muskies.
No pike
yet.
How d'you feel?
MARGE
Oh, fine.
NORM
Not on your feet too much?
MARGE
No, no.
NORM
You shouldn't be on your feet too
much, you got weight you're not
used too.
How's the food down
there?
MARGE
Had dinner at a place called the
King's Table.
Buffet style.
It
was pretty darn good.
NORM
Was it reasonable?
MARGE
Yah, not too bad.
So it's nice
up there?
NORM
Yah, it's good.
No pike yet, but
it's good.
DAYTON-RADISSON RAMP
The top, open, level.
Snow blows.
A car sits idling.
Another car pulls onto the roof.
It creeps over to the
parked car and stops.
It continues to idle as its door
opens and Wade steps out, carrying the briefcase.
The door of the other car bangs open and Carl bounces out.
CARL
Who the fuck are you?
Who the
fuck are you?
WADE
I got your goddamn money, you
little punk.
Now where's my
daughter?
CARL
I am through fucking around!
Drop
that fucking briefcase!
WADE
Where's my daughter?
CARL
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?
I
gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
WADE
Where's my damn daughter?
No
Jean, no money!
CARL
Drop that fucking money!
WADE
No Jean, no money!
CARL
Is this a fucking joke here?
He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut.
CARL
...
Is this a fucking joke?
WADE
Unghh ... oh, geez...
He is on the pavement, clutching at his gut.
Snow swirls.
CARL
You fucking imbeciles!
He bends down next to Wade to pick up the briefcase.
WADE
Oh, for Christ ... oh, geez...
Wade brings out his gun and fires at Carl's head, close by.
CARL
Oh!
Carl stumbles and falls back, and then stands up again.
His
jaw is gouting blood.
CARL
...
Owwmm...
One hand pressed to his jaw, he fires down at Wade several
times.
Blood streams through the hand pressed to his jaw.
CARL
...
Mmmmmphnck!
He fnkem shop me...
He pockets the gun, picks up the briefcase one-handed,
flings it into his car, gets in, peels out.
DOWN RAMP
Carl screams down the ramp.
He takes a corner at high speed
and swerves, just missing Jerry in his Olds on his way to
the top.
Jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up.
JERRY
Oh, geez!
EXIT BOOTH
Carl squeals to a halt at the gate, still pressing his hand
to his bleeding jaw.
CARL
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
ATTENDANT
May I have your ticket, please?
RAMP ROOF
Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac.
He
gets out and walks slowly to Wade's body, prostrate in the
swirling snow.
JERRY
Oh!
Oh, geez!
He bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him
over to the back of the Cadillac.
He drops Wade's body,
walks to the driver's side of the car, pulls the keys and
walks back to pop the trunk.
He wrestles Wade's body into
the trunk, slams it shut and walks back to the scene of the
shooting.
He kicks at the snow with his galoshed feet, trying to hide
the fresh bloodstains.
EXIT BOOTH
Jerry approaches in the Cadillac.
The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away.
The
booth is empty.
Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as
he passes.
Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a
prostrate body.
