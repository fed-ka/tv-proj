	FADE IN:

1	INT.  DAILY PLANET - PIT - DAY			1

	CLARK bangs away at his word processor.  LOIS passes by,
	tries to sneak a casual glance.  Clark stops what he's doing.

				CLARK
		Adopted kids looking for their
		birth parents, if you have to know.

	Lois ticks off points on her fingers.

				LOIS
		Search for roots.  Emotional
		roller-coaster.  Unrealistic
		expectations.  Tear-jerker
		reconciliations.

				CLARK
			(impressed)
		Quick study.

				LOIS
		Not really.  I did it three years
		ago.

	Clark is not going to let Lois get to him.

				CLARK
		There are no old stories, just
		new angles.

				LOIS
		Seems to me if your real parents
		don't care enough to raise you,
		then why give them a second
		thought?

				CLARK
		Because if they gave you away,
		they must have had a reason.
		And it's the not knowing that
		kills you.

	The fact that Clark is really speaking from the heart
	about his own situation is lost on Lois.

				LOIS
		Good.  You take the touchy-feely
		stuff, I'll take Superman.

	Clark watches Lois breeze off, turns back to his word
	processor.  JIMMY, who's been looking at a picture of Lois
	with her sister, Lucy, on her desk, catches up with Lois
	in mid-stride.

				JIMMY
		Smooth outfit, Lois.  New?

				LOIS
		What do you want, Olsen?

				JIMMY
		I was just thinking -- since your
		kid sister's new in town -- maybe	*
		she'd like somebody to ... you
		know, show her around.

				LOIS
		You want to ask Lucy out?

				JIMMY
		Do I have a shot?

				LOIS
		I'll need a complete financial
		statement and the results of a
		recent physical.

	Jimmy looks nonplussed.  Lois stops, smiles.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		I'm kidding, Jimmy.

				JIMMY
		You don't think she'll laugh in
		my face?

				LOIS
			(shrugs)
		Use the telephone.

	Suddenly, both elevators open simultaneously.  JASON TRASK,
	a man of ram-rod military bearing crossed with a maniacal
	sense of mission, bursts onto the floor, followed by about a
	dozen MEN-IN-BLACK.  They are frozen-faced, agent-types,
	dressed in off-the:-rack dark suits, plain ties and shirts.	*
	Trask holds an-official document over his head:

				TRASK
		This is a warrant issued by
		Federal Court.

	The agents spread throughout the room, securing the
	premises and exits.

1	CONTINUED:  (2)				1

				TRASK
		Everyone:  Step away from your
		desks!

	PERRY bursts forth from his office, intercepts Trask.

				PERRY
		Nobody comes busting into my
		newsroom like this!

	Trask simply hands him the warrant.

				TRASK
		Take it up with Washington.

				PERRY
			(scanning)
		Order to produce evidence ...
		compel testimony ...
			(shocked)
		Lois Lane and Clark Kent!

	As if in answer, an agent begins searching Lois's desk.
	Lois goes ballistic, screaming at him, literally prying
	him away with her own hands.

				LOIS
		Wait a minute!

	A second agent moves to pull her off the first.  Lois,
	however, is a handful and soon a third agent is involved.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		Get your hands off me!

	Clark moves to help, puts an arm on an agent's shoulder. 
	Instinctively, the agent whirls around, producing a weapon.
	A moment of serious tension before Trask warns the
	agent:

				TRASK
		Put it away.  He's just a reporter.

	The agent holsters his weapon.  Lois struggles free of the
	agent restraining her, confronts Trask.

				LOIS
		Reporter.  As in, protected by
		the Constitution.

				TRASK
		Impressive document.
			(holds up warrant)
		It gives the courts the authority
		to issue warrants like this one.
		Which says I get what I want.

				CLARK
		What exactly is that?

				TRASK
		Mister Kent, I presume?
			(off his nod)
		I want Superman.  And I'm not
		leaving until you tell me where I
		can find him.

	OFF Clark's reaction, we:

					FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

2	INT. DAILY PLANET - PERRY'S OFFICE - DAY			2

	Clark nervously shoots paper wads into the waste basket.
	When one of them is about to miss, Clark uses his SUPER-
	BREATH to maneuver it into place.  Lois peeks through the
	blinds, sees Trask and Perry arguing while the Men-in-Black
	continue their plunder.

				LOIS
		Do they honestly think if we knew
		where Superman was, we'd hang
		around this place?

	Lois turns, sees one paper wad dropping from a floating
	position directly above the waste basket.  She looks at
	Clark funny, distracted by Perry entering, closing the
	door behind him.

				PERRY
		Okay, here's the deal.  They want
		the two of you to take a
		polygraph --

				LOIS
		-- what?! --

				PERRY
		-- limited to national security
		concerns about Superman --

				CLARK
		-- a lie detector?! --

				PERRY
		-- so I told them to stuff it.
		Not my reporters, no thank you.

				CLARK
			(relieved)
		Right.

				LOIS
		Good for you.

				PERRY
		I told them if they're bound and
		determined to take your computers
		and your notes to just get it over
		with and get out of the office so
		we can start suing their butts
		into the next century.

				LOIS
		Take my computer?

				PERRY
		You talk, they walk.  You don't,
		they're gonna confiscate the
		whole shebang.

				LOIS
		Perry, everything I've ever done,
		or thought about doing is on that
		computer.  All my contacts, all my
		research... my novel!

	Clark reacts to the suggestion of a novel.  Lois shoots back
	a look that says don't ask.

				CLARK
		Don't you back up onto floppy
		disks?

				LOIS
		Clark, this is no time to discuss
		your compulsive behavior.	*

				PERRY
		So what are we going to do, folks?
		I'm with you either way.

	Clark looks apoplectic.  Lois just shrugs.  The stakes
	have reversed for both of them.
	*
				CLARK
			(frantic)
		What about the First Amendment,
		Lois?

				LOIS
		Clark, they pulled a gun on you.
		To these guys the First Amendment
		is a pesky little detail.

				CLARK
		I can't do this.  We can't!

				LOIS
		Clark, if we knew anything, I'd
		agree.  But this is like taking
		a polygraph about the ring-tailed
		lemur.

	Perry nods.  Turns to Clark.

					(CONTINUED)


	L&C - "Strange Visitor" - Rev. 7/21/93 (Pink)		7.

2	CONTINUED: (2)					2

				PERRY
		She's got a point. We don't know
		enough about Superman to lie.
			(seeing Clark's
			 nervousness)
		Kent, you know something you
		haven't told us?

	Perry and Lois look to Clark, now caught in the trap.

					CUT TO:

3	INT. DAILY PLANET - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY			3

	Lois is hooked up to a polygraph machine. Trask asks the
	questions and a TECHNICIAN administers the machine.

				TRASK
		You will answer 'yes' to these first
		two questions. We use this to
		calibrate the machine.
			(beat)
		Is your name Lois Lane?

				LOIS
		That's what the by-line says. Yes.

				TRASK
		Are you also President of the United
		States?

				LOIS
			(rolls eyes)
		Yes.


4	INT. DAILY PLANET - OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY		4

	Clark stands with his back to a couple of Men-in-Black.
	He has his eyes closed, fingers on his wrist.  We hear the
	AMPLIFIED SOUND OF a RAPID PULSEBEAT.

	After a few moments of concentration, the PULSE BEGINS TO
	SLOW.  Clark snaps out of his biofeedback loop, cocks his
	head toward the conference room.  We sense he is listening
	in.



						8.

5	INT. DAILY PLANET - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 			5

	Trask looks at Lois, exasperated.  Lois's answers drip
	with attitude and sarcasm.

				TRASK
		Do you have any reason to believe
		Superman is an agent of a foreign
		power?

				LOIS
		Yeah, and leprechauns are agents
		of the I.R.A.

				TRASK
		Is Superman from another planet?

				LOIS
		If something looks like a duck,
		walks like a duck and talks like
		a duck, the chances are pretty good
		it is a duck.
			(beat)
		He looks like a man to me.

				TRASK
		During the time you two were
		alone, did Superman discuss his
		mission here on Earth?

				LOIS
		Mission?  We flew.  We didn't talk.
		We didn't have to.

				TRASK
			(quietly; to
			 Technician)
		Non-verbal communication.
			(to Lois)
		Does Superman have any telepathic
		powers?

				LOIS
		I hope not.

	Trask looks hard at Lois.  Obviously has no sense of
	humor.  And, he thinks he senses an opening.

				TRASK
		Have you any romantic attachment to
		this Superman?

	Lois laughs.

5	CONTINUED:					5

				TRASK (Cont'd)
		Yes or no?

				LOIS
		No.

	The Technician notices a fluctuation, points it out to
	Trask.  They share a look, suspicions growing.  They turn
	their attention back to Lois who just shrugs.

					CUT TO:

6	INT. DAILY PLANET - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER			6

	Clark is strapped in, his turn at bat, looking very, very
	concerned.

				TRASK
		You will answer 'yes' to these
		first two questions.  We use
		this to calibrate the machine.
			(beat)
		Is your name Clark Kent?

				CLARK
		Yes.

				TRASK
		Are you also Superman?

				CLARK
			(freaking)
		Yes.

	Trask turns to the Technician.  He looks at the read-out
	which, in contrast to Lois's, seems to barely register.
	They speak confidentially.  Clark uses his SUPER-HEARING
	to eavesdrop.

				TRASK
		Why isn't this reading as a lie?

	The Technician slams the polygraph machine on the side with
	his hand.

				TECHNICIAN
		Either the machine's broken again
		or this reporter's so mild-
		mannered he hasn't got a pulse.
		Ask him again.

	Trask turns back to Clark.

					(CONTINUED)


						10.

6	CONTINUED:					6

				TRASK
		Remember to answer 'yes' now.
		Are you Superman?

	Clark looks toward the polygraph needle.

				CLARK
		Yes.

	He aims a short burst of SUPER-BREATH at the polygraph.
	The needle shoots up all the way.  The Technician turns
	to Trask.

				TECHNICIAN
		Working.

				TRASK
		All right, Mister Kent, let's
		proceed.  Have you ever met
		Superman?

	Clark's face is beginning to flush, bright red.

				CLARK
		Met him?  I've seen him in
		action if that's what you mean,
		but we haven't actually had a
		conversation...

	Trask focuses his gaze on Clark, who squirms uncomfortably.

				CLARK (Cont'd)
		I guess you could say we've met,
		Yes.

	Clark now begins to LEVITATE out of his seat.  Pulls himself
	back down, grips hard on the chair arms.  There is a slight
	BREAKING SOUND.

				TRASK
		Is he from this Earth?

				CLARK
			(the truth)
		I don't know.

				TRASK
		Can you take us to Superman right
		now?

				CLARK
		Take you ... ?

				TRASK
		Can you contact Superman?

	Clark's legs, nervously intertwined around the chair
	legs, tense, breaking the chair.  He supports himself
	without them.

				CLARK
		Uh, you mean, by phone or
		something?

				TRASK
			(exasperated)
		By any means possible.  Telepathy,
		for example.  Can you contact
		Superman?

				CLARK
			(lying)
		No.

	The AGENT with the headset interrupts.

				AGENT
		Perimeter's been penetrated.

	Trask frowns, nods.  The Agent disappears outside the
	door and the Technician begins dismantling his set-up,
	pulling wires off Clark.  As they do, Trask turns to
	Clark:

				TRASK
		Mister Kent, I don't need a
		polygraph to tell me when I'm
		being lied to.  I can see it in
		the eyes.
			(drilling Clark)	*
		We're not finished.	*

	Trask takes off.  Clark sighs and stands.  As he does,
	the entire chair collapses.


7	INT. DAILY PLANET - PIT - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY		7

	Trask strides onto the floor, claps his hands.  Agents 
	immediately cease what they are doing, follow after him
	toward the elevators.

				PERRY
		What's going on?  I want an
		explanation.

					(CONTINUED)


						12.

7	CONTINUED:					7

	Trask doesn't answer.  Simply gets on the elevators with
	the rest of the agents.  As quickly as they came, Trask
	and company have gone.  As the elevator doors close, CAT,
	wearing another outrageous outfit, exclaims:

				CAT
		It was horrible the way they
		treated us.  That agent frisked
		me twice!

	Perry begins barking orders to various staffers.

				PERRY
		Biederman, let's get legal on
		this right away.
			(to Clark, Lois)
		Lane, Kent, type up your notes
		and give them to Valdes.  She's
		writing this.
			(claps hands
			 together)
		Rest of you, get back to it.

	People snap back into action.  Perry heads back to his
	office, but he's intercepted by Lois and Clark.

				LOIS
		What do you mean, 'type up
		your notes'?  This is my story!

				CLARK
		Our story.

				LOIS
		Seniority.

				PERRY
		You two are the story right
		now.  In case those goons come
		back with subpoenas, I want you
		out of here A.S.A.P.

				CLARK
		I guess I can work at home.

				PERRY
		Home?!  Anywhere but home.  Don't
		be where they can serve you.  Wear
		your beepers.  We'll call you.

	Perry storms off purposefully.  Lois and Clark look
	to their ransacked desks in frustration.  Cat approaches
	Clark.

				CAT
		Since you're a man in hiding, this
		is the perfect time for you to have
		dinner at my place.

				CLARK
		You and me?

				CAT
		Unless you think we'll need a
		chaperon.

	Clark looks a little concerned, but feels trapped. Nods
	his agreement.


8	INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT			8

	Cat steps inside first. Clark follows, warily. Cat
	shuts the door.

				CAT
		I'm going to change into something
		more comfortable.

	Cat disappears into the back room.  Clark gulps.  He takes
	a moment to look around.  Although certain pieces of art
	have an erotic theme, they are still tasteful.


8A	INT. CAT'S CLOSET - NIGHT			8A	*

	Featuring a wild profusion of outfits, many of the risque	*
	and outrageous variety.  Cat holds up one of these, con-
	siders it, puts it back.  Tries another, then another. 
	Finally, she shakes her head, says to herself:

				CAT
		Farm boy moves to the big city.
		He's looking for a little piece of
		home.

	Cat focuses on a particular choice, which we do not see.

				CAT (Cont'd)
		And that's just what he's going
		to get.

	Clark's attention is now on a wall full of books and maga-
	zines.  Everything from famous biographies to works by
	Henry James and D.H. Lawrence.  Cat reappears wearing jeans
	and a sweatshirt.  Clark breathes a sigh of relief.

				CAT
		I think a Pinot Noir would be nice.
		I've got one chilling.

	Cat moves past Clark into the kitchen area, pulls a
	bottle out of the refrigerator and begins to pour them
	each a glass of wine.  Clark watches, speaks to her
	through the pass-through counter area.

				CLARK
		You've got quite a library.

				CAT
		I do read.

				CLARK
		I know you do.  Maybe your place is
		just different than I was expecting...

				CAT
		You haven't seen the bedroom.
			(off Clark's
			 reaction)
		Relax.  I may never show it to you
		either.

	Cat smiles, CLINKS her wine CLASS against Clark's.

				CLARK
		You're full of surprises..

				CAT
		You have no idea.

	LUCY sprawls on the sofa, thumbing a magazine when the door

		I'm a kind of government ombudsman.

		Well, yes.  But also to advise you

		Anybody who would do this is a

	As Lois and Thompson continue to fence over who knows what,
	Clark makes use of his X-RAY VISION to see inside Thompson's
	attache case.  He sees a file that reads, "Incident Analysis:
	Eyes Only."

	Looking inside still further, Clark sees an itemization that
	includes Roswell, New Mexico, 1947 -- White Mountains,
	Arizona 1975 -- Gulf Breeze, Florida, 1986 -- Voronezh,
	USSR, 1989.  Most amazing of all, however, is one heading
	labeled: Smallville, Kansas, 1966!

	Clark is shaken to the core by what he sees.  As Thompson
	continues, we are with CLARK'S POV now, and all sound
	drains from the room.  We see Thompson moving his lips now,
	and Lois talking back to him, but we hear nothing.  Just the
	dead, numbing silence that Clark feels.  Clark is brought
	back by:

				LOIS
		Come on, Clark.  Let's go.

	Clark sees Lois flip her reporter's notebook shut, reach to

				CLARK
		What? Oh, sure. How'd it go

				LOIS
		Well, I tailed our man Thompson
		into a furniture warehouse on
		Bessolo Boulevard. I waited	*
		around a while, but I lost him.	*

		Maybe he went out the back entrance.

		Project Blue Book? Clark, the

		business in 1969. This is old

	Clark wants to keep the bombshell to himself.

				CLARK
		You're right. It was just a
		bunch. Didn't pan out.

	Lois pulls away from the machine, then leans back.  Clark	*
	starts to protest, but Lois waves him off.

				LOIS
		Just a hunch.

	Lois studies the picture a long moment, then pulls away
	again.

	including a substantial gun collection.  Lois's small tape
	recorder sits on the table next to some unshelled walnuts.

		Yesterday a man named George
		Thompson came to Metropolis.

		Keeping a secret eats away at

		day, you wake up and realize
		it's consumed everything inside
		you.

	Newcomb turns back from the window, picks up Lois's tape
	recorder, turns it off.  Newcomb ejects the cassette, takes
	the nutcracker to crunch the tape into oblivion.

				NEWCOMB (Cont'd)
		We were just a small group when
		we started, but we all took
		special oaths on the same day.
		August the second, nineteen-
		forty-seven.  I was about your

				LOIS
		You didn't take an oath to protect

	Newcomb takes a moment, thinking about Thompson.  Then:

				NEWCOMB
		You don't need me to find Trask.
		He's probably hiding in plain
		sight.

				LOIS
		Like a used office furniture
		warehouse on Bessolo Boulevard?

	Newcomb arches his eyebrow at the Bessolo Boulevard
	reference.

	corner of the desk.  It has two numbers on it: "3-9."

				NEWCOMB
		Not this one I designed it

		inside, or someone who'd been on
		the inside, to help you out.  Now,
		assuming you could find such a
		person, you'd have to hope that
		person found a man like Trask so 
		repugnant and his methods so
		un-American, that he would choose
		to help you.  That's a tall order.

	Newcomb moves to his collection of military rifles,
	mounted on the wall, and removes one of them.

				NEWCOMB (Cont'd)
		I'm going to count to three.
		When I turn around, I expect you
		to be gone.  One...

		It was all here, Perry.

		Tell him.

				CLARK
		She's right.

				LOIS
		U.F.O.'s, Perry.  Unidentified

		U.F.O.'s?

		Yes!  Don't you see?  Coverup.

		Not when you're talking U.F.O.'s.

		You realize what we've lost here,

		All my life.

	Lois closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, trying to compose
	herself.  When she turns to face him, she's business.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		Everybody's looking for you.

				SUPERMAN
		I know.  And I know you almost
		died because of that.

				LOIS
		Well, it did make that bungee jump
		I did last year seem pretty tame.

				SUPERMAN
			(serious)
		I'm going to find that man and

		You seem to have all the ... the

		I am a man, Lois.  Just like

				LOIS
		I'm glad you're here, but why are

				SUPERMAN
		To help.

				LOIS
		I need more of a quote, you know?
		Like 'I have not yet begun to
		fight.' Or 'Damn the torpedoes.'
		If you said you were here to
		fight for truth or justice or the
		American way, something like
		that, that would be a quote.

				SUPERMAN
		Can I get back to you?

				LOIS
		I'm a reporter.  I have
		deadlines.  I have an editor.
		Don't they have newspapers on
		Krypton?

				SUPERMAN
		Probably not like yours.

				LOIS
		Yeah, well, nobody has an editor
		like mine.  If you're here to
		help, this would be a good place

				LOIS

		This is a job for Superman,

				SUPERMAN

		Be seeing you?

	With that, he begins to LEVITATE toward the window.

				LOIS
		Hope so.

	Lois watches him go, then turns back to her word processor

	a little less strange, and we:
