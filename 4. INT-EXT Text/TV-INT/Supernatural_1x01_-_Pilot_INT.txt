    INSIDE THE CRIB.  An INFANT BOY, a few months old.  SAM.    

    MARY HARRISON, late 20 s, gently beautiful in a genuine, 
    maternal way.  She leans her 3-year-old son DEAN over the 
    crib s edge.  Dean kisses the baby s forehead.

                                YOUNG DEAN
                   Night, Sammy.  

  Now Mary leans over, kisses Sam.  

                                MARY
                  Goodnight, love.

    Mary carries Dean to the doorway, where her husband JACK 
    HARRISON, 30, waits.  Jack flips off the lights. 

                                JACK
                  Sam.  You sleep through the night, 
                  and you can have Dean s room.  

    Jack leaves the door open a crack.  

  On Sam.  Beat.

    Then... the FISHER-PRICE MOBILE, above his crib, begins to 
    spin, silent, of its own accord.  

  On the dresser.  A TEDDY BEAR CLOCK TICKS, soothing.  But 
    then it abruptly stops.  Frozen.

    A Casper the Friendly Ghost NIGHTLIGHT flickers...                                                                                  2.




    A BABY MONITOR, on a nightstand.  (We also see Jack and 
    Mary s WEDDING PHOTO-- he s wearing naval whites.)  The 
    baby s PIERCING CRIES, through the monitor receiver.  

    Mary groans awake.  Looks over.  Jack isn t in bed.  Still 
  the baby bawls.


    Mary shuffles down the hall.  Opens the nursery door, peers 
  in.  Pitch-black inside.  But Mary discerns a FIGURE hunched 
    over the crib.

                                MARY
                  Jack?  Is he hungry?

                                FIGURE
                  Shhhhh.  

    Mary holds up her hands-- okay, sorry.  She turns away.  

  But when she reaches her bedroom door, she stops.  Noticing--  

  At the other end of the hall... the stairwell.  A pale, 
    dancing, ghostly light.  Coming from downstairs.  Mary 
    frowns.  What the hell?  

  She moves toward the shimmering glow.  Cautious.  

  At the stairs now.  Bare feet padding down the steps.  

    Until, finally, Mary reaches the bottom, to see--


    Jack.  Asleep in his La-Z-Boy.  An old movie on the muted TV.  

                                MARY
                  Oh my God.

    Mary spins, BOLTS up the steps! 


    Mary BURSTS into the nursery, flips on the light.  And 
    whatever she sees O.S., it causes the color to drain from her 
    face; her breath to come in short, panicked bursts.

                                MARY
                      (a whisper)
                  ...get away from him...                                                                                  3.




    Coming from upstairs, Mary s terrible, ragged SCREAMING!  
    Jack LUNGES out of his chair--

                                JACK
                  Mary?!

  As Jack takes the steps two at a time, Mary s screaming 
    abruptly snuffs out.


    Jack explodes into the nursery.  Mary s not there.  He moves 
  up to the crib.  The baby s okay, thank God, though he s 
    bawling, inconsolable.  Jack holds Sam, confounded--

                                JACK
                  Mary...?

    Jack is about to exit the room, to search for his wife, when 
  he stops.  Sensing something.  He turns back, noticing--

    INSIDE THE CRIB.  Plink.  A dime of crimson red appears on 
  the Sesame Street mattress.  Plink.  Then another.  Another.

    They re drops.  Drops coming from above.  

    Jack looks up at the ceiling.  His face twists into equal 
    parts anguish and terror.  

                                JACK
                  ...no...oh my God no...

  ON THE CEILING.  MARY.  Impossibly splayed out, as if it were 
  the floor.  Eyes wide open, glassy.  Dead.

    Jack barely has time to react, before...

    Sizzling.  BLACK LINES, BURNING THEMSELVES into the wall.  
    Spiderwebbing.  Some horizontal, some vertical.  At first, we 
    don t realize what it is.  But then it takes shape.

    A message.  Branded into the wall, in charcoal black letters 
    four feet high--

    COMING FOR YOU

  The message smolders and IGNITES.  Flames curl the wallpaper.  
    Spreading fast.  A smoke alarm BLARES, piercing.

    Outside, in the hallway, Dean begins to push open the nursery 
    door, crying, terrified.                                                                                  4.



                                YOUNG DEAN
                  Mommy?!  Daddy?!

    Snapping to lucidity, Jack carries baby Sam out of the room. 
    Snatches up Dean with his other arm, before the boy enters.

                                JACK
                  No, Dean.  Don t look, okay?  We 
                  gotta go.

    Jack darts quickly for the stairs.  

  Out the front door.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Scruffy hang-out.  Halloween party.  George W. Bush throws 
    back shots with Bill Clinton and Dracula.                                                                                    6.



    Jessica sits at a tall, round table.  Watching Sam and Luis 
    play darts.  Sam THROWS--

                                JESSICA
                  ...but Sam, I think it s crazy.  
                  Luis, tell him he s crazy.

                                LUIS
                  You re crazy. 

    Thwak.  Thwak.  Thwak.  THREE DARTS pierce a DART BOARD.  
    Dead bulls-eyes, crowding the tiny center. 

                                LUIS
                        (dismay at the game)
                  Dude...

                                SAM
                  I don t see what the big deal is.  

                                JESSICA
                  It s Thanksgiving.  I mean, is 
                  there any holiday you don t have a 
                  problem with?  Why would you work 
                  through Thanksgiving?

                                SAM
                        (playful)
                  Hmm.  Let s see.  Oh yeah-- my 
                  crushing loan debt.  

                                JESSICA
                  Ha, ha. 

    Luis throws his darts.  Shitty. 

                                LUIS
                  Dammit!

                                SAM
                  Seriously, if I don t catch up and 
                  clerk my ass off, Judge Carlton s 
                  gonna slaughter me.  And there s 
                  about twenty other students just 
                  dying to take my place.  

                                JESSICA
                  Even he takes off Thanksgiving...

                                SAM
                  It s not like I have any big plans 
                  or anything.                                                                                    7.



                                JESSICA
                        (gingerly)
                  You could always... go home.   

                                SAM
                  Yeah, no, that would be a tiny 
                  bit... excruciating.  

    Sam s turn again.  Another three bulls-eyes.  Luis GROANS.  

                                JESSICA
                  Why?  What is so terrible about 
                  your family?

    There s ground here that Sam doesn t care to tread.  So, as 
    usual, he turns it into a joke.

                                SAM
                  Nothing.  We were just like the 
                  Huxtables.  Only with a lot more 
                  shouting and browbeating.

                                LUIS
                  You know, I hear that in real life, 
                  Bill Cosby s a totally harsh guy.

                                SAM
                  See?  There you go.

                                JESSICA
                  Okay, I get it, you never talk 
                  about  em, no reason to start now.

                                LUIS
                  Must be some serious skeletons in 
                  that family closet.

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  Throw your darts.

                                JESSICA
                  It s just... you work so hard, I 
                  mean, even getting you out 
                  tonight... and now you re gonna 
                  spend Thanksgiving, alone, wading 
                  through bench memos?  It makes me 
                  kinda sad. 

  Sam moves close to her.  Puts his arms on her shoulders.  
    Sincere and sweet.                                                                                    8.



                                SAM
                  Don t be.  Jess, I m happy.  The 
                  happiest I ve been since... well, 
                  forever.  Trust me on this.

    Sam s turn at the dart board again.  He begins to throw.  
    Jessica takes a beat, and then--  

                                JESSICA
                  Well.  There is another option, of 
                  course.

                                SAM
                  What s that?

                                JESSICA
                  You could... come home.  With me.

  Sam turns to Jessica, surprised and pleased.  Meanwhile, Sam 
    just threw yet another triple bulls-eye.

                                LUIS
                  Dude!  You re like Rain Man!

                                SAM
                        (moving back to Jessica)
                  Really?  You sure I m ready for 
                  family consumption?  

                                JESSICA
                  You ll have to watch the 
                  spontaneous drooling... but yeah, I 
                  think so.  What do you think?

                                SAM
                  Can we have that awkward  where do 
                  I sleep  moment with your Dad?

                                JESSICA
                  Definitely.

                                SAM
                  Then I m in.

  Sam and Jessica smile at each other.  A deeply romantic 
    moment, all in the eyes, all without kissing.  Until--

                                LUIS (O.S.)
                  CRAP!

  Sam and Jessica start laughing.                                                                                  9.




  We PAN OFF Sam s bedside table (an OLD FRAMED PHOTO-- Mary 
    Harrison, cradling infant Sam) to find... 

    Sam, sleeping.  Jessica, peaceful and dreaming, beside him.  
    Then-- a soft SHATTER, tinkling like a bell.  Sam jolts 
    awake.  He clearly sleeps with one eye open.  Silent, he 
    slides out of bed.


  Sam emerges from the bedroom, into the hallway.  He peers 
    into the BATHROOM.

    POV-- INSIDE BATHROOM.  Sure enough... the window is broken.  

    Sam s expression tightens.  He pivots to the hall closet.  In 
  the back... a battered, VINYL-SHELL SUITCASE.  As silent as 
  he can, eyes and ears peeled for any coming threats, Sam 
    opens the case.

    INSIDE.  Guns.  Knives.  Multiples of each.  Damn.

  Sam snatches a BOWIE KNIFE.  He doesn t hold it in that 
      Psycho-stabbing, amateur way; no, he grips it tight and low.  
    Like a professional.  He prowls into the main room.


  The room s black.  Gloomy.  Sam searches.  Wary, vigilant.  
    Under furniture.  Behind curtains.  He finds nothing.  Until 
  his razor-sharp eyes discern--

    Beneath the SWINGING DOOR, leading to the kitchen.  A pale, 
    ghostly light flits across the linoleum.  (It may even remind 
  us of the shimmering glow from the teaser).   

  Sam backs up, against the wall, beside the kitchen door.  
    Clutching the knife.  

    Sure enough... the swinging door CREAKS, slow, as someone 
    (something?) inside attempts to open it quietly--

    When Sam ATTACKS!  

  And surprisingly, the MAN from the kitchen dodges, just as 
    expertly.  Efficiently TWISTING the knife out of Sam s hand.  
  We get a good look at the man.  DEAN HARRISON, 26.  

                                DEAN
                  Easy, tiger.  Just looking for a 
                  beer.                                                                                    10.



                                SAM
                        (beyond shocked)
                  Dean...?  

                                DEAN
                          (inappropriately casual)
                  Hey Sammy.  How s things?  How s 
                  law school treating you?  

                                SAM
                  You scared the crap outta me.

                                DEAN
                  Well.  That s because you re out of 
                  practice.

                                SAM
                  What are you doing here?

                                DEAN
                  What, I can t pop in for a visit?
                        (off Sam s skeptical look)
                  Okay, okay.  We gotta talk.

                                SAM
                  Um.  The phone...?

                                DEAN
                  Would you have picked up?

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  Yeah, okay, fair point.

                                JESSICA
                  Sam...?

    Jessica appears on the other side of the room.  With a  
     Smurf  T-shirt and long, bare legs.  Dean casually reaches 
    inside the kitchen, deposits the Bowie knife on the counter, 
  out of sight.  Then he grins, mischievous.

                                DEAN
                  I love the Smurfs.

                                SAM
                  Jess, hey, sorry to wake you.  This 
                  is... this is Dean.

                                JESSICA
                  Your brother Dean?                                                                                  11.



                                DEAN
                  I gotta tell you, you are 
                  completely out of Sam s league.

  Sam rolls his eyes.  Dean s regularly like this with women.  
    Jessica can t help but blush a little.

                                JESSICA
                  That s what I m always saying. 
                        (then)
                  Just let me put something on--

                                DEAN
                  No, I wouldn t dream of it.  
                  Besides, I gotta chat with your 
                  boyfriend in private.

                                JESSICA
                  Oh.  Alright.

                                SAM
                  No, whatever you wanna say, you can 
                  say it in front of her.

                                DEAN
                  Um.  Okay.  Dad hasn t been home in 
                  a week.

                                JESSICA
                  Oh my God.

                                SAM
                  So he s working overtime on a 
                  Miller Time shift.  He ll stumble 
                  back sooner or later.

                                DEAN
                  Dad s on a hunting trip, and he 
                  hasn t been home in a week.

                                SAM
                        (after a long beat)
                  Jess.  Excuse us.  We re gonna go 
                  talk outside.


    Jessica sits on the bed.  Waiting for Sam.  When he enters.  
  And begins to throw clothes into a backpack.

                                JESSICA
                  Everything alright?                                                                                  16.



                                SAM
                  Yeah.  So, Jess, listen.  Stay here 
                  as long as you want, okay?  Fridge 
                  should be reasonably stocked.

                                JESSICA
                  You re leaving?

                                SAM
                  Just for a few days.  

                                JESSICA
                  A few days?  Is this about your 
                  Dad?  Is he alright?  

    From the hall closet, Sam snags a second bag.  The VINYL-
    SHELL, WEAPON-PACKED SUITCASE.

                                SAM
                  Yeah.  You know.  Just a little... 
                  family drama. 

                                JESSICA
                  Your brother said he was on some 
                  kind of hunting trip...?

                                SAM
                  What?  Yeah, he s up at the... 
                  cabin, probably got Jim, Jack, and 
                  Jose with him.  We re gonna bring 
                  him back.

                                JESSICA
                  Now?  It s three in the morning.  
                  Sam, you sure you re okay?  

    Lugging both bags, Sam gives a bewildered Jessica a kiss. 

                                SAM
                  I m okay, everybody s okay, don t 
                  worry.  I ll call you later.  
                  Promise.  

                                JESSICA
                        (calling after him)
                  At least tell me where you re 
                  going...?


    Troy drives home.  It s pitch black; he can t see further 
    than his hi-beams.  Suddenly, his RADIO MUSIC decomposes into 
    STATIC.  He glances at it-- weird-- begins to fiddle with the 
    dial, when--  

    Appearing in the perimeter of his headlights-- a figure, by 
  the roadside.  A GIRL, 18 or 19.  


  We see her face, as she sits in Troy s car.  CONSTANCE WELD.  
    Beautiful.  Piercing gray eyes.  A hushed, melodic voice-- 
    like distant wind chimes.

                                CONSTANCE
                  Take me home?

                                TROY
                  Where do you live?

                                CONSTANCE
                  4636 Breckenridge.

    Troy accelerates.  Surreptitiously, he wipes the Harry Potter 
     lightning  birthmark from his forehead; he doesn t want to 
    look like a geek.  Then, trying to make conversation--                                                                                  18.



                                TROY
                  It s cold.  You must be freezing.

  She doesn t respond.  Only gazes out her window.  Sweetly 
    pathetic, Troy probes further--

                                TROY
                  So breakdown, huh?  Scary.  I bet 
                  your, uh, boyfriend s worried... 

    Still no response.  It s disquieting.  


                                TROY
                        (looking off screen)
                  You don t live here.

  THE HOUSE.  Abandoned.  Rotting.  A decayed husk.  

    Constance gazes at the house.  With melancholy--

                                CONSTANCE
                  I can never go home.

  In ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT, Troy turns from her, glancing at the 
    house again--

                                TROY
                  So where do you really live?

    --and when he turns back, she s GONE.  VANISHED completely.  
  At first, Troy s startled.  But then his rational mind takes 
    over.  He steps out of the car.  

    HOLD ON the passenger side window.  As a FAINT HANDPRINT 
    MATERIALIZES onto the glass.  Seemingly from nowhere...


    Troy was mistaken; it wasn t her dress.  It s a tattered, 
    billowing CURTAIN.  Constance isn t inside this house.  
    Nobody is... nothing here but jagged, dim shadows.  

                                TROY
                  ...hello...?

    Troy can t help it.  He s spooked. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Troy.  Agitated.  He takes a deep, deep breath.  Shakes his 
    head.  He s being silly.  As we PULL BACK.  REVEALING--

    CONSTANCE.  Sitting, mute, in the darkness of the back seat.  
  He doesn t notice her.  

    ANGLE ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR

    Finally, Troy glances into the mirror.  Eyes widen.  GASPS--

                                                                        BLACKOUT.


                                END OF ACT ONE                                                                                  20.


                                      ACT TWO


    Open window.  Wind.  Loud music.  Dean grins.  Enjoying the 
    simple, visceral pleasures of movement.  Sam rides shotgun.  
    Filing through a messy cardboard box of CASSETTE TAPES.  He 
    glances up, noticing--

  ON THE DASH.  Several rows of sturdy SWITCHES.  (Nothing too 
    fancy; they look like Dean installed them.)

                                SAM
                  See you made a few modifications.

    Dean turns down the BLASTING music.

                                DEAN
                  What?

                                SAM
                  I see you made a few modifications.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.  Couple tricks.  Couple 
                  treats.

                                SAM
                        (returning to the box)
                  I swear, man.  You gotta update 
                  your cassette tape collection.

                                DEAN
                  What s wrong with  em?

                                SAM
                  Well, for one, they re cassette 
                  tapes.  And two--
                        (reading labels)
                  Black Sabbath.  Motorhead.  
                  Metallica.  It s the Greatest Hits 
                  of Mullet Rock.                                                                                    21.



                                DEAN
                  Maybe I should put on some  Spin 
                  Doctors.   

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  I was eleven.  You re never gonna 
                  let me live that down, are you?

                                DEAN
                  Hey, you bought the album, Little 
                  Miss Can t Be Wrong.

                                SAM
                  Well, how  bout the radio?  Maybe 
                  there s something from this 
                  century.

                                DEAN
                  House rules, Sammy.  Driver picks 
                  music, shotgun shuts his cake hole.  

                                SAM
                  You know.   Sammy  is a chubby 12 
                  year old.  I m Sam, okay?

                                DEAN
                        (turns music WAY UP)
                  What?  Music s too loud.


                                SAM
                      (on his cell)
                  ...okay, thank you.
                        (clicks it shut)
                                (MORE)                                                                                  22.

                                SAM (CONT'D)
                  So that s it.  Sanger Hospital, the 
                  morgue, every listed hotel and 
                  motel.  About every bar, too--

    Dean shoots Sam a harsh look at that last one.

                                SAM
                  No one even close to fitting Dad s 
                  description.  So what do you think?

  The car slows at the only stoplight.  The boys see-- a WOMAN, 
    LITTLE GIRL in hand.  Taping up a fresh batch of missing 
    posters, emblazoned with her husband s photo.  The LITTLE 
    GIRL stares at Sam and Dean.  It s unsettling.

                                DEAN
                  I think if we wanna find Dad, we 
                  gotta find out what the hell s 
                  happening around here.


  As Dean shuffles through a THICK STACK of I.D. cards--

                                SAM
                  No.  Forget it.  We can t.

                                DEAN
                  Why not?

                                SAM
                  Well, mostly because impersonating 
                  a Federal agent is illegal.  

                                DEAN
                  And...?

                                SAM
                  Hello?  Trying to be a lawyer here.

                                DEAN
                  Would you chill?  You ve gotten 
                  very type-A, this past year...

    Dean picks the correct I.D. card.  Grins.

                                DEAN
                  Here it is.                                                                                  23.




    CLOSE ON THE I.D.  Now in a slim leather wallet.  As a 
    forgery, it s flawless.  Dean s photo, beneath the SILVER 
    STAR SEAL of the United States Marshals Service.

    DEPUTY JAFFE, 40, mostly harmless, holds it.  He looks over 
    these two young men in their street clothes.  Sam hangs back, 
    tense and tight-lipped. 

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  ...aren t you two a little young 
                  for Federal Marshals?

                                DEAN
                  Deputy Marshals, actually, and 
                  thanks, that s kind of you to say.

    Meanwhile, the inside of the department is just as chaotic as 
  the outside.  Crowded with tired, overworked staff.  

    INSIDE A GLASS OFFICE.  SHERIFF PIERCE, 50 s, severe and 
    strict-looking, converses with two dark-suited FBI AGENTS.

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Well, take a number, boys.  FBI s 
                  already muscling for rank.  You can 
                  talk to Sheriff Pierce when he s 
                  done with  em, but it ll be a few 
                  hours at least.

                                DEAN
                  Few hours?  Look, our boss wants a 
                  status report, and he wants it 
                  yesterday.  How  bout you just give 
                  us a lay of the land?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  And what makes you think I got the 
                  time?

                                DEAN
                        (irritated)
                  Listen, Barney--

    When Sam intervenes.  Surprisingly collected--

                                SAM
                  Hey.  We re all Deputies here, and 
                  we re all under the gun.  So can 
                  you help us out?  Please, just a 
                  few minutes?  Then I promise, we ll 
                  blow right outta here.                                                                                  24.



  OFF Deputy Jaffe.  Considering--


  Sam and Dean follow Deputy Jaffe into the room.  Dean is 
    reading from a clipboard.

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  ...so here s all the evidence we 
                  collected off Centennial Highway.  
                  And by that, I mean a whole lotta 
                  nothin .

  The EVIDENCE TABLE is covered in typical roadside debris-- 
    soda cans, crumpled fast food wrappers.  Sam looks it over.

                                DEAN
                  Any eyewitnesses?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Not at the time of disappearance.  
                  It s always the same.  Victims are 
                  last seen turning onto Centennial, 
                  or heading towards it.  But 
                  somewhere along that road... poof, 
                  they re gone.  And I mean gone, not 
                  even tire treads, it s... weird.

  Sam spots something amid the junk.  He lifts it with a pen.  
  An OLD SILVER NECKLACE, with a tarnished (and MEMORABLE) ROSE 
    PENDANT.  Discarded long ago.  Still, it seems out of place.

                                DEAN
                  So what s the popular theory?  

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  That it s some kinda stolen car 
                  ring.  We ve been shaking down chop 
                  shops.  

                                DEAN
                        (reading the clipboard)
                  Yeah, I see that.  Ford Taurus, 
                  Mercury Topaz, Honda Civic.  These 
                  are hot rides.  

                                SAM
                  All four victims were male?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Five victims, and yes.

  Sam and Dean both stop.  Look up.                                                                                  25.



                                SAM
                  There s been another?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Just last night.

                                DEAN
                        (with some worry)
                  Middle-aged man?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                        (with a tinge)
                  High school kid.  Name s Troy 
                  Squire.  He was coming home from a 
                  Halloween party. 

                                SAM
                  You know him.

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Everybody knows everybody here.  
                  Dog dying s a city-wide tragedy.  
                  So... five people missing...

  Sam looks at the Deputy with sympathy.  


  Sam and Dean head for the front entrance.  When they pass 
    Sheriff Pierce and the two FBI Agents.

                                SHERIFF PIERCE
                        (brusque; suspicious)
                  Can I help you with something?

                                DEAN
                  No, sir, we were just leaving.
                        (nodding to the FBI)
                  Agent Mulder.  Agent Scully.

  As the boys walk on--

                                SAM
                  So... no eyewitnesses...

                                DEAN
                  No.  But, we put our ears to the 
                  ground, we ll probably pick up some 
                  whisper or rumor about this thing.  
                  And you know the best place for 
                  that--                                                                                  26.




    A LIBRARIAN pokes her head into an aisle.  Glowering at Dean 
  and Sam.  Dean pulls a 2004 Sanger Yearbook from the shelf.  
    Looks up  Troy Squire  in the index.  Turns to a photo--

    A candid of Troy.  Carefree smile.  Arms around two friends, 
    BILL COAKLEY and AMY BROWN.  

                                DEAN (PRE-LAP)
                  You must be Amy.  And Bill.


    A COMPUTER SCREEN.  A website-- The Sanger Herald.  Words are 
    typed into a keyword search field.   Murder.  Centennial 
    Highway.   The response:  No Articles Found. 

    Dean.  At the computer.  Lit, ghostly, by the phosphorescent 
    screen.  Sam stands behind him.  Dean tries again.  This 
    time:  Murder.  Hitchhiking.   No Articles Found.

                                SAM
                  Let me try.                                                                                  29.



                                DEAN
                  I got it.  

    Dean tries again.   Death.  Hitchhiking.   No Articles Found.  

                                SAM
                  Really.  It s like watching a 
                  monkey type--

    Annoyed, Dean slides back, offering the chair.

                                DEAN
                  Fine.  Be my guest, control freak.

  Sam takes his place.  Thinking.  Beat.  Then... Sam 
    highlights the word  Death,  changes it to  Missing.   (So it 
  now reads:  Missing.  Hitchhiking. )  

  And an ARTICLE APPEARS.  SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MISSING GIRL.   

  Sam smirks, gloating, at an unamused Dean.

                                DEAN
                  So you re a net jockey.  Congrats.   

                                SAM
                   ...Constance Weld, last seen by 
                  passing motorists, hitchhiking on 
                  Centennial Highway, at mile marker 
                  33..   This was about 10 years ago.

  ON THE SCREEN--  A PHOTO.  CONSTANCE.  We recognize her-- 
    it s the girl in Troy Squire s car.  Beside her, a smiling, 
    heavy set WOMAN.  We see a fragment of caption:  ...seen here 
    with mother Marjorie Brunson... 

  Sam taps in a new keyword search.   Constance Weld.   

  And a SERIES of ARTICLES come up.  Sam clicks through them, 
    rapidly, one after another.  The headlines tell the story--

    MOTHER PLEADS FOR DAUGHTER S SAFE RETURN. 
    CANDLELIGHT VIGIL HELD.
    SEARCH ENTERS 6th MONTH. 
    Until, finally-- MULTIPLE REMAINS FOUND.  

  Sam holds on this one.  A photo accompanies the article-- a 
    wretched looking MAN.  JOSEPH BURROUGHS.  Reading--  

                                SAM
                  Jesus.  They finally found her in 
                  this guy Burrough s trailer.  And 
                  six bodies in the backyard.                                                                                  30.



    When something occurs to Sam.  Dean notices his expression--

                                DEAN
                  What is it?  

    Then... Sam clicks back a few articles.  To the CANDLELIGHT 
    VIGIL story.  There s a school portrait of Constance here.  
    She s wearing the ROSE PENDANT NECKLACE.  

                                SAM
                  I knew I saw that necklace before.  
                  It was at the police station...

                                DEAN
                        (leans in)
                  Where d it say she was hitchhiking 
                  again?


  Sam and Dean sit.  Radio playing softly.  Their version of a 
    stake-out.

                                SAM
                  ...so what do we do if Casper shows 
                  up?  We can t exactly shoot it in 
                  the face.

                                DEAN
                  We don t do anything.  We hang 
                  back, watch and learn.  You know 
                  the drill.  First, we figure out 
                  what we re dealing with--

                                SAM
                  --then we figure out how to kill 
                  it, I know.  
                        (then)
                  You know, sometimes you sound so 
                  much like Dad, it s creepy.

                                DEAN
                  I take that as a compliment.  

    Long beat.  Sam s got something on his mind--                                                                                  31.



                                SAM
                  So.  Um.  How s he been, anyway?

                                DEAN
                  Okay.  You know.  He s Dad.

                                SAM
                  Is he... still pissed?

                                DEAN
                  You know.  He s Dad.  He s a 
                  stubborn bastard and you--

                                SAM
                  What?

                                DEAN
                  ...you hurt him pretty bad...

    Sam, defensive, frustrated, feels the sting of old wounds.

                                SAM
                I hurt...?  He threw me out--   

                                DEAN
                  I don t wanna talk about it--

                                SAM
                  All I did, was tell him I was going 
                  to law school--

                                DEAN
                  That s not all you did--

                                SAM
                  Know what normal Dads are when they 
                  hear that?  Proud.  But him?
                        (affecting a stern voice)
                   You wasted enough time at college 
                  already, boy.  Time to come home 
                  and join the business. 

                                DEAN
                  You told him you hated him...

                                SAM
                  After he called me a coward.  Dean.  
                  He said if I was gonna go, I should 
                  stay gone.  And I hurt him?                                                                                    32.



                                DEAN
                  You know what you said!  You said 
                  his whole life, the whole reason he 
                  did what he did, was pointless-- 

  Sam grows quiet at Dean s flash of anger... 

                                DEAN
                  You remember that?  That no matter 
                  how many things we hunted, we d 
                  never find the thing that killed 
                  Mom!  No matter how many people we 
                  saved, Mom was dead and we were 
                  never gonna bring her back!  

                                SAM
                  ...I remember...

                                DEAN
                        (quiets now, too)
                  That s what did it, you know.  He 
                  was so angry... we both were.  
                  Mostly, cause we knew it was true.

                                SAM
                        (with intense regret)
                  I m sorry.  I wish I could take it 
                  back.  You have no idea...
                        (then)
                  But you gotta understand-- I... 
                  just had to get outta there.  For 
                  once, I wanted to be...

                                DEAN
                  Normal?  Cause... you re pretty 
                  much a freak.

                                SAM
                  Not normal.  Happy.  You know.  
                  Just... have friends.  I think I 
                  wanna marry Jess-- I mean, not now, 
                  but one day.  Raise kids-- kids who 
                  won t be terrified all the time.

    Dean takes this in.  Sentimental beat.  But then, abruptly--

                                DEAN
                  What a total load of crap--

                                SAM
                  Wow.  Thanks.                                                                                  33.



                                DEAN
                  I mean, pretending to be all fuzzy 
                  and safe, when you know nobody is, 
                  not with what s out there.  But 
                  you d rather jam your head in the 
                  sand?  Be some ulcered-up lawyer?

                                SAM
                  It s not that simple...

    Meanwhile-- the RADIO.  Playing softly throughout.  Now 
    decomposes into STATIC.  OUTSIDE, the wind picks up.  The 
    guys don t notice.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah, it is.  Can t run forever, 
                  Sammy.  Sooner or later, you gotta 
                  face up to who you are--

                                SAM
                  Yeah?  And who s that?

                                DEAN
                  You re one of us.  We may put the 
                  fun in dysfunctional, but we re the 
                  only family you got.  And this 
                  stuff is in your blood.  

  Sam contemplates this.  A long beat.  Then, mock solemn--

                                SAM
                  Thank you, Obi Wan.

                                DEAN
                  Bite me.  I swear, man--

    When Dean suddenly stops.  He leans forward, hunching over 
  the wheel.  Squinting into the black night.

                                SAM
                  ...what?

    Abruptly, Dean flips the HEADLIGHTS, ILLUMINATING-- A PALE 
    FORM.  CONSTANCE.  Scuttling between the CORN STALKS.  We 
    barely catch a glimpse before she vanishes again.

                                DEAN
                  Come on!  

    Dean LEAPS out of the car.  Plunges into the field.                                                                                  34.



                                SAM
                  Wait!  I thought we were hanging 
                  back--
                        (Dean s already gone)
                  Dammit.

  And Sam scrambles after his brother.


  Sam sits on one of the beds, studying a puzzle of NEWSPAPER 
    CLIPPINGS spread before him.  When his CELL PHONE CHIRPS.  

  On the cell phone display screen-- JESSICA CALLING.  
    ANSWER... or IGNORE.  

  Sam wants to pick up.  But what the hell s he gonna say?  He 
    punches IGNORE.  Then, Dean enters--

                                SAM
                  You call 911?

                                DEAN
                  Yep.

                                SAM
                        (rolls his eyes)
                  You tell  em your name was Ted 
                  Nugent?  

                                DEAN
                  You know I did.
                        (then)
                  What ve you got there?

                                SAM
                  Bad news.  I ve been looking at the 
                  dates of the disappearances.  First 
                  one was a Wednesday.  Then the 
                  following Tuesday.  Then a Sunday.  
                  Goes on like this.

                                DEAN
                  I don t follow.

                                SAM
                  It s a pattern.  The days between 
                  victims.  5 days.  Then 4, 3, 2.  
                  Next is one.  It ll be tonight.

    Meanwhile, Dean is scooping up his keys and wallet, pulling 
  on his jacket, etc.  Not really listening.

                                DEAN
                  Nice work there, Matlock.                                                                                  38.



                                SAM
                  Um.  What are you doing?

                                DEAN
                  I m packing up my toothbrush, 
                  what s it look like?  

                                SAM
                  Wait, you wanna take off?

                                DEAN
                  Get on the ball, son.  Our grumpy 
                  little hitcher s stowing her 
                  victims in the cornfield.  Dad, 
                  Dad s pick-up-- not in the 
                  cornfield.  So sing along with me--

                                SAM
                        (dry)
                  He s probably not one of her 
                  victims, I know.

                                DEAN
                  He s probably not even in Sanger.  
                  Who knows if he ever came, in the 
                  first place?  Anyway, doesn t 
                  matter, we ll find him.

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  We re not leaving.  Not until we 
                  deal with Constance.

                                DEAN
                  What?  Sammy.  We don t have time.  
                  We got more pressing matters here.

                                SAM
                  We ll make the time.

                                DEAN
                  Where s this coming from?  I 
                  thought you d wanna ditch.     

                                SAM
                  I do, believe me.  But people are 
                  getting hurt...

                                DEAN
                  You know, last couple of years, a 
                  lot of people were getting hurt, 
                  and where the hell were you?                                                                                    39.



                                SAM
                        (simply)
                  Well.  I m here.  Now.  And I m not 
                  gonna walk away, and let more 
                  people die.  So I m hunting this 
                  thing.  With or without you.

                                DEAN
                  You re a stubborn bastard.

                                SAM
                  Runs in the family, I guess.  
                        (then)
                  Dean... he d want us to stay.  
                  Hell.  Think of what he d do to us 
                  if we left.

    A long beat.  Dean thinks.  Then, he SIGHS--  

                                DEAN
                  Do to us?  Man, you know I d blame 
                  everything on you.
                        (Sam smiles)
                  So... what are you thinking?  

                                SAM
                  Well... just to mix things up a 
                  bit, I was thinking this time, we 
                  should actually have a plan.  

                                DEAN
                  And what s that, smart ass?  


    A HIGH SCHOOL PORTRAIT of CONSTANCE.  Enigmatic expression.

  Sam holds the photo.  Lifting it from a cardboard crate of 
    teenage-girl belongings.

    Meanwhile, Dean stands with Marjorie, amidst the room s 
    stacked boxes and sheet-covered furniture.  This is difficult 
  for Marjorie to discuss--

                                MARJORIE
                  When she got a little older, she 
                  started acting out.  Drinking, God 
                  knows what else.  But even then, 
                  you could see this... hurt in her 
                  eyes.  But she kept it to herself.  
                  Like a secret.

  Now Sam digs a DIARY from the crate.  Inside, the usual 
    girlish bubble-cursive.  But also... a phrase, on almost 
    every page, often multiple times:  I can never go home.   

  Sam looks up.  Thinking.  What does that mean?                                                                                   41.



                                MARJORIE 
                  Then... that day in June.  She was 
                  hitchhiking-- which I always begged 
                  her not to do-- and that was it.  I 
                  never saw her again.

                                DEAN
                  Joseph Burroughs, he picked her up?    

                                MARJORIE
                  Police say he kept her locked up in 
                  his trailer, outside of town.  
                  Almost a year, before he shot her.  
                  And they didn t even fry the 
                  sonofabitch, he s up at Folsom.  
                  Put that in your article. 

                                DEAN
                  Which cemetery is Constance buried 
                  at? 

                                MARJORIE
                  Well.  Her headstone s at Hughes 
                  Creek.  But she s not buried 
                  anywhere.  Least, nowhere I know.

                                SAM
                        (reacting to this)
                  I thought they found her.

                                MARJORIE
                        (pained)
                  Some of her.

                                DEAN
                  Ms. Brunson.  This is important.  
                  What, exactly, did they find?  


    Sam, on his cell phone.  Looks like he s having a root canal.

                                SAM
                  ...Judge Carlton, hi, it s Sam 
                  Harrison.  Yes, sir, I do know I ve 
                  been missing some work.  I had kind 
                  of a family emergency.  Sir, I was 
                  hoping I could ask you for a favor.
                        (wincing)
                  Yes, sir, I know... yes, very thin 
                  ice...


    Sam.  Getting patted down at the Registration Station.  
    Dumping the contents of his pockets into plastic trays.  
    Walking through a series of BARRED DOORS, that open and CLANK 
    shut, as he passes through.  OVER which--

                                FOLSOM OFFICER (V.O.)
                  You will not be allowed personal 
                  items in the visiting area.  You 
                  are not to give anything to, or 
                  receive anything from, the inmate.  
                  You are to maintain a safe distance 
                  from the inmate at all times.  You 
                  understand?  


  Sam sits at a mounted steel table.  When JOSEPH BURROUGHS, 
  40, enters the room.  Bland face, glasses; the  quiet 
    neighbor  type.  He s cuffed.  GUARDS, stationed at the 
    walls, keep a close eye, as Burroughs sits. 

                                SAM
                  Thank you for seeing me.

                                BURROUGHS
                  I don t get many visitors.  You a 
                  law student or something...?

                                SAM
                  I m writing a paper, I was hoping 
                  for some information.

                                BURROUGHS
                  About what?

                                SAM
                  Constance Weld.

    Burroughs TENSES.  His face hardens into granite.

                                SAM
                  I just need to know--

                                BURROUGHS
                  I m not talking about her. 

                                SAM
                  I need to know where she s buried.                                                                                   45.



                                BURROUGHS
                        (through gritted teeth)
                  In a cemetery.  

                                SAM
                  No.  Where you buried her.

                                BURROUGHS
                  We re finished here.


  The motel phone.  Dean waits for it to ring.  He glances out 
  the window.  The sun is setting.  Portentous storm clouds 
    gather on the horizon.  Distant lightning.

                                DEAN
                  Come on, Sam.


                                SAM
                  You have to tell me--

                                BURROUGHS
                  Guard--

                                SAM
                  Someone s going to die tonight, if 
                  you don t tell me...

                                BURROUGHS
                        (stops; a beat)
                  What?

                                SAM
                  Constance.  She s out there.  
                  Killing people.   

                                BURROUGHS
                        (waving off the guard)
                  Sorry.  We re okay.
                      (to Sam)
                  Constance is dead.

                                SAM
                  Look, normally at this point, I d 
                  bust out my  truth is out there  
                  speech, but we really don t have 
                  time.  She s dead, yes-- and she s 
                  still hitchhiking.  Men are picking 
                  her up, and she s slashing them.                                                                                  46.



    Burroughs reacts to this-- but for now, he keeps his cards 
    close to his chest.

                                BURROUGHS
                  You re insane.

                                SAM
                  You re not the first person to say 
                  so.  I know how this sounds, I 
                  do... but if I can give you some 
                  proof, will you help me?   

                                BURROUGHS
                  And how you gonna do that?  

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  Well.  For one.  I think I know 
                  what happened 10 years ago today.

                                BURROUGHS
                        (goes white as a sheet)
                  How...?  I never...

                                SAM
                  There s fewer and fewer days 
                  between her victims.  It s a 
                  pattern, a countdown.  To tonight.
                        (beat)
                  This was the night you murdered 
                  her, wasn t it?  

                                BURROUGHS
                  This is a sick joke.  Constance 
                  isn t killing people.  It s 
                  impossible.

                                SAM
                  Whether you believe me or not... 
                  she is.  Because of you.  Because 
                  of what you did to her.

  And Burroughs SHATTERS like GLASS--

                                BURROUGHS
                I stopped her.  She can t be doing 
                  it again.  Because I stopped her.  

                                SAM
                  ...what do you mean?                                                                                  47.



                                BURROUGHS
                  What difference does it make?  No 
                  one ever believes me anyway.

                                SAM
                  Tell me what you mean--

                                BURROUGHS
                  I loved Constance.

                                SAM
                  You kept her locked up--

                                BURROUGHS
                  No.  She lived with me, that s all.  
                  But she liked to hitchhike.  Guys 
                  would pick her up.  She d take the 
                  men to her parents  house, the old 
                  one. And she slashed their throats.    

                                SAM
                  Why would she do that...?  

                                BURROUGHS
                  When she was little, her parents 
                  beat her.  Forced her to fast.  So 
                  she could  atone for her sins.   
                  Until she stabbed  em both.  Put 
                   em in a car, drove it in a ditch, 
                  set it on fire.  She was 11 at the 
                  time. 
                        (then)
                  So when she grew up, she liked to 
                  cut her boyfriends in front of the 
                  house.  In front of Mommy and 
                  Daddy, you know, like  look at your 
                  little girl now.      

                                SAM
                  Why didn't you call the police?

                                BURROUGHS
                  ...wouldn t matter.  Even if they 
                  locked her up, she d just keep 
                  killing.  No matter what they did 
                  to her, she d find a way to keep 
                  killing.  No.  There was only one 
                  way to stop her.
                        (wretched)
                  But I did it.  I stopped her.

                                SAM
                  Where is she buried?                                                                                  48.



                                BURROUGHS
                  She was sleeping.  And I put a gun 
                  to her head.  God forgive me--

                                SAM
                  I need to know where she s buried--


  The storm has begun.  Lightning cleaves the night sky.  And 
  the Impala s engine sounds like the THUNDER.  It charges 
    through the pouring rain.

                                BURROUGHS (V.O.)
                  ...an oak tree... she s beneath an 
                  oak tree... off Breckenridge Road.

    Dean, driving.  Focused, determined.  Passing Constance s 
    ancient HOUSE, on his way to--


    Sam.  Driving back to Sanger.

    CONSTANCE appears in the headlights!  Sam drives right 
    THROUGH her--  

  He GASPS, brakes hard!  Spinning, wild, on the slick roads.  
  He barely manages to control the swerving car.  Thankfully, 
  it comes to a stop.   

    Sam.  Panting.  Catching his breath.  But he doesn t notice--

    Constance.  Now sitting in Sam s back seat. 

                                CONSTANCE
                  Take me home.  

  Sam looks up, icy with fear-- 

                                                                        BLACKOUT.


                                END OF ACT THREE                                                                                  50.


                                    ACT FOUR


    Sam, behind the wheel.  Constance, in the back.  No sound, 
    except the muffled patter of rain on steel.  No light, except 
  for the occasional flare of lightning.  Once again--

                                CONSTANCE
                  Take me home.

                                SAM
                  ...no...

  The doors LOCK, by themselves.  The RADIO clicks on, 
    squealing white noise.  The gas pedal depresses.


  The untouched steering wheel turns, correcting course.  

    Sam.  Breath coming in short bursts.  Mind racing.  Trying to 
    figure out a way to save his own life.  

    Constance.  Behind him.  Mute.  And there s something in her 
    expression.  Something malevolent.


                                SAM
                  ...don t do this...

    Once again, Constance gazes at her house--

                                CONSTANCE
                  I can never go home.

  But Sam watches her in the rearview, as she says this.  And 
  he perceives something, that no one s noticed before...

                                SAM
                  ...you re scared.  You re scared to 
                  go home.                                                                                    51.



    Then... in ONE SHOT... Sam pivots from the rearview (where 
    Constance is still visible)... to look at her directly... 

  But she s VANISHED.  

    Frantic, Sam whirls for the car door.  Trying to unlock it, 
  but it s jammed.   He throws his shoulder into it-- no good.  
  He pounds on the glass, about to SMASH it with his elbow--

    Lightning.  And in the STROBING FLASH--

    Constance.  Now in the passenger seat, beside Sam.  (He s 
    turned toward his window, doesn t see her).  She s a rotting 
    WRAITH.  Mouth twisted into a rawboned rictus.  

  But it s only for a subliminal split second.  When the 
    lightning snuffs out-- she again DISAPPEARS.  Though now we 
    know... she s still inside the car.

    Suddenly, Sam JOLTS.  Shards of excruciating PAIN shoot 
    through his body.  He falls back in his seat.  And we see-- 
  his chest.  His shoulders.  His neck.  Everywhere, SLASHING 
    CLAW MARKS APPEAR (several ripping right through his shirt).

    Lightning-- and for a flash, there s Constance, straddling 
    Sam, savagely TEARING at him.  Then... the lightning 
    vanishes, and so does she. 

    Sam s hands.  Fumbling for the ignition.  Trying to turn the 
    engine.  But his hands are WRENCHED away, by invisible 
    forces.  CUTS criss-cross his wrists, his arms.  Sam 
    struggles, SHOUTS in agony.  He s a goner for sure... when--

    SMASH!  The driver s side window SHATTERS-- a hailstorm of 
    safety glass beads.  

    DEAN.  Standing outside the car.  Pointing a COLT SIX-SHOOTER 
  at the seemingly thin air in front of Sam.

                                DEAN
                  Let him go, you bitch.

    Dean FIRES!  And in the rapid succession of GUNFIRE FLARES-- 
    Constance is VISIBLE, as if in STROBING LIGHT.  

  She turns to Dean.  Unharmed, of course.  She grins at him, 
    vicious.  But she s let go of Sam.  And so--

                                SAM
                  ...I m taking you home...

  And Sam is now able to TURN the ignition.  He SLAMS the gas!                                                                                  52.




  The car SNAPS a support beam, second story lumber RAINS down.


  Sam cracks his head, sharp, against the steering wheel, as 
  the car comes to an abrupt, dust-settling stop.


                                DEAN
                  Sam!  Sam!

    Dean scrambles through the newly-created opening, up to the 
    car.  It s wedged between a wall and a heavy fallen beam.  
    Inside the car, Sam is weak.  Forehead bleeding.  But alive.

                                SAM
                  I m okay.

                                DEAN
                        (extremely relieved)
                  Where is she?  

                                SAM
                  I don t know.

    Dean looks over the room.  The storm has abated, the wind has 
    died down, the radio s quiet.  All seems benign.

    Dean tries to open the car door.  No chance.  

                                DEAN
                  Can you move?
                        (Sam nods, yes)
                  Come on, I ll help you.

  Sam GROANS, pained and sore.  He begins to crawl through the 
    window.  Dean helping him.  When-- the wind.  It picks up.  
    Tattered curtains flutter.  The RADIO.  Clicks on.  Faint 
    music buried beneath static.

                                DEAN
                  Hurry. 

    Something SKITTERS just outside their field of vision.  Dean 
    spins, vigilant... but nothing s there.                                                                                  53.



    Quick as he can, Sam evacuates the car.  Dean gets him to his 
    feet.  Sam s arm around Dean s neck, they hobble for the 
    entrance, but it s slow going-- 

    Another SCUFFLING sound, this one over their shoulders.  They 
    both look back, scanning, cautious... and that s why they 
    don t see... IN FRONT OF THEM-- the CURTAINS (beside their 
    exit) BILLOW UP, unveiling--

    CONSTANCE.  Blocking the way.  Putrid.  Wrathful.  Her image 
    FLICKERS rapidly, appearing and disappearing.  

  Sam and Dean turn forward.  Spot her--  

  She DRIFTS towards the brothers, the tips of her yellowed 
    toes lightly scraping the floor planks.    

  Sam and Dean back away.  Dean FIRES his Colt again.  No use.

  She grows closer.  Closer.  Eyes aflame.  Suddenly--

    There s TWO FIGURES BEHIND HER!  A decayed MAN and WOMAN, 
    40 s, the fronts of their shirts BLOODY from STAB WOUNDS.  
    Constance s PARENTS.  

                                WHISPERED ON THE WIND
                  ...you ve come home...

    They seem to envelop her.  Merging with her.  There s a 
    horrible, otherworldly ANIMAL SHRIEKING-- and they ALL MELT 
    AWAY.  Gone completely.  Still.  Silence.

  Sam and Dean.  As they (and we) catch our collective breaths--

                                DEAN
                  ...hey.  Sam?  

                                SAM
                  Yeah? 

                                DEAN
                        (long solemn beat; then)
                  Good luck getting the deposit back 
                  on that rental.

    Dean cracks a smile.  Sam smiles back. 


  The brothers LAUGH.  Enjoying a rare moment of victory. 

                                DEAN
                  ...so how d you know that would 
                  work, anyway?  

                                SAM
                  What?

                                DEAN
                  Taking her home.

                                SAM
                  I didn t.  

                                DEAN
                  Wow.  Thoughtful plan.

                                SAM
                  Well, I can t believe you actually 
                  shot Casper in the face.  

                                DEAN
                  Hey, saved your ass--


                                SAM
                  Where are you going?

                                DEAN
                  East.  Figured we d check out the 
                  house next.

                                SAM
                  The house?

                                DEAN
                  Our house, Chachi.  Maybe there s 
                  something I missed.  Some bread 
                  crumb Dad left behind...

    When Dean glances at Sam, sees his expression.  Dean s smile 
    fades, as he puts it together.                                                                                  55.



                                DEAN
                  ...but you re not going East, are 
                  you?  You re going back to school.  

  Sam nods, a little sad and a little guilty.

                                SAM
                  ...I m sorry.  

                                DEAN
                        (after a beat)
                  I ll take you back.  

                                SAM
                  No, man, I can catch a--

                                DEAN
                  I ll take you back, Sam.  It s the 
                  least I can do.

    Dean SWINGS the car around.  Pulling a U-turn.


    Clearly, Sam s conscience is getting the best of him--

                                SAM
                  ...look, I m gonna call the cops, 
                  the FBI, first thing.  File a 
                  Missing Persons.

                                DEAN
                  Good.  It s a good idea.

                                SAM
                  I mean, he could be anywhere.  We 
                  can t just cruise the whole 
                  country, hoping we bump into him. 
                  But I m gonna help, okay?  I m 
                  gonna do everything I can.

    Dean nods.  More silence.  Sam can t take it anymore.

                                SAM
                  You know.   Passive aggressive  
                  isn t really your gig--  

                                DEAN
                  What?  Did I say anything?                                                                                  56.



                                SAM
                  That s just the point.  If you re 
                  pissed, then be pissed. 

                                DEAN
                  I m not pissed.

                                SAM
                  Convincing delivery.

                                DEAN
                  Really.  I m serious.

                                SAM
                  Well, you re something.

                                DEAN
                  I m done.  Okay?

                                SAM
                  What s that supposed to mean?  Done 
                  with what?

                                DEAN
                  This.  These sparkling little 
                  arguments of ours.  Trying to drag 
                  you into something you just don t 
                  want any part of.  
                        (beat)
                  I can t ask you to throw everything 
                  away and hit the road.  To trade in 
                  your girl and your school for bad 
                  food and mangy motels--

                                SAM
                  Dean--

                                DEAN
                  So go live your life, Sam.  I mean 
                  it, be happy.  I m not gonna fight 
                  you.  I m tired, and...

                                SAM
                  And what?

                                DEAN
                  And I just don t care anymore...

                                SAM
                        (after a beat)
                  I think I d rather you were pissed.                                                                                  57.



                                DEAN
                  What do you want me to say?

  Sam doesn t answer.  The brothers ride in silence.  


  The Impala motors past libraries.  Classrooms.  The various 
    signs and landmarks of the august university.  Sam watches 
  the familiar scenery pass.  Clouded with doubt.  Is he doing 
  the right thing?


  Sam enters.  Lugging his bags.  He flips on a lamp.  Walks 
    toward his bedroom.  He s too exhausted to realize... 

    BEHIND HIM.  The lamp FLICKERS.  On the wall-- his clock, 
    gently ticking, abruptly STOPS.  Frozen.                                                                                    58.




    Sam s hand.  Turning the bedroom doorknob.  He swings open 
  the door, just as--

    Across the room, Dean FORCES OPEN the front door.  It all 
    happens at once.  Sam turns to his brother, confused.  And 
    Dean s expression washes into FEAR--

                                DEAN
                  Sam!  Behind you!

    Sure enough, in the shadowed bedroom over Sam s shoulder... a 
    MENACING, TWISTED DARK FIGURE waits...

  Sam pivots to the figure.  Turns back to Dean, confused.  
    Then... Sam flips on the bedroom light, revealing--

    It s not a dark figure.  It s a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, draped 
    over a CHAIR.  Sam looks at his brother-- are you okay?

                                SAM
                  Dude.  What s the problem?

                                DEAN
                  I... I swore I saw...

                                SAM
                  What?

    Dean approaches, out of sorts.  The brothers enter the 
    bedroom.  Dean scans-- the room is empty.  Quiet.  Normal.

                                DEAN
                  Nothing.  Nothing, I guess...

  Sam walks over to the chair.  Dry--

                                SAM
                  Well.  Don t worry.  My IKEA chair 
                  never hurt anybody.                                                                                  59.



  Sam tugs the sweatshirt off the chair back.  But then... Sam 
    frowns... taking a closer look at the chair... and that s 
    when he notices--

  ON THE SEAT.  Plink.  A dime of red crimson appears.  Plink.  
    Then another.  Another.  They re drops.  Coming from above.  

    Dean sees them, too.  With dread, the brothers looks up--

  ON THE CEILING.  JESSICA.  Impossibly splayed out, as if it 
    were the floor.  Eyes wide open, glassy.  Dead.

                                SAM
                  JESS!  NO!

  And before they can even react-- SIZZLING.  BLACK LINES, 
    BURNING THEMSELVES into the wall.  Spiderwebbing.  Some 
    horizontal, some vertical.  Once again, a charred warning--

    COMING FOR YOU

  The words IGNITE.  The room blazes rapidly, a tinderbox. 

    Anguished, Sam leaps up on the chair.  Struggling to pull 
    Jessica down.  But he can t reach.  And the flames are 
    spreading.  Dean yanks Sam away, hard--

                                DEAN
                  Sam!  We have to go!

    Dean practically drags Sam out of the apartment...
