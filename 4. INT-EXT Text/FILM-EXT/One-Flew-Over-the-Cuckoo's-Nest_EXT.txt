All we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains,
rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and
crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work
clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the
very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight.
A long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn
elsewhere and he looks down.
REVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV
Far below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss
the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed
prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an
ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the
base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the
officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look
up at McMurphy.
McMURPHY
As he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him.
MAN (V.O.)
(through bullhorn)
McMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle,
from the infirmary. Can you hear
me?
McMurphy doesn't respond.
SHANKLE (V.O.)
(through bullhorn)
Can you hear me, McMurphy?
McMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a
SECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN.
SECOND VOICE
(through bullhorn)
Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ
sake, he ain't gonna come down...
you...
The BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy
continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against
the coming night when...
SHANKLE (V.O.)
(through bullhorn)
McMurphy!
I have the warden's promise. If you
come down, nobody will hurt you!
You'll be in my custody! I promise!
An imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face.
WIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped
off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the
Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and
several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court,
which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves
scattered everywhere.
Martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by
Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic
circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing.
MARTINI
(as he throws ball)
Catch it! Catch it!
The ball rolls to the corner.
WASHINGTON
Martini, there ain't nobody there,
ya dumb goon! Go get the ball!
MARTINI
No!
Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after
the ball, when Martini goes running after it.
MARTINI (CONT'D)
I get it! I get it!
But Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to
the ball.
Martini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite
agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and
Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon
out.
The other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a
prison yard.
Cheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding,
who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a
cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up.
MCMURPHY
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual
pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py
shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a
peckin' party?
HARDING
A pecking party?
MCMURPHY
That's right, buddy. And you want
to know who pecks the first peck?
HARDING AND CHESWICK
Who? Who?
MCMURPHY
Ah, come off it! It's that Big
Nurse, that's who...
The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding.
HARDING
It's as simple as that. You've been
on our ward six hours and have
already simplified the work of
Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in
one grand analogy: it's a pecking
party.
MCMURPHY
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or
Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm
talkin' about is that crummy
meeting and what that nurse did to
you!
HARDING
Did to me?
MCMURPHY
Did to you and all the rest of you
guys.
BILLY
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh
wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
MCMURPHY
What did I see 'cept a grown man
gettin' whipped so bad he can't
laugh anymore.
FREDRICKSON
It's the questions she asks.
MCMURPHY
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
HARDING
Miss Ratched is a competent
psychiatric nurse, not some, some
kind of monster pecking out our
eyes!
MCMURPHY
(as calm as blue waters)
She ain't peckin' at your eyes,
buddy.
McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on
his toes.
MCMURPHY
She's peckin' at your balls, buddy,
at your ever-lovin' balls.
Harding is doubled over.
SEFELT
That kind of behavior will get you
a P.A. rating, my friend.
MCMURPHY
P.A. What the hell is that?
SEFELT
Potential assaultive.
FREDRICKSON
Which gets you shipped up to
Disturbed for a nice little zap
job.
MCMURPHY
Huh?
HARDING
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend.
Five cents' worth of electricity
and you are out of everybody's
hair.
MCMURPHY
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
HARDING (CONT'D)
And if you persist in your ways,
they can always ship you over to
Medical Surgery.
MCMURPHY
What for?
HARDING (CONT'D)
Lobotomy!
MCMURPHY
Lobotomy?
HARDING (CONT'D)
(pointing to lobotomy
case)
That!
McMurphy looks.
SHOT OF A LOBOTOMY CASE
A vegetable, complete with two half-dollar scars in his
forehead.
McMURPHY
As he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to
his feet and he picks it up.
MCMURPHY
(to Harding)
Is that your sense of humor or are
you tryin' to say somethin'?
HARDING
Now, what would I be trying to say?
Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.
SCANLON
Gimme the ball!
MARTINI
No. Me! Me!
WASHINGTON (O.S.)
Pass the ball, McMurphy.
McMurphy crosses to the court, bouncing the ball as he goes.
When he reaches the court he holds the ball out to
Washington, who reaches for it, but McMurphy snaps it back
over his shoulder to Martini.
MCMURPHY
(turning to Martini)
Pass it to me, Martini.
Martini holds back.
MCMURPHY
C'mon, I'll give it back!
Martini passes to McMurphy.
MCMURPHY
Atta boy, Martini.
He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back
to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to
McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands
watching.
MCMURPHY
(encouraging them)
Back and forth, that's it. Shoot,
man, we'll be takin' on the New
York Knicks before we're through...
McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them.
He catches her eye. She turns away.
MCMURPHY (V.O)
Hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on,
I'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit
or you sit...
Washington and Warren are sitting on the grass watching
Martini, Scanlon, Harding and Billy, who are positioned on
the court waiting on McMurphy who is under the board with
Bromden.
Cheswick and the other patients hang around off court as:
MCMURPHY
(with great physical and
vocal emphasis throughout
entire scene)
Okay, Chief. This is your spot! I
don't want you to move from this
spot! Never!... 'Kay, now, take the
ball! Raise your hands, like
this...
McMurphy raises his hands above his head. Bromden follows
suit.
MCMURPHY
That's good! That's a good boy,
Chief! Now jump and put it in!
McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't. McMurphy does this a couple
of times. Each time Bromden remains motionless.
HARDING
He can't hear you!
MCMURPHY
I know, goddammit! You don't have
ta tell me that!
HARDING
So why are you talking to him?
MCMURPHY
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin'
to myself! It helps me think!
HARDING
It doesn't help him.
MCMURPHY
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!
(turning to Bromden)
Does it, Chief!
(no response)
See, it doesn't hurt him.
(to Bromden)
Jump! An' put it in!
McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't move.
HARDING
Well, I think you're just confusing
him...
Bromden jumps.
MCMURPHY
Ha! Did ya see that!
(calling to Cheswick on
the sidelines)
Hey, Cheswick!
CHESWICK
Yeah, Mack?
MCMURPHY
Come here!
Cheswick runs over.
CHESWICK
Yeah, Mack?
MCMURPHY
Let me get on your shoulders.
CHESWICK
Sure, Mack...
McMurphy climbs on his shoulders.
MCMURPHY
'Kay, wheel me around to the
basket... 'Kay, easy, easy. Hold
it! 'Kay, now.
(he sees Bromden has
walked away)
Hey, Chief, come back!
Bromden doesn't hear.
MCMURPHY
Cheswick, go get 'im!
Cheswick goes after Bromden, catches him, and McMurphy
latches onto him.
MCMURPHY
Now, wheel me to the basket.
Cheswick, straining under the weight of McMurphy, turns
toward the basket.
as the Acutes join McMurphy to see the moon low in the sky,
silhouetting the trees and buildings, and Martini chasing
Scanlon across the wet grounds.
CHESWICK
There they are!
MCMURPHY
(his attention elsewhere)
Hey, what's that?
SEVERAL ACUTES
(simultaneously)
What? Where?
MCMURPHY
(pointing)
Over there!
SEFELT
(squinting)
I don't know...
BILLY
I-i-it's a b-b-bus!
MCMURPHY
A bus?
BILLY (CONT'D)
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
MCMURPHY
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we
take ourselves a little spin around
the place.
TABER
We'll get in trouble...
CHESWICK
Yeah, maybe we ought to go back,
Mac...
FREDRICKSON
Yeah, my feet are cold...
SEFELT
My feet hurt...
BILLY
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
MCMURPHY
(walking towards the bus)
Go ahead! Go back!
The Acutes cast frightened looks at each other then go after
McMurphy. Martini and Scanlon join them.
BILLY (CONT'D)
H-H-How d-d-do we g-g-get b-back?
McMurphy has reached the bus and begins checking it out.
TABER
Yeah, take us back to the
dumbwaiter, Mac.
MCMURPHY
I'm not going back in there. I told
ya this was a one way trip. Now
stand aside.
McMurphy lifts the hood to the bus and begins jumping the
wire. The Acutes stand helplessly by as the engine turns over
and catches. McMurphy closes the hood and gets on the bus to
a chorus of, "Please, Mac, take us back... Please..."
McMurphy puts the bus in gear and the bus starts moving. The
Acutes start running alongside of the bus calling out for
McMurphy to take them back.
MCMURPHY
(shouting to them)
Get on assholes!
They leap on.
As the bus makes a full circle and stops alongside of
Bromden.
MCMURPHY
(waving Bromden onto the
bus)
Come on, Chief! Let's go!
Bromden boards the bus. McMurphy lets out a war whoop as he
closes the door and starts the bus moving.
as the bus picks up speed and churns across the grounds.
as the bus careens out the main entrance and down the
thoroughfare.
as the bus turns a corner past a sign that reads:
DALLES 6, SALMON CREEK 8, DEPOE BAY 11, CAPE LOOKOUT 22,
PORTLAND 46
The dawn is just cracking the horizon as the bus pulls up
behind a corroded tin sheet building. A sign reads:
DEPOE BAY, SEAMANIS SERVICE, SPORT FISHING, BOATS FOR CHARTER
Beyond the boathouse is the dock with several fishing
trawlers and beyond that -- the open sea.
The door to the bus opens and McMurphy gets out.
MCMURPHY
(as he steps out of the
bus)
This is it!
as McMurphy walks directly to the wall, alongside the door,
lifts the edge of the siding, comes up with a key, opens the
door and enters.
A beat, then the lights go on inside the building.
SHOT OF BUS
The Acutes' faces pressed against the windows, looking out.
as a white gorge of smoke and water pours from the stern and
the boat pulls away from the dock, leaving a boiling foam of
water.
as the boat passes out of the harbor and heads for the open
sea.
DISSOLVE TO:
The sun is up. The engine is dead. The ballgame is HEARD OVER
ship's RADIO. The men are scattered over the boat. Taber and
McMurphy, beer in hand, are sunning themselves, listening to
the ballgame. On the stern Martini and Scanlon are trying to
rig up a pole. Fredrickson gives them a hand. Billy has a
line out. So does Bromden and Sefelt who is seated nearby,
fishing the ocean floor when he suddenly gets a bite and
looks over the side, surprised. His line goes straight down
into the depths. His glasses fall off into the water. Sefelt
sighs and slowly begins reeling his line in.
Billy gets a strike and starts fighting the fish.
BILLY
H-H-Help!
MCMURPHY
Ease up on the star drag, keep the
tie up, up and work hell outta that
fella.
Martini gets a strike and loses it. Scanlon comes up and
starts to take the pole from him.
SCANLON
My turn.
MARTINI
(hanging onto the pole)
No.
They start a tug of war. Fredrickson tries to break it up,
when he gets a strike and his line spins out.
Billy's fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver
scales, and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go
down and the line snaps.
MCMURPHY
Up, I told you! Keep that tip up...
up! You had you one big silver
there.
Fredrickson lands his salmon in a spray of scales and blood.
The fish is flopping all over the deck. Billy grabs the fish
and wrestles it down.
Bromden lands a fish when --
SEFELT (O.S.)
Oh, my God! I see something!
Everyone rushes over to Sefelt and looks down into the water.
REVERSE SHOT
Deep down in the water a gigantic white form slowly rises out
of the depths, becoming solid, alive.
SCANLON
Jesus God...
MARTINI
What is it?
FREDRICKSON
We'll never get that on the boat.
The fish is now clearly SEEN.
BILLY
(calling)
M-M-Mack! M-M-Mack!
McMurphy pulls himself up.
MCMURPHY
What is it, kid?
BILLY
C-C-Come here and l-look at th
this!
McMurphy crosses down and looks over the side.
MCMURPHY
He's a big flounder. Could weigh
two, three hundred. You got to lift
him in with a winch.
FREDRICKSON
Does that mean we have to cut him
loose?
MCMURPHY
Like hell we will! We got the
muscle standing right here. All we
need is a couple gaffin' hooks and
some rope.
BILLY
I-I-I'll get them.
MARTINI
Me, too.
SCANLON
Me, too.
McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is sweating under the strain.
MCMURPHY
Steady does it, Sefelt!
SEFELT'S POV
The massive fish is closer to the surface.
DISSOLVE TO:
BACK TO SCENE
All the men are standing by as gaffing hooks and rope are
made ready. The fish is gaffed and slowly hauled out of the
water.
McMurphy and Bromden lean over, held by the others, grab the
big fish by its gills and, with a heave-ho, the fish is slid
in and flopped to the bottom of the boat. The men go
sprawling over the big fish. There's a lot of laughter,
handshakes and back-slapping going on when --
VOICE
(over bull horn)
All right! Stand to! Stand to!
The men look up.
REVERSE SHOT - ACUTES' POV
Off the bow is a Coast Guard cutter, and on the deck stands
Doctor Spivey, Washington, Warren and several other aides
dressed in white.
as McMurphy, bruised from the fight, and Bromden, handcuffed
to a special belt, wait while an aide unlocks the first of a
double set of heavy security doors.
The first door is locked, leaving McMurphy, Bromden, and the
three aides crammed in the small space between the two doors
while another aide opens the second door and McMurphy and
Bromden step through, followed by the aides.
Rolling hills, forests and distant mountains, bathed in
sunlight, as Bromden runs across a far-off meadow.
