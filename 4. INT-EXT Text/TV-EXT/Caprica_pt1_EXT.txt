    An imposing edifice -- the architecture combines the very 
      ancient with the extremely modern.  A FLOOD OF STUDENTS 
      bursts from the front doors and rolls down the huge marble 
      steps.  Somewhere in this mass of suddenly paroled youth, we 
      FINDZoe and Lacy.  Zoe suddenly turns back, looks up at the 
      towering edifice and the carved words over the entrance:

                CAST ASIDE THE TEMPORAL, REACH FOR THE ETERNAL

    She stares at them  for a long moment, then looks around at 
    the laughing, carousing faces rushing past her.

      ZOE S POV

      TIME SEEMS TO SLOW DOWN and as it does, the joyful faces of 
    her fellow students seem somehow more grotesque, more like 
      caricatures of joy as they whip out the many CELLPHONESand 
      other GADGETS that are part and parcel of teen life on 
      Caprica.  Zoe watches them all with an opaque expression that 
      could be disdain, anger or even sadness until she spots...

    BEN

      He s not quite the same cool looking guy that he was in the V-
      Club -- in fact, he verges on geekdom here, with an 
      awkwardness of posture and the epitome of unhip clothes that 
      probably means Zoe is one of the few girls ever to give him 
    the time of day.  The one thing that is the same, however, is 
    the intensity of the look in his eyes -- something deep and 
      dangerous roiling down in there somewhere.

      A TENNIS BALL...

      ...Connects with a RACKET.

      DANIEL GRAYSTONE, early 40s, is in the middle of an 
      invigorating set with his wife AMANDA GRAYSTONE, late 30s.

    We see the scope of the Graystone Estate, Zoe s home.  

      A sprawling mansion, the size of which would put Bill Gates 
    to shame, meanders along a mountain ridge, with a commanding 
      view of the entire valley floor below them.        "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0611.


    As they play, we can see that Daniel and Amanda have been 
      together for a very long time and know each other so well 
      they're even anticipating shots in the match itself.  

                                  AMANDA
                    Out.

                                  DANIEL
                    What!

                                  AMANDA
                    It was as out as out can be.  Do we 
                    need to turn on the line sensors?

                                  DANIEL
                    That s exactly what I m going to 
                    do, Cheater-girl.  Serge?

      SERGE, a cylindrical ROBOT SERVANT which balances on a single 
      large ball bearing, and has been waiting patiently with 
      towels and bottled water, turns to Daniel.

                                  SERGE
                          (smooth, calm but 
                            electronic)
                    Yes, Sir.

                                  DANIEL
                    Activate the line sensors, please. 

    And suddenly the court s outline begins to glow.

                                  AMANDA
                    And the auto-umpire.

      A POLE full of elaborate SENSORS rises from the ground where 
    an umpire would normally be and immediately begins scanning.  
      Daniel grins a shit-eating grin at Amanda.

                                  DANIEL
                    Come on, cheater.  Double sets.

                                  AMANDA
                    Oh, don t go all immature on me 
                    just because I m better than you.

                                  DANIEL
                    What d you say, cheater?  I can t 
                    hear you, cheater?

                                  AMANDA
                    Gods, if only the worlds knew what 
                    a baby you really are!

                                  SERGE
                    Excuse me, Daniel?      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0612.


                                  DANIEL
                          (chuckling)
                    Yeah?  What is it?

                                  SERGE
                    There is an urgent message for you 
                    and Amanda from the Athenian 
                    Academy regarding Zoe.

    The joy goes out of Daniel and Amanda almost instantly.  They 
      look at one another with the look of two parents who just 
      knowthis isn t good.

                                  AMANDA
                    Here we go again...

                                  DANIEL
                    Let s not prejudge this.

                                  AMANDA
                          (to Serge)
                    Is Zoe home?

                                  SERGE
                    She s in her room.*

                                  AMANDA
                    Tell her to get her...ass *
                    downstairs and meet us in the 
                    kitchen.

                                  SERGE
                    Of course, Amanda.

      Serge wheels away.

                                  AMANDA*
                    Damn her...*

                                  DANIEL
                          (gently)*
                    Mandy-- don t go into overreaction *
                    mode.  We don t even know what *
                    we re dealing with yet.

    But Amanda isn t hearing him and Daniel decides not to pursue 
    it any further.  He heads off the court and toward the house. 
      Amanda heaves the ball in the air and then SMASHES it over 
    the fence.


      It s RAINING the next day. 


      Amanda impatiently sits behind the wheel of her sleek, 
      expensive car in the driveway, as Zoe deliberately walks down 
    the driveway with her backpack.   Amanda can see that Zoe is 
      taking her good sweet time to get down the driveway.  She 
      HONKS the horn.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0618.


    ZOE

      Smiles every so slightly, pleased at getting under her 
      mother s skin.  Again.  She makes it to the door and is about 
    to open it when her expression turns bittersweet.  She looks 
    up at the house.  Her home.  

      She s never coming back. 

      Another HONK and Zoe finally gets in the car.


    As Amanda s car pulls away from the curb where STUDENTS are 
      STREAMING up the steps toward the entrance through the 
      pouring rain.  Zoe stands there for a beat, looks around -- 
      finds Lacy s face in the crowd.  

      Lacy seems nervous.  She forces at smile at Zoe, who glances 
      around and then the two girls disappear for a moment into the 
      river of girls... 

    ... and then emerge on the far side of the Academy entrance, 
      heading not into the school, but walking quickly down the 
      sidewalk and around the corner.


    Zoe and Lacy move quickly through the rain, glancing behind 
      them occasionally to be sure no one s following.  Bensteps 
    out of some bushes and falls into step with them -- he s 
      carrying three HEAVY BACKPACKS, two of which he hands off to 
      Lacy and Zoe.

                                  BEN
                          (to Zoe, re: backpack)
                    Thought the whole idea was to 
                    travel light.

                                  ZOE
                    Yeah, well...*

    The three of them are a study in contrasts:  Zoe is giddy 
      with excitement, Lacy is scared, and Ben... well, Ben is 
      nervous too, but with a strung-out, edgy, vaguely dangerous 
      quality to him.  If Zoe wasn t so wrapped up in her own 
      excitement, she d notice that something is very wrong with 
    her boyfriend this morning...

                                  ZOE
                    Got the passports?

                                  BEN
                    What?  Oh -- yeah.  Yeah, don t 
                    worry about it.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0619.


    Ben holds his coat tightly closed around his body as they 
      head down a flight of STAIRS toward the Metropolitan 
      Levitation Mass Transit platform (think subway).


      Joseph comes outside, reaches into a pocket and takes out a 
      pack of cigarettes.  Taps one out.  Then realizes he doesn t 
      have a light.  Annoyed, he s about to throw it away when --

                                  DANIEL (O.S.)
                    I vegot it.*

    He turns to see Danielpull a LIGHTERout of his pocket.  
      Daniel is wearing the black ARMBAND.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Thanks.

      Joseph takes a deep drag, shoots Daniel a look out of the 
      corner of his eye -- Daniel is famous.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0626.


                                  JOSEPH
                    Never see you smoke on TV.

      Daniel starts slightly -- always a little surprised when he s 
      recognized in public, even now.

                                  DANIEL
                    No, well... company image and all 
                    that.  I did quit a few years ago, 
                    actually.  Started up again last 
                    week.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Yeah.  I ve been trying to quit 
                    myself.  Not much of a priority 
                    now.  My name s Joseph Adams.

                                  DANIEL
                    Daniel -- well, you know.

      Daniel sticks out a hand, then notices Joseph s gloves.

                                  DANIEL
                    Oh -- I m sorry.  I... uh... didn t 
                    know...

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s okay.  Tauronsshake hands 
                    during mourning.
                          (shakes his hand)
                    The gloves are symbolic -- helping 
                    keep our distance from the world 
                    during mourning... or something.  
                    It s an old custom.  Not even sure 
                    why I do it.

                                  DANIEL
                    Well... times like this... the old 
                    ways are supposed to help, I guess.

      A quiet beat as they stand and smoke.

                                  DANIEL
                    Could use a cup of coffee.

                                  JOSEPH
                    There s a cafe around the corner.

                                                                            CUT TO:      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0627.



      A sleek and modern facility in the heart of the city.


      Daniel and Joseph sit at a small, metal table, the whir and 
    hum of street traffic only a few feet away.  Two cups of 
      coffee on the table.  Neither says a word.  Each of them just 
      smoking and watching the traffic roar past at what seems like 
      impossible speeds...


      Daniel and Joseph are still sitting there, the cigarettes 
      piling up in the ashtray, the empty coffee cups scattered 
      across the table as the traffic lights play across their 
      faces...


      Joseph and Daniel are each lost in his own reverie, each 
      literally watching the world go by.  A long, still moment 
      before:

                                  JOSEPH
                          (awkwardly)
                    I should be going.  Thank you for 
                    the coffee.

    He sticks out his hand.

                                  DANIEL
                    Sure.

      Daniel takes Joseph s hand, but then suddenly his entire 
      being seems to collapse and suddenly he's sobbing into the 
      other man's shoulder.*

                                  DANIEL
                    Sorry.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0634.


                                  JOSEPH
                    No, I...

                                  DANIEL
                    This isn t... it s not me... I 
                    don t...

                                  JOSEPH
                    It s okay.  I know.
                          (beat)
                    Tell you the truth... I m about 
                    five seconds from throwing myself 
                    in the middle of traffic.

      Daniel nods, pulls himself together, takes in a deep, 
      shuddering breath.  Daniel looks back at the table of 
      discarded coffee cups and cigarette butts.

                                  DANIEL
                    I needed that.  To just sit.  
                    Smoke.  So... thanks.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Easiest job I had all day.

    The hints of a smile briefly play across both their features 
    as Joseph nods and Daniel signals his Driver, who smartly 
      opens the car door for him.

                                  DANIEL
                    Can I give you a ride home?

                                  JOSEPH
                    No.  Thanks.  I live in the city.

      They shake hands and Daniel heads off toward his car, then 
      stops and looks back.

                                  DANIEL
                    Hey -- you follow Pyramid at all?

                                  JOSEPH
                    I've been known to lay a few cubits 
                    down on the Bucks.
                          (beat, wry)
                    To my great misfortune.

                                  DANIEL
                    Bucks suck this year.  But I've got 
                    courtside seats.  You interested?

      Joseph hesitates for a moment.  Then...

                                  JOSEPH

                      Absolutely.

      Daniel hands him a card.

                                  DANIEL
                    My private number.  Call me and 
                    we ll work out the details.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Okay.  Thanks.

      Daniel gets in the car and Joseph watches him drive away...

      Joseph waits as the doors fly open and Kids start pouring 
      out.  He scans the river of students until he catches sight 
    of a NINE-YEAR OLD BOY wearing BLACK GLOVES walking out, not 
      interacting with any of his peers.

      WILLIAM ADAMS looks up to see his father -- hard to read how 
    he feels about seeing him here.  He s an inward, withdrawn 
    kid under the best of circumstances and these have hardly 
      been the best of circumstances lately.  He slows walks over 
    to Joseph.

                    Okay.

    And that s usually about the extent of father/son bonding on 
      most days.  But these aren t most days anymore and Joseph 
      both wants and needs to reach out to his son.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I, uh... got off early and thought 
                    we could walk home together.  Maybe 
                    stop and grab a shaved ice.

      After a beat, William shrugs.


      Joseph and William walk down the street, both of them eating 
      shaved ice out of cup.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I met a man who has offered to take

                                  JOSEPH
                    No, I thought we d give grandma the 
                    night off.  This is just a guy s

                    Ever.

      It s one of those things kids just blurt out, not meant to be 
      hurtful but matter of fact.  Still, it hits Joseph hard.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I want to change that, Willie.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0652.


      They walk together in silence until...

                                  WILLIAM
                    Do you think they still feel pain?

    In contrast to the Graystone mansion, Lacy Rand s family 
      lives in a very middle-class house, in one of the suburbs 
      ringing Caprica City.

                                  MOTHER S VOICE

                    She s hiding something.

                                  CLARICE
                    She s gone through an incredibly 
                    traumatic event.

                                  DURAM

                    Where does the Athenian Academy 
                    stand on the question of 
                    monotheistic belief, Sister?

                                  CLARICE
                    Am I under investigation now?

                                  DURAM
                    Just a question.*

                                  CLARICE
                    The Academy is dedicated to *
                    following in the path of the gods -- 
                    the goddess Athena is our *
                    patroness.  Weare, however, open *
                    to all forms of worship, including 
                    belief in one god.*

                                  DURAM
                    Very tolerant. *

                                  CLARICE
                    Agent Duram, you know I can t *
                    answer a question like that.*      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0655.


                                  DURAM
                    It doesn t concern you that there s 
                    a proven link between worship of a 
                    single god and an absolutist view 
                    of the universe?  A belief that 
                    right and wrong are determined 
                    solely by a single all-knowing, all-
                    powerful being whose judgement 
                    cannot be questioned?  A god in 
                    whose name the most horrendous 
                    crimes can be sanctioned without 
                    appeal?  

      Clarice looks at him for a beat, then smiles sweetly.

                                  CLARICE
                    You know a great deal about the 
                    subject.

                                  DURAM
                    Know your enemy, Sister Clarice.

                                  CLARICE
                    Love your enemy, Agent Duram.  That *
                    is whatAthena teaches us.  Even of *
                    those who are intolerant of us.  

      Duram holds her eyes for a moment longer.

                                  DURAM
                    I ll be in touch.

      Duram walks away, leaving Clarice alone on the walkway.

      glances back up at the house --


      Joseph walks with THE GUATRAU though this pleasant park on 
    the water s edge.

                                  GUATRAU
                    There is a delicate matter that I 
                    need your help on, Yoseef.

                                  JOSEPH
                    If I can, you know I will.

                                  GUATRAU
                    There is a man -- an important man -
                    - who has conveniently forgotten 
                    how he got to be so important.  
                    Regrettably, he is embarking on an 
                    enterprise that will cause great 
                    distress, not only to my personal 
                    interests, but to many of my 
                      colleagues.  This, I cannot 
                      sanction... so action must be 
                    taken.

                                  JOSEPH
                    With all due respect, Gautrau, 
                    passing along a bribe is one thing; 
                    being involved in a murder, however 
                    indirect, steps over a line I 
                    cannot cross.

    The Gautrau bursts out laughing.      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0663.


                                  GUATRAU
                    Oh, by the gods, it s nothing like 
                    that.  No, no.  We didn t send you 
                    to law school in order to waste 
                    your talents on something so... 
                    basic.  What I would ask of you is 
                    to meet with this individual and 
                    outline for him his options:  Give 
                    up his folly and embrace us once 
                    again as a friend.  Or face the 
                    consequences of being our enemy.

                                  JOSEPH
                    You want me to threaten him.

                                  GUATRAU
                    I d like this matter to be resolved 
                    in a civilized manner and there s 
                    no Tauron I can think of more 
                    civilized than you, Tse Yoseef.

      Joseph is silent for a beat.  Then...

                                  JOSEPH
                    May I ask who it is I m supposed to 
                       negotiate  with?

                    You don t tell the Gautrau you need 
                    time to think.  About anything.  
                    You say  Yes, sir.  Thank you, sir.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I don t care if he put me through 
                    law school or not.  I m tired of 
                    doing his dirty work for him.  He 
                    can just fire me if he doesn t like

      Daniel unceremoniously escorts Lacy outside the door and 
      closes it shut.


    The entrance is quiet, empty.  Lacy Rand walks up quickly up 
    the steps, her clicking heels the only sound...

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Right in the middle of lunch time at the school, as we try to 
      sort out all the activity... until we find Lacy sitting on a 
      bench, eating a simple lunch.

                                  ZOE (O.S.)
                    Hey there you.

      Lacy looks up to see Zoe and Ben, arm in arm, clearly in 
      love.  Lacy gives her a cold look.

                                  LACY
                    Missed you at the club last night.  
                    Missed you for two hours.

    Zoe senses Lacy s mood, disengages from Ben and sits next to 
      Lacy.  Then puts her arm around her.

                                  ZOE
                    Sorry.  Haven t been much of a

                    It s fine.  Doesn t matter.

                                  ZOE
                    Look... I ve found something.  It s 
                    changed my life.  I want to share 
                    it with you.

                                  LACY
                          (skeptical)
                    Changed your life?

                                  ZOE
                    Sounds stupid, huh?  
                          (beat)
                    It s not.  It s real.  Come with 
                    us.

                                  LACY
                    To what?

                                  ZOE
                    A prayer meeting.

                                  LACY
                    Like I don t go to enough of those.

                                  ZOE
                    This is different.

    Ben finally speaks, his voice soft, his whole demeanor gentle 
    and still -- the true believer.

                                  BEN
                    You pray, but your gods don t 
                    answer.  You hurt, but your gods 
                    don t heal.  You go the V-Clubfor 
                    sex and sin, but it doesn t fill 
                    the void in your soul.

      Lacy is taken aback, struck by this quiet young man.

                                  ZOE
                    There istruth in the world, Lace.  
                    There is a right and there is a 
                    wrong.  And there is a God.  A God*
                    who knows the difference.

    Off Lacy, as she finds herself drawn into something...

                                  JOSEPH
                    Willie... how would you feel if you 
                    could have your sister back?  If 
                    she could be in our lives again?

                                  WILLIAM
                          (shrugs)
                    I don t know.

                                  JOSEPH
                    Don t you miss her?

                                  WILLIAM
                    Sometimes.  I miss Mommy too but...

                                  JOSEPH
                    But what?

                                  WILLIAM
                          (without emotion)
                    They re dead.  We can t have them 
                    back so isn t moving on really the 
                    best thing to do?

    Off Joseph, hearing a fatalism he's never heard from his son 
      before...


      Joseph meets with Sam over coffee.

                                  JOSEPH
                    I need a favor, Sam.  I don t even 
                    know how it can be done but I need 
                    something... stolen.

                                  SAM
                          (amused)
                    Really?  You?  I m listening.

                                  JOSEPH
                    From the Vergis Corporation... on 
                    Tauron.

                                  SAM
                    That s a problem.  Tomas Vergis is 
                    a good friend of the Gautrau.  I 
                    doubt he d sanction stealing from a 
                    friend, so...

                                  JOSEPH
                    What if I agreed to deliver the 
                    message he wanted?  To Secretary 
                    Chambers?      "Caprica"  2ND NETWORK REVISION 10/6/0690.


                                  SAM
                    That might change things.  But 
                    isn t this one of those big lines 
                    of yours you re always so worried 
                    about crossing, Joe?  Sure you 
                    really want to do that?

                                  JOSEPH
                    I don t have any choice.
                          (beat)
                    Will you ask the Guatrau?

                                  SAM
                    Consider it done.

    Sam gets up and walks away.
