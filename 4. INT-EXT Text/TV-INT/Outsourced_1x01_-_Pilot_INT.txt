The elevator opens and TODD DONOVAN, a young, all-
American guy, exits and starts down the hallway with a 
bounce in his step.  He grins as he passes the familiar 
sign on the wall proclaiming:  Mid America Novelties. 

CUT TO:


TODD enters and is shocked to see the call center is 
empty and partially vandalized.  The only person in the 
office is his boss, JERRY, who is happily working, even 
humming to himself.  He spots Todd and stands.

JERRY THE BOSS
Todd!  You re back!  How was the 
management training?

TODD
Where is everyone?  What happened?

JERRY THE BOSS
Oh, we did a little right-sizing.  
Costs were through the roof.  
Pensions.  Health care.  We had to 
make some cuts, but now we re the 
right size to move ahead.

TODD

JERRY THE BOSS
Exactly.  Yesterday we outsourced 
the call center to India.

TODD
India?

JERRY THE BOSS
This is a great move for us, Todd. 
Things are really looking up for 
the company. 2.

A brick, thrown from outside, flies through the window, 
lands, and rolls towards them.  Todd sees a note is 
attached so he picks up the brick to read the note.

TODD

Bastard--   You

JERRY THE BOSS

Jerry takes the brick and tosses it onto a pile of other 
bricks which have previously been thrown into the office.

TODD
Jerry, I was supposed to run the 
call center.

JERRY THE BOSS
I know--

TODD
I went through training 
specifically to run the call 
center.

JERRY THE BOSS
I know, I know, but listen, you re 
our best salesman.  We re not 
gonna lose you.  We still want you 
to run the call center.  In India.

Jerry gives him two thumbs up.

TODD
You want me to go to India?

JERRY THE BOSS
They don t get our culture.  We 
need an American in charge.

TODD
But I ve never been out of the 
country before.

JERRY THE BOSS
This is a killer opportunity for 
you, Todd.  They told me, if you 
get this right--

Another brick flies in the room and lands closer to them.

TODD
Should we step back a little?3.

JERRY THE BOSS
Good idea.

They step back and continue.

JERRY THE BOSS (CONT D)
They said, if you get this right, 
they ll bump you up to senior 
management.  Todd Donovan, Vice 
President of Sales.  Huh?  How 
does that sound?

TODD
Vice president...  Someday these 
bricks will be for me.

JERRY THE BOSS
spirit! the That s

TODD
But I ve spent my whole life in 
Kansas City.  I d be leaving 
everything behind.

JERRY THE BOSS
You re twenty-five.  What s your 
life?  Some drinking buddies?  An 
 X-Box  in a shared apartment?  A 
girlfriend you only see on the 
weekends?

TODD
Hey, I got a lot more going on 
than that.
(thinks about his 
life, then)
I guess I could take the  X-Box  
with me.

JERRY THE BOSS
There you go!

TODD
I mean, this is the time of my 
life when I should be up for 
adventure.

JERRY THE BOSS
Exactly!

TODD
Things happen for a reason, right?

JERRY THE BOSS
Yes they do!4.

TODD
My Dad always said, when a door 
closes, God opens a window.

JERRY THE BOSS
And this window opens onto sunny 
India!

Jerry, in a lame attempt at Bollywood style dancing, 
twists his arms as if he were putting in light bulbs.

JEREMY

 BING BING BING BING BING BING. 

TODD
You know what?  I m in--

JERRY THE BOSS
Excellent.

TODD
--Assuming we agree on terms.

JERRY THE BOSS
Excuse me?

TODD
If I do this for the company, I 
need a written contract that 
spells out my promotion, my 
salary, everything I get when I 
come back.

JERRY THE BOSS
Todd, you know I can t do that.  
You re gonna have to trust the 
company s word on this.

Todd looks around at all the empty desks.

TODD
Yeah, that s not gonna happen.  I 
need it in writing.

Todd picks up a piece of paper and holds it out to Jerry.

JERRY THE BOSS
Sorry.  It s against policy.  My 
hands are tied.

TODD
Are you sure you can t do this for 
me?

TODD (CONT'D)
Because I m guessing if I don t go 
to India, they ll need someone 
else to go.  And the only person 
with experience running a call 
center is you. 

Jerry tries to keep a blank expression.  Todd stares back 
at him.  Finally, Jerry gives in, grabs the paper, and 
sits down to write out Todd s contract.

JERRY THE BOSS
Looks like that management 
training helped you grow a pair.

TODD
It was great.  We spent a whole 
day on standoffs.  The trick is to 
make the other guy feel good about 
giving in.  But I don t have to do 
that with you.  You re doing such 
an amazing job without my help. 
(over his shoulder)
So, corner office, company car, 
stock options...

Is that your natural penmanship?  
beautiful. It s

Thank you.

MANMEET
No.

Manmeet tries to walk away, but Gupta pursues.

GUPTA
There was a fascinating article 
about humming birds.  They re not 
as nice as they seem.9.

Manmeet, trailed by Gupta, crosses by ASHA and MIDORI and 
we stay with them.  Asha is a smart, confident and 
striking woman.  Midori, on the other hand, is a 
wallflower who suffers from extreme shyness.  We catch 
them mid-conversation as Asha tries to calm Midori while 
they flip through a Mid-America novelty catalogue.

ASHA
...I wouldn t worry about it.  The 
products may be different, but the 
work is the same.

Midori is embarrassed to reveal:

MIDORI
But I ve never worked at a call 
center before.

ASHA
Oh, okay.  Well, sit next to me.  
I ll show you how it s done.  
You ll be fine.  You d be

Asha flips the page and they see the novelties for sale 
include an American flag Snuggie, a wallet made from

shouts.

RAJIIV

Todd glances at the paper, then speaks in mangled Hindi.

No one knows what to say.  Rajiiv starts to applaud and 
scowls at the workers until they join in applauding. 

TODD (CONT D)
Oh no, not necessary.  Thanks.

That wasn t really an applause 
moment.

RAJIIV
You underestimate your charisma.  
Such a light within you.

Todd steps forward and greets the employees one by one 
until he comes to Midori, who is so shy she avoids his 
eye as she shakes his hand.

TODD
Hello.  You are...?

MANMEET
Yes, Manmeet.

TODD
You re name is Man-meat?  Wow.  
That doesn t leave a lot of room

his blank look)

Rajiiv gestures to a nearby window.  At the moment, there 
is a giant cow outside looking in the window.

TODD
You ve got to be kidding me.

RAJIIV
Sir?

TODD
There s a cow outside the window.

RAJIIV
Yes, the cow is considered sacred.  
It can go where it pleases.

TODD
Really?  Well, maybe that s a good 
thing.  We won t have to go far

Todd laughs and mimes reaching out the window to milk the 
cow directly into a coffee mug.  Rajiiv does not laugh.

RAJIIV
Please do not touch the cow.

Of course not.

So, what time is lunch?

CUT TO:


Todd is heading back to the call center bullpen when he 
passes an open office and sees Ajeet (aka The Big Sikh) 
with his feet up on the desk, eating pakoras and watching 
TV.  Ajeet, about to pop a pakora in his mouth, sees Todd 
out of the corner of his eye and covertly nudges the door 
with his foot.  Todd has just enough time to register how 
nice this office is compared to his cubicle before the 
door shuts.  

CUT TO:


Todd cuts through the bullpen on his way to his office.  
 a opening she s as just cubicle her in Asha passes He
wrapped present which turns out to be a picture of a man 
in a suit.  Todd stops to say hello, surprising Asha.

TODD
Hey, what you got there?

ASHA
My fiance sent me a picture of 
himself.

TODD
Oh, your fiance.  What s his name?

ASHA
(momentarily drawing 
a blank)
...uh.

TODD
Don t tell me Indian names are 
hard for you too?

Todd laughs, and Asha recovers.

ASHA
Pradeep.  His name is Pradeep

second.

TODD

TODD
Really?  Then how...  We re gonna

ASHA
Of course.

Todd crosses away.  Asha puts the picture on her desk and 
considers her fiance.  Then she grabs the picture again, 
puts it in her desk drawer, and closes the drawer.

CUT TO:


Todd enters and sees Manmeet getting a cup of tea.  Todd 
nods hello.  He opens the pantry and is checking out the 
snacks when he hears:

MANMEET
(under his breath)
Oh no, please don t come in here.

 the entering Gupta sees and gaze Manmeet s follows Todd
bullpen, looking around for someone to talk to.

TODD
What s the matter with him?

MANMEET
He won t stop talking.  Believe 
me, you don t want to get stuck 
with Gupta.

TODD
Yeah, we had a guy like that back 
in my old office.  Ed Millner.  
He d never shut up.  If you got 
stuck with him in the break room, 
forget it.  You couldn t shake 
him.

Todd and Manmeet look up to see that Gupta is approaching 
the kitchen.  In a matter of seconds, he will round the 
corner and see them.  Manmeet turns to Todd.

MANMEET
So how did you handle it?

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

Gupta rounds the corner and enters the kitchen.  No one 
is there.  Gupta looks around, surprised.  He could have 
sworn he saw someone in here a second ago.

REVEAL: Todd and Manmeet are hiding in the pantry with

TODD
Back home, we had a bigger pantry.

Manmeet nods that he understands.  They watch Gupta 
through the crack between the doors.  Unfortunately for 
them, Gupta lingers, sipping his tea, just waiting for 
someone to talk to.  Now they can t leave because it 
would be obvious they were hiding in the pantry.  After a 
beat, Manmeet turns to Todd:

MANMEET
Do you know any redheads?

TODD
Excuse me?

MANMEET
I m looking for a wife.  I like 
redheads.  And blondes.  Dark hair 
too.

TODD
So, all women?

MANMEET
(sheepishly 
conceding)
Yes, all of them.

TODD
Well, actually, my ex-girlfriend 
was kind of a redhead--

MANMEET
Ex-girlfriend?  Did she say  no? 

TODD
Not usually.  Wait, say  no  to 
what?

MANMEET
When you asked her to marry you?

TODD
Oh, I didn t ask her to marry me.  
We were just dating.

MANMEET
Dating until you get married, yes?

TODD
No, you see, Manmeet -- gotta get 
used to saying that -- things are 
different in America.  You date 
someone for a while before you 
decide if you want to get married.  
(MORE)23.

TODD (CONT'D)
And some people aren t looking to 
get married anyway.  It s called 
serial monogamy.  You date a 
woman, if it doesn t work out, you 
date another woman, and then 
another woman, and so on.
 Manmeet s (off
incredulity)
Okay, I realize that sounds kind

Midori turns and exits, but it s too late.  Gupta

GUPTA
They discovered a vegetarian 
spider, first one in nature.  I 
believe it was in Costa Rica... 

Todd and Manmeet emerge from the pantry and watch Gupta 
trailing Midori through the office.

TODD
May God have mercy on her soul.

Manmeet nods.

CUT TO:


Todd and Rajiiv enter carrying a box of novelties.  (In 
the background, Gupta is still talking to Midori who is 
miserable.)

TODD
Okay, everyone--

Rajiiv interrupts by clapping at the employees.24.

RAJIIV
Stop what you re doing!  It s time 
to work!
(politely, to Todd)
You have the floor.

TODD
Time for a little pop quiz.  
You ve had all morning to study 
the catalogue, now let s see how 
good you are at  add-ons. 
(off their looks)
You know what  add-ons  are, 
right?  Someone calls to buy a 
product, and you suggest another 
related product for them to buy as 
an  add-on. 
(then)
Okay, let s say someone orders a 
finger. #1   we re

Todd takes a giant foam hand from the box which extends 
one finger as if to say,  we re #1. 

TODD (CONT D)
Now, what would you suggest as an 
 add-on? 
(off their silence)
I ll give you a hint.  Notice the 
finger is green and gold, huh?  
Green Bay Packer s colors.
(then)
Oh come on.
(pulling a cheese 
head from the box)
A cheese head!  This is basic.

RAJIIV
What is a cheese head?

TODD
You put this on when you root for 
the Packers.

Todd puts on the cheese head.  The employees just stare 
at him.

TODD (CONT D)
Are any of you taking this job 
seriously?

Asha inadvertently chuckles at this sight but quickly 
covers her mouth and turns away.  Todd takes off the hat.25.

TODD (CONT D)
Guys, we have to be ready.  The 
phones have switched over.  We re 
live.  There are 300 million 
Americans who could be calling in 
for a novelty any minute now.

Todd gestures to the silent phones.

TODD (CONT D)
...You never know when someone s 
gonna need a novelty.

ASHA
Sir?

TODD
Todd.

ASHA
Todd.  I think the problem we re 
having is that even if we memorize 
the catalogue, what we are 
memorizing makes no sense to us.

TODD
What do you mean, it doesn t make 
sense?

ASHA
(off the catalogue)
Well, for example, here is this 
mistletoe novelty.  Even if I 
memorize the order number, that 
won t help me because I don t know 
what a mistletoe is.

TODD
Okay.  Mistletoe is something you 
put up at a Christmas party--

MANMEET
What is a Christmas party?

TODD
What s a Christmas party?  Really?  
Oh, man.  Okay, a Christmas party 
is a party to celebrate the birth 
of Jesus, who was the son of God.

RAJIIV
Which God?26.

TODD
Which God?  The God, the real one.
(noticing a reaction 
and moving on)
Anyway, mistletoe is like a shrub 
and you hang it in a door way and 
wait till a hot woman comes along.  
I m talking a woman who s out of 
your league, she d never even talk 
to you, but you surprise her by 
standing next to her under the 
mistletoe, and it s awkward, but 
she has to kiss you.  By law.

Confused, Asha holds up the catalogue and indicates the 
product that prompted her original question.

ASHA
Then what is this?

Todd leans in.  INSERT CLOSE UP of a mistletoe belt-
buckle, a novelty belt buckle with a small mistletoe 
branch extending from the top of the buckle.

TODD
That s...that s actually pretty 
clever.  You re supposed to kiss 
under the mistletoe.  So, if you 
wore that, someone would have to 
kiss you...down there.

ASHA
This is how you celebrate the 
birthday of the son of God?

TODD
See, the thing is, Americans can 
be holy, and have fun at the same 
time.  Next question.

MANMEET
Why do Americans need these 
things?

TODD
don t. We

ASHA
Then what is the purpose?

TODD
The purpose?  There is no purpose.  
There doesn t have to be a purpose 
in America.  You can do what you 
want.  That s what s so great 
about my country.

TODD (CONT'D)
You have the freedom to pursue 
your dream, whatever it is.  You 
can be president, or a scientist, 
or you can invent novelties 
like...

Todd reaches in the box and pulls out a novelty, but he 
instantly regrets his choice.  The novelty is a small 
model of a woman s torso in a red dress.

MANMEET
What is that?

TODD
(committing to it)
This is exactly what I m talking 
about.  Maybe no one needs this, 
but in America, no one can stop 
you from making it.  This is the 
definition of freedom.  This is

a headset to hear the caller and fumbles to turn off the 
 jingle jugs. 

MANMEET
Thank you for calling Mid America 
Novelty.  How can I help you?

AMERICAN CALLER (V.O.)
Yeah, I want that mug on page six.

MANMEET
Of course.  Can I please have the 
order number?

Manmeet looks to Todd who nods,  So far, so good. 

AMERICAN CALLER (V.O.)
Uh, let s see.  It s uh...256-KPR.

MANMEET
That s 256,  K  as in Krishna,  P  
and in Punjabi,  R  as in 
Ramayana.

Todd grimaces.

AMERICAN CALLER (V.O.)
Rama-what?  Where am I calling?  
Is this India?28.

MANMEET
...No.

AMERICAN CALLER (V.O.)
Am I calling freakin  India to 
order a mug that says  America s 
#1?! 

MANMEET
(off a cheat-sheet)
No, we are in Detroit, city of 
motors and black people.

The Caller hangs up.  Todd, frustrated, turns to Rajiiv.

TODD
Are you sure these are the best 
workers you could find?

RAJIIV
Sir, are you suggesting I hired 
lesser employees to make you look 
bad?

TODD
No, of course not.  Why would you 
do that?  As you said, our fates 
our tied.  If I can t make this 
office work, they ll get rid of 
me.
(realizing, eyeing 
Rajiiv suspiciously)
In which case, they ll need a new 
manager.

RAJIIV
Perhaps they ll try a local.

TODD
Rajiiv, I thought you were on my 
side.  I thought  My success is 
your success. 

RAJIIV
It is.  But also, your failure is 
my success.  Either way, I m 
rooting for you.

Rajiiv steps away.  As Todd looks out and considers his 
employees, we...

Midori nods that she understands.  Just then, through the

She spots Gupta and grimaces to herself.  Gupta perks up.  

GUPTA
Asha, did--

pantry)
Yes, Gupta I read the paper.  But 
I m getting a migraine so I m 
sorry but I need absolute quiet.  
Perhaps we can talk later.

GUPTA

Oh, okay.  Perhaps later.

Asha opens the pantry door and sees Todd, Manmeet, and 
Midori.  30.

(The pantry door opens out so Gupta is unable to see past 
the door into the pantry.)  Todd shakes his head as if to 
say,  please don t give us up.    Asha considers them, 
then shuts the door.

ASHA
Actually, Gupta, I m feeling 
better, why don t we chat at my 
desk.

GUPTA
Really?!

Asha leads Gupta out, back into the bullpen.

ASHA
Yes.  Did you read that story 
about the tiger who attacked the 
farmers?
(loud enough for 
Todd/Manmeet/Midori 
to hear)
One farmer threw herself at the 
tiger, sacrificing herself so that 
her three co-workers could live.  
They really owed her after that.

GUPTA
(as they exit)
I missed that one.  Did you read 
about the inchworms that are both 
male and female?

ASHA
No.
(it hurts to say)
Please tell me about it.

Asha exits with Gupta.  Another EMPLOYEE enters to make a 
cup of tea and is surprised when Todd, Manmeet, and 
Midori come out of the pantry, and, without an 
explanation, pass her and exit.

CUT TO:


Todd and Rajiiv look over the bullpen and see that the 
employees are familiarizing themselves with the products.

I know.  That s why I want to 
light a fire under everyone today.

RAJIIV
I have a thought.  Why don t you 
pick one employee...  

Rajiiv gestures to Midori who, at that moment, is trying 
on a novelty baseball cap with a built in mullet wig.

(CONT D) RAJIIV
...and fire them.  That will scare 
the others into working harder.

TODD
I don t want to fire someone just 
to make a point.

RAJIIV
She doesn t belong here anyway.  
She is a lower caste.  

TODD
I think I ll try my way first.  If 
it doesn t work, I m sure I can 
find someone to fire.

 Rajiiv s However,  back. smiles Rajiiv and smiles Todd
smile fades as he realizes Todd might be speaking about 
him.

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

All the employees have gathered and Todd addresses them.

TODD
Alright, everyone, thank you for 
coming in so early.

A novelty garden gnome Manmeet is trying to figure out 
makes a farting sound.  Manmeet chuckles.

MANMEET
It is a farting garden gnome.32.

TODD
I know, pretty cool, huh?  
(to everyone)
Okay, here s the deal.  Asha was 
right.  Even if you guys memorize 
the catalogue, you re not getting 
the cultural stuff, and that s 
what we re selling.  So it s time 
you learned about America. 

Todd holds up several DVD s and CD s.

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

Rajiiv stands in front of Todd and the workers.

RAJIIV
A census taker once tried to test 
me.  I ate his liver with some 
fava beans and a nice chianti.

 too little a is impersonation Lector Hannibal Rajiiv s
good and everyone is uncomfortable.

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

Asha, standing in front of everyone, looks down at what 
she s written on a piece of paper and inadvertently 
giggles at what she s about to say.

TODD
Please, some respect.  This is a 
classic.

 by Delight   Rapper s attempts then breath, a takes Asha
the Sugar Hill Gang.

ASHA
I said a hip, hop, the hippie, the 
hippie dibby hip hop hop and you 
don t stop to rock it to the bang 
bang boogie--

Asha breaks down laughing.  Todd and the others laugh 
with her.

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

Manmeet is giving an over-wrought performance.33.

MANMEET
 Put.  That coffee.  Down!  
Coffee s for closers only. 
(then, pretending to 
accept an Oscar)
I would like to thank the Academy, 
and of course my wife, Mrs. Halle 
Berry-Shukla.

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

Midori, mortified to be the center of attention, is 
performing so quietly everyone has to lean in to hear.

MIDORI
(in a half whisper)
You talking to me?  You talking to 
me?  Well I m the only one here.  
Who the  naughty word  do you 
think you re talking to?

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

Gupta stands before everyone, humming an indecipherable 
tune.  There is a foreboding air of anticipation.  Then:

GUPTA
 I M BRINGING SEXY BACK-- 

Collectively, the group recoils and cuts Gupta off before 
he can sing another verse.

MOST OF THE WORKERS
No!

GUPTA
What?  What?

Gupta and the others turn to Todd for a  ruling. 

TODD
(to Gupta)
Just, no.

Gupta hangs his head.

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

Todd is standing at the front, addressing everyone.34.

TODD
...These phones are gonna start 
ringing soon, and we have to do 
better than yesterday.  We have to 
start pushing the add-ons, that s 
our bread and butter.  Look, we 
may not be the cream of the crop, 
we re more like the  Bad News 
Bears ...
(off their blank 
looks)
No one knows who the  Bad News 
Bears  were?

RAJIIV
(raising his hand)
Sir, I would venture to say that 
they are bears, who, when they 
come to town, it is very bad news 
indeed.
(off Todd shaking his 
head in frustration)
...Because they are bears.
(turning to the 
others for support)
Who wants a bear in your village?

TODD
It was a movie about a baseball 
team with a bunch of losers--

ASHA
Are we the losers in this story?

TODD
Yes, well, no, because my point 
is, everyone thought they were 
losers, until they proved people 
wrong.

ASHA
Who are we proving wrong?

TODD
Just people.
(sneaking a glance at 
Rajiiv)
So by the end of the month, I want 
everyone selling ten add-ons a 
day.  By the end of this week, 
five a day.  And by the end of 
today, I want everyone, and I mean 
everyone, to sell one add-on.

Midori looks around, nervous.35.

RAJIIV
Or what?

TODD
There is no  Or What,  because I 
believe you re gonna do it. 
Look, this is my first time as a 
manager.  Some guys might be 
scared to tell you that, but I m 
not because I believe in myself.  
Sales is about confidence.  Do you 
believe in yourself?

MANMEET
(to himself)
Coffee is for closers.

DISSOLVE TO:

LATER THAT MORNING:

Todd walks the floor with a headset and a switcher that 
allows him to eavesdrop on any call.  He switches to 
Manmeet s call as he finishes a sale.  

MANMEET
Let me read that item number back 
to you.  That s 732-GRF.  732,  G  
as in  Good Fellas,   R  as in 
 Raging Bull,  and  F  as in...
(almost an Italian 
accent)
Forgetaboutit.

Manmeet smiles at Todd who nods.

DISSOLVE TO:

LATER THAT MORNING:

Todd walks past Asha and clicks over to her call.

ASHA
...Many of our customers who 
bought confederate flag shot 
glasses also purchased a deer head 
which you can mount on the wall.

CALLER (V.O.)
(in a Southern 
accent)
Why would I mount a deer I didn t 
shoot?36.

ASHA
Because this deer sings  Sweet 
Home Alabama. 

CALLER (V.O.)
(interested)
Okay, now that s funny.

Both Todd and Asha grin.

DISSOLVE TO:

LATER THAT MORNING:

Todd is pacing the floor.  At the moment, no one is on a 
call, all the employees are waiting.  Then a phone rings.

TODD
(before anyone can 
answer)
Wait, who hasn t sold an add-on 
yet?

All the employees turn to look at Midori.  She almost 
wilts under the scrutiny.  Todd gestures at the ringing 
phone until Midori answers it.

MIDORI
(into phone, sotto)
Mid America Novelty, how can I 
help you?

CALLER (V.O.)
Hello?

MIDORI
(slightly louder but 
still way too soft)
How can I help you?

CALLER (V.O.)
Hello?  Is anyone there?

Rajiiv shakes his head and makes a throat slitting 
gesture regarding Midori.

CALLER (V.O.) (CONT D)
Hello?

Todd, thinking fast, reaches down and turns up the volume 
 static of lot a is There  call. the of side Midori s on
on her end, but, finally, Midori has a voice.

MIDORI
How can I help you?37.

CALLER (V.O.)
I wanna order the fake dog poo.

MIDORI
Wonderful choice.

CALLER (V.O.)
Yeah, my roommate s getting on my 
nerves.  I wanna freak him out.  

MIDORI
(without consulting a 
catalogue)
In that case, could I also 
interest you in our fake vomit on 
page 23, lower left hand of the 
page?

CALLER (V.O.)
This vomit, does it look real?

MIDORI
Well, it makes me sick to look at 
it.

CALLER (V.O.)
Yeah, alright, I ll get the vomit 
too.

TODD
(taking off his 
headset, to the 
room)
Okay, that s everyone.

The others (except for Rajiiv) applaud for Midori and she 
beams shyly...until she hears the caller in her ear:

CALLER (V.O.)
Why are people clapping?

TODD
(sotto to Midori)
Get the credit card info.

MIDORI
Oh.

As Midori rejoins the call to get the credit card 
information, Todd sidles up to Rajiiv for an aside.

TODD
You were hoping I would succeed or 
fail, but there s one outcome you 
didn t anticipate: my modest but 
slowly improving just okay-ness.  
(MORE)38.

TODD (CONT'D)
And that s something I m mighty 
good at.  Looks like you 
underestimated me...and 
overestimated me.

As Todd walks away, and Rajiiv looks on baffled, we:
