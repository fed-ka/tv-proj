      A cluster of STUDENTS take diligent notes during an 
      astonishingly dry lecture. The round-shouldered LECTURER 
      points to a grid-reference map peppered with dots.

                    If we take our example grid-map, 
                    the Cycladic island of Melos, we 
                    can identify that this grid was 
                    compiled using randomly stratified 
                    sample transects which were then 
                    field-walked such as in the process 
                    outlined on Wednesday. When 
                    choosing a site for sampling it is 
                    important to take into account top 
                    .. top.. top ....

    Her hair an excited tangle of Celtic curls. This is DR

      JAMES springs awake with a cry, his hand finding the knife 
      under his pillow. Young, touseledand clearly broke. The 
      bedsit is grey and lit by a single bulb. It is adorned as a 
      monk s cell. JAMES (trembling) gets immediately to his knees 
    in supplication. Another derelict, COLM, enters. He wears a 
      long dusty trench coat.

                    And I ve dreamt about it.

      JAMES is on his feet. He is staring at the photographs on his 
      dusty mantelpiece - pictures of earnest young boys at a 
      monastic school, attended by monks.  

      Outside, a mullah calls to prayer.

                                  COLM
                    I ve just been down the court 
                    house. He s been acquitted.

      COLM switches on the only luxury in the room - a portable tv 
      linked to a digital box.

                    When he came to Christ he was 
                    surprised to discover that wearing 
                    a crucifix was considered 
                    provocative. He was staggeredto 
                    discover that his prison chapel was 
                    turned over on a weekly basis for 
                    Indian yoga classes. What has 
                    happened to our Christian identity? 
                    Has it been eroded or have we sold 
                    the Lord down the river to appease 
                    an ever-broader stream of spiritual 
                    aliens?

      JAMES punches off the TV. Again, he hears the call to Muslim

      GILLIAN drags a jacket over her cocktail dress, joining BEN 
    at the examination table. A partly assembled skeleton. Each 
      bone has been labelled. GILLIAN places the skull at the top 
    of the vertebrae. BEN turns over the warped hilt of a sword.

                    Our knights have been dated to the

                    radical. King Phillip of France 
                    outlawed them in 1307. I believe 
                    the arrests began on Friday 13th.

      There Are Many Mansions . Music begins to fill the room from 
    the CD player - Gregorian plain-song.

      SCENE OMITTED3535



      GILLIAN extracts a distinctive lead crucifix from a tray of 
      silt. She cleans it off using a needle-thin water jet. 
      GREGORY hunches over her.

                                  GREGORY
                    Ah yes, one of the pert little 
                    third years pulled this out. It 
                    definitely belonged to a 
                      Grandmontine.

                                  GILLIAN
                    Well the Grandmontinemonks were 
                    the chroniclers of the Templars.
                    It s a good bet one was travelling 
                    with them when they were attacked. 

    She turns over the crucifix - etched on the back is a snake 
    and a sword.

                    Don t know. Look at the way this 
                    chain is snapped. As though it was

                    live in the Lord s house all my

                    In times of trouble He will shelter 
                    me; He will keep me safe in His 
                    temple and make me secure on a high

    She picks up a Chinese box. Opens the lid and peers in. 
      Reacts with a start and drops it. 

      A photo catches her eye - young Gillian with unruly teenage

    has been drawing swords. Variations on the same idea. And 
      star maps. Pinpointed constellations. VIV can not make sense

      outside. Shadow under the door. VIV is stock still. Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  39.

      streets of Jerusalem. Crying children hunkered beside dead 
      parents. Arabs and Israelis slaughtering one another. And all 
    of this to one solitary choir boy singing  Jerusalem .

       And did those feet in ancient time, walk upon England s 
      mountains green? And was the Holy Lamb of God in England s 
      pleasant pastures seen ..? 

    The images intensify, the cutting growing rapid. The hymn

                      theirJerusalem or Christ s 
                    Jerusalem?

      GILLIAN blazes. BEN tries to calm her down but she shrugs him 
      off. LAYGASS remains patient. MASTIFF looks nervous.

                    I believe the Knights Templar
                    brought the Cross of Christ to 
                    England. If they were butchered 
                    then maybe the Cross is still here.

                      Geo-physhasn t uncovered anything 
                    else. And anyway, wouldn t their 
                    attackers take it?

                                  LAYGASS
                    Not necessarily. The Knights had 
                    become outcasts. Maybe they were 
                    killed simply for that reason. 

                                  GILLIAN
                    Then why not let us find it? Why 
                    turn a scientific enquiry into a

      Sounds of the door swinging open. Someone else has entered 
    the candle-lit library.

      GREGORY feels an urge to hurry. He trawls quickly through the 
      spines of books until he finds what he is looking for. Flips 
      down the pages. Finds a heading on the GrandmontineOrder.

      Someone is moving down an aisle of books towards him. GREGORY 
      reads avidly, strolling deeper into the library.

    At her desk, the LIBRARIAN is writing. A shadow passes across 
      her. She looks up but there is no one.

      GREGORY has the book on a reading stand. He photographs the 
      relevant pages with his digital camera.

      A noise in one of the aisles. GREGORY can see nobody. 

      Creak. Floorboard on the opposite side of the case. Someone 
      standing on the other side. GREGORY begins to walk slowly 
      along the aisle. Can he hear footsteps matching him? He 
      freezes. Leans forward and pulls out a book.

      A pair of bloodshot eyes blaze back at him.

      GREGORY drops the book with a crash. He darts down another 
      aisle. He moves fast, switching from row to row.

                                  GILLIAN
                    No, I m going down!

      LAYGASS grabs VIV and throws her to the ground, raising his 
      sword. In the hellfire glow of burning crosses he appears 
      demonic. 

    And VIV starts to sing.

                                  VIV
                     And did those feet in ancient 
                    times, walk upon England s 
                    mountains green? And was the holy 
                    Lamb of God, in England s pleasant 
                    pastures seen ..? 

      Beautiful. Pitch-perfect. Pure. LAYGASS is dumbfounded. The 
      song has captured him. He did not expect it. VIV stares at 
    him as she sings  Jerusalem  with utter sincerity. 

                                  LAYGASS
                    God gave you that voice sister. But 
                    the Devil uses it.

    It is the fraction of a beat that is needed.Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  63.


      GILLIAN swings in on her harness and collides with LAYGASS.
    He topples over backwards, splayed across a burning cross in 
      crucifixion pose. FX: He screams as his body ignites.

    VIV sits up. GILLIAN is swinging in for a second pass.

    VIV lifts up her hand - hope beyond hope.

      GILLIAN snatches it.

                                  BEN
                    Now!

    He and GREGORY pull in the harness. FX: GILLIAN rises away 
      from the fire, VIV dangling from her grip.

                                  VIV
                    Don t let go!

                                  GILLIAN
                    I ve got you honey.

    On the chamber floor, JAMES opens his eyes. JAQUES de SAINT-
      OMAR, the captain of the Templars, stands over him.JAMES 
      lifts out his hand but the Knight does not try to help him. A 
      burning cross falls across JAMES and he is gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:



    The chamber is raging inferno. The crosses are collapsing in 
      ashes. 

      Save one.

    One cross rests in the middle of the conflagration but it 
      does not burn. Then suddenly it ignites in a flame that roars 
      brighter than all the rest. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      PULL BACK from another fire. The flames of a cosy pub hearth.

      DANIEL MASTIFF finds the TEAM sitting around a table near the 
      fire all with pints of real ale. 

                                  GILLIAN
                    Hello Daniel, pork scratching?

                                  DANIEL MASTIFF
                    No Cross.

                                  GILLIAN
                    Apparently not. 

                                  BEN
                    Might be for the best Daniel. It s 
                    a pretty inflammatory relic.Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  65.


                                  DANIEL MASTIFF
                    Yes, yes .. Would you like another 
                    pint of Smug? 

    He turns to leave. GILLIAN goes after him.

                                  GILLIAN
                    Daniel. You were hoodwinked by a 
                    fanatic.

                                  DANIEL MASTIF
                    When vocation becomes passion 
                    anyone can become a fanatic. If I 
                    recall, it runs in yourfamily.

    He leaves her feeling troubled. She returns to the pub table. 
      They watch her. GILLIAN produces the hunk of 2000 year old 
      cedar. 

                                  BEN
                    They can t reclaim the DNA. Blood s 
                    too polluted. 

                                  GREGORY
                    Our poor bleeding stranger remains 
                    a mystery. Good. For the best.

                                  GILLIAN
                          (hefts the wood)
                    If you can t build with it, all 
                    wood is good for is burning. Any 
                    carpenter knows that.

    She tosses the chunk onto the fire. It roars up at once. They 
      watch it burn. They ve done the right thing.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SCENE MOVED TO 105102102



      GILLIAN has put the splinter into two glass plates which she 
      then puts on the shelf with her numerous antiquities.

                                  GILLIAN
                    Viv? There s something I want to 
                    ask you.

                                  VIV
                    What?

                                  GILLIAN
                    Are you going talk like a fortune 
                    cookie or are you going to get out 
                    there and start digging?

    VIV grins at her. *

                    Not right now. There s something I 
                    have to do.

                                                                            CUT TO:Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  66A.



      GILLIAN stands before the WOMANin her late 50 swith the 
      mass of unruly black-grey hair. The WOMAN will not look at 
      GILLIAN. She just keeps drawing - patterns and symbols.  

                                  GILLIAN
                    I was really close. Maybe some 
                    things are best left hidden. You 
                    know that better than anyone. 

    The WOMAN ignores her, continues to scribble. Dots. Lots of 
      dots that she begins to join as though they are 
      constellations.Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  67.


                                  GILLIAN (CONT'D)
                    I m not trying to boast. I just 
                    wanted you to know. 

    She kisses the WOMAN on the top of her head.

                                  GILLIAN (CONT'D)
                    Take care mum. I love you.

    She pauses at the door. Her MOTHER doesn t even break from 
    her writing. GILLIAN leaves sadly. 

      Alone, her MOTHER pauses in her  work . 

    In the doorway, GILLIAN unfolds a crumpled picture - Jaques 
    De Saint-Omar holding aloft a sword.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      GILLIAN smooths out her picture of Jaques De Saint-Omar. She 
      circles his sword with a marker pen and adds the picture to 
    the wall. We pull back to reveal a myriad of maps, pictures, 
      designs that wallpaper the room. Swords. Images of swords. 
      Designs of swords. The place is like an altar to the sword 
      throughout history. 

    We hear an electrical hum that skitters around the room like 
      a naughty phantom. GILLIAN clocks it. Frowns. The hum dies 
      away.

      FADE OUT.
