                    We are products of our parents - 
                    whether we like it or not. Every 
                    single trait from the color of your 
                    eyes to the color of your hair, to 
                    the way your pinky bends or whether 
                    you can roll your tongue, it s all 
                      determined by the genes passed down 
                    to you by your mother and father.  


      A long driveway lined with elm trees leads to a beautiful Old 
      Enfield estate. A sports Jaguar, a Lexus SUV, and an Audi.

                    Each of your parents donates one of 
                    their alleles and the combination 
                      determines your blood type. A 
                    mother who is type O, for example, 
                    can only pass on an O allele.


      A middle-class neighborhood. A small house painted a powder 
      blue. Wind chimes and funky statues in the front yard.                                                                                       7.




      Regina and Daphne drive up to the estate in their 10-year old 
      car. They take in the size of the house. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Whoa...  

                                  REGINA
                    Famous ex-baseball player, owns a 
                    chain of car washes...Honey, you 
                    scored!

                                  DAPHNE
                    Stop that. 

      They park. The front door opens and Kristen steps out. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    Hi! You found it!

      Luke and Toby follow her out. (We can see Bay in the kitchen, 
      looking out through the window.)

                                    KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                    DAPHNE, THIS IS LUKE AND TOBY. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Hi. Nice to meet you.

      The boys stare. Kristen glares at them.

                                  TOBY/LUKE
                    Nice to meet you. Hi. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    My goodness they look alike, don t 
                    they?
                          (to Daphne)
                    YOU SURE LOOK ALIKE! 

                                  REGINA
                    No matter how loud you yell, she 
                    still can t hear you.                                                                                       9.



                                    KRISTEN
                          (embarrassed)
                    Of course, I m sorry.

                                  REGINA
                    Just face her and talk normally. 
                    Not too fast, not too slow.

                                  DAPHNE
                          (to Kristen)
                    It s okay, everyone does that. 

      John pulls up, hurries out of his car. 

                                  JOHN
                    Sorry! We re opening up three more 
                    car washes and things are crazy -

                                  DAPHNE
                    I can t believe you re John Kennish 
                    of Kennish Car Wash - we used to go 
                    there all the time!

                                  BAY
                          (to Toby, can t understand 
                            Daphne s voice)
                    What d she say?

                                  DAPHNE
                    And my friend Emmett is so excited 
                    to meet you. Huge Rangers fan.

                                  JOHN
                    We ll go to a game!  

                                    KRISTEN
                    Should we have some lunch?

      Regina signs to Daphne (and we caption)  lunch -- inside the 
      mansion.  Daphne signs back (and we caption),  Be nice!  Just 
      as Kristen mouths to Bay  Be nice! 


      Bay stands in front of a TRASH DUMPSTER in a deserted alley, 
      spray painting it, fast, working intensely. Street art -- 
      creating something in public spaces on unlikely canvases -- 
      is her passion, her escape, and her secret. 


      John drives Daphne home in his Jaguar. He pulls up in front 
      of her house, taking in the less-than-stellar neighborhood. 

                                  DAPHNE
                            (cheerfully)
                    We know all the cops. 

                                  JOHN
                    Well that s helpful. 

      The front door opens and Regina comes out. Daphne pulls a set 
      of brand new GOLF CLUBS from the backseat to show her.  

                                  DAPHNE
                    Look!

                                  JOHN 
                    She seemed so interested in 
                      learning...

      Now Adrianna emerges from the house.

                                  REGINA 
                    John, this is my mother, Adrianna.

                                  JOHN
                    Wow, you re the spitting image of 
                    Bay. 

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Really?! I can t wait to meet her. 

                                  JOHN
                    I know Bay would love that.  

                                  REGINA
                    Daphne, come in. It s cold. 

      Adrianna follows her inside, leaving Daphne and John alone. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Thanks again. That was really fun.                                                                                      22.



                                  JOHN
                    Are you kidding? You re a natural!  

      Daphne grins and heads towards her house. John turns back to 
      his car, sees that she forgot her hat on the passenger seat. 

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Daphne! 
                          (she doesn t respond)
                    DAPHNE!

      She still doesn t turn around. And then John remembers - 
      she s deaf. He had actually forgotten for a minute. 

      But instead of getting back into his car, he stands there for 
      a beat, very still, listening to the sounds of the city. The 
      cars, the dogs, the radios, the crickets, the kids playing. 

      And the realization that she can t hear any of it makes him 
      profoundly sad. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Bay sits in a parked car across the street from Regina s 
      house. Her hair is tucked into a knit hat and she wears 
      sunglasses. She studies Regina through the kitchen window, 
      watching her every move.  


      Kristen loads her groceries into her car. A woman - JULIE - 
      heading into the store sees Kristen.

                                  JULIE
                    Kristen! I think we saw you at the 
                    club on Saturday?   

                                    KRISTEN
                    Oh yeah, beautiful day, wasn t it?

                                  JULIE
                    Who was that girl you were with? 

                                    KRISTEN
                          (backing out, waves)
                    Gotta run. Good seeing you!

      She speeds off. As she drives away, she feels guilty for 
      lying. She just isn t ready to answer questions. Not yet. 


      Lunch time at Daphne's school. It s a typical high school, 
      except the halls are mostly silent, as everyone is signing. 

      Daphne eats at a table with her best friend EMMETT, 16. (They 
      sign and we caption the conversation.)

                                  EMMETT
                    Just think, if you were raised by 
                    them, you could be some incredible 
                    golfer today! 

                                  BAY
                          (laughs)
                    Maybe.                                                                                    28.



                                  EMMETT
                    Or a religious freak. Or a total 
                    bitch. Your whole personality might 
                    be different. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    I like to think there s a part of 
                    me that s somewhat fixed. But 
                    you re right. Who knows. 

                                  EMMETT 
                    You would ve been raised in 
                      Tarrytown! One thing s for sure - 
                    you and I never would ve met.

                                  DAPHNE
                      I probably wouldn t even be deaf.

      Emmett reacts to this. 

                                  EMMETT
                    Why do you say that?

                                  DAPHNE
                    I got sick when I was a baby. Maybe 
                      I wouldn t have gotten sick in this 
                    alternate life. I mean, you change 
                    one thing, everything changes. It s 
                    a domino effect.  

      He stares at her. The concept dumbfounds him. 

                                  EMMETT
                    You...but hearing. I can t imagine. 

                                  DAPHNE 
                    I try not to think about it. The 
                    whole  what if  thing makes my head 
                    hurt. 

      RED LIGHTS flash and the students head to class. 

      Daphne stands up - sees John standing on the edge of campus. 
      She hurries over to him. 

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Hi! What are you doing here? 


      Bay is still in her car, spying on Regina. There s a KNOCK on 
      the passenger window - she JUMPS.                                                                                     29.



      A MAN (the same man Regina spoke to through the videophone - 
      PENN) is staring at her. He gestures for her to roll down the 
      window. (He is deaf, but he does not sign in this scene.)

                                  PENN
                    Hey. What are you doing here? 

                                  BAY
                    Nothing! I m allowed to park where 
                    I want!

      Scared, she jams the car into gear and speeds off. 

      Penn watches her go, and sees a KENNISH CAR WASH license 
      plate holder. Suddenly he realizes who she must be. 


      Daphne and John take a walk through the basketball court.

                                  JOHN
                    Bay goes to Buckner Hall. Have you 
                    heard of it? 

      She looks at him quizzically.

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                          (says it again, slower)
                    Buckner Hall.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Oh yes, yes. Buckner Hall. 

                                  JOHN 
                    It s the best school in the city. I 
                    know your grades and activities 
                    would be good enough to get you in. 

      The PRINCIPAL walks by, signs to Daphne (and we caption).

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Why aren t you in class? 

                                  DAPHNE
                    This is my uncle. 

      The principal looks John over. 

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Tell him next time he has to get a 
                    pass from the office.

      Daphne nods and he leaves.                                                                                     30.



                                  DAPHNE
                    You want me to go to Buckner Hall?

                                  JOHN 
                    I just don t think isolating 
                    yourself in a deaf bubble is a good 
                    idea. Let s say you want to be a 
                    surgeon - is your team going to 
                    have to learn to sign to get your 
                      instructions? Are you going to have 
                    to read lips in the operating room? 
                    Am I talking too fast?
                          (Daphne gestures  a 
                            little ; he slows down)
                    The rest of the world can hear. 
                    Don t you want to interact with 
                    them on a daily basis?

      Daphne hesitates. She wasn t prepared for this.  

                                  DAPHNE 
                    I know Buckner s really expensive -

                                  JOHN
                    Don t worry about that.

                                  DAPHNE
                      I appreciate this so much. But I 
                    like my friends, my teachers, the 
                      classes... 

                                  JOHN 
                    You d love Buckner Hall! They ve 
                    got this incredible science lab, 
                    the pool is almost Olympic size... 
                    We want to give you the best 
                    education so you can have every 
                      opportunity open to you. Plus 
                    there s Bay...I think you two 
                    should get to know each other. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    I don t really think she wants to 
                    get to know me.

                                  JOHN
                    Well, she needs some time. But we 
                    all want to be part of your life. 
                    Luke, Toby...you have brothers.

                                  DAPHNE
                    I know. It s incredible.                                                                                     31.



      Even though mainstreaming has never been something she s 
      wanted, he is making it sound so appealing - to get to know 
      her new family, to make him happy.  

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Can I think about it? 

                                  JOHN
                    Of course! I ll set up a tour. 
                    We ll go from there. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    I should get back to class. 

                                  JOHN
                      Absolutely. Just - one more thing.
                          (beat)
                    Maybe it s best not to tell Regina 
                    about any of this? Keep it just 
                    between us?

      Daphne hesitates. As uncomfortable as this makes her, she 
      realizes that he s probably right. 

      She nods and walks back to class. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.                                                                                    32.



                                  ACT THREE


      Daphne and John get a tour from the principal, MR. LANIER.

                                  MR. LANIER
                    Last year we had 35 National Merit 
                    Scholars. But we re not just for 
                    smart kids. We ve got scientists, 
                    poets, linguists, athletes, service 
                    leaders   you name it.

      Daphne takes in the facilities - which are magnificent. 

                                  JOHN
                    Now Roy, you were telling me you d 
                    have a, what s it called again -

                                  MR. LANIER
                    Right, we d have an interpreter 
                    with you at all your classes, P.E., 
                    any afterschool event you want to 
                      participate in. And we d pair you 
                    with a student in each class whose 
                    notes you could borrow. That way 
                    you can focus on the interpreter.   

      Daphne nods, smiles. 

                                  JOHN
                    Isn t it incredible here? 

                                  DAPHNE
                      Beautiful. 


      Daphne turns to John and the principal. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Is it okay if I just walk around on 
                    my own for a few minutes?

                                  JOHN/MR. LANIER
                    Of course!/ Yes!/ By all means.


      Bay and John are by his car, mid argument. She is very upset.

                                  BAY
                    When were you planning on telling 
                    me?

                                  JOHN
                    I m sorry, I should ve. But it s 
                    just a tour. It s very preliminary. 

                                  BAY
                    That s not the point. 

                                  JOHN 
                    Honey, we have to find a way to 
                    integrate her into our lives. And I 
                    think it d be good for you to get 
                    to know her.

                                  BAY
                    Why? Because she s so perfect?

                                  JOHN
                    What? Of course not.

                                  BAY
                    You can t just throw her in my 
                    face. One second after meeting her, 
                    she s going to my school?

                                  JOHN
                    I know it s fast, but we ve all 
                    lost so much time already.  

      Teachers walk by. They both lower their voices. 

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Bay, be reasonable. She hasn t had 
                    the same opportunities as you. Your 
                    mother and I are just trying to 
                    make this thing right.  

      She s on the verge of tears. 

                                  BAY 
                    Right for who?

                                  JOHN
                    Right for all of us.                                                                                     37.



                                  BAY
                    Well what s best for me is not 
                    having her here. And if you care 
                    about me at all, you won t do this. 

      The bell rings. She turns around. 

                                  JOHN
                      Bay...come on. Bay! 


      Daphne sits on the curb, texting. Toby jogs out of school, 
      glances around, making sure there are no teachers around. He 
      doesn t notice Daphne.

      He heads over to a BMW with the motor running, hands over an 
      ENVELOPE. Daphne watches, curious. The car drives away. 

      He walks back towards school - and sees her. Stops.

                                  TOBY
                    Hey. What are you...

                                  DAPHNE
                    Your dad set up a tour for me.

      He seems a little nervous. He s obviously wondering what she 
      saw and if she s going to say anything to his dad. 

                                  TOBY 
                    Are you going to go here?

                                  DAPHNE
                    I don t know. We ll see. 

    A motorcycle pulls up. It s Emmett. She signs and speaks.

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Emmett, this is Toby. Toby, Emmett.

      Emmett holds up one hand, a silent hi. 

                                  TOBY
                    Hey. 

      Emmett signs to Daphne, and we caption. 

                                  EMMETT
                    Is this your brother?

      She signs  yes.  Toby looks between them.                                                                                    38.



                                  DAPHNE
                    He was just asking who you are.

                                  TOBY
                    He doesn t talk?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Not orally. 

      The guys look at each other. 

                                  TOBY
                    Why not?

                                  EMMETT
                    Ask him why he doesn t sign.

                                  TOBY
                    I mean, why do some deaf people 
                    talk and others don t? 

      He s asking genuinely, but Daphne knows Emmett probably isn t 
      taking this line of questioning well.  

                                  DAPHNE
                    It just kind of depends on the 
                      person...if they re comfortable... 
                    if they had speech therapy growing 
                    up...if they want to to speak. 

                                  TOBY
                    But he reads lips?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Yes. 
                          (then, delicately)
                    You can just ask him directly.  

                                  TOBY
                          (confused)
                    But he won t answer.

                                  DAPHNE
                    It s just, uh, not really 
                      considered polite to talk about 
                    deaf people in the third person if 
                    they re right there. 

      Toby looks at Emmett. Still not totally getting this. 

                                  DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                    Plus I can interpret.                                                                                     39.



                                  TOBY 
                    What does he do if you re not 
                    around?

                                  EMMETT
                    He s doing it again. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    He uses pen and paper, or gestures.  
                    He actually isn t around people who 
                    don t sign that often. 

                                  TOBY
                    How is that possible? 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Because everyone in his family is 
                    deaf. Because all of his friends 
                    are deaf.

                                  TOBY
                    His whole family is deaf?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Uh huh. 

                                  TOBY
                    Okay, but what about stores, buses, 
                      restaurants? What does he do in 
                    like, real life?

                                  DAPHNE
                    He gets by. 
                          (looks at Emmett, laughs)
                    Trust me. Emmett gets by. 

                                  EMMETT 
                    Because I ve been trained to deal 
                    with d-bags like you since I was 
                    born. 

      Daphne glares at him.

                                  TOBY
                    What d he say?

                                  DAPHNE
                    He really likes your shoes.


      Bay and her friend SIMONE sit at a bench on the patio of a 
      Mexican dive where they serve minors. They re drunk. Bay is 
      acting like the whole story is hilarious. 

                                  SIMONE
                    I don t believe you.

                                  BAY
                    It s true! We were switched at 
                    birth! 

                                  SIMONE
                    You re such a liar! 

                                  BAY 
                    I m telling you! I got her family 
                    and she got mine.                                                                                    41.



                                  SIMONE
                    You and some deaf girl.

                                  BAY
                    Yes! And you know what s even 
                    weirder? I could ve been deaf.

                                  SIMONE
                    Ha ha. 

                                  BAY
                    I m serious. She got sick as a kid. 
                    So if I had been raised by my real 
                    mom, I would ve probably been in 
                    the same place on the same day to 
                    catch the same germ that made her 
                    sick. I might ve gone deaf, too. 

                                  SIMONE
                    That is so freaky.

                                  BAY
                    I know!!
                          (imitating how a deaf 
                            person sounds)
                    He-llo. My - name - is - Bay.

      She folds her arms, shimmies her weight, throws her fingers 
      into what looks like gang signs.

                                  SIMONE
                    Why are you signing like a deaf 
                      gangster??

      They both crack up.


      Penn and Regina exit the bakery, head for Regina s car. 

                                  PENN
                    Are you going to call Angelo?

                                  REGINA
                    Why on earth would I do that?

                                  PENN
                    Because he left when Daphne was 
                    three years old insisting she 
                    wasn t his daughter and that you 
                    cheated on him with a tall, blonde  
                    mystery man?

                                  REGINA
                    He left when she was three years 
                    old because she went deaf. 

                                  PENN
                    That s probably true. But as it 
                    turns out, he was right. She wasn t 
                    his daughter. 

                                  REGINA
                    Pure coincidence.                                                                                    44.



                                  PENN
                    I d think you d want to prove to 
                    him you were telling the truth.

                                  REGINA
                    Screw him. He missed out on raising 
                    Daphne. That s his loss. 

                                  PENN
                    Maybe he wants to meet Bay. Don t 
                    you think you should tell him about 
                    all of this? 

      This stops Regina. She never thought about that. 

      Her cell rings. She gestures  one second  to Penn.

                                  REGINA
                    Hello?
                          (listens)
                    There must be some mistake.
                          (listens)
                    Are you sure? Where?  
                          (to Penn, stunned)
                    Daphne was arrested.

      She s so discombobulated that she speaks without signing. 
      Realizing her mistake, she signs -  Daphne was arrested.   

                                  REGINA (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    She needs an interpreter! By law, 
                    she is required to have an 
                      interpreter! You have to talk 
                    slowly! Wait until I get there! 


      Kristen, John, and Regina rush outside. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    I can t believe she ran off here! 
                    It s a horrible neighborhood!

                                  REGINA
                    It s my neighborhood.

                                  JOHN
                    Let s just stop fighting and focus 
                    on finding Bay. Okay?

      They look at each other. Momentary truce.                                                                                     47.



                                  REGINA
                    Call me if you find her. 

      They nod and head towards their respective cars. 

      Regina dials her mother. 

                                  REGINA (CONT'D)
                    Can you watch Daph? Bay s missing. 
                          (beat)
                    I don t know. I ll call you later. 

      She hangs up and stands there for a beat. The thought of 
      losing Daphne is utterly overwhelming to her.  


      Bay stands on a deserted corner, trying not to look nervous. 
      An Audi pulls up. Bay opens the door and hurries in.

      Toby drives off. Bay doesn t say anything.

                                  TOBY 
                    You re welcome.  

                                  BAY
                    You should be thanking me, I 
                    probably saved you two grand by 
                    ending your night early. 

                                  TOBY
                    You are such a brat.

                                  BAY
                    Why, because I m not reacting well 
                    to finding out that I m part of 
                    some plot device in a Mark Twain 
                    novel? Excuse me for not handling 
                    this better. 

                                  TOBY
                    You re the one who started this! 
                    You could ve left it alone, but no, 
                    you had to go dragging mom and dad 
                    to that genetic counselor -

                                  BAY 
                    I didn't expect the answer to be 
                    yes! I said I did, but deep down I 
                    was kind of hoping there d be some 
                    other explanation. Toby, every 
                    single thing I took for granted 
                    about myself was just yanked away. 
                    My mom s not my mom. My house isn t 
                    my house. I don t even know what my 
                    name is. I m supposed to be Daphne, 
                    not Bay. I mean Jesus, who the hell 
                    am I?

      Toby is quiet for a beat.

                                  TOBY
                    You re right, this is wacked.                                                                                       52.



                                  BAY
                          (wipes her eyes)
                    Forget it, I know you can t 
                      understand. No one can.

      Beat.

                                  TOBY 
                    Actually, that s not true. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Regina is behind the door, very still, listening.

                                  BAY (O.S.)
                    I m sure Regina didn t even notice 
                    I was gone.  

      Regina closes her eyes. Pained to hear this.                                                                                      54.




      A MOVING TRUCK is parked outside. 


      MOVERS carry a pool table, arcade games, and a huge sectional 
      out of the poolhouse, and cardboard boxes, and furniture in. 
      Both families are here, overseeing the move.                                                                                     57.



                                  REGINA
                    I need color to survive. I m 
                    thinking of painting the outside a 
                    bright orange...

                                  JOHN
                    We said no rules. It s your home, 
                    do whatever you want with it.

      Kristen tenses, doing her best to bite her lip. 

      Adrianna passes Kristen, holding a plant. 

                                  ADRIANNA
                    I m Adrianna. Nice to meet you. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    Oh. Are you - also - ?

                                  ADRIANNA 
                    Just like the First Mother-in-Law, 
                    right? 

      She smiles and heads into the poolhouse. Off Kristen s look, 
      wondering what other surprises are in store for her.


      Kristen approaches Regina.

                                    KRISTEN
                    I just want to say, anything in the 
                    house is yours - the fridge, the 
                    pantry, we have a full bar - 

                                  REGINA
                    I m sober, Kristen. I ve been sober 
                    for 11 and a half years. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    Oh. I...had no idea.

                                  REGINA
                          (sharp)
                    Of course you didn t. We don t know 
                    anything about each other except 
                    that we raised each other s 
                      daughters. 

                                    KRISTEN
                    I m just trying to -                                                                                     58.



                                  REGINA 
                    Look, we agreed to this arrangement 
                    so I could get to know Bay and you 
                    can get to know Daphne. And 
                    frankly, I could use the free rent. 
                    But I m sure you re about as 
                    thrilled to have me in your 
                    backyard as I am to be here. So 
                    let s just make one thing clear. I 
                    don t intend to enter your house 
                    without permission and I assume 
                    you ll extend me the same courtesy.  

      Stunned, Kristen nods wordlessly. Regina heads off. 


      Daphne sees Luke on the back steps, studying a book intently. 

                                  DAPHNE
                    Hey. Whatcha reading?

      Luke holds the book up. It s THE DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN SIGN 
      LANGUAGE. Daphne s face lights up. She signs something. 

                                  LUKE
                    Wait, wait, I just learned that... 
                       Awesome! 

      She walks away, beaming. Luke practices the sign to himself. 


      Emmett pulls up on his motorcycle. Daphne approaches.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Want to grab lunch? I m craving 
                    Jensen s.

      Emmett gestures for her to climb on the bike. As she does, he 
      looks up and sees Bay in the house, staring at him. Their 
      eyes meet, a mutual flicker of interest. 

                                  EMMETT
                    Hey. Who s that girl?

      Daphne looks at Bay, considering how to answer this.  

                                  DAPHNE
                    The other me.  

                                                                            FADE OUT
