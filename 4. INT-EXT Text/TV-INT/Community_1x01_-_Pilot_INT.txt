      Britta moves down a food line, assembling her meal from bins 
      of saran wrapped items.  Jeff gets in line next to her. 

                                  JEFF
                    Oh, hey.  Spanish.

                                  BRITTA
                    Yeah, just don t hit on me, okay?

                                  JEFF
                    Whoa.

                                  BRITTA
                    And as you walk away, don t call me 
                    a lesbian or say  don t flatter 
                      yourself. 

                                  JEFF
                    Anything I should do?

                                  BRITTA
                    You should not hit on me.

                                  JEFF
                    Listen, I just wanted to let you 
                    know about my Spanish study group.

                                  BRITTA
                    The guy that spent today s class 
                    playing Bejeweled on his iphone has  
                    a study group?  Am I allowed to 
                    sign up twice?

                                  JEFF
                    I m taking that class for the easy 
                    credit.  I actually tutor Spanish.

      She turns to him.  On the hook but suspicious.

                                  BRITTA
                    Say that in Spanish.  Now.                                                                                      5.

      Jeff sighs, shouldering her cynicism with grace, and uses 
      gestures to indicate his mind, school and language:

                                  JEFF
                    Duermo tarde Espanol, una hora mas, 
                    no rayar mi coche.

      Subtitle:  I sleep late Spanish, one more hour, do not 
      scratch my car.  She squints.  Then surrenders.

                                  BRITTA
                    I really need help with Spanish.

                                  JEFF
                    I was willing to bet.  I m Jeff.  
                    The group meets in the library at 
                    six.

                                  BRITTA
                    I ll be there.  I m Britta.  Thank 
                    you so much, this is great. 

      Britta finishes paying for her food and walks away.  Jeff 
      turns to the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN at the cash register.

                                  JEFF
                      Technically, I am in college, so 
                    it s okay to use a college move, 
                    right? 

                                    ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                    Huh?

                                  JEFF
                    Sorry.  I was raised on TV, I think 
                    every black woman over fifty is a 
                    cosmic mentor with free advice.

                                    ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                    How about for two twenty five you 
                    can have your damn tacos. 

                                  JEFF
                    Yes ma am.

      Jeff gets out his wallet.

                                                                          FADE OUT.                                                                                      6.

                                            ACT I

                                                                            FADE IN:



      Psychology Professor DUNCAN [30s, low calibre hippy] is 
      working at his desk in a small office lined with plants, 
      books and weird art.  Jeff appears in his doorway.

                                  JEFF
                    You re a hard man to reach, 
                      Professor.

      Duncan takes a moment to place the face.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Jeff Crocker?  Attorney at law?

      He stands and shakes Jeff s hand.

                                  JEFF
                    You remember.

                                  DUNCAN
                    How could I forget?  I still can t 
                    figure out how you got a jury to 
                    connect September 11th with my DUI.  
                    Let alone why it helped.

                                  JEFF
                    2002 was a simpler time.

                                  DUNCAN
                    What s my lawyer doing on campus?

                                  JEFF
                    I m a student.

                                  DUNCAN
                    That can t be an inspiring journey.

      Duncan goes to a dorm-sized fridge and grabs two beers.

                                  JEFF
                    Eh, those ivy league twits on the 
                    state bar have had me under a 
                      microscope since I started.  
                    They ve suddenly decided that even 
                    though I have a law degree, my 
                    college degree isn t  legitimate.  

      Duncan hands Jeff one of the beers.                                                                                      7.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I thought you had a bachelor s from 
                    Columbia.

                                  JEFF
                    And now I have to get one from 
                    America.  They must have noticed 
                    the eagle in the seal was holding 
                    coffee branches.  I m dead in the 
                    water until I replace that degree. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    If you re in my class, I hope 
                    you re not going to ask for special 
                      treatment.  

                                  JEFF
                      Professor, please, I do have rules.  
                    I would never take psychology, it s 
                    boring.  But I was hoping that, as 
                      a teacher, you could get me all the 
                    quizzes, tests and exams for the 
                    classes I am taking this semester.

      Jeff places a sheet of paper on Duncan s desk.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Jeff, you just described - no, 
                    defined cheating.  Not only is it 
                    illegal, it s unethical.

      He takes a drink of his own beer.

                                  JEFF
                    Well, laws are tools.  We reshape 
                    them to suit the job.  And you 
                    seemed less concerned with ethics 
                    the day I convinced twelve of your 
                    peers that when you did a U turn on 
                    a freeway and tried to order 
                    chalupas from an emergency call 
                    box, your only real crime was being 
                    an American.   

                                  DUNCAN
                    You re saying I owe you.

                                  JEFF
                    I m not saying that.  I m giving 
                    you pieces of a puzzle, which, when 
                    put together, form a picture of you 
                    owing me.

      Duncan gets somber.  He surrenders.                                                                                      8.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I ll look into it. 

      Jeff heads for the door.

                                  JEFF
                    I ll be in the library at six, but 
                    by 6:20, my fake study group will 
                    not have shown up and I ll have to 
                    take a very hot girl to dinner.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Oh, Jeff.  Don t lie to women.

                                  JEFF
                          (doesn t care)
                    Whoops!

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jeff is seated at a big table, reading a Spanish text book.

                                  JEFF
                          (repeating)
                      Bienvenido.  Bienvenido.

      Britta walks in.  He smiles.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                      Bienvenido!  Have a seat.

      Jeff puts a notepad in front of her while she gets settled at 
      the room s large table.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    You can put your contact info on 
                    here.  I guess the group is running 
                    late, but we can get acquainted.

      She writes some stuff on the pad.

                                  BRITTA
                    You may have noticed this morning, 
                    I m not great at small talk.

                                  JEFF
                    I want to talk big.  I want to 
                    know, what s your deal?

                                  BRITTA
                    That s not small talk?                                                                                      9.

                                  JEFF
                    What s your deal and IS GOD DEAD?!

                                  BRITTA
                    Alright.  My deal.  I dropped out 
                    of high school to pursue my love of 
                    anarchy.  I made a lot of new 
                    friends vandalizing billboards, I 
                    helped coordinate us into a very 
                    large, successful movement of 
                    anarchist billboard vandals, and we 
                    decided I was the leader, which 
                    meant we had to kick me out, 
                    because we were anarchists.  Soon 
                    after, they became an advertising 
                    firm.  One of their shampoo 
                      billboards is across the street.

                                  JEFF
                    The one that says  hey, it s your 
                    hair, we just want to clean it? 

                                  BRITTA
                    Power to the people.  And you can 
                    go on Facebook and see photos of 
                    their children, who have names like 
                    Hemingway and Chomsky and who are 
                    seated in the backs of SUVs.  So I 
                    guess my deal is, be honest with me 
                    and I ll like you.  Because I may 
                    be broke and  crawling back to 
                    society  but I m doing it having 
                    learned that what s most important 
                    to me is honesty.

                                  JEFF
                          (concern)
                    Good thing to learn.

                                  BRITTA
                    What s most important to you?

                                  JEFF
                    I would say...honesty, because...
                          (surrender)
                    I would say anything to get what I 
                    want and I want you to like me.

                                  BRITTA
                    Very honest answer.  So you get 
                    your wish.  I like you fine.

      Jeff blinks.                                                                                    10.

                                  JEFF
                    Oh.

                                  BRITTA
                    Yeah, see how easy.  

                                  JEFF
                    That s it, huh?  No Looney Tunes 
                    character tattooed on your hip I 
                    have to pretend to love?  

                                  BRITTA
                    Not me.  Buy me dinner, don t lie 
                    to me and we ll be in bed before 
                    midnight.  

      The two of them chuckle at her joke.  

                                  JEFF
                    - All kidding aside, if you re 
                    hungry -

      Abed enters.  Britta looks as though she was expecting him.

                                  BRITTA
                    Abed s in the house!  Whoooo!

                                  JEFF
                          (good fake enthusiasm)
                    Whooooo, Abed!  Also whyyyyy?

                                  ABED
                    Britta invited me, is that cool?

                                  JEFF
                          (plastered smile)
                    I can t think of a single logical 
                    reason why not.  Have a seat.  And 
                    put your contact info here.

      Abed sits down to write on the notepad.

                                  ABED
                    Cool cool cool cool.   
                          (while writing)
                    Hey, this is kind of like Breakfast 
                    Club, huh?

                                  BRITTA
                          (supporting it)
                    We re in a library.  

      With great precision, Jeff reads Abed s cell number while 
      punching it into his own phone under the table.                                                                                    11.

                                  ABED
                    Well, yeah, and we re students, 
                    from different backgrounds, and I m 
                    sure we ve each got a thing, like 
                    an issue, all balled up inside of 
                    us that would make us cry if we 
                    talked about it.

      Jeff thumbs something into his phone.

                                  BRITTA
                    Do you have something balled up 
                    inside you want to talk about?

                                  ABED
                          (thinks about it)
                    Oh, I got a little doozy in the 
                    chamber I can let loose if things 
                    get emotional.

      Abed s phone beeps.  His reaction makes Jeff nervous.

                                  ABED (CONT D)
                    Whoa!  Text message.  Let s give 
                    this bad boy a read. 

      Abed picks up his phone.

                                  JEFF
                    I m sure it s personal -

                                  ABED
                    - No, I don t know this person.
                          (clears throat)
                     Say you have to pee I need to talk 
                    to you. 

      Jeff pretends to digest it along with the other two, all of 
      them exchanging confused looks.

                                  ABED (CONT D)
                     Say you have to pee? 

                                  BRITTA
                    Weird.

                                  JEFF
                    Yeah.  Creepy.

      Professor Duncan ducks his head into the room, sees Jeff, 
      then sees the others.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Jeffrey, a quick word?  About 
                      psychology?                                                                                    12.

                                  JEFF
                    I ll be right back.  When it s 
                    about psychology, it s urgent.

      Jeff heads for the door.

                                  BRITTA
                    What if the group shows up?

                                  JEFF
                    They ll know what to do.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jeff enters, feigning disappointment.

                                  JEFF
                    Well, I just found out that the 
                    rest of the group -

      Britta is not at the table, but Abed is, along with four new 
      students: Pierce, Shirley, Troy and Annie.  They look at him.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    - is here?

                                  ABED
                    Britta s in the bathroom, I think, 
                    and I invited more people from 
                    Spanish class, is that cool?

      Jeff raises a fist that immediately becomes a thumbs-up.

                                  JEFF
                    It s the coolest.  I should go to 
                    the bathroom, too.  And I should 
                    bring my jacket, keys and wallet in 
                    case there s a fire.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jeff is on his way to the exit doors.  He nearly collides 
      with Britta, who is entering the lobby.

                                  BRITTA
                    Ah.  Busted.  
                          (confiding)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    15.

                                  BRITTA (CONT'D)
                    I barely smoke.  But that group is 
                    getting big, made me skittish, I 
                    started craving a grit.

                                  JEFF
                    Same here.  I saw those faces and I 
                    just had to ...suck a ..leaf tube,  
                          (hail Mary)
                    Maybe you and I would get more 
                    studying done over -

      Britta laughs at the proposition.

                                  BRITTA
                    - Dinner?  Come on, we both know 
                    that s when the studying stops.  
                    Let s do this thing first. 

      She starts walking away, then adds:

                                  BRITTA (CONT D)
                    If it really turns out to be a 
                    train wreck, we ll slip out early.

      She walks away.  Jeff mulls this over.

                                  JEFF
                    Oh.  I can do a train wreck.

                                  OLD BLACK WOMAN (O.S.)
                    What a tangled web we weave.

      Jeff is startled to see the old black woman from the 
      cafeteria next to him in the lobby.  She s placing books on a 
      cart, unloading the overnight return bin.  

                                  JEFF
                    Don t you work in the cafeteria?

                                  OLD BLACK WOMAN
                    I have many jobs.  In many places.

      Jeff s jaw drops.  She rolls her eyes at him.

                                  OLD BLACK WOMAN (CONT D)
                    I m not magical, I m underpaid.  
                    You racist jackass.

                                  JEFF
                    Sorry. 

      Jeff heads back to the study room, ready for action.

                                                                          FADE OUT.                                                                                    16.

                                            ACT II

                                                                            FADE IN:



      Jeff settles into his chair at the head of the table.  He 
      looks around the room.  There s Britta, there s Abed, there s 
      Annie the type-A teen, Troy the meat head jock, Shirley the 
      closed-up ex-housewife and Pierce the weird old man with 
      neatly brushed grey hair and some kind of stone around his 
      neck he must have bought at a tarot card store.

                                  JEFF
                    Alllll right.  Look at this crew.  
                    Alllll ready to study alllll night. 

      Everyone concurs.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    But who studies with strangers, 
                    right?   We re all in the same 
                    class and we don t even know each 
                    other, my name is Jeff.

      Pierce speaks.  He talks kind of like George Takei.

                                  PIERCE
                    Jeff, it s a pleasure, my name is 
                    Pierce Hawthorne and yes, that is 
                    Hawthorne as in Hawthorne Wipes, 
                    the award winning moist towelette.

                                  JEFF
                    I was just going to ask.

                                  PIERCE
                    I m also a Rotarian and no stranger 
                    to public speaking so maybe I 
                    should make the introductions.  You 
                    already know Britter.  Brittles?  

                                  BRITTA
                    Britta.

                                  PIERCE
                    My apologies Britta, you also know 
                    A-bed, A-bed the A-reb, is that 
                      inappropriate?

                                  ABED
                          (as if asked to get ice)
                    Sure.                                                                                    17.

                                  PIERCE
                    We ve got Roy, Roy, the wonder boy 
                    I call him, -

                                  TROY
                    - Troy.

                                  PIERCE
                    You are correct, and little 
                    princess Elizabeth, -

                                  ANNIE
                    Annie.

                                  PIERCE
                    Very sorry, and finally this 
                    beautiful creature s name is 
                    Shirley.

                                  JEFF
                          (to Shirley)
                    Is that even close?

      Shirley nods.

                                  PIERCE
                    One does not forget Shirley, she is 
                    a very, very fascinating, very 
                    gorgeous young woman.

      Shirley does not appear to enjoy the flattery.  Jeff makes a 
      mental note.  Annie speaks up.

                                  ANNIE
                    I d like to know why I had to find 
                    out about this group on accident.

                                  ABED
                    Oh, this is getting way more like 
                    Breakfast Club, now.

                                  BRITTA
                    We should get started studying -

      Jeff goes into action, seeing an opening for his crowbar.

                                  JEFF
                    You know, I ve been part of a lot 
                    of study groups that fell apart 
                    because of unaddressed tension.  
                    Shouldn t someone address Annie s 
                    concern?  Did we not invite her?                                                                                    18.

                                    SHIRLEY
                    Well, Annie, sweetie, I guess it 
                    didn t occur to anyone -

                                  ANNIE
                    - That s strange, because I 
                    remember the first day of class, I 
                    asked if anyone was interested in 
                    starting a Spanish study group, and 
                    passed around a sign-up sheet, and 
                    when it came back, all that was on 
                    it was a drawing of a unicorn with 
                    a wiener instead of a horn, a 
                    guitar for a wiener and a dog 
                    emerging from its rear.

                                  BRITTA
                    That was a cat and he was going in.
                          (off her look)
                    What?  Everyone added something.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yes, and then gathered behind my 
                    back for a study group!  

                                    SHIRLEY
                    Pumpkin, it s not behind your back, 
                    we just didn t think about you.

                                  ANNIE
                    Can we stop with the pumpkins and 
                    the sweeties?  Being younger 
                    doesn t make me inferior, if 
                    anything, your age indicates you ve 
                    made bad life decisions.

                                    SHIRLEY
                          (simmering)
                    Mmmmmmmm.

                                  JEFF
                          (seizing opportunity)
                    Shirley has a response to that.

                                    SHIRLEY
                    No, I don t.

      The entire room encourages her to respond.

                                    SHIRLEY (CONT D)
                    Well, I m sure I ve made bad life 
                      decisions.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    19.

                                    SHIRLEY (CONT D)
                    I decided to spend twenty years 
                    raising children and cleaning up 
                    after a man who ran out the door 
                    ten minutes after winning one-oh-
                      two-point-seven thousand dollars in 
                    a radio contest.  That was a bad 
                    decision.  And maybe Annie s 
                    decisions will be better.  And I 
                    think she should decide whether she 
                    wants to be considered a child or 
                    an adult, because a child gets 
                    pity, but not respect, and adults 
                    can get respect but they can also 
                    get grabbed by the hair and have 
                    their faces put through jukeboxes.

                                  BRITTA
                          (blurting)
                      Seriously!

      Britta quickly composes herself.  Annie pouts.  Shirley 
      regains her shyness.  Pierce gives her head a supportive 
      stroke, causing her to wince.  Jeff points a pen at Pierce, 
      shifting to what he hopes is even more fertile ground for 
      sowing discontent.

                                  JEFF
                    Pierce, let s discuss this 
                      creepiness.

                                  PIERCE
                    I beg your pardon?

                                  JEFF
                    Are you unaware Shirley finds your 
                    advances inappropriate?

                                  PIERCE
                    What advances?

                                    SHIRLEY
                    You have been sexually harassing me 
                    since the first day of class!

                                  PIERCE
                     Sexually harassing?   That doesn t 
                    make sense, why would I  harass  
                    someone that turns me on?

                                  TROY
                    Saying she turns you on is the 
                      harrassment, buddy.

      Pierce slams the table with his fist.                                                                                    20.

                                  PIERCE
                    I am a business leader and a 
                    community pillar and I don t take  
                    courting advice from teenage boys!

                                  TROY
                    Well this teenage boy is a 
                      quarterback and a prom king, so 
                    maybe you should!

                                  ANNIE
                    You re not prom king anymore, Troy, 
                    this isn t Greendale High.

                                  TROY
                    How did you know I went there?

                                  ANNIE
                    Because you re wearing your stupid 
                    letter jacket and more importantly 
                    I SAT BEHIND YOU IN ALGEBRA!

                                  TROY
                    Wait, are you the girl that got 
                    hooked on pills and dropped out? 
                    You re Little Annie Adderall!

                                  ANNIE
                    And you re a stupid jock that lost 
                    his scholarship because he 
                      celebrated getting it with a keg 
                    stand and dislocated both 
                      shoulders!

                                  ABED
                    I m ready!  I m ready!

      Everyone looks at Abed.

                                  ABED (CONT D)
                    I bought one of those big binders 
                    to store my DVDs in.  And I left it 
                    in the sun, and the plastic sleeves 
                    melted to the discs, and they re 
                    all unplayable and it s my fault!

      Abed starts sobbing real tears.  Everyone watches, confused.

                                  JEFF
                    That s your Breakfast Club doozy?

                                  ABED
                          (through sobs)
                    I love cinema!                                                                                    21.

      Jeff s phone rings.  He answers.

                                  JEFF
                    Hello?

      A very low voice from the other end:

                                  DUNCAN (V.O.)
                          (on phone)
                    It s Professor Duncan.  Come to the 
                    parking lot.  Now.

                                  JEFF
                    What s wrong with your voice?

                                  DUNCAN (V.O.)
                          (on phone)
                    I m disguising it.

                                  JEFF
                    I ll be right there.

      Jeff hangs up.  

                                  BRITTA
                    Now where are you going?

                                  JEFF
                    It s an emergency.  You guys need 
                    to hash this stuff out anyway, 
                    because we can t study with all 
                    this stuff seething under the 
                    surface.  I just hope at least one 
                    of you is here when I get back.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jeff heads across the library toward the study room, carrying 
      Duncan s packet.  

      Britta opens the door and comes running to him.  We can hear 
      chaos coming from the room behind her.

                                  BRITTA
                    It s really bad in there.

                                  JEFF
                    Yeah, sounds like a train wreck.  
                    What do you say?  Time to go?

                                  BRITTA
                    Go?  Jeff, I would rather flunk 
                    Spanish and starve to death than 
                    abandon a group of people in pain.

      Jeff stares at her for a beat, then:

                                  JEFF
                    You thought I meant time to go to 
                    dinner?  I meant time to go give 
                    these people the healing they need.  
                    Time to spread the love, time to 
                    set everything back to exactly the 
                    way it was before they got here. 

      She gives his arm one of those platonic but lingering touches 
      that women have been using to secretly control civilization 
      for 50,000 years.  As she heads back to the room, Jeff adds 
      carefully:

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    Then dinner.

                                                                          FADE OUT.                                                                                    24.

                                            ACT III

                                                                            FADE IN:



      Jeff walks in.  Everyone is sitting with their arms folded, 
      staring at the table in front of them.

                                  JEFF
                    How s it going in here?

      Everyone explodes into furious name calling and arguing.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    Alright, alright.  Simmer down!  I 
                    want to tell you something!

      They quiet down.  He squares himself.  Closing argument time.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    You know what makes humans 
                    different from other animals?  We 
                    are the only species on Earth that 
                    observes Shark Week.  Sharks don t 
                    even have Shark Week, but we do.  
                    For the same reason I can pick up 
                    this pencil, tell you its name is 
                    Steve, then go like this
                          (snaps pencil)
                    And part of you dies just a little 
                    inside.  Because humans can connect 
                    to anything.  We can sympathize 
                    with a pencil, we can forgive a 
                    shark, we can give Ben Affleck an 
                    Academy Award for screenwriting.  

      Everyone nods knowingly, touched.  Britta, however, remains 
        poker-faced.  

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    People can find the good in just 
                    about anything but themselves.  
                    Look at me.  It s obvious to all of 
                    you that I m awesome, and yet, if I 
                    agreed with you, I would be an ass.  
                    But I can think Annie s awesome in 
                    ways that I m not.  She s driven.  
                    Some people have to be driven or 
                    the power goes off and the ice 
                    cream melts.  And look at Pierce.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    25.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    Other guys his age are locked up in 
                    their houses yelling at the people 
                    on TV for farting, this guy is out 
                    here, with us, even though he s 
                    earned the right to dismiss us. 
                    Just like Shirley s earned a little 
                    elbow room, and a lot of respect, 
                    not as a wife, not as a mother, 
                    it s time for her to be a woman, 
                    and don t test her on that, because 
                    that thing about the jukebox was 
                    way too specific to be improvised, 
                    we want her on our side when we 
                    rumble with the other study groups. 

      The group murmurs in enthusiastic agreement.  Troy nods at 
      Shirley.  Shirley smiles.   

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    You want Troy, too.  That s why 
                    we re tempted to dis the jacket, 
                    because it s a symbol that 
                      intimidates us, you think 
                      astronauts go to the moon because 
                    they hate oxygen, come on, they re 
                    trying to impress their high 
                    school s prom king, and well they 
                    should, because I saw our track 
                    team tonight and I m pretty sure 
                    Troy s gonna be a big dog on 
                    campus.  And Abed.  You know, God 
                    made people with minds that wander 
                    because the answers we need are 
                    barely ever the ones we re asking.  
                    Abed s a shaman, ask him to pass 
                    the salt, you get a bowl of soup, 
                    and guess what, soup is better.  
                    Abed is better.
                          (beat)
                    You re all better than you think 
                    you are.  You re just not designed 
                    to believe it when you hear it from 
                    yourself.  So everybody, do me a 
                    favor, look to the person on the 
                    left.

      Everybody does it.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    I want you to extend to that person 
                    the same compassion you extend to 
                    sharks, pencils and Ben Affleck.  I 
                    want you to say to that person,  I 
                    forgive you.   Go ahead.                                                                                    26.

      Everyone says  I forgive you. 

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    Now look at me.

      Everyone looks at Jeff.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    You just stopped being a study 
                    group.  You have now become 
                    something unstoppable.  I hereby 
                    pronounce you a community.      

      Abed wipes at some tears.

                                  ABED
                    It s not like Breakfast Club 
                    anymore.  Now it s like Stripes, or 
                      Meatballs.  Anything with Bill 
                    Murray, really.  

                                  JEFF
                    I agree with Abed that tonight has 
                    been very special.  Too special for 
                    Spanish, really, and I think that, 
                    like the Breakfast Club, we ought 
                    to disband and reflect.

      Jeff looks at Britta and nods his head slightly toward the 
      door, like,  let s go.   

      Britta looks at Jeff.  She looks around the room at all the 
      mesmerized faces.  Finally, she announces her decision while 
      watching Jeff carefully. 

                                  BRITTA
                    Actually, now that we re 
                      unstoppable, it ll probably take no 
                    time at all to prepare for this 
                    quiz, right? 

      Everyone agrees with that.  They re very excited about 
      studying, now.  Jeff goes to plan C.

                                  JEFF
                    I have a surprise for you guys.  We 
                    don t need to study.  I have all 
                    the tests and answers for the 
                    semester.  

      Jeff shows the packet he got from Duncan.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    So.  All done.                                                                                    27.

      Everyone at the table is a bit taken aback.  Britta narrows 
      her eyes on him.  Pierce puzzles through this.

                                  PIERCE
                    Well, Jeff, now, why in Hell s 
                    Bells would you want to enroll in a 
                    community college to cheat?

                                  JEFF
                    I didn t want to enroll here, 
                    Pierce, I have to be here.  I m a 
                    lawyer.  I mean, I was a lawyer, 
                    and I d like to get back to being 
                    one as soon as possible. 

                                  BRITTA
                          (gross)
                      A lawyer...

                                  TROY
                    Then why have a study group?

                                  JEFF
                    I DON T HAVE A STUDY GROUP!  YOU 
                    PEOPLE JUST SHOWED UP!

      Britta explains something to everyone she d been putting 
      together for a while.

                                  BRITTA
                    It was all to get in my pants.

                                  JEFF
                    Why can t you see that for the 
                      compliment that it is?

                                  ANNIE
                    What about the look left speech?  
                    Was that real?

                                  JEFF
                    I learned it at tennis camp when I 
                    was seven.

      Everyone is dismayed and disappointed.

                                  JEFF (CONT D)
                    I added the Ben Affleck references!

                                  BRITTA
                    Jeff, you had me at  I m a lawyer,  
                    and by had me, I mean had me ready 
                    to puke.  Now please leave and let 
                    us study before my gag reflex hits 
                    a tipping point.                                                                                    28.

                                  JEFF
                    But you re not listening, I have 
                    the answers.  

      Britta physically gags.

      Abed shakes his head.

                                  ABED
                    I thought you were like Bill Murray 
                    in any of his films.  But you re 
                    really like Michael Douglas in any 
                    of his.

                                  JEFF
                    Yeah, well, you have Asperger s.

      As Jeff exits, everyone recoils in shock and comforts a 
      confused Abed.

                                  BRITTA
                    He is not qualified to make that 
                      diagnosis.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Professor Duncan is enjoying a pipe in his office and seems 
      to have been expecting Jeff to burst through the door, which 
      Jeff now does.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Before you react, you ll want to 
                    think about the gift you ve been 
                    given.

                                  JEFF
                    An excuse to punch a hippy?                                                                                    29.

                                  DUNCAN
                    A second chance at an honest life.  
                    A life that starts here at 
                      Greendale.  All these tricks you 
                    acquired to survive out there, they 
                    have no use in this place that 
                    you re wiping your feet on.  People 
                    here are excited and proud to be 
                    here, students and faculty alike.  
                    And frankly, we re a little 
                    offended by the implication that 
                    there s anywhere else we d like to 
                    be.  This is a lesson you need to 
                    learn, Jeff.  

      Jeff shrugs.

                                  JEFF
                    Well, I m...I m sorry, but I m not 
                    getting it.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Maybe you re incapable of learning.

                                  JEFF
                    Is it possible you re incapable of  
                    teaching?  It is community college.  
                    Now give me my keys or it s going 
                    to get sloppy.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
