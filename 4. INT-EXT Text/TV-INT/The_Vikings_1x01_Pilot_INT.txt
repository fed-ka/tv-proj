    Winter. The embers of the fire still glow in the centre of 
  the floor. We are close again on the baby s face...as he 
    sleeps in the crook of Ragnar s arm.

    Ragnar is awake, staring up into the darkness and the play of 
    shadows across the rafters, a look of profound awe upon his 
  face.



    Lagertha plays with her two CHILDREN. Her son BJORN is about 
  ten and daughter GYDA about eight years old.

    Ragnar appears, gestures to her.

                                RAGNAR
                  Come.

    Ragnar leads Lagertha into the main room.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Here is the man I told you of, 
                  Lagertha.

  He indicates the figure standing beside the fire: a tall MAN 
  of uncertain age, his craggy face heavily lined, his hair and 
    beard both long and matted, as if his journey has been long 
  and arduous.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Welcome, stranger, to our house.

  The strange man bows a little. Lagertha pours a drink of 
    sweet, strong mead and hands it to him. The stranger empties 
  the cup.                                                                                  6.



                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                  Sit by the fire, warm yourself.

  The stranger nods again, and sits, Ragnar and Lagertha doing 
    likewise.

                                RAGNAR
                  This man is a wanderer. He has been 
                  on a boat that travelled to the 
                  west.

    This is clearly a shock to Lagertha. She stares at the man.

                                LAGERTHA
                Is it true?

  Once more the stranger nods, but does not reply. Lagertha 
    suddenly realizes that he is glancing towards his cup, and 
  she quickly re-fills it.

  And once more he empties it, then belches, and wipes his hand 
  over his mouth.

                                WANDERER
                  We sailed north up the coast, to 
                  the rock formation which looks like 
                a skull. And then, when we were out 
                  in the open sea, we turned due 
                  west. And I was frightened.

                                LAGERTHA
                  What happened to you? Where did you 
                  get to?

    Behind her, we see Bjorn and Gyda peeking into the room, and 
    listening.

                                WANDERER
                  After two days and nights we saw 
                  land. Someone said it was a land 
                  called England, for they had been 
                  there before. But I don t know if 
                  it s true. I was only told that in 
                  this land there was great treasure. 
                  We went ashore, found a big house 
                  there, and took some things from 
                  it.

    From his bundle of discarded furs he retrieves an object: a 
    small but very beautiful ivory crucifix.                                                                                  7.



                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                In England, they worship a strange 
                  god called Jesus Christ. They say 
                he died in a tree.

                                RAGNAR
                  Like Odin. Only Odin came back to 
                  life.

    Lagertha examines the glittering prize.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Tell us how you crossed the open 
                  ocean - once you lost sight of 
                  land? How did you know you were 
                  sailing west, not north or south?

                                WANDERER
                  We had a board. It belonged to a 
                  Swede.

                                LAGERTHA
                A board? What kind of board...?

                                WANDERER
                A sun-shadow board. Here is one.

    Again he reaches into the thick pile of animal furs and this 
    time produces a  solskuggerfol  board. It is a smallish 
    wooden board with a pin or gnomon in the centre (which can be 
    adjusted up or down) and with circles drawn around the pin.

                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                To show you how it works, I need to 
                  float it in a tub of water.

    Ragnar goes off to fetch one.

  Once more the wanderer looks at his empty cup, and once more 
    Lagertha re-fills it.

  And once more he empties the cup in one gulp. Outside the 
    wind blasts against the house and makes the candles inside 
    flutter and almost gutter.

    Ragnar returns with the tub of water and the wanderer places 
  the board in the water, where it floats.

  Then he takes a candle.

                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                  This candle is the sun.                                                                                  8.



  He holds the candle over the board.

                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                  Each day the sun rises, and climbs 
                in the sky until noon.
                      (he arcs the candle across 
                        the board - the shadow 
                          shortens)
                  See how the shadow shortens. At 
                  noon it will be at its shortest as 
                  the sun is at its zenith.

                                RAGNAR
                  But this only tells me how far 
                  south I have travelled -

                                WANDERER
                  Now listen. The day before you 
                  sail, mark a circle around the 
                  pointer on the board at the place 
                  where the shadow is shortest at 
                  noon. The next day at sea, place 
                  the board in water again around 
                  noon and watch for the shadow. If 
                it only touches the circle, your 
                  course remains true. If the shadow 
                  passes outside the circle, like 
                  this, you have drifted and must 
                  steer further south. If the shadow 
                  never reaches the circle you are to 
                  the south and must steer more 
                  north. Keep the noon shadow on the 
                  circle and your course will be 
                  true.

    Ragnar and Lagertha stare at the board and the shadow as it 
    moves across it.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Is it really true, wanderer, that 
                  you crossed the ocean using only 
                  this...this children s toy?

                                WANDERER
                  Yes, I swear to you. I swear on my 
                  sacred ring. Of course, we also 
                  used ravens to show how far we 
                  might be from land, but the board 
                  took us across the open sea.

                                LAGERTHA
                I cannot believe it.                                                                                  9.



    Ragnar looks at her.

                                RAGNAR
                  But if it s true, Lagertha, just 
                  imagine! In just two days and 
                  nights we can reach the coast of 
                  England. We can find out for 
                  ourselves if what people have said 
                  is there really is there: rich 
                  lands, buildings made of stone, 
                  places filled with treasures. Don t 
                  you want to go and find out? I do.

  A long beat.

    Lagertha looks at the board, then at the wanderer.

  Then she blows out the candle, plunging the board into 
    darkness.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Why did you do that?

                                LAGERTHA
                  Because there is something I want 
                  to know. I want to know what 
                  happens if there is no sun? How can 
                  the board help you then? How can 
                  you find your way.

                                WANDERER
                  You use this.

  He holds something out in his hand, but they can t see what 
  it is. Ragnar brings another candle closer - and it shines 
    upon a piece of semi-transluscent rock (actually a form of 
    calcite).

                                RAGNAR
                  What s that?

                                WANDERER
                A sunstone.

                                LAGERTHA
                  What good is it?

  The wanderer smiles.

                                WANDERER
                  I ll show you. Come outside.

    Ragnar leads them outside.                                                                                  10.





    Lagertha, carrying the bucket inside, finds Ragnar putting a 
  thick woollen coat over the shoulders of his son, BJORN, now 
    twelve years old, and a handsome, strong-looking youth.

    Lagertha stops and looks at them.

                                LAGERTHA
                  What are you two doing?

                                RAGNAR
                  I m taking Bjorn to the Thing.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Not yet. He s not old enough.

                                RAGNAR
                  He s twelve years old. 

                                LAGERTHA
                  Take him next year. Next year is 
                  soon enough.

    Ragnar smiles at her.

                                RAGNAR
                  He ll need a silk ribbon.



    BJORN  spies  on his mother as Lagertha washes her long 
    blonde hair in the tub of water. The water seems to flow in 
    slow motion from the ends of her hair like mercury as she 
    kneels over the tub.

  His eyes are full of love for her.

                                BJORN
                        (quietly)
                  Mother.

    Lagertha looks up, flicks back her hair so she can see him, 
  and smiles tenderly.



    Ragnar and Lagertha in bed together, cradled close after love-
    making. She stares into his eyes.                                                                                  12.



                                LAGERTHA
                  Don t sleep with too many women in 
                  Kattegat.

                                RAGNAR
                  Are you crazy? I won t sleep with 
                  any of them. I don t want to. I can 
                do without it for a few weeks.

                                LAGERTHA
                Is that another way of saying you 
                  love me?

  She teases him.

                                RAGNAR
                I always dream of you. Last night I 
                  dreamt you were feeding me blood 
                  pudding.

                                LAGERTHA
                  What does that mean?

                                RAGNAR
                  It means you were giving me your 
                  heart.

  And they close in, and kiss passionately.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                I love you so much I could feed you 
                  the whole sky.



  A long gloomy room, with a fire in the centre and benches 
    arranged on either side.

  The men drink ale from horned cups. Rollo watches Bjorn sip 
  from his horn, and laughs.

                                ROLLO
                  You won t get drunk like that.

    Bjorn smiles uneasily, then tips back the horn and drinks 
    deeply.

                                ROLLO (CONT D)
                  Are you ready for a woman? There 
                  are some good-looking women in 
                  Kattegat. And they re free.

                                RAGNAR
                  Of course he isn t. He can t even 
                  grow a beard.

    Rollo laughs again, empties his horn, and holds it out to be 
    refilled by a WOMAN with a jug. He stares at her wolfishly.

                                ROLLO
                  So - where do you think he ll send 
                  us this year?

                                RAGNAR
                  Probably to the Eastlands again - 
                  the same as last year. The same as 
                  always.

                                ROLLO
                  Those bastards up there are as poor 
                  as we are. What do they have left 
                  to give us?

                                RAGNAR
                  Only themselves.

  A beat. He glances round, lowers his voice.                                                                                  18.



                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                We should go west. I ve heard such 
                  tales, Rollo. Great towns, cities 
                  and treasures; hordes of gold and 
                  silver. And a new god.

                                ROLLO
                  I ve heard those stories too. But 
                  what does it mean?
                We can t sail across an open ocean.

  A beat. Ragnar glances carefully at Bjorn, who has fallen 
    asleep on his thigh. Lowers his voice again, despite the 
  loud, drunken voices around him.

                                RAGNAR
                  We can. I believe there s a way.

    Rollo looks at him.

    Then Ragnar picks up his son.

                                ROLLO
                  Where are you going?

                                RAGNAR
                  To sleep.

                                ROLLO
                I don t understand you, Ragnar 
                  Lothbrok, everyone else comes here 
                  to get drunk in the company of good 
                  friends and to fuck beautiful 
                  women.

    Ragnar smiles.

                                RAGNAR
                  I ll see you in the Great Hall.

  He carries his son away.



    Outside, a cold wind whips across the waters of the fjord. 
    Lagertha settles her daughter to sleep, telling her a story.

                                LAGERTHA
                  The giantess opened her rotting 
                  cavernous mouth and yawned.  Go 
                  away!  She said.  I want to sleep 
                  again. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  19.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT'D)
                  I m not doing you any more favors.  
                  She gave Freya a withering look. 
                   My noble goddess, she said,  you 
                  leap around at night like Heidrun 
                  cavorting with a herd of goats. 

  Gyda, warm beneath a bear skin, smiles sleepily.

  A beat.

                                GYDA
                  Go on!

                                LAGERTHA
                  Freya slowly raised her arms - like 
                  this!
                        (raises her own arms)
                   I will girdle you with flame so 
                  you cannot leave this place without 
                  catching fire.  Hyndla laughed. 
                   You ve gone running to Od, who 
                  always loved you; and many another 
                  has wormed his way under your 
                  apron. 

  She pauses, checks the girl again...whose eyes are now 
    closed. She is nearly asleep.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                        (more quietly)
                  There was fire in Asgard, dancing 
                  in the air. A band of flame, a 
                  quivering halo, surrounded the 
                  giantess. Her limbs tightened; she 
                  pressed her arms against her side.  
                  Flames about me,  she cried.  The 
                  earth is on fire, and I must pay 
                  the full price or forfeit my life. 

  She stops, listens for a moment to the sound of her 
    daughter s easy breathing. Then leans down, kisses her 
    forehead, and pulls the bear skin up to her neck.

    Lagertha moves through to the other chamber. The fire (in the 
    centre of the room) is dying down. But its flickering flames 
    illuminate the war shields hung from hooks on the wall. She 
    stares at them - and then unhooks one, and holds it to 
    herself...as if remembering all the times she used it, in the 
    heat of battle. 

  Now she stands proud with it, in the empty room, with only 
  the crackling of the logs and the moaning of the wind.                                                                                  20.





  A large and impressive chamber with a lattice of high beams 
  and some wall coverings. It s crowded. On a raised dais at 
  one end, sat on a carved chair, is EARL HARALDSON, late 
    forties and still a formidable-looking warrior, dressed in 
    wide trousers and fur-trimmed coat. The Earl is flanked by 
  some of his HOUSECARLS - his private, elite bodyguard - by 
    SLAVES and several (mostly male) members of his FAMILY. His 
    striking WIFE wears a sleeveless dress which reaches to the 
    ground, and over it a sleeveless cape which is thrown back, 
    revealing the whiteness of her arms. She is adorned with 
    necklaces and oval brooches.

    Filling the rest of the hall, and obliged to stand, are 
    FREEMEN like Ragnar and Rollo.

  In the small space between them a rather pathetic FIGURE is 
    standing, shifting from one foot to the other, his eyes 
    downcast. He s almost a figure of fun and everyone is 
    grinning at him.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Olaf Anwend...

                                OLAF
                  Yes, sir.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  You have pleaded guilty to the 
                  charge of stealing. Tomorrow you 
                  will run a gauntlet of stones and 
                  turf as punishment.

                                OLAF
                  Yes, lord. Thank you, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Don t thank me. And let it be known 
                  that a fine is to be paid by anyone 
                  who fails to throw something.

    There s laughter - as Olaf is led away. Bjorn tries his best 
  to peer through the men blocking his view of events.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Bring in the next accused.

  Bjorn actually catches a glimpse of the YOUNG MAN brought 
  into the hall in chains by the housecarls. The young man has 
  a pleasant expression, keeps his head high and does not avert 
  his eyes.                                                                                  21.



                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Eric Trygvasson, you are accused of 
                  the murder of Sigvald Strut this 
                  January. How do you plead?

                                TRYGVASSON
                It wasn t murder, lord. I killed 
                  him in self-defence. It was he who 
                  attacked me.

                                WOMAN
                        (shouting)
                  LIAR!

  The WOMAN is part of the dead man s family, standing in a 
  group close to the defendant.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  If it wasn t murder, why did you 
                  not declare your crime to the first 
                  person you met afterwards, as the 
                  law obliges? In fact, you passed by 
                  several houses before you reported 
                  it.

    Trygvasson looks over at the woman and the dead man s family.

                                TRYGVASSON
                  I...I thought the relatives of the 
                  dead man might be living in them.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  The law allows you to pass two 
                  houses in such circumstances - but 
                  never a third.

                                FAMILY MEMBER
                  You felt guilty. You went to his 
                  house and murdered my brother in 
                  cold blood.

  Fresh uproar. Bjorn struggles to keep an eye-line on the 
    accused. Ragnar notices, lifts him up.

                                  TRYGVASSON
                  It s not true. We argued about some 
                  land. He pulled out a knife...

                                WOMAN
                  You re lying! You wanted that land 
                  for yourself. You re a liar and a 
                  coward.                                                                                  22.



                                TRYGVASSON
                  Who says I m a coward? I m no 
                  coward.

  More people join in the shouting. The Earl bangs his fist on 
  the table.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Silence! All of you - show some 
                  respect.

    They fall silent. Earl Haraldson looks at Trygvasson.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                As the normal procedures were not 
                  followed, this killing cannot be 
                  atoned for by compensating the 
                  victim s family.

  The family shout their approval, raise their fists 
    aggressively towards the defendant.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Murder is a dishonorable act among 
                  our people, Eric Trygvasson, 
                  committed in secret, unacknowledged 
                  and very likely to set in train a 
                  cycle of revenge killings, which 
                  would also involve your own family.

  He looks up at the assembly.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                I ask all of you how you find the 
                  accused. If you think him guilty, 
                  raise your arms. Your decision must 
                  be unanimous.

    Quickly, everyone raises their hands. But the Earl hesitates, 
  for someone has not. Ragnar realizes who it is and squeezes 
    Bjorn s thigh. Bjorn raises his hand.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Eric Trygvasson, you have been 
                  found guilty of murder. How would 
                  you like to die?

  A beat. Trygvasson looks round the room in that same cool 
    way, as if he was above it all.

                                  TRYGVASSON
                  By beheading, lord.                                                                                  23.



                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Granted. Your execution will take 
                  place tomorrow. And afterwards we 
                  shall feast and discuss the summer 
                  raids.



  A secret, turf-covered shed close by the edge of the water.

    Gloomy - but slightly  religious  in the way the space is lit 
  by tallow candles. 

    Watched by Ragnar and Bjorn, Floki uncovers the skeleton of a 
  a new boat. It s still in a rudimentary shape, its spars 
    naked. Even so, Ragnar is immediately entranced.

                                FLOKI
                  What do you think, Ragnar Lothrok?

                                RAGNAR
                  It s bigger! The hull s deeper.                                                                                  29.



                                FLOKI
                  Yes, but it will be lighter and 
                  faster than before, and carry a 
                  much bigger sail. The construction 
                is different. It s built with a 
                  strong central plank. The two 
                  strakes above it are nailed 
                  directly onto the knees of the 
                  frames. But the ones below - look! - 
                  are cleated and lashed onto the 
                  frames, not nailed, so they can 
                  move in relation to each other. 
                  This means the boat will not butt 
                  against the waves like a goat, but 
                  move over them like a ripple.

    Ragnar continues to study the boat.

    Meanwhile, Bjorn studies Floki s tools with all the 
    fascination they exert upon a young boy s mind. Planes, spoon-
    shaped bores, small axes and rivets. And then, almost with a 
    shock, he sees the small, strange figure hunched in the 
    shadows, wearing a conical hat and grinning. It s a wooden 
    statue of the god Loki and the grin is not pleasant, but 
    wicked and somehow disturbing.

    Bjorn moves quickly away.

                                RAGNAR
                  Why have you cut the oarports into 
                  the sheerstrake?

                                FLOKI
                  It makes it easier to row, and the 
                  ports can be closed when the boat 
                  is at sea. 

                                RAGNAR
                  You think this boat could handle 
                  long sea voyages?

                                FLOKI
                  That s why I built it.

                                RAGNAR
                  And it will be strong enough?

    Floki shrugs.

                                FLOKI
                  We won t know that until we try. 

    Ragnar looks at him.                                                                                  30.



                                RAGNAR
                  When will it be ready?

                                FLOKI
                  Ah, as to that...

                                RAGNAR
                  What?

                                FLOKI
                  We re out of money. We have to pay 
                  for the sail...and then the anchor. 
                  You know what those blacksmiths are 
                  like! Such greedy bastards.

  A beat. Ragnar reluctantly brings out a leather pouch.

                                RAGNAR
                  This is almost all I have left from 
                  last summer s raids.

  Floki takes the pouch, with a grin.

                                FLOKI
                  Don t worry, Ragnar Lothbrok. We ll 
                  soon be as rich as dwarves!

  And he laughs.



  Great trestles have been set up and the freemen sit around 
  them, drinking and ready to feast. Music is playing. Earl 
    Haraldson, with his wife and family members, sits at high 
    table.

  There is much laughter in the hall. Then a horn is sounded - 
  for silence.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Before we feast, we have an 
                  important ceremony to perform. Two 
                  young men have joined us for the 
                  first time and must receive their 
                  arm-rings.  Olaf the son of Ingolf 
                  and Bjorn son of Ragnar Lothbrok. 
                  Both of you come up here.

    Bjorn and the other YOUNG MAN approach the high table. The 
    Earl walks round to the front of the dais...and draws his 
    sword.                                                                                  31.



                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  Kneel.

  They both kneel. A housecarl slips two ornate bracelets of 
    twisted silver, the clasps fashioned as animal heads, onto 
  the blade. Earl Haraldson holds the blade close to the young 
    men s faces.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT D)
                  These rings symbolize your coming 
                  of age - and they also bind you in 
                  loyalty to me, your chieftan. Any 
                  oath you swear upon your ring, you 
                  must honor and keep, or else lose 
                  your honor. Do you understand and 
                  do you swear so?

                                BOYS
                  Yes, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  And you freely recognize your 
                  fealty to me?

                                BOYS
                  Yes, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Then take your rings.

  The boys take their rings from the point of the sword and 
    clasp them around their arms. Ragnar looks on proudly. Then 
    sees that Haraldson is staring at him. 

  But the moment is lost as the freemen shout out their 
    approval, banging their fists on the tables as the boys 
    return, embarrassed but delighted, to their seats.

                                RAGNAR
                  Let me look! Ah - it s a fine ring. 
                  Never lose it, my son, or something 
                  dreadful will happen to you.

                                BJORN
                I won t father.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Now let s feast.

    Ragnar suddenly stands up.                                                                                  32.



                                RAGNAR
                My lord...we all want to feast: but 
                  we also want to know where we will 
                be raiding this summer.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Can t it wait?

                                ROLLO
                  No, tell us. We re anxious to know. 
                We have a right to know.

  A beat. The hall has fallen silent.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Very well. Then we shall go raiding 
                  to the east again, into the 
                  Eastlands, into Rus...

                                RAGNAR
                  Every year we do the same thing. We 
                  raid people who have nothing more 
                  than we have. We have a hard life, 
                  and they have a hard life - but we 
                  take from them even the few things 
                  which they have. But, lord, we have 
                  an alternative...a choice...another 
                  journey...

    There is a groundswell of noise...of some disagreement. The 
    Earl is alive to it.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Oh yes, I too have heard the 
                  rumors. I hear that if we sail 
                  west, across the open, fathomless 
                  ocean, we shall somehow come to 
                  lands far richer and more 
                  plentiful. Yes, I have heard those 
                  stories. But I tell you now that I 
                  will not risk my ships or my 
                  reputation on wild, speculative and 
                  unrealistic visions.
                        (beat)
                I pay for the ships. Therefore they 
                  go where I tell them to go, and 
                  that is the end of the matter.
                        (beat)
                  Now let s feast.

  He claps his hands...and the feast is brought in.

    Ragnar looks at Rollo, who shrugs.                                                                                  33.



  Then a HOUSECARL approaches their table. The housecarl has a 
  livid scar which runs from the corner of his mouth up his 
  cheek to his eye.

                                HOUSECARL
                  Ragnar Lothbrok, Earl Haraldson 
                  wants to speak with you in private.

    Ragnar nods, glances reassuringly at Bjorn, follows the 
    housecarl behind the dais, into a small chamber.



    Haraldson is flanked by several of his heavily-armed 
    HOUSECARLS. It s an intimidating atmosphere.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Ragnar Lothbrok...

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Are you hungry?

  A beat.

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes, lord.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  You want to feast in my hall? You 
                  want to sail in my ship? What else 
                  do you want of me?

                                RAGNAR
                  Lord, I -

    Haraldson slams his fist onto the table. The housecarls close 
    around him.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                I know you question my rule. I know 
                  you have big ideas. But you should 
                  keep them to yourself, Ragnar 
                  Lothbrok. What are you? You re a 
                  farmer. Remember that. You re just 
                a lowly farmer. And you owe 
                  obedience and rent to me.
                        (beat)
                I warn you. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  34.

                                EARL HARALDSON (CONT'D)
                If you dare to stick your nose in 
                  my face, I will kill you.

  He stares at Ragnar.

                                                                          CUT TO:





  A few low tallow candles, otherwise darkness. The shapes of 
    things.

  A long beat.

                                BJORN
                  I m frightened.

    Ragnar grasps his wrist. Then there s the sound of a voice, 
    ancient, unsexed.

                                VOICE
                  Why don t you come in? I m waiting.

    Ragnar encourages his son to push aside the curtained wall, 
  and go inside.                                                                                  35.



  The ANCIENT SEER is sitting in the dark. An old man or woman, 
    with withered dugs, sightless, white-eyed. Probably an old 
    woman, it s actually impossible to tell. But there s a 
    strange and powerful aura about the figure which makes Bjorn 
    instinctively recoil. Before her is a bowl of dried brown 
    shrivelled mushrooms. She reaches out gnarled fingers and 
  chews one.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  What do you want?

                                RAGNAR
                I want to know what the gods have 
                in store. 

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  For you - or for your son?

                                RAGNAR
                  I m more interested in myself.

  The ancient hag chuckles.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  The gods desire you to have a great 
                  future. I see that. But they can 
                  withdraw their goodwill at any 
                  time. 

                                RAGNAR
                  To have this great future, must I 
                  challenge the law?

    This seems to be the nub of it. There s a pause. The ancient 
  one reaches out and touches his face and her sightless eyes 
    peer into his.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  It is always possible for a man to 
                  shape his own fate. You must 
                  convince the gods to alter the 
                  runes, so they work in your favor. 
                  But the laws of men are  far below 
                  the workings and shapings of the 
                  gods.

                                RAGNAR
                  So I should take the law of men 
                  into my own hands?

    Silence.                                                                                  36.



                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  You won t answer me!

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  You already have your answer. 

                                RAGNAR
                No I don t. I don t have the real 
                  answer.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  Then go and ask the gods 
                  themselves. What are you afraid of?

  Looks at her.

                                RAGNAR
                        (quietly)
                  Who is not afraid of the gods?

  The old hag grins. Looks sightlessly at Bjorn.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                I say only this to you: beware of 
                  your sons.

                                RAGNAR
                  My sons? I have only one son.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                I see more.

                                RAGNAR
                  Why should I beware of them?

  The ancient stares at Ragnar again with her white, blind eyes 
  - and will not answer. Turns instead and stares, sightlessly, 
  at Bjorn, who is afraid of her, looks away.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  Look at me, child.

    Bjorn steels himself to look back at her.

    After a few moments, she nods.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN (CONT D)
                I think your son is ready. Take him 
                  up to the temple. Let him also see 
                  the gods and, if he wishes, speak 
                  to them. That s all I can tell you.                                                                                  37.



                                RAGNAR
                  You haven t helped me at all, old 
                  woman.

  A long beat.

                                ANCIENT WOMAN
                  Perhaps you asked the wrong 
                  questions. In any case, sometimes 
                  you should not try to forsee your 
                  fate, for it is best not to know 
                  it.



  The young men feel frisky, cocky. They laugh, nudge each 
    other.

                                SECOND YOUNG MAN
                  Where s your softest bed?

  A beat.

                                LAGERTHA
                  In here.

  She leads them into the shield room. Springing forward, she 
    snatches a shield from the wall. 

    They take the axes from their belts.

                                FIRST YOUNG MAN
                  We don t want to kill you, woman.

                                LAGERTHA
                  You couldn t kill me if you tried 
                  for a hundred years.

  She swoops into a secret place, and pulls out a sword. 

  Now she is a shield-maiden again. Her eyes have hardened. She 
  is changed.

  For the first time, the two young men are not so sure.

                                SECOND YOUNG MAN
                  Before you try anything, think 
                  about your daughter.

                                LAGERTHA
                I am thinking about my daughter. 
                  Now you will leave my house or I 
                  will gut you like fish and cook 
                  your entrails.

  She attacks them with frightening speed. No sooner has the 
    first young man raised his axe than she has sheared off the 
    handle with her blade. She slashes at the second young man - 
    once, ripping his clothes open, and a second time slashing 
  the side of his face.

  He screams. His blood splashes on the floor.                                                                                  41.



    Lagertha fixes her attentions on the first, now unarmed young 
    man...who loses his nerve and bolts for it. His companion, 
    bleeding copiously, bolts after him.

    Lagertha takes a moment to compose herself - then hurries 
    outside.



  Gyda is hiding among the goats. Lagertha takes her into her 
  arms.

                                GYDA
                  Have they gone?

                                LAGERTHA
                  Yes, they ve gone.

                                GYDA
                  What did they want?

                                LAGERTHA
                  They were travellers. They were 
                  thirsty, that s all.
                        (beat)
                  Shall we go on milking the goats?



  The golden glow from the roof generates a strange, almost 
    unearthly light. There s a water-source somewhere...for the 
  sound of water running and splashing fills the great domed 
    space.

  The space is dominated by three huge wooden statues, several 
    metres high, made of highly polished wood. But the priest 
  first takes them over to the stone altar on which there is a 
    sacred Viking ring, a wooden bowl filled with blood and a 
  twig.

    Ragnar kneels by the altar and Bjorn follows his example. The 
    priest dips the twig into the blood of a sacrificed animal 
  and shakes it over them, sprinkling them with blood.

                                PRIEST
                        (sing-song)
                  Hail to the Aesir! Hail to the 
                  goddesses! Hail to the mighty, 
                  fecund earth. Wit and wisdom may 
                  you give us, and healing hands 
                  while we live!

  They move towards the statues, Ragnar once more sinking to 
  his knees and making his obeisance.

  Bjorn looks confused and over-awed. But the priest, with a 
    smile, gently guides him closer.

                                PRIEST (CONT D)
                My son, you have travelled a long 
                  way, but now at last you are face 
                to face with our gods.

  He draws Bjorn gently towards the first statue: of a massive, 
    muscle-bound, bearded, earthy-looking figure holding aloft 
  his mighty hammer.

                                PRIEST (CONT D)
                  This is Thor. You know him, of 
                  course. You hear him in the 
                  thunder, when he races across the 
                  clouds with his goats. He protects 
                  all of us. And when he goes forth 
                  with his hammer, Mjollni, in his 
                  hand, he is irresistible.                                                                                  44.



  CLOSE ON: Thor s sculpted face, his exaggerated features, 
    peasant-like, wide-mouth, bulbous nose - rather comic-book.

  The priest draws Bjorn towards the second statue: a figure 
    with a disproportionately huge and erect phallus.

                                PRIEST (CONT D)
                  You know who this is?

                                BJORN
                        (tentative)
                  Frey?

                                PRIEST
                Of course it s Frey. Who else could 
                it be? The god of sunshine and 
                  rain, of fertility, of children and 
                  crops. Of harvests. Of everything 
                  that grows new...but is cut down 
                  again each year. Then grows once 
                  more. 
                        (beat)
                  Come. 

  He draws Bjorn to the last figure. We have seen this figure 
    before: a tall, thin figure holding a spear, wearing a cloak 
  and a wide-brimmed hat, under which his single eye peeps out. 
  Even carved in wood, there is something magnetic but also 
    something sinister, even terrifying about the image.

                                PRIEST (CONT D)
                  And this...

                                BJORN
                  ...is Odin.

                                PRIEST
                  Odin. god of war, of warriors slain 
                in battle. He lives in his great 
                  hall at Valhalla, with all the 
                  reborn warriors, feasting and 
                  drinking...

    Ragnar suddenly cuts in.

                                RAGNAR
                  Odin is not only the god of those 
                  slain in battle. He is many other 
                  things. He is our universal father. 
                He is the god of Skalds; he governs 
                  the mystic ecstacy, the great 
                  pathos, the passion of the soul.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  45.

                                RAGNAR (CONT'D)
                He is the god of thought..of 
                  curiosity. He wanted to look into 
                  the well of knowledge, guarded by 
                  the wise, decapitated Mimi. They 
                  told him he would have to lose an 
                  eye to gain knowledge...and gladly 
                he did it. You see there, Bjorn? He 
                  has but one eye. But with that 
                  single-eye he sees everything.

  A beat. He takes out two small coins, gives them to the 
    priest.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Thank you for your time, priest.

  The priest is clearly offended, and would like to say 
    something stinging - but manages to restrain himself. He 
    bows, walks out.

  A long beat. Bjorn is still staring up at the statue of Odin, 
  as if mesmerized.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                        (softly)
                  Bjorn...there s something you 
                  should know. Our family are direct 
                  descendants of Odin. Odin was once 
                a man. He fought and made a great 
                  name for himself, and when he died 
                  he became a god. But he was once a 
                  man, with a family and a home. And 
                  it is written in the runes that we 
                  are directly descended from his 
                  family.

                                BJORN
                  We are descended from gods? No 
                  father. How can it be?

                                RAGNAR
                  It is so. Which is why I believe I 
                  have inherited the god s curiosity. 
                  He loved knowledge. He wanted to 
                  find out about things. And so do I. 
                I want to find out what lies to the 
                  west of us...what cities and gods 
                  are over there. I m not satisfied 
                  with staying here, in this small 
                  country, where everyone has to 
                  scratch out a living, unless you re 
                  an earl. Odin gave his eye to 
                  acquire knowledge, but I would give 
                  far more.                                                                                   46.



  Bjorn stares up again at the giant statue of the one-eyed 
  god. 

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                Go outside and wait for me.

  Bjorn nods, and leaves Ragnar alone with his god.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                        (quietly)
                  Lord, O High One, I have sworn my 
                  life to you, and I have come to ask 
                  your advice. Is it not true that, 
                  in the beginning of everything, you 
                  led the revolt of the Aesir against 
                  the Vanir? Was it not you, Lord, 
                  who burned the body of the witch 
                  Gullveig three times? And did you 
                  not sit in your high seat in 
                  Valhalla sharpening your spear and 
                  polishing your shield? And when the 
                  gods moved against each other, was 
                  it not you who cast the first spear 
                  into the host of the Vanir?  
                        (beat)
                  So I have come to ask, have I your 
                  permission to rise in revolt 
                  against my earthly lord? Would you 
                  give me your blessing, if I cast 
                  the first spear? Lord, O High One, 
                  if you would forgive or encourage 
                  me, I ask only that you give me a 
                  sign.

    Odin stares back at him with his single eye.


                                                                          CUT TO:



    Ragnar and Lagertha sit on the bed.

                                LAGERTHA
                  How was it?

                                RAGNAR
                  Good. Earl Haraldson gave Bjorn his 
                  arm-ring. Then I took him up to the 
                  temple.                                                                                   47.



                                LAGERTHA
                So many things at once. My poor 
                  son.

                                RAGNAR
                He didn t complain. Then I took him 
                to see the new boat.

                                LAGERTHA
                  How is it?

                                RAGNAR
                We won t know until we sail in her, 
                  but she looks good.

  He reaches out, touches her cheek.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                I missed you. Did anything happen  
                  while we were away?

                                LAGERTHA
                  No.

                                RAGNAR
                  Did you miss me?

                                LAGERTHA
                I was too busy on the farm to miss 
                  you.

                                RAGNAR
                  Is that true?

  She smiles. 

                                LAGERTHA
                  No. I ached with love longing. My 
                  belly was empty of laughter.  

                                RAGNAR
                  How can I make you laugh now?

                                LAGERTHA
                I don t want to laugh now.

  She pushes him back on the bed, and gets astride him.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                I want to ride you, like a bull. 
                  Like a wild bull.                                                                                   48.



  She rocks back and forth, her eyes gleaming. Unclasps her 
  hair and leans down to kiss him, her hair falling all around 
  him.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                  Now bull, now.

  He starts to make love to her.

  In the other room, by the smouldering fire, Bjorn can hear 
  them. His parents make love loudly, shouting, and the bed 
    shakes.

    Untroubled, he saunters outside.



    Ragnar, Lagertha, Bjorn, Gyda and Rollo eat and drink. Rollo 
    drinks copiously. Looks at Gyda.                                                                                   49.



                                ROLLO
                  So, Gyda, tell me: is your mother 
                  teaching you how to use a shield?

                                GYDA
                  Yes. I know how to use a shield. I 
                  know what it s for.

                                ROLLO
                  Your mother was a famous shield-
                  maiden.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Not so much of the  was  please, 
                  Rollo.  Is  will do.

                                ROLLO
                  Is...a famous shield-maiden. We 
                  fought in the same shieldwall. 
                  Against the Eastlanders. She fought 
                  like a Valkyrie.

                                LAGERTHA
                I fought to protect my husband, my 
                  brothers and my father. They, too, 
                  were in the shieldwall. I would 
                  have died, willingly, for any of 
                  them.

    Ragnar looks at her.

                                RAGNAR
                  You nearly did.

    (It s something between them)

  She rises.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Come on children, to bed. We ll 
                  leave the men.

                                BJORN
                  I m a man. I have a ring.

                                LAGERTHA
                  To bed!

                                BJORN AND GYDA
                  Good night.

                                RAGNAR
                  Good night, my children.                                                                                  50.



    Kisses them.

  They go off. Ragnar pours more mead for them both.

                                ROLLO
                  Tell me your news: what about the 
                  boat?

                                RAGNAR
                  I ve seen it. It s a wonderful 
                  thing, Rollo. It s almost half-
                  finished.

                                ROLLO
                Do you trust Floki? Isn t he a 
                  great joker?

                                RAGNAR
                  He s a great boat builder. I trust 
                  him to do that.

                                ROLLO
                  And the sun board and the sunstone - 
                  you believe they can guide you 
                  across the sea?

                                RAGNAR
                I do.
                        (beat)
                  But I have to ask you this: when 
                  the boat is finished, will you sail 
                  west with me?

    There s a long beat. Rollo drinks, wipes his mouth. Stares at 
  him.

                                ROLLO
                  Only if we re all equal. I won t go 
                  under your command.

    Ragnar slips the ring from his arm. Holds it out to Rollo.

                                RAGNAR
                I swear on my sacred ring, I swear 
                  before Odin, that everyone in the 
                  boat will be equal, and will share 
                  equally what we find.
                        (beat)
                  Will you come?

  A beat. Then Rollo reaches out, and also takes hold of the 
  ring.                                                                                  51.



                                ROLLO
                I will come. I swear.

    Ragnar grins, embraces him.

  But Rollo is still staring at him.

                                ROLLO (CONT D)
                  But we must find a crew. Not many 
                  men will go against the wishes of 
                  Earl Haraldson. Many of them will 
                  be afraid, and if we approach them 
                  some may even go to him and betray 
                  us.

                                RAGNAR
                  Leave that to me. I have a good 
                  idea where we will find our crew.

    Rollo looks at him quizzically, but doesn t question him.

                                ROLLO
                  You re very determined, Ragnar 
                  Lothbrok. How do you know we ll be 
                  successful?

                                RAGNAR
                I don t know. But what I do know is 
                  that our fates are already decided. 
                  One way or another, we can t change 
                  them.

  A beat. Then Lagertha comes back in.

                                LAGERTHA
                  They re asleep.

  She sits down. Ragnar rises.

                                RAGNAR
                I must go and piss.

  He walks outside.

    Rollo pours Lagertha some mead.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Thank you.

  She smiles at him. He tries to hold her gaze.

                                ROLLO
                  I ve always wanted you. Always.                                                                                  52.



                                LAGERTHA
                  That s too bad.

  She smiles again, but he takes it like an insult - reaches 
  out and grabs her wrist. She spills her drink.

                                ROLLO
                  Don t insult me, shield-maiden.

    Looks at him.

                                LAGERTHA
                  No. I would never insult you. 
                  You re too great a warrior.

    Eyes tight on each other. Then he releases his grip.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                  But not so great a man.



    Ragnar comes back in. Is immediately aware that something has 
    happened between Lagertha and Rollo - but chooses to ignore 
  it.

  He sits down again.

                                RAGNAR
                I saw a wolf in the meadow.

                                ROLLO
                  You must kill it.

    Ragnar looks at him.

                                RAGNAR
                  No. I mustn t kill it.                                                                                  53.



                                ROLLO
                  Why not?

  A beat.

                                RAGNAR
                  Because it wasn t a wolf.





    Bjorn lies in his narrow bed, still awake.

  He can hear the adult conversations in the next room. His 
    hand still grips the arm-ring he s been given, for he will 
    never let it go.

    When he closes his eyes he sees the statue of Odin. Odin is 
    staring at him with his one eye. But the eye is alive. And 
  his gaze is terrible. It bores into you.



    Lagertha recites the saga to her children, who listen, like 
    frozen things listening.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Balder s horse, meanwhile, was 
                  galloping along the foreshore and 
                  worked into a streaming sweat. Then 
                a servant plunged a short dagger 
                  into its throat. It gave a violent 
                  jerk and, without a sound, crumpled 
                  among the wrack..



    Ragnar goes on with the nighttime saga, as the children hover 
    between wake and sleep.

                                RAGNAR
                  Thor raised his hammer. Slowly and 
                  solemnly he intoned the magic words 
                to hallow the cremation. Then a 
                  dwarf called Lit came running along 
                  the water s edge. He passed right 
                in front of Thor, and Thor was so 
                  enraged that he put out a foot and 
                  tripped him. The dwarf flew threw 
                  the air and landed right on the 
                  licking and curdling pyre. In this 
                  way, he was burned to death beside 
                  Balder.

  Bjorn bursts out laughing at the thought of the dwarf flying 
  into the fire. He laughs and laughs. And Ragnar smiles, and 
  even his daughter is tickled.



  The first brightness in the night sky. A little rill of 
    light.                                                                                  56.



  The moon is still in the sky, pale and diminishing.

  The camera travels through the house and its sleeping 
    inhabitants. We see the colored shields, some weapons. The 
  ashes of a fire, a slaughtered beast upon a hook.

  The children asleep, like any other children. But Bjorn still 
    clasping his arm-ring in a deathless grip. The small statue 
  of Freya. A sleeping cat.

    Ragnar and Lagertha naked and asleep, coiled together.

  Then Ragnar opens his eyes.

  And the first thing he sees is a horrifying mask. And then he 
  hears laughter, and Floki rips off the mask as he stands over 
  their bed.

    Ragnar stares up at him, covering his cock.

                                FLOKI
                  It s ready.
