      Bianca tries the door.  It won t budge.  Kat, with an annoyed 
      sigh, opens her door and heads around to the passenger door.  
      She puts her foot on the side of the car for leverage, and 
      YANKS the door open.

                                  KAT
                    Your highness.

      Bianca gets out, patting her hair and smoothing her skirt.

                                  BIANCA
                    How do I look?

                                  KAT
                    Shallow.

                                  BIANCA
                          (cheery)
                    Thank you.

      She prances off.  Kat returns to the driver side and opens 
      the door, blocking traffic.  A motorcycle comes SCREECHING to 
      a stop, just inches from the door.  The rider pulls off his 
      helmet, revealing PATRICK VERONA, 17, dark, mysterious, and 
      intense.  He glares at Kat with rage, breathing heavily.  
      She s caught off guard by his sexiness, then snaps out of it.

                                  KAT
                    Don t look at me.  You re the one 
                    speeding in a school zone.

      She hops in and drives off.  Now Patrick is caught off guard.


                                    END OF TEASER                            10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 5.


                                        ACT ONE


      Kat finds a prime spot close to the school.  She starts to 
      pull in, and a convertible Mini Cooper zips up at the same 
      time.  Both cars stop, in a parking detente.  Kat looks over 
      at the driver -- CHASTITY CHURCH, Padua s queen bee.

                                  CHASTITY
                    This is my spot.

                                  KAT
                    I was told the spots aren t 
                    assigned.

                                  CHASTITY
                    Oh they re assigned.  By Charles 
                    Darwin.  So why don t you and 
                      your...Volvo head to the back with 
                    the other less evolved species.

      That pisses Kat off.  She throws her car into drive and pulls 
      into the parking spot.  In doing so, her car takes off the 
      front corner of Chastity s Mini-Cooper.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    What?... Hey!... STOP!

      Patrick pulls up, noticing this whole encounter as Kat locks 
      her car and walks away, waving at a fuming Chastity.

                                  KAT
                    So nice meeting you.


      ANGLE ON Cameron and Michael sitting on a picnic table in the 
      quad eating lunch.

                                    CAMERON
                    What s she doing now?  Other than 
                    looking beautiful, of course.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 10.


      Michael looks over Cameron s shoulder at Bianca, who s 
      sitting on a bench across the way, apparently studying.

                                    MICHAEL
                    She s taking off her shirt.  Man, I 
                    pegged her at a B cup, tops.

      Cameron can t help but look.  He turns back and throws a 
      pencil at Michael.

                                    CAMERON
                    I don t have much time before her 
                    social status is determined.  It s 
                    like she s about to reach into the 
                    sorting hat at Hogwarts.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Well get over there Harry Pooper 
                    and pull out your wand!

      Emboldened, Cameron stands and takes a few steps towards 
      Bianca.  She looks up and he spins back around.

                                    CAMERON
                    Wait!  What do I say first?

      ANGLE ON Bianca, who looks back down at a hand-written time-
      line of Chastity s day.  Bianca checks Chastity s picture and 
      looks down the sidewalk, where Chastity exits the building 
      with two gal pals.  She s wearing a neck brace.  Her friends 
      hug her, concerned, as she leaves them and heads towards 
      Bianca - who sits up tall, preparing herself.

      As Chastity approaches, Bianca opens her hand and lets a tube 
      of make up roll stealthily out and across the sidewalk.

                                  BIANCA
                          (to Chastity)
                    Ooh, watch out!  

      Chastity stops, annoyed.  Bianca rushes out to pick it up.

                                  BIANCA (CONT D)
                      I wouldn t want you to fall in 
                    those...
                          (off Chastity s boots)
                    Fierce boots!  Christian Louboutin?

                                  CHASTITY
                          (whatever)
                    Dior.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 11.


                                  BIANCA
                          (off make-up)
                    Besides, I can t lose my favorite 
                    mascara.  It s MAC Plush Lash.

                                  CHASTITY
                          (slightly interested)
                    That s what I wear.

                                  BIANCA
                    Great, right?  It s pricey, but 
                    it s my one splurge.  Everything 
                    else goes into the bank so that 
                    someday I can buy a powder blue 
                      convertible Mini-Cooper.

                                  CHASTITY
                    I m Chastity!

      She holds out her hand.  Bianca takes it like she s greeting 
      the Queen.

                                  BIANCA
                    Bianca.

                                  CHASTITY
                    Walk with me and tell me your life 
                    story.

      Bianca, excited, gathers her things and walks with Chastity.

                                  BIANCA
                    Well, we just moved here from Ohio.

                                  CHASTITY
                    Wow, great story.  You should try 
                    out for cheerleading!

      As they walk off, we ANGLE ON Cameron and Michael.  Cameron s 
      totally defeated.

                                    CAMERON
                    Too late.  Voldemort s got her.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Not so fast.  This is our year, 
                    remember?  We just need a plan.
                          (getting an idea)
                    Hey, don t your parents have book 
                    club tonight?

                                    CAMERON
                    It s scary you know that.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 12.


                                    MICHAEL
                    It s that new Chabon book.  
                    Overrated if you ask me.  But while 
                    they re away we re gonna throw a 
                    party.

                                    CAMERON
                    Did you eat peanut butter? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Listen, if we host the first rager 
                    of the year, we ll be legends.  And 
                    Bianca will be able to talk to you 
                    in public!

                                    CAMERON
                    But my parents will be home at 
                    midnight.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We ll call the cops at eleven.  
                    They ll break up the party, making 
                    it even more epic.  Then we spend 
                    the last hour cleaning up. 
                          (off Cameron s doubt)
                    C mon, imagine greeting Bianca as 
                    she walks into a raging party at 
                    your house.

      Cameron grins as he pictures it.  That sounds awesome.  He 
      shakes it off.

                                    CAMERON
                    But how do we get people to come?

      Michael thinks then his face lights up.  Bingo!


      MANDELLA, 17, a shy, chubby goth girl spray paints 
      elaborately cool graffiti on the back of the building.  Kat 
      walks around the corner, startling her.  She hides the can of 
      paint behind her back.

                                  KAT
                    Burn the school down, for all I 
                    care.

      Mandella smiles shyly.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    May I join you?  I was losing my 
                    appetite in there.  
                                  (MORE)                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 13.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                      Apparently it s no longer socially 
                    accepted to chew with your mouth 
                    closed.

      Mandella nods her head.  Kat sits, examining her work.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    What s your name?  When you become 
                    a famous artist, I wanna be able to 
                    say I knew you when.

      Mandella blushes.  Nobody s ever shown her such praise.

                                  MANDELLA
                    Mandella.

      Kat looks across the building and spots Patrick, he s sitting 
      at a picnic table, whittling a stick with a switchblade.  He 
      stares at Kat with the same scary, intense gaze.

                                  KAT
                          (re: Patrick)
                    Mandella, who is Captain Intensity 
                    over there?

                                  MANDELLA
                    Patrick Verona.  People say he 
                    shows seven of the signs of a 
                    serial killer.

                                  KAT
                    Is one of them inappropriate 
                    staring?

      Kat stares back at him calmly, initiating a stare off.  She s 
      cool as a cucumber.  Patrick, getting more and more 
      uncomfortable, stabs his knife into the table. 

                                  MANDELLA
                          (re: Patrick, fearful)
                    Maybe we should sit somewhere else.

      Patrick can t take it anymore.  He breaks gaze, folds his 
      knife up menacingly, and leaves.

                                  KAT
                            (victorious, to Mandella)
                    There, now where were we?
                          (off graffiti)
                    Do you work in any other mediums?

      Mandella is in awe of her new friend.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 14.



      There s a group of girls wearing various forms of belly-
      baring workout clothes sitting on the lawn.  Bianca sits 
      among them.  Chastity stands at the front.

                                  CHASTITY
                    You all did great at tryouts.  Give 
                    yourself a round of applause.

      The girls clap and smile at each other.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    Now, the reason they re called 
                     tryouts  is because not everyone 
                    can make it.  If everyone could, 
                    they would be called sign ups.

      The girls look at each other nervously.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    And that means some, no let s be 
                    honest, most of you won t make the 
                    squad.  Those of you who don t may 
                    beat yourself up about it.  Heck, 
                    some of you might regret it for the 
                    rest of your lives, as you struggle 
                    with inadequacy issues.  You ll 
                    think back on tomorrow when I post 
                    the list in the cafeteria as the 
                    moment it all went wrong. 

      The girls wait for Chastity to finish her thought.  She picks 
      up her purse and fishes for her car keys.  She finds them.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    So good luck!

      The girls all disperse, completely and totally gutted.  
      Bianca runs after Chastity.

                                  BIANCA
                    Great speech!  Very inspiring.

                                  CHASTITY
                    Yeah, but no one cried. 
                          (shaking her arms limply)
                                  (MORE)                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 17.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Swaha!  Swaha! 
                            (explaining)
                    I m expelling their loser energy.  
                    After all, you and I are winners.

      She winks at Bianca, insinuating that Bianca is making the 
      squad.  Bianca is ecstatic: she s a popular cheerleader!  

      SFX: HONK!!!

      Kat has pulled her car up next to them. 

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    Ugh, there s Volvo girl again!  Of 
                    the ten things I hated about today, 
                    she s number one.  I swear, they 
                    will let anyone into public school.

      Bianca reacts to that in horror.  She looks over at Kat and 
      mimes  cut it out.   Kat rolls down the car window.

                                  KAT
                    You re right, Dad s going to kill 
                    us if we re not home for dinner.  
                    Now quit the charades and get in.

      Bianca closes her eyes.  Oh no.  She opens them and looks 
      over at a confused and disgusted Chastity.  

                                  BIANCA
                          (to Chastity)
                    I ll see you tomorrow.  By the way, 
                    you look amazing in this light.

      But the damage is done.  Chastity stares straight ahead and 
      walks across the street in front of Kat s car.  Kat taps the 
      gas, making the car jump forward.  Chastity screams bloody 
      murder.  Once she realizes she s OK, she looks over at Kat.

                                  KAT
                    Oops.

                                  CHASTITY
                    You evil bitch!

      She runs off. Kat smiles.

                                  KAT
                    I think I like this school.

      Bianca seethes like a volcano about to explode on Kat.

                                        ACT TWO


      Kat walks over to Patrick on his motorcycle.

                                  KAT
                    OK, Hannibal Lecter, let s cut to 
                    the chase.  You want some of this?

      She holds up her left fist, where she s threaded her keys in 
      between her fingers, like blades.  Patrick laughs.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    No?  Then how  bout some of this?

      She pulls a taser out from behind her back.  It sparks.  
      Patrick falls silent.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    What do you want?                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 23.


                                    PATRICK
                    What do you mean?

                                  KAT
                    I mean, do you want to deal me 
                    drugs?  Or steal my car?  Or 
                    harvest my organs?  There has to be 
                    a reason people are scared of you.

                                    PATRICK
                    Why are people scared of you?

                                  KAT
                    People aren t scared of me.

                                    PATRICK
                    Sure they are.  It s why I find you 
                      interesting.

      He revs his engine and rides off.  Kat watches him go, 
      intrigued and maybe a bit turned on.


      Kat leans against her car, waiting for Bianca.  Patrick pulls 
      up on his bike with a trashy girl on the back.  Patrick nods 
      at Kat.  A flash of jealousy crosses her face.  

                                  KAT
                    You guys should really be wearing 
                    helmets.

      He pulls away.  Bianca walks up carrying her penguin head.

                                  BIANCA
                    Who s the cool rider?  The cool, 
                    cool, cool, cool rider?

                                  KAT
                    Very funny.  Nice penguin head.

                                  BIANCA
                    Don t call PETA, it s not real.

                                  KAT
                    Looks like Stella got her snark 
                    back.

                                  BIANCA
                    Can we just go home? 

      They get in the car and pull away.
