A MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Legend tells of a legendary warrior
whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff
of legend.
The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and
wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He traveled the land in search of
worthy foes.
CUT TO:
The entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas.
WARRIOR
KABLOOEY!
CUT TO:
The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky.
Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
It mattered not how many foes he
faced. They were no match for his
bodacity.
The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final
blow while doing a split between two trees.
The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god-
rays shine down upon him.
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Never before had a panda been so
feared... and so loved.
(MORE)
3.
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Even the most heroic heroes in all
of China, the Furious Five, bowed
in respect to this great master.
MONKEY
We should hang out.
WARRIOR
Agreed.
As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits
approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior
brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain
into the sea of bandits.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
But hanging out would have to wait.
`Cause when you're facing the ten
thousand demons of Demon Mountain,
there's only one thing that
matters. And that's--
In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.
MONKEY
Po! Get up!
TIGRESS
You'll be late for work!
PO
Whu?
SLAM ZOOM in towards Palace.
End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a
FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle
between the Palace buildings.
Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark
shapes move in the foreground.
Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously,
diving on Shifu.
Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a
staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers
go flying -
They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who
is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
SHIFU
Well done, students... if you were
trying to disappoint me.
He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey, greater speed.
Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is
mentioned.
8.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
Mantis--
Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
ZENG
Master Shifu!
SHIFU
(impatiently)
What?!
ZENG
(startled)
Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
to see you.
Shifu looks up, concerned.
Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena. A couple
BUNNY KIDS run by.
BUNNY FAN #1
Yippee!
BUNNY FAN #2
I'm a Kung Fu warrior!
BUNNY FAN #1
Me too!
Where's Po?
PAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands
at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the
daunting task before him.
Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.
13.
The sun beats down on Po, but he presses forward. Climbing.
Climbing.
DISSOLVE TO:
Po is still struggling up the stairs.
PO
Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost
there...
He stops, flopping onto his back to catch his breath.
WIDEN TO REVEAL he's only made it up seven steps.
PO (CONT'D)
What? No! Oh No!
Two Pigs pass by.
KG SHAW
Sorry, Po.
JR SHAW
We'll bring you back a souvenir.
Po watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This
is his heroic moment.
PO
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
Po tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the
stairs.
Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace
Pig bangs a gong.
SHIFU
It is an historic day, isn't it,
Master Oogway?
OOGWAY
Yes, and one I feared I would not
live to see. Are your students
ready?
14.
SHIFU
Yes, Master Oogway.
OOGWAY
Now know this, old friend. Whomever
I choose will not only bring peace
to the Valley, but also to you.
As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts
walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards
the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.
ANNOUNCER
Let the tournament begin!
Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena.
Po gasps for air as he hoists himself over the last step,
laughing victoriously.
PO
(out of breath)
Yeah!
The doors to the palace arena begin to close.
PO (CONT'D)
Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming!
Po runs to the entrance and proceeds to bang on the door.
PO (CONT'D)
Hey! Open the door!
DRUMS inside drown out Po's pounding. He yells.
PO (CONT'D)
Let me in!
Inside, spectators' screams drown out Po's yelling.
Po panics for a beat and then finds a window. He jumps and
weakly struggles to pull himself up.
Po struggles to peek through the window.
15.
Po comes to.
PO
Huh? Oh no! Wait!
He sees the fireworks and has an idea.
PO (CONT'D)
Yeah!
Po struggles with something, his back turned to us. Reveal he
has tied a load of fireworks to a chair. He hops on and
lights the fuse.
PO'S DAD (O.S.)
Po?!
Po's Dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
PO
What does it look like I'm doing?
Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the
Dragon Warrior!
PO'S DAD
But I don't understand. You finally
had the noodle dream.
Po looks uneasy.
PO
I lied. I don't dream about
noodles, Dad!
He looks at the fuse... almost all gone... Po holds onto the
chair for dear life, closes his eyes, and braces himself for
liftoff.
PO (CONT'D)
I love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-
18.
Po finally opens his eyes...
He's still on the ground. The fuse was a dud. Po falls face
first into the dirt. He looks away, embarrassed. Po's Dad
holds out his apron.
PO'S DAD
Come on, son. Let's get back to
work.
PO
Okay.
Po sighs, starts to reach for the apron, then-- BOOM! The
rockets ignite, propelling Po into the stadium wall.
PO'S DAD
Oh! Come back!
Po's rocket chair blasts him into the sky amid a shower of
fireworks.
CROWD
Oooh! Aaahh!
Po climbs up and up...until the rockets die out and the chair
loses power...
PO
Uh oh...
Oogway's arm sweeps down the line of the expectant Five... Po
falls towards the center of the ring...
The tension builds as the Five wait to see who will be
picked. Then... SMASH!
Po lands and kicks up a huge dirt cloud, obscuring the ring.
A huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain.
Fifteen stories of iron and rock. No windows. One door --
locked, bolted and sealed tight. Rhinoceros guards in armor
patrol the perimeter.
Zeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry
spots him in the distance. He lands, sliding on the ice and
crashing into the gate. The rhinos point their spears at him.
ZENG
Wait wait wait! I bring a message
from Master Shifu.
CLANG! The doors creak open. The terrified goose peers in.
CUT TO:
The Five are walking to the bunkhouse, which sits high on a
hill.
MANTIS
There's no words.
CRANE
No denying that.
VIPER
I don't understand what Master
Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's
just gonna get himself killed.
CRANE
(mocking)
He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior
fell out of the sky on a ball of
fire.
MANTIS
When he walks, the very ground
shakes!
TIGRESS
One would think that Master Oogway
would choose someone who actually
knew Kung Fu.
CRANE
Yeah, or could at least touch his
toes.
MONKEY
Or even see his toes.
As the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them
has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing
everything.
He attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut. He lifts
up his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls
over.
33.
He gets up and watches them go inside. He sighs.
A dejected Po stands under a peach tree in the moonlight.
Oogway approaches.
OOGWAY
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
Po spins around, his face dripping with peach juice.
36.
PO
(mouth full)
Is that what this is? I am so
sorry. I thought it was just a
regular peach tree.
OOGWAY
I understand. You eat when you are
upset.
PO
Upset? I'm not upset. What makes
you think I'm upset?
OOGWAY
So why are you upset?
Po sighs, there's no use trying to lie to Oogway.
PO
I probably sucked more today than
anyone in the history of kung fu,
in the history of China, in the
history of sucking.
OOGWAY
Probably.
PO
And the Five... man, you should
have seen them, they totally hate
me.
OOGWAY
Totally.
PO
How's Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior? I mean,
I'm not like The Five. I've got no
claws, no wings, no venom. Even
Mantis has those...
(he imitates a mantis'
front legs)
...thingies. Maybe I should just
quit and go back to making noodles.
OOGWAY
Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't
noodles.
Po looks confused.
37.
OOGWAY (CONT'D)
You are too concerned with what was
and what will be. There is a
saying: Yesterday is history,
tomorrow is a mystery, but today is
a gift. That is why it is called
the present.
Oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a
peach falls into Po's open hand.
KA-THOOM! The door blasts open and Rhinos go flying
everywhere.
WHUMP. The Goose hits the ground. The commander's horn
prosthetic falls in front of him.
ZENG
Nuuu... Urggg...
Tai Lung picks up the Goose by the throat.
ZENG (CONT'D)
URRK!
TAI LUNG
I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was
beginning to think I had been
forgotten.
With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's
ruffled feathers.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
Fly back there and tell them...the
real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
Tai Lung throws the Goose into the air and he flutters off.
Lightning strikes.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP of a gong being struck.
Shifu walks with a bit more energy.
VIPER
What do we do now, Master? With the
panda gone, who will be the Dragon
Warrior?
SHIFU
All we can do is resume our
training and trust that in time,
the true Dragon Warrior will be
revealed.
Po crashes out of the door and tumbles down the steps.
The Five watch him fall.
TIGRESS
If he's smart, he won't come back
up those steps.
MONKEY
But he will.
44.
VIPER
He's not gonna quit, is he?
MANTIS
He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll
tell ya that.
Cut WIDE as Po continues to tumble.
FLASHBACK. Shifu peeks out of the Training Hall and finds a
baby leopard cub on the steps.
TIGRESS (V.O.)
Shifu found him as a cub. And he
raised him as a son.
Baby Tai Lung pulls on Shifu's whiskers.
47.
TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...and when the boy showed talent
in Kung Fu...
Baby Tai Lung punches the training dummy across the floor.
TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...Shifu trained him.
Shifu teaches Baby Tai Lung how to punch.
TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He believed in him. He told him he
was destined for greatness.
Hard cut to a full-grown Tai Lung demolishing a training
dummy.
TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It was never enough for Tai Lung.
He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But
Oogway saw darkness in his heart
and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley. He tried
to take the scroll by force. And
Shifu had to destroy what he had
created.
Tai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace.
He crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu
and Oogway.
Shifu leaps at Tai Lung to deliver a kick.
TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But how could he?
Seeing only baby Tai Lung running towards him, Shifu pulls
his kick short. Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike
and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.
Tai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with
strikes at his pressure points. He falls to the ground in a
heap.
TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd
never loved anyone before...
Young Tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the
same manner as Tai Lung. Shifu corrects her form. Nothing
more. Young Tigress looks crestfallen.
48.
TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...or since.
The sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress.
Oogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought. Shifu
rushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated.
SHIFU
Master! Master!
OOGWAY
Hmmm?
SHIFU
(out of breath)
I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.
OOGWAY
Ah, Shifu. There is just news.
There is no good or bad.
SHIFU
Master, your vision...your vision
was right. Tai Lung has broken out
of prison. He's on his way!
OOGWAY
That is bad news...
He turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised.
OOGWAY (CONT'D)
...If you do not believe that the
Dragon Warrior can stop him.
SHIFU
The panda? Master, that panda is
not the Dragon Warrior.
(MORE)
50.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
He wasn't even meant to be here --
it was an accident!
OOGWAY
There are no accidents.
SHIFU
Yes, I know. You've said that
already. Twice.
OOGWAY
Well, that was no accident either.
SHIFU
Thrice.
OOGWAY
My old friend, the panda will never
fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
until you let go of the illusion of
control.
SHIFU
Illusion?
OOGWAY
Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
cannot make it blossom when it
suits me, nor make it bear fruit
before its time.
SHIFU
But there are things we can
control.
Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
I can control when the fruit will
fall.
A peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses
the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
And I can control--
Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed
in it.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
--where to plant the seed. That is
no illusion, Master.
51.
OOGWAY
Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
that seed will grow to be a peach
tree. You may wish for an apple, or
an orange... but you will get a
peach.
SHIFU
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
OOGWAY
Maybe it can. If you are willing to
guide it, to nurture it. To believe
in it.
Oogway covers the seed with dirt.
SHIFU
But how? How? I need your help,
Master.
OOGWAY
No, you just need to believe.
Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
will believe.
SHIFU
I... I will try.
Oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to
Shifu.
OOGWAY
Good. My time has come. You must
continue your journey without me.
He hands his staff to a confused Shifu.
SHIFU
What... what are you..?
Oogway backs away into the swirling fog.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Master, you can't leave me!
The petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.
OOGWAY
You must believe.
SHIFU
Master!
52.
Shifu runs after him. Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms.
As the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge
of a cliff.
Oogway is gone.
We pan across to the bunkhouse.
PO (O.S.)
...So I'm like, fine, you may be a
wolf, you may be the scariest
bandit in Haijin Province...
Super wide shot as Po runs away from the compound. Closer as
he continues running. He checks over his shoulder, turns
back... Shifu lands right in front of him.
SHIFU
You cannot leave! A real warrior
never quits!
PO
Watch me!
He tries to maneuver around Shifu, but is redirected back.
PO (CONT'D)
Come on! How am I supposed to beat
Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to
the stairs.
SHIFU
You will beat him because you are
the Dragon Warrior!
He pushes Po back with the staff.
PO
Ow! You don't believe that! You
never believed that! From the first
moment I got here, you've been
trying to get rid of me.
Shifu pokes him again, this time causing Po to fall on his
back.
SHIFU
Yes. I was. But now I ask you to
trust in your master as I have come
to trust in mine.
PO
You're not my master. And I'm not
the Dragon Warrior.
Po shoves the staff away and gets up.
57.
SHIFU
Then why didn't you quit? You knew
I was trying to get rid of you, and
yet you stayed.
PO
Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because
every time you threw a brick at my
head or said I smelled, it hurt.
But it could never hurt more than
it did every day of my life just
being me.
Po looks down at the Valley, then turns back to Shifu.
PO (CONT'D)
I stayed because I thought if
anyone could change me, could make
me... not me, it was you. The
greatest kung fu teacher in all of
China.
SHIFU
But I can change you! I can turn
you into the Dragon Warrior! And I
will!
PO
C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here
right now. And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here, how
are you gonna change this...
(indicate belly)
...into the Dragon Warrior? How?
How? How?!
In frustration, Shifu yells out the answer.
SHIFU
I don't know!!!
(then, resigned)
I don't know.
PO
That's what I thought.
Shifu walks away, leaving the path open to Po.
Tigress stands in the moonlight outside the palace. She has
seen what just transpired between Shifu and Po.
58.
She turns away, a look of resolve on her face... and LEAPS.
She flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in
the valley below. She looks back up at the palace.
TIGRESS
This is what you trained me for.
She takes off running.
The other four are right behind her.
VIPER
Tigress!
She keeps going and they give chase.
TIGRESS
Don't try and stop me!
The chase continues through the village.
VIPER
We're not trying to stop you!
TIGRESS
What?
VIPER
We're coming with you!
Then...the others join her. Tigress smiles. They leap off
into the night.
Night dissolves to dawn. Shifu sits under the peach tree. He
stirs, hearing KUNG FU NOISES from the training hall. He goes
to investigate.
CUT TO:
Shifu leads Po through the mountains.
PO
I know you're trying to be all
mystical and kung fu-y, but could
you at least tell me where we're
going?
Shifu just continues walking.
CUT TO:
Shifu is sitting beneath a tree. Winded and wheezing, Po
slowly works his way up the hill.
Po sets his gear down and looks around. Shifu breathes in the
morning mist as Po approaches.
PO
You dragged me all the way out here
for a bath?!
Po begins to pat his armpits with water.
SHIFU
Panda, we do not wash our pits in
The Pool of Sacred Tears.
Po quickly stops. Realizing.
61.
PO
(in awe)
The pool of...
SHIFU
This is where Oogway unravelled the
mysteries of harmony and focus.
This is the birthplace of Kung Fu.
The camera cranes up to reveal they are standing on rock
shapes that resemble a yin yang symbol.
As the camera pulls further out, it pulls back through a
vision of Oogway doing Kung Fu moves.
FLASH FRAME -- Shifu leaps atop one of the rocks and looks
down at Po.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Do you want to learn Kung Fu?
PO
(awestruck)
Yeah...
SHIFU
Then I am your master!
PO
Okay!
Tears of joy well up in Po's eyes.
SHIFU
Don't cry.
PO
Okay.
Po sniffs the tears back and smiles.
Shifu leads Po out into an open field.
SHIFU
When you focus on Kung Fu, when you
concentrate...you stink.
Po scowls.
62.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
But perhaps that is my fault. I
cannot train you the way I have
trained the Five. I now see that
the way to get through to you is
with this!
Shifu produces a bowl of dumplings.
PO
Oh great, `cause I'm hungry.
SHIFU
Good. When you have been trained,
you may eat. Let us begin.
Po's training unfolds -- deep breathing exercises, balance
tests, push ups, sit ups, climbing, etc. Through it all, he
never gets to eat, although he does indeed learn kung fu.
Shifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder.
SHIFU
After you, panda.
Po stops short, suspicious.
PO
Just like that? No situps? No ten
mile hike?
SHIFU
I vowed to train you... and you
have been trained. You are free to
eat.
Po grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Enjoy.
Po raises the dumpling to his mouth. WHOOSH! Shifu snatches
the dumpling away and eats it himself.
PO
Hey!
63.
SHIFU
I said you are free to eat. Have a
dumpling.
Po reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks
the dumpling into the air.
PO
Hey!
Shifu eats it and Po scowls.
SHIFU
You are free to eat!
PO
(upset)
Am I?
SHIFU
(challenging)
Are you?!
Po and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and
sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and
Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one
left.
Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He
hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks
as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with
his bamboo staff.
But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final
dumpling.
Shifu smiles. Po has passed the final test.
But then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand.
PO
I'm not hungry... master.
Master and pupil bow to each other.
CUT TO:
The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain
peaks.
64.
Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and
races toward them.
TIGRESS
Cut it!
The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the
mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the
final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch
herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the
bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The
Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
TAI LUNG
Where's the Dragon Warrior?
TIGRESS
How do you know you're not looking
at her?
Tai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.
TAI LUNG
You think I'm a fool? I know you're
not the Dragon Warrior. None of
you!
The Five exchange quick, worried looks.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
(nodding confidently)
I heard how he fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire, that he's a
warrior unlike anything the world
has ever seen.
The Five exchange quick, confused looks.
MONKEY
Po?
TAI LUNG
So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
a worthy opponent. Our battle will
be legendary!
Tigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches
Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters
with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through
the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the
bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
MONKEY
We've got this. Help her!
65.
Viper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the
ropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane
manages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with
his own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's
"throat".
VIPER
Monkey!
ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the
rope by himself.
MANTIS
Go!
(then)
Ack! What was I thinking?!
Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and
sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets
back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single
strand of rope.
TIGRESS
Mantis!
Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave
shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face
and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.
TIGRESS (CONT'D)
Now!
Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which
way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai
Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist.
Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies
safely to the mountain.
The Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...
Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling
the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope
whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.
With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.
TAI LUNG
Shifu taught you well...
Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
But he didn't teach you everything.
66.
Tai lung lunges toward the rest.
Shifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard. Po has an
easy spring in his step.
SHIFU
You have done well, Panda.
PO
Done well? Done well?! I've done
awesome!
He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.
SHIFU
The mark of a true hero is
humility!
After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -
SHIFU (CONT'D)
But yes...you have done awesome.
And he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As
they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind
them. IT'S CRANE!
Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a
heap.
PO
Huh? Guys? Guys!
Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.
PO (CONT'D)
They're dead? No, they're
breathing! They're asleep?! No,
their eyes are open.
Crane struggles to lift his head.
CRANE
We were no match for his nerve
attack.
His head collapses to the ground.
67.
SHIFU
He has gotten stronger.
PO
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
Shifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then
Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -
MONKEY
He's too fast!
He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly
realizes where he is.
MONKEY (CONT'D)
Sorry, Po.
Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.
TIGRESS
I thought we could stop him.
SHIFU
He could have killed you.
MANTIS
Why didn't he?
SHIFU
So you could come back here and
strike fear into our hearts. But it
won't work!
PO
Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
pretty scared.
SHIFU
You can defeat him, panda.
PO
Are you kidding? If they can't--
They're five masters. I'm just one
me.
SHIFU
But you will have the one thing
that no one else does.
68.
The Five arrive at the base of the stairs.
TIGRESS
We've got to get them out safely.
Monkey picks up a small child.
MONKEY
Come, little one. Let's find your
mama.
TIGRESS
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north. Crane, light the
way.
They split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate. Po is
left by himself.
He makes his way through the bustling town.
72.
JR SHAW
(skeptically)
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
Po approaches the Noodle Shop.
PO
Hey, Dad.
PO'S DAD
Po!
Seeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around
his son. Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad
pulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Good to have you back, son!
PO
(listlessly)
Good to be back.
Po's Dad goes back to packing things up.
PO'S DAD
Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
it's time to face it -- the future
of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
no longer slices.
Dad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Also, I was thinking, maybe this
time we'll have a kitchen you can
actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
that?
He turns and notices that Po hasn't moved. He walks to Po
sympathetically.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
out. It just... wasn't meant to be.
Po slumps against the cart.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Po, forget everything else. Your
destiny still awaits. We are noodle
folk -- broth runs deep through our
veins.
73.
PO
I don't know, Dad. Honestly,
sometimes I can't believe I'm
actually your son.
Dad is taken aback.
PO'S DAD
Po, I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you a
long time ago...
PO
Okay.
Dad pauses dramatically.
PO'S DAD
The secret ingredient of my secret
ingredient soup!
Po feigns excitement.
PO
Oh.
PO'S DAD
C'mere! The secret ingredient is...
nothing!
PO
Huh?
PO'S DAD
You heard me. Nothing. There is no
secret ingredient!
PO
Wait wait...it's just plain old
noodle soup? You don't add some
kind of special sauce or something?
PO'S DAD
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just have to believe
it's special.
Po looks at his father with dawning realization. He picks up
the Scroll.
For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then
he smiles serenely. He gets it now.
74.
PO
There is no secret ingredient...
Po turns back to look at the palace.
CUT TO:
At the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley,
awaiting his fate. With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears
before him.
TAI LUNG
I have come home, Master.
SHIFU
This is no longer your home. And I
am no longer your master.
TAI LUNG
Yes. You have a new favorite. So
where is this...Po? Did I scare him
off?
SHIFU
This battle is between you and me.
TAI LUNG
So. That is how it's going to be?
SHIFU
That is how it must be.
They fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the
doors of the Jade Palace.
Tai Lung enters.
TAI LUNG
I rotted in jail for twenty years
because of your weakness!
SHIFU
Obeying your master is not
weakness!
TAI LUNG
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
You always knew...
Dissolve to FLASHBACK.
75.
A young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head.
TAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do? What did you do?!
Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past
dissolves into the present.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
NOTHING!
Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance.
SHIFU
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!
TAI LUNG
NOT YOUR FAULT?!
Enraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and
throws them at Shifu.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?!
WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY
BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY
DESTINY?!
Shifu dodges each attack.
SHIFU
It was never my decision to make!
Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.
TAI LUNG
It is now.
They fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
Give me the scroll!
SHIFU
I would rather die.
They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters
into a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a
flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu
gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
76.
Shifu climbs the column to the rafters. Tai Lung follows and
sends them both crashing through the roof.
Lightning flash.
Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's
throat as they crash back through the roof.
They kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the
floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he
charges at Shifu.
TAI LUNG
All I ever did, I did to make you
proud! Tell me how proud you are,
Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor
and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames
extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
SHIFU
(weakly)
I have always been proud of you.
From the first moment, I've been
proud of you. And it was my pride
that blinded me. I loved you too
much to see what you were becoming.
What I was turning you into. I'm...
sorry.
Tai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's
expression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.
TAI LUNG
I don't want your apology. I want
my scroll!
He holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung
bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
WHAT? WHERE IS IT?!
Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.
SHIFU
(weakly)
Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
halfway across China by now. You
will never see that scroll, Tai
Lung. Never. Never...
77.
Tai Lung is furious. He roars, ready to strike Shifu.
Suddenly...
PO (O.S.)
Hey!
Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.
PO (CONT'D)
(out of breath)
Stairs...
Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.
TAI LUNG
Who are you?
PO
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
(exhales hard)
Huhhh...
TAI LUNG
You?! Him?!
(to Shifu)
He's a panda.
(back to Po)
You're a panda. What are you gonna
do, big guy? Sit on me?
PO
Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
use this. You want it? Come and get
it.
Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across
the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.
TAI LUNG
Finally!
Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,
sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and
strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to
run.
Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace
steps.
Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends
him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
78.
Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and
smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes
right back at Po.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
That scroll is mine!
Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the
scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down
stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down
on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the
scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po
snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies
towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,
but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart
which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the
noodle.
Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees
and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the
street.
As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array
of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around
to hide the scroll.
PO
Lightning!
Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po
uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes
out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll
rolls down the steps towards the river.
Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases
down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the
fireworks-filled sky.
Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The
scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an
ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who
sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-
vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is
shocked.
TAI LUNG
The scroll has given him power.
(then)
NOOO0!!
He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting
shockwave collapses the building.
79.
Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach
the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and
unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the
ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating
punch.
As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the
impact crater.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
(out of breath)
Finally... oh yes... the power of
the Dragon Scroll... is mine!
Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.
TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
It's NOTHING!!
Po stirs.
PO
It's okay. I didn't get it the
first time either.
TAI LUNG
(disbelief)
What?
Po gets to his feet.
PO
There is no secret ingredient. It's
just you.
Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
TAI LUNG
RRRAAAH!
PO
AAAAGGGHH!
Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.
PO (CONT'D)
Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!
Don't! Don't!
Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he
delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
80.
The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms
come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing
back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what
he just did.
Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po
strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even
getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai
Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai
Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po
prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!
He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until
finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the
ground.
Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.
TAI LUNG
(heavy breathing)
You... can't defeat me. You're just
a big, fat panda!
SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.
PO
I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
big, fat panda.
Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.
TAI LUNG
The Wuxi Finger Hold!
PO
Oh, you know this hold?
TAI LUNG
You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
Shifu didn't teach you that.
PO
Nope. I figured it out.
He flexes his pinky...
PO (CONT'D)
Skadoosh!
KA-THOOM!
81.
A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the
Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.
DISSOLVE TO:
Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist
looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
KG SHAW
Look! The Dragon Warrior.
As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and
his scarf is a torn apron.
Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the
crowd.
PO'S DAD
That's my boy. That big, lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!
PO
Thanks, Dad.
Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the
ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest
of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.
PO (CONT'D)
Hey, guys.
TIGRESS
Master.
Tigress bows deeply. The others follow.
FURIOUS FIVE
Master.
PO
(modest)
Master?
(then, remembering)
Master Shifu!
Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then
more steps.
82.
