Jim and Abby walk to their cars. Jim is walking faster than
she is, trying to get away. She trots along, trying to keep
up.
ABBY
Next time we could go bowling. I
noticed online that you're the mid-
ranked amateur in the state. I
mean, if there is a next time. I'm
not trying to be presumptuous, but
I am getting a pretty good vibe
here...

ABBY (CONT'D)

Floss?

JIM
Uh, no thanks.
It's late.
I

He gets into his car as she hands him his doggy bag.
ABBY
FYI, be sure to eat this by
tomorrow. With curry, you can't
smell if it's gone bad, so after
three days, you should just toss
it. Really, don't even give it to a
pet or anything.
JIM
Three days. Got it.
Abby has officially lost control to the producer part of
herself...she knows what she's doing, but can't stop herself.
ABBY
Here, just to be sure, I'll write
today's date on it for you.
Abby takes a pen out and writes a date on the bag.
JIM
(annoyed)
It's fine, really...
The bottom of the bag gives out and a container of goopy
leftovers SPILLS all over Jim's lap.
ABBY
(horrified)
I told them to double bag this!
JIM
I'm just gonna -- go.

MIKE
Ah, I see you ladies have started

He smiles at TWO BLONDE TWINS IN BIKINIS, who wrestle in a
kiddie pool of Jello.
We INTERCUT with the control room.
ABBY
Who let them on the lot? Don't we
have security?
IN THE ALLEY, a security guard watches the girls, smitten.
Mike smiles to the camera.
MIKE
Babes wrestling in Jello. Let's
just take a quick survey and see
which option the men out there
would pick.

Do we have phone lines?

Two, go wide! Good. Ready, one --

Abby grabs the microphone for Mike's ear piece...
ABBY
Lick the Jello off her finger!
ON THE MONITOR -- A slightly puzzled look from Mike, but he
lifts the girl's finger and licks the Jello off it.
ABBY (COMT'D)

Go one!
The camera focuses tightly on his face.
MIKE
Mmmm...I was wrong. It's cherry.
And that's the ugly truth. Over to

As Mike waves to camera, he's pulled into the Jello pool and
the girls rip off his shirt.

Abby runs through the grounds of the complex looking or
D`Artagnan.

She spots him hiding under a U-Haul, and slowly creeps
towards him.
ABBY (CONT'D)
It's okay, baby. I'm not mad. I
mean, yes, I am somewhat angry --

but I'm repressing it...

A car speeds past, honking obnoxiously at Abby. The cat races
away, then climbs up a LARGE TREE beside one of the condos.
Abby sighs and follows.
ABBY
Really? This is how I get to spend
my evening?

Abby looks up the tree to see D'Artagnan perched on a branch
above. He MEOWS.
ABBY
It's okay, baby. Just stay there.
Abby jumps up, grabs a branch and starts to climb.

Almost there.
Abby starts climbing higher, testing branches as she goes.
Finally she reaches the branch he's on.

ABBY (CONT'D)
It's okay. I've got you.
D'Artagnan safely in hand, she looks around and notices she's
just outside a window. She looks in and sees --
A handsome man in a steamy bathroom taking a shower. This is
COLIN ANDERSON.
ABBY (CONT'D)
Oh, my.
Abby covers the cat's eyes, then looks away. But a moment
later, she's looking back in the window, to see --
Colin step out of the shower. Abby takes a deep breath as he
crosses to the mirror, giving her a look at his abs.
ABBY (CONT'D)
Oh, my, my...
Abby leans closer to see Colin start flossing, wearing only a
towel.
ABBY (CONT'D)
(a delighted gasp)
He flosses...
Suddenly we hear a CRACK, and the branch breaks. Colin looks
out the window and makes eye contact with Abby just as --
ABBY (CONT'D)
Ahhhh!
D'Artagnan leaps to another branch as Abby falls. As she
plummets, her foot gets caught between some branches, leaving
her now HANGING UPSIDE DOWN.
ABBY (CONT'D)
Help!
The front lights SWITCH ON and Colin, still in a towel, races
out of his condo. As he runs up to the tree --
COLIN
Just stay calm. You're gonna be

She DROPS out of his arms and onto the ground. As she goes,
his TOWEL GOES WITH HER. Landing on her face.
COLIN
Whoops.
She pulls the towel away and looks up, trying not to make eye
contact with the one-eyed trouser snake staring back at her.
ABBY
Hi, I'm Abby.

Abby hates herself.
ABBY
I'm such an idiot --
She starts doing a SELF-HATING SPAZZY DANCE, mocking her

She freezes.

Yes. I'm going now. Good night.
She walks off, trying to maintain her dignity.

Abby and Mike walk down the street.
MIKE
Rule number one. Never criticize.
ABBY
Even if it's constructive?
MIKE
Never. Men are incapable of growth,
change or progress. For men, self-
improvement ends at toilet-
training. Rule number two. Laugh at
whatever he says.
ABBY
What if what he's saying isn't
funny?
MIKE
That's irrelevant. A fake laugh is
like a fake orgasm.
ABBY
And a fake orgasm is good?
MIKE
No, but a fake orgasm is better
than no orgasm at all.

A fake orgasm is no orgasm.

ABBY
You'll never know.
He raises an eyebrow, impressed.

Mike and Abby walk along, coffees in hand.
MIKE
Rule number four. Men are very
visual. Ninety percent of a
relationship is based on how good
the woman looks. We have to change
your look.
ABBY
What's wrong with my look?
MIKE
(taking her in)
Sports bras? Khakis? Srunchies?
Nurse shoes?
ABBY
These aren't nurse shoes! They're
Lady Keds.
MIKE
Abby, you're a very attractive
woman but you are completely
inaccessible. You're all about
comfort and efficiency.
ABBY
What's wrong with comfort and
efficiency?

Nothing. Except no one wants to

We INTERCUT with Mike.
MIKE
There's no right answer to that

Abby does something between a nod and shaking her head. Colin
hooks at her, confused.
COLIN
I'm really more of a fair weather
fan myself. I do like watching Mike
DeLoggia pitch, though. Amazing
bone structure.
MIKE
Laugh.
Abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly. Colin looks
at her.
COLIN
What's so funny?
ABBY
Your joke.

Shit, he was serious?

There's an awkward moment as Colin hands her the hot dog.

Alright, we need a recovery. Make

Repulsed, she flinches, losing control of her drink, DUMPING

It looks like Abby is giving Colin an enthusiastic HAND JOB.
The ENTIRE STADIUM, ballplayers included, stop what they're

ABBY (CONT'D)
Are you sure they're cotton cause
this should be coming out, wait...
it's coming. It's definitely

She smiles at Colin. As he looks nervously up at the

DR. LESTER
Of all primates, Bonobos are the
closest relatives to human beings,
both genetically and socially -
especially when it comes to sex.
For the Bonobo, sex is a way to
ease stress and diffuse tensions.
MIKE
So summing up Bonobo-land, the
chicks look great, get freaky in
bed and in turn, they get to sit on
their asses and boss their men
around all day.

As he opens the door and goes inside, Jonah calls out --
JONAH
I'm pretty sure you don't want to
open your new show with that.

On the field that is covered with hot air balloons and their
pilots and aficionados, Abby and Joy stand with Mike's
replacement -- JACK MAGNUM, a fast-talking slickster who
thinks he's really fucking cool.

JACK MAGNUM
How's my skin? Too shiny?
How are
my pores?
JOY
Tiny.
JACK MAGNUM
Which side is better? Left? Right?
Full-frontal?
Joy looks at Abby, a little worried.
ABBY
They're all fine. But let's go
over your intro.
(prompting him)
"I'm Jack Magnum and this is..."
JACK MAGNUM
The Ugly Truth!
He fake-smiles and does the "point-and-shoot", going so far
as to blow the smoke off his fingertip gun.
ABBY
Oh-kay.
Let's maybe lose the gun.
JACK MAGNUM
What?
The gun is my signature
move.
ABBY
(impatient)
Unless the NRA is paying your
mortgage this month, I say lose the
fucking gun.
JOY
And we're live in -- five, four,
three, two --
104
106
Abby looks at Joy, panicked.
ABBY
He's ad-libbing. Why is he ad-
libbing? There's no ad-libbing.
107
109
Abby stands in the basket, still nervous, but flying on
adrenaline. Joy gives her a "keep going" hand gesture.
ABBY
Take Mike Alexander, for instance.
He up and quit the show without so
much as a word. You think you know
what men are going to do, you think
you know what they want to do...but
when it comes down to the moment
where they actually have to nut up,
they turn around and do something
completely different.

Joy and the camera guy watch as Abby gains steam, ranting to
the camera. B-CAMERA, strapped to the basket, also records.
ABBY
The big, strong, romantic men we've
been reading about in novels and
watching in movies since we were
nine? They're fallacies. "Blue
Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie.
Men are not strong. Men are not
brave. Men are afraid.
112
113
Mike's truck careens into the parking lot. He gets out,
racing towards the field.
114
114
Abby is now on a total tear.
ABBY
...They're afraid to say what they
feel. Afraid to grow up. Afraid to
tell the truth.

Mike pushes through the crowd of balloon lovers.
117
117
Abby continues her impassioned tirade.
ABBY
Even if they have a moment in a
hotel elevator that's totally
romantic and filled with potential,
men are completely incapable of
copping to it. Because men are
weak.
MIKE (O.S.)
Let me tell you something about
women.
She turns to see --
MIKE standing there. He pushes past Joy and climbs into the
balloon. Grabbing the mic from Abby's hand.
ABBY
Hey --
MIKE
(ignoring her; to camera)
Women would have us believe that
they are the victims. They aren't.
They want us to think that we break
their hearts for sport. That's
crap. They say they want romance.
They say they want true love, but
all they want is a checklist. Is he
perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a
doctor?
118
119
Abby glares at Mike.
ABBY
That is not true.
BY THE CAMERAMAN, Joy shrugs.
JOY
Well, kinda true.
Mike continues his rant.
MIKE
You men that fit the criteria --
don't kid yourselves. They're not
sleeping with you. They're sleeping
with a carefully calculated set of
venal choices. Money over
substance. Looks over soul. Polish
over principles. No gesture, no
matter how real or romantic, will
ever compensate for a really
impressive list of credentials.
ABBY
Says the man who's never made a
gesture except for this one --
She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture.
MIKE
So, the elevator wasn't a gesture?
ABBY
The elevator was a moment of
passion, followed by a moment of
panic on your part, apparently.
120
121
Mike glares at Abby.
MIKE
I came by your room!
ABBY
And then you ran away.
MIKE
Well, that wasn't panic,
sweetheart. It was an unwillingness
to compete with the walking
checklist that was in your bed. You
should be thanking me.
NEARBY, Joy taps her watch.
JOY
We have ten seconds.
An OVERZEALOUS BALLOON PILOT walks up.
PILOT
Are we ready to soar up, up and
away?
IN THE BASKET, Mike looks at the camera.
MIKE
And that's the Ugly Truth, folks. A
girl in heat for two guys will
always pick the one with the better
resume.
BEHIND HIM, the Pilot silently boards the balloon.
ABBY
That is bullsh --
The TORCH of the BALLOON is suddenly fired, covering her FBC
violation.
The cameraman follows the balloon as it slowly starts to
rise.
JOY
...And we're out.
(then; sotto)
Keep rolling on B-camera.

Now holding champagne glasses, a disgusted Mike and Abby look
at opposite ends of the sky, hating that they are trapped
together.
MIKE
Hey! I know -- we can pass the time
with you telling me how much fun
you and Colin had having sex in Los
Angeles.
ABBY
I broke up with Colin in Los
Angeles, jackass.
Mike is thrown, turning to look at her.
MIKE
What?
PILOT
To our left, we have the Sandia
Mountains, glistening in the
afternoon twilight...
Abby ignores the pilot.
ABBY
Oh, that got your interest? If you
think we're going to finish what we
started in LA, you're out of your
mind. You lost your chance.
PILOT
And to our right, you'll see the
Rio Grande River winding its way
through the diochramatic
landscape...
Mike ignores the pilot as well.
MIKE
I never had a chance with you.
PILOT
And off in the distance, we have
the Petroglyph National Monument,
where --
ABBY
(to the Pilot)
Can you stop talking, please?

ABBY (cont'd)
(to Mike)
You're right. I had a momentary
lapse in judgement where I thought
you might be more than you are. But
you aren't. Clearly.
MIKE
What does that mean?
ABBY
(mocking)
"I'm Mike Alexander. I like girls
in Jello. I like to fuck like a
monkey. Don't fall in love -- it's
`scary.'"
125

Joy talks on the phone to Stuart.
JOY
Don't worry, I saw this coming, so
I got us a three second delay.
126
131
On the phone, Joy hi-fives the cameraman, then quickly
composes herself.
JOY
(into phone)
I feel good about it.
132
133
CLOSE ON Mike, as he addresses the camera. He holds a mic,
wears a tuxedo and speaks in a hushed voice.

MIKE
As many of you know, sometimes a
guy's gotta admit what he thought
was the truth isn't necessarily the
whole truth. Yes, women have a
checklist, but sometimes that list
includes a foul-mouthed idiot who
took way too long to realize he was
in love.
(holds up a finger)
Let's continue this conversation in
a second.
WE PULL BACK to REVEAL --
Mike is standing in a garden with rows and rows of WEDDING
GUESTS seated behind him. An altar with flowers and a
minister wait patiently.
Mike gestures for the camera to follow him as he makes his
way up to the altar.
As he arrives he greets his groomsman, JONAH, also wearing a
tux. He only has eyes for Joy, Abby's bridesmaid.
JONAH
(to Joy)
Has anyone ever told you you have a
stupendous bosom?
JOY
Not lately, so feel free to say it
again.
A string quartet's version of "HERE COMES THE BRIDE" begins,
as we PAN OVER to see --
ABBY, in a wedding dress, about to make her way up the aisle.
Looking absolutely beautiful.
MIKE
(wowed; to camera)
Zoom in on this, guys. I want the
whole city to see how lucky I am.
The cameraman ZOOMS IN on Abby, as she catches Mike's eye and
smiles.
IN THE AUDIENCE, Elizabeth takes photo after photo. Her date
-- a dead ringer for Jim Morrison -- looks at her, amused.

ELIZABETH
What? No one's ever going to
believe this. I need proof.
AT THE ALTAR, Abby finally arrives and looks at Mike.
ABBY
(re the cameras)
What's this?
MIKE
Hope you don't mind, but we're
live.
ABBY
(re the cameraman)
No, what's Jorge doing so close?
We need a master.
MIKE
(surprised)
You knew about this?
ABBY
Hello...I'm the producer. It's
sweeps week. How do you think I
got them to pay for this?
She gestures to -- BOB and HAROLD from Corporate, who sit in
the audience.
Mike looks momentarily surprised, then --
MIKE
God, I love you.
He turns to the camera.
MIKE
So, here it is, guys. The games,
the manipulation, the ploys, the
tactics... all the things we do to
think we're in control. But guess
what? We never are.
Abby leans over his shoulder.
ABBY
(to the camera)
Isn't it beautiful?
