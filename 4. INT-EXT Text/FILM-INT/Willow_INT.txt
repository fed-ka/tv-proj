The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.
Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.
In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.
The screaming stops.
There's a
moment of silence.
As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.
In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.
DRUID
Is it a girl?
ETHNA
It is a girl.
DRUID
Show me its arm.
Ethna peels back the swaddling.
On the baby's arm is a
small marking.
DRUID
It's true then.
I must tell Queen
Bavmorda.
With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.
Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.
The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.
Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.
MOTHER
Ethna, please.
Help me.
They're
going to kill my baby.
Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.
ETHNA
They'll kill you.
MOTHER
Please save my baby.
Ethna hesitates.
Then decides.
She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.
ETHNA
Pretend this is the child.
MOTHER
Thank you, Ethna.
Thank you.
The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.
Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.
The mother lies back and sighs with relief.
Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.
QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.
The druid hurries
alongside.
BAVMORDA
We will start the ritual at dusk.
You're certain this is the one?
DRUID
It bears the markings.
BAVMORDA
I must see for myself!
Just as the
omen foretold!
The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.
BAVMORDA
So.
You *were* the one.
MOTHER
Yes.
But nothing you can do will
stop the prophecy.
BAVMORDA
This child will have no power over
me....
Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.
BAVMORDA
(furiously)
Where's the baby!
One of the guards looks up the stairs.
GUARD
The midwife!
Bavmorda flies into a rage.
BAVMORDA
Find that baby!
Use the dogs!
Sorsha!
Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.
Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.
BAVMORDA
Kill her.
Bavmorda storms away with the druid.
WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.
War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.
Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.
WILLOW
This is bad.
If we're caught with
that little daikini it'll be the
end of us.
Careful, Ranon, I need
that for the festival.
(indicates magic cloth)
Kiaya, what are we going to do?
KIAYA
We're gonna give this baby a bath.
The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.
WILLOW
Burglekutt's right.
There's not
enough time to finish plowing.
We'll lose everything and I'll end
up working in the mines.
He shudders at the thought.
KIAYA
Willow, do you think we should take
her to the Village Council?
WILLOW
No, no!
They'll think it's a bad
omen.
There'll be a flood or a
drought or a plague and
everybody'll blame me for it!
RANON
Look.
What's that?
Willow leans forward.
On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.
It only adds
to Willow's fears.
WILLOW
I don't know.
This is trouble.
I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
it tomorrow at the Festival.
The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.
Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.
Relieved, he throws his arms around her.
WILLOW
We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.
We
must take her to the Council.
The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.
Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.
Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.
BURGLEKUTT
An evil beast from the outer world
has invaded our peaceful village,
looking for a baby!
This only adds to the frenzy.
A VILLAGER
It's a sign!
An omen!
ANOTHER VILLAGER
Our crops will die!
BURGLEKUTT
Silence!
One beast we can kill.
But there may be more!
And they
won't give up their search till
they've found what they're looking
for!
MEEGOSH
Whose baby is it!
OTHER VILLAGERS
Who's to blame for this!
Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.
As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.
At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.
The High
Aldwin raises his hand.
It flashes magically.
He
points as he speaks:
HIGH ALDWIN
Willow Ufgood!
Come before me!
The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.
Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.
Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.
HIGH ALDWIN
Earlier today you tried to tell me
something, Willow.
WILLOW
(bows his head)
My family found this baby in the
river, High Aldwin.
The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.
He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.
HIGH ALDWIN
A daikini child...
(his eyes close)
...of some importance, I feel...
BURGLEKUTT
That's what the beasts want!
Give
it back!
The crowd rumbles, many agree.
WILLOW
They'll kill her!
We can't let
this baby die!
BURGLEKUTT
What do we care!
Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.
The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:
HIGH ALDWIN
...importance...yes...this child
is special...
COUNCILMAN
What should we do?
Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.
HIGH ALDWIN
This child must be taken beyond the
boundaries of our village.
All the
way to the daikini crossroads.
The room goes silent.
A VILLAGER
Who will do that?
SEVERAL VILLAGERS
Vohnkar!
Vohnkar!
Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.
HIGH ALDWIN
The outer world is dangerous and
corrupt, Vohnkar.
And this baby is
hunted by blood-hungry beasts.
Are
you willing to sacrifice your life?
Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.
VOHNKAR
If I go, who'll defend you if other
beasts attack?
The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.
BURGLEKUTT
He's right!
It seems only fair
that the man to take this baby to
the crossroads...
(walking stick up)
...be the very man who plucked
it...
(walking stick down)
...out of the river!
All eyes turn to Willow.
Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.
WILLOW
I can't do it!
I haven't put my
crop in!
A COUNCILMAN
You caused this trouble.
You found
the baby...you get rid of it!
BURGLEKUTT
I nominate Willow Ufgood!
The crowd cheers wildly.
The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.
With a flourish he waves
his arms.
HIGH ALDWIN
I will consult the bones!
Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.
The
crowd jumps away.
The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.
He leans down and studies
the bones.
Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.
The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:
HIGH ALDWIN
The bones tell me nothing.
(he eyes Willow)
But I must make a decision.
Is
there love in your heart for this
child?
Willow hesitates.
He looks at the baby.
WILLOW
Yes.
The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:
HIGH ALDWIN
The bones have spoken!
Willow?
The security of this village
depends on you!
The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.
Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.
Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.
MIMS
Dada?
Willow sets the baby down.
He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.
MIMS
Watch out for brownies, Dada.
WILLOW
I will, Mims.
Goodnight.
He smiles and kisses her.
Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.
RANON
Dada, what's a daikini?
WILLOW
Daikinis are giant people who live
far far away.
RANON
Are you scared?
Willow shrugs.
Ranon sits up in bed.
RANON
I could be you rguard!
I could
carry your spear!
WILLOW
(smiles)
What a great son you are, Ranon.
I
wish I could take you with me.
Now
go to sleep...
Ranon slides down under his blankets.
Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.
Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.
His feet and wrists are being bound.
Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.
They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.
WILLOW
(focusing)
Where am I?
Where's the baby?
FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:
FRANJEAN
I am Franjean, king of the world.
Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.
WILLOW
That baby's my responsibility!
Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.
FRANJEAN
I don't care.
We paid for her.
Go
back to sleep, monsieur...
As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.
The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.
He
pricks Willow's arm.
WILLOW
Yeow!
(he loses consciousness)
Madmartigan...I never should've
trusted you...
FADE TO BLACK
Willow's eyes open.
A wild little face is looking at
him.
A wild little person is standing on his chest.
TEEMO
Tongue.
Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.
Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.
He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.
WILLOW
Who are you?
ROOL
Quiet, you fool!
TEEMO
(formal)
We are emissaries of her majesty,
Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
Coshairm.
WILLOW
Queen Cherlindrea?
TEEMO
She requests the presence of your-
self and the young princess.
WILLOW
Who??
TEEMO
You're the guardian, aren't you?
ROOL
Quit yakking, Teemo.
We gotta get
outa here!
Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.
The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.
He squeezes
through.
Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.
Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.
They hear the baby crying.
They peek
through the door.
Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.
Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.
TEEMO
Elves!
They're always tormenting
babies.
They make them cry and
take their tears.
ROOL
Somebody has to do it.
WILLOW
Why??
ROOL
How else they gonna make dew drops?
The baby shrieks.
WILLOW
I'm getting her out of there!
TEEMO
No!
You let us handle this.
Come
along, Rool!
Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.
They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.
The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.
With confidence he
smiles at Rool.
TEEMO
Watch this.
Right between the
eyes.
ROOL
(to the elves)
He never misses.
Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.
With
all his might he throws.
His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.
TEEMO
Ooops.
Was that right?
That
wasn't right.
Suddenly the entire wall implodes.
The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.
The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.
WILLOW
Could you spare some milk for this
poor hungry baby?
Everyone looks up.
Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.
BARMAID
Get outa here, Peck!
PATRONS
A Peck!
Get him out!
Beat it,
Peck!
They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.
Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.
He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.
WILLOW
I could use your help, boys.
Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.
Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.
He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.
Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.
He
creeps out.
And bravely reaches for the milk.
TEEMO'S VOICE
Willow?
Willow slaps his pocket.
Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.
And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.
WILLOW
This is not fun.
He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.
Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.
WILLOW
Woah!
The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.
Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.
One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.
WENCH
Hurry!
Hurry!
Very frightened, she looks out the window.
The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.
THE OTHER WOMAN
(in a gruff voice)
How do I look?
It's Madmartigan!
Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.
WILLOW
You!!
MADMARTIGAN
Where the hell did you come from?
Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.
WILLOW
I trusted you...
The brownies peek out.
ROOL
Who's he?
MADMARTIGAN
You're crawling with rodents.
The bedroom door explodes open.
In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.
LLUG
Where is he!!
Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.
The
wench innocently curtsies.
WENCH
There's nobody here except me and
my, um, cousin.
Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.
He speaks in a high feminine voice.
MADMARTIGAN
How do you do.
Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.
He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.
WILLOW
Hey!
Give me that baby!
MADMARTIGAN
(high voice)
These Pecks make terrible nurse-
maids.
WILLOW
Nursemaid?!
Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.
MADMARTIGAN
(high voice)
They get too excited.
With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.
Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.
LLUG
Wanna breeeeeeed?
Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.
Then he smells the baby.
He winces
and groans.
WILLOW
(mischievously)
Time to change her diaper.
MADMARTIGAN
Time to leave.
Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.
But
he doesn't get very far.
Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.
Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.
Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.
The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.
In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.
Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.
Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.
SORSHA
You!
Are you the mother of that
child?
MADMARTIGAN
No.
(looks at Llug; in a high voice)
I mean yes.
Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.
SORSHA
Let me see it.
Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.
MADMARTIGAN
(high voice)
I can't.
SORSHA
Let me see it.
WILLOW
No!
You can't!
Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.
MADMARTIGAN
(high voice)
I can't.
SORSHA
Why not?
MADMARTIGAN
(to Willow)
Why not?
WILLOW
Because she's sick.
MADMARTIGAN
(to Sorsha)
Because she's sick.
SORSHA
Give it to me!
Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.
Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.
The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.
Sorsha regains her balance.
She rips off her black
helmet.
Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.
MADMARTIGAN
(high voice)
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
SORSHA
You're not a woman.
Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.
The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.
LLUG
Not a woman??!!
All hell breaks loose.
Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.
Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.
Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.
Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.
SORSHA
After them!!
She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.
The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.
Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.
SORSHA
This baby won't do what I say.
You
seem to know what to do.
Here!
Make it shut up.
Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.
WILLOW
She needs to be changed.
SORSHA
I changed her already!
Willow politely shrugs.
WILLOW
She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.
Soon the baby stops crying.
Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.
Then his eyes focus on the fire.
SORSHA
Who is that horrible friend of
yours?
WILLOW
(watching the fire)
Madmartigan.
SORSHA
Who is he?
WILLOW
I don't know much about him.
Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.
Willow creeps
toward the fire.
SORSHA
He's very bold.
Do you really
think my hair is beautiful?
She turns and looks right at Willow.
He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.
WILLOW
Uh, yes.
It's very nice hair.
He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.
WILLOW
She's hungry.
SORSHA
I know she's hungry.
I tried to
feed her but she wouldn't eat a
thing.
I'm not a wet nurse.
WILLOW
Here.
Hold her.
He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.
He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.
At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.
SORSHA
I tried everything.
A spoon.
I
poured milk into her mouth, she just
spat it out.
I don't know what to
do, I'm not a mother.
During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.
It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.
He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.
WILLOW
Sometimes she likes it heated.
Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.
He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.
WILLOW
She's a good baby.
Sorsha looks down at the baby.
Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.
In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.
Starts to
leave.
But stops.
Willow pokes his head inside.
WILLOW
(whispers)
Come on, Madmartigan...!
Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.
Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.
WILLOW
What are you doing?
Get out of
there...!
Madmartigan looks down at her.
Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.
Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.
Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:
MADMARTIGAN
I love you.
He kisses her lips.
Her eyes open.
SORSHA
One move, and you really will be a
woman.
Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.
SORSHA
You're a fool.
Now put her back.
MADMARTIGAN
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Sorsha presses the knife.
SORSHA
Don't make me kill you.
Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.
MADMARTIGAN
I believe you would...
Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.
Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.
SORSHA
Why did you say that?
MADMARTIGAN
Say what?
SORSHA
I love you.
Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.
Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.
MADMARTIGAN
Because it's true.
SORSHA
I don't believe you.
Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.
He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.
For once, he isn't
conning anybody.
His feelings are genuine.
MADMARTIGAN
I wish it weren't true.
I swore
I'd never let this happen.
I hate
you.
I hate your beauty, I hate
your innocence, I hate the feelings
you've awakened in me.
The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.
MADMARTIGAN
I'm in love with you, Sorsha.
I
don't want to be, but a power has
enchanted me and I stand helpless
against it.
It's torture.
Battle-
field or prison cell was never half
as cruel.
He kneels onto her bed.
Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.
MADMARTIGAN
I want you and I can't have you so
I want you all the more.
If this
were another time and another place
I'd--
He stops.
He looks into her eyes.
Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.
SORSHA
You'd what?
Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.
Until:
They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.
It all happens
quickly.
Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.
In one hand he holds the baby.
In the
other hand:
Willow.
KAEL
What's going on here!!
Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.
SORSHA
Deceiver!!
Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.
Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.
Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.
Grabs it.
As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.
They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.
Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.
MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.
Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.
Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:
his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.
AIRK
Madmartigan.
Settled down with a
family huh?
Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.
MADMARTIGAN
You left me to die, friend.
AIRK
You managed alright.
MADMARTIGAN
Is this what's left of your army?
Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.
One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.
OFFICER
Keep that baby quiet.
They hear hoofbeats outside.
Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.
He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.
Willow holds the baby tight.
Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.
Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.
A door opens.
Nobody breathes.
Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.
Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.
They see her.
Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:
OFFICER
Kill her.
Madmartigam shakes his head.
MADMARTIGAN
You'll draw the others.
Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.
Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.
At last she goes back
upstairs.
Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.
In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.
Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.
The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.
Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.
Everyone sighs with relief.
Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.
AIRK
It's you they're after, Madmarti-
gan.
What did you do this time?
MADMARTIGAN
They're not after me.
They want
the baby.
Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.
He watches and listens.
AIRK
Who is this baby?
Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.
WILLOW
The princess, Elora Danan.
They all know of her.
They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.
PEOPLE
The prophecy has come true.
AIRK
Give her to us.
We'll protect her.
Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.
RAZIEL
Not safe!
Not safe!
Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.
WILLOW
We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
She'll be safe there from
Bavmorda's powers.
Airk looks up at Raziel.
Then down at Willow.
He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.
AIRK
Tir Asleen is a myth.
It doesn't
exist.
RAZIEL
It does!
It does!
I will show
you!
Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.
AIRK
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
I've lost half my men fighting
Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
maar army.
Now you and this Peck,
and that magpie up in the rafters,
are gonna take 'em on alone?
MADMARTIGAN
(challenging)
Then come with us.
Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.
AIRK
The war is here!
In towns and vil-
lages like this!
Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.
AIRK
You're chasing a dream.
MADMARTIGAN
Just get me some horses.
Airk glares at him furiously.
Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.
Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.
Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.
WILLOW
Madmartigan!
I can't stand being
in closed-in places.
MADMARTIGAN
Want me to carry Elora?
WILLOW
I'm used to her.
How's she doing?
Willow wears the papoose on his back.
Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.
MADMARTIGAN
She's doing a lot better than we
are, Peck.
Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.
They keep
going.
Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.
Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.
they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.
Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.
MADMARTIGAN
Willow...this may be a bad time to
ask this question but...what if
Raziel's wrong?
WILLOW
She can't be wrong.
She's a very
very very powerful sorceress.
MADMARTIGAN
She's a bird, Willow.
WILLOW
That's my fault, not hers.
I've
got to keep practicing.
I'm still
in the learning stage but magic,
Madmartigan, requires concentration
and--
MADMARTIGAN
Watch it!
WILLOW
Ahhh!
Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.
He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.
They stop.
They hear something.
Something
strange.
Then, something moves on the wall.
WILLOW
I hate this.
The cave walls come to life.
Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.
Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.
Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.
Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.
Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.
MADMARTIGAN
Go, Willow!
Run!
Run!
Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.
Mad-
martigan waits.
The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.
Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.
As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.
The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.
Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.
But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.
The horses rear and back away.
Madmartigan stands there, wondering.
Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.
He turns.
The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.
MADMARTIGAN
Willow!
Willow!
He looks around frantically.
Willow is nowhere to be
seen.
Then the baby cries out.
Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.
He runs toward them.
The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.
KAEL
Go after them!
Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.
He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.
Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.
Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.
Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.
Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.
MADMARTIGAN
Hurry, Willow!
Throw it!
Willow winds up and throws with all his might.
The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.
Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.
The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.
The
soldier's body turns to stone.
RAZIEL
Look out!
One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.
Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.
He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.
The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.
Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.
KAEL
After them!!
But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.
The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.
They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.
Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.
A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.
RAZIEL
Tir Asleen.
WILLOW
There's nobody here.
They approach the twelve pillars.
RAZIEL
The Knights of the Pacalcade.
The
king's bravest warriors.
Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.
Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.
RAZIEL
Turn them back, Willow!
Willow stares at the twelve knights.
WILLOW
How??
RAZIEL
Use the philosopher's stone!
Hur-
ry!
Invocation!
Release them!
The castle door is rusted and old.
madmartigan heaves
against it.
Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.
Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.
He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.
WILLOW
Beings within, beings without!
Danu danu walkail funfawtha!
He continues to chant and to concentrate.
One of the
knights comes to life.
WILLOW
I did it!
Madmartigan!
Come here!
Look!
You gotta see this!
I did
it!
RAZIEL
More!
More!
Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.
Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.
WILLOW
Tuatha tuatha danu!
Each knight shakes himself into action.
Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.
WILLOW
Raziel!
I transformed them all!
I'm a magician!
RAZIEL
You didn't transform them, Willow,
you released them.
That was noth-
ing.
Now change me.
Willow's on a roll.
He rubs his hands together.
WILLOW
I feel like I could do anything!
He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.
The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.
Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.
WILLOW
Capture the enery...limitless
power of the will...avvdachh doth
indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!
Raziel begins to change.
From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.
WILLOW
Raziel?
Is that you?
Oh-oh.
What
happened?
Raziel tilts her goat head.
RAZIEL
I hate this.
Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.
Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.
He makes a run for the hallway.
SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.
Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.
Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.
The six horsement run in and corner him.
He
grabs an enormous broadsword.
Swings it like a base-
ball bat.
The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.
The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.
The remaining
soldiers come after him.
Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.
Kael looks up from his horse.
KAEL
Sorsha!!
He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.
Kael holds up his great
hand.
In it he holds the baby.
KAEL
Bordak!
Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.
KAEL
Kill them both!
He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.
As he reaches it he abruptly stops.
Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.
KAEL
Troops!
To Nockmaar!
Ride with
me!
Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.
Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.
WILLOW
I'm sorry.
There were too many of
them.
Madmartigan scoops him up.
With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.
Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.
He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.
Then creaks the door open.
BAVMORDA looks up.
Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.
BAVMORDA
Kael!
Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.
Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.
Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.
KAEL
Queen Bavmorda.
I have the child.
The baby squirms and cries.
Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.
BAVMORDA
We must start the ritual!
She hears noise outside the castle.
BAVMORDA
Who is that?
KAEL
An army of rebels and traitors.
Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.
Psychically:
BAVMORDA
Where is Sorsha?
KAEL
She has turned against you.
Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.
to her druids:
BAVMORDA
Purify the altar!
Arrange the im-
plements!
I'll deal with Sorsha!
The druids take the baby from Kael.
Bavmorda storms
out the door.
Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.
RAZIEL
Get down!
The ritual chant!
Quick!
Protect yourself!
WILLOW
Why?
RAZIEL
Just do it!
Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.
door.
Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.
BAVMORDA
Begin the ritual.
Now!
Light the
first candle.
A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.
Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.
In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.
BAVMORDA
Come, thunder.
Come lightning.
Touch this altar with your pwer.
Come into my tower...
Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.
Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.
A druid places teh baby on the altar.
The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.
Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.
Her face contorts as she recites:
BAVMORDA
Dark runes, dark powers!
Blend and
bind, bind and blend, Universal
night!
And the might of Nockmaar!
Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.
Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.
Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.
RAZIEL
It's over, Willow.
You did well.
You protected yourself.
Willow looks up.
He hears the grunting outside.
With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.
Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.
WILLOW
I've come all this way and now
Elora Dana's going to die!
RAZIEL
No!
I can still defeat Bavmorda!
WILLOW
She's too powerful, Raziel
Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.
RAZIEL
A true magician, Willow, never
surrenders.
She is a sorceress--I
am a sorceress!
Transform me now
and I will destroy her!
Hexagram!
Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.
He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.
WILLOW
Banish all disturbing forces from
this place.
Fire, water, above and
below.
Balance.
Balance.
Bal-
ance.
Raziel begins to change.
Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.
RAZIEL
(voice distorted)
Don't give up!
Willow!
He chants and strains.
Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.
Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.
At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.
Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.
WILLOW
Raziel!
She looks down at her old hands.
Then her eyes focus
with purpose.
RAZIEL
We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
low.
Bring in our brave men.
Willow opens the tent.
Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.
A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.
The baby
shrieks.
Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.
BAVMORDA
Black fire forever kindled within,
Let the second right begin!
With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.
The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.
Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.
AIRK
Uphill with our rough weapons,
we'll never make it!
SORSHA
Elora Danan will die!
RAZIEL
By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
runic drum!
WARRIOR
Bavmorda is too powerful.
We need
more forces.
I say we retreat!
The other warriors agree.
RAZIEL
Bavmorda cannot transform you.
I've protected this camp with a
spell.
MADMARTIGAN
Can you use your magic to get our
men into the fortress, Raziel?
Raziel shakes her head.
RAZIEL
Bavmorda has shielded it with a
spell of her own.
The warriors grumble and protest.
In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.
Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.
The warriors rumble.
WILLOW
Wait!!
Willow jumps to his feet.
They all turn to him.
WILLOW
I have an idea.
Back in my village
we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
MADMARTIGAN
Willow, this is war, not agricul-
ture!
WILLOW
I know, I know!
But this is a way
to get into that castle...
The all gather around Willow to listen.
Thunder rumbles.
Bavmorda looks up.
Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.
Now three candles
are lit.
The baby screams on the altar.
With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.
The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.
They all look at Willow.
AIRK
It's too much work.
WARRIOR
It can't be done.
SORSHA
Kael will never fall for it.
Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.
MADMARTIGAN
(doubtful)
I don't know, Willow.
WILLOW
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
take care of Elora Danan like your
own daughter.
She is all that
matters.
Are you going to abandon
her?
Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.
AIRK
Come on, Madmartigan.
you gonna
listen to a Peck?
You and I are
warriors.
You know this plan will
never work.
Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.
Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.
MADMARTIGAN
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
SORSHA
I have no family.
The gong rings four time.
Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.
RAZIEL
If we do not fight, and the baby
dies, all hope for the future is
lost.
I shall face the danger
alone if I have to.
The men shake their heads.
WILLOW
Me, too.
Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.
MADMARTIGAN
Time is running out.
We must now
decide who's going to leave and who
is going to stay...
The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.
The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.
BAVMORDA
Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!
Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.
The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.
Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.
Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.
Airk sets Willow
down.
Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.
Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.
Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.
AIRK
Let's squah 'em!
In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.
ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY
Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.
SORSHA
No, Willow!!
She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.
A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.
Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.
They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.
Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.
At the top in THE DOOR.
Light throbs
behind it.
Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.
Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.
SORSHA
I will face my mother alone.
Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.
Sorsha
climbs to the door.
Courageously, she opens it.
Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.
BAVMORDA
Sorsha!!
Sorsha recoils in horror.
Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.
She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.
Sorsha
kills them.
The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.
SORSHA
I won't let you kill her!
Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!
BAVMORDA
You are a weakling.
Like you fa-
ther!
Can you not see that I am
about to become all-powerful!
Lightning explodes overhead.
Sorsha lunges for the
baby.
But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.
SORSHA
No!!
Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.
Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:
BAVMORDA
Raziel...!!
The door flies open.
The twelve burning candles all
blow out.
There stands Raziel.
Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.
Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.
The sorceresses face each other.
Battle rages.
Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.
Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.
Like mice, they dart up some stairs.
Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.
The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.
Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.
They look at
each other.
Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.
Willow creeps toward the door.
It suddenly throbs and
flashes.
He jumps back.
Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.
The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.
RAZIEL
The baby will be queen.
It has
been foretold, Bavmorda.
BAVMORDA
My ritual will kill the prophecy!
Now the child dies with it, its en-
ergy exiled into oblivion!
(lightning flashes)
You see?
I hold the power of the
universe!
RAZIEL
Not until your ritual is complete!
BAVMORDA
And who will stop me?
The elements
are slaves to my command!
She points at the sky.
As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.
RAZIEL
There is no one who can match your
sorcery.
Except me!
Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.
Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.
Objects fly about.
The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.
Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.
Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.
Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.
Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.
He hears a yell
and looks up.
Kael strikes Airk down.
MADMARTIGAN
Airk!!
Airk falls down the stairs.
Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.
MADMARTIGAN
Airk!
Airk!
MADMARTIGAN
Madmartigan...you're a brave
warrior...a true friend...a good
man...
MADMARTIGAN
We're gonna win this war, Airk.
An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.
Picks up his sword.
And goes up
the stairs after Kael.
The sorceress continue their battle.
They change
each other into various beasts.
They fight, physically
and magically.
In the midst of chaos, the door opens.
Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.
Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.
BAVMORDA
As above, so below!
Universe of
evil, Raziel!
It conquers even
you!
Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.
Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.
The baby is gone.
Willow races toward the door with the baby.
The door
suddenly slams shut.
Bavmorda's voice roars out:
BAVMORDA
*Stop!
Bring back that child!!!*
Willow stops.
He turns around.
Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.
BAVMORDA
Who are you?
WILLOW
I'm Willow Ufgood.
I'm a magician.
Bavmorda laughs.
Willopw slowly walks toward her.
he
digs into his pocket.
Takes out the last magic acorn.
WILLOW
I'm a *great* magician.
Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.
Her hand shoots
out and catches it.
the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.
Willow
backs away, feeling successful.
But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.
It reverses:
her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.
She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.
BAVMORDA
Is that the extent of your power?
Willow stands there helplessly.
Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.
The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.
Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.
Up and up they go.
A spectacular
swordfight.
Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.
kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.
Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.
Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.
BAVMORDA
Place it on the altar.
WILLOW
No.
You can't have her.
BAVMORDA
By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
the lightning and send this child
into the destructive realm.
Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.
WILLOW
And with my magic I'll send her
into the...into the...
He gropes for a word.
Bavmorda laughs at him.
BAVMORDA
You're no magician.
WILLOW
Into the good.
Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.
her eyes flash.
BAVMORDA
Even I don't have the power to do
that.
You're a fraud.
Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.
Raziel opens her eyes and watches.
The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.
Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!
BAVMORDA
Impossible!
Bordak!
Bordak!
Bavmorda flies into a rage.
She lunges across the
copper altar.
Thunder and lightning!
BAVMORDA
Aaaaahhhh!!!
A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.
She
howls in pain.
Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.
Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.
