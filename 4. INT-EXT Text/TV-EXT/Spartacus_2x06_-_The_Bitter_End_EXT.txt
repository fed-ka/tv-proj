  The darkening sky FLASHES, a storm brewing. The men have 
  gathered. Batiatus leads a procession as Titus  body is 
  carried out on the funerary couch by Oenomaus, Gannicus, 
  Barca, Rhaskos, and Crixus. All in full gladiator gear.

  LUCRETIA

  bears witness from the balcony, her face unreadable.  
  Standing with her are Solonius, NAEVIA, Magistrate Sextus, 
  and a few other Romans.

  TITUS  FUNERARY COUCH

  is placed on a pyre near the edge of the cliff. Ringing it 
  are pedestals displaying the images (im-mag-ees): busts and 
  funerary masks of illustrious ancestors. Gannicus and the 
  other bearers take their place among the men.

                                        BATIATUS
                         We stand upon sacred ground. 
                        Watered with tears of blood.  Words 
                        I often heard spoken in my youth. 
                      By my father.  By his father before 
                        him. Yet only now do I truly 
                        understand them.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

  Batiatus solemnly takes in the assembled men.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      We have all suffered the bitter 
                        sting of loss.

  ANGLE ON OENOMAUS: Feeling it most profoundly.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And yet here we stand. We have felt 
                        the agony of heart ripped yet 
                        beating from sundered chest.

  ANGLE ON GANNICUS: Tears of regret welling in his eyes.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And yet here we stand. The House of 
                        Batiatus is no stranger to 
                        misfortune. To the cruel whims of 
                        the gods, and base men that would 
                        position themselves as such. And 
                        yet. Here. We. Stand.

  Batiatus pauses, letting the power of that sink in.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        This house is built atop unshakable 
                        foundation of respect and honor. 
                        And in no one were such qualities 
                        more evident than Titus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus. A man I often challenged. 
                        A man I often...

  The word  hated  sticks in his throat. He recovers, 
  continues.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You were the very life coursing 
                        through his veins. Even after his 
                        passing, his love for you and this 
                        ludus will live on.  Through 
                        actions of worthy son. I will laud 
                      my father s memory by seeing the 
                        House of Batiatus elevated beyond 
                        the imagining of my ancestors. I 
                        will need all of you to see it 
                        done. Men of hard purpose and 
                        desire.

  ASHUR tenses as he spots DAGAN emerging from the infirmary 
  to join the assembly. A blood-crusted cloth is tied around 
  his ruined eye. His good one burns a hole in Ashur.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.
  CONTINUED:

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Much has slipped from grasp in 
                        recent days. I would close 
                        trembling fingers into tight fist, 
                        and see no more follow in 
                        unfortunate wake. Let previous 
                        decision fall aside. None among you 
                        will be sent to the mines, 
                        regardless of standing!

  Rhaskos and the men react, overjoyed. Dagan glares at Ashur, 
  the implication of impending violence for taking his eye 
  clear.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The sun has set on an era. Let us 
                        celebrate the name of Titus 
                        Lentulus Batiatus with drink and 
                        the clash of swords! Their sound to 
                        carry my father to the afterlife!

  Oenomaus CRACKS his whip. Three pairs of men move into 
  position: Gannicus and Barca; Rhaskos and Gnaeus; Crixus and 
  DURATIUS. Crixus whispers to Gannicus as a SLAVE hands them 
  their weapons. [NOTE: Real weapons, not practice ones.]

                                        CRIXUS
                        Will you fight your man to 
                        conclusion?  Or drop defense and 
                        allow hollow victory, as you did 
                        with me before Titus?

  Gannicus tightens, deadly anger flaring in his eyes.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You are champion now. Do not 
                        fucking broach subject again.

  Gannicus moves into position opposite Barca. Crixus  gaze 
  lingers in discontent before turning to Duratius across from 
  him. Oenomaus hands Batiatus a torch.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let contest be ad vulna, to the 
                        wound.  Spill blood upon the sand, 
                        yet live to one day die with glory 
                        and honor in the arena!

  Batiatus lights the pyre.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Begin!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.
  CONTINUED:

  The three pairs clash together. Batiatus drinks from an 
  AMPHORA OF WINE. Jugs are passed out to the men as they 
  shout encouragement to the combatants. SLOW PUSH IN ON 
  BATIATUS as he watches the fight, the fire illuminating a 
  face etched in stone as hard as that of his ancestors...



  Batiatus cautiously moves down the street, deserted due to 
  the rain. The hood of his cloak raised to better 
    concealment.

  Oenomaus and Barca, also cloaked, follow with Gannicus.  
  Gannicus  hands are bound in chain. Batiatus pauses, peering 
  into the gloom.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  harsh whisper)(
                        Where the fuck are they?

                                        BARCA
                        I will search ahead.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Stay where you are. I would not 
                        have you from my side.

                                        GANNICUS
                      If you had sold me to Tullius, only 
                      my life would be at risk.

                                        BATIATUS
                        With great risk comes greater 
                        reward.  And I shall have mine.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  spotting something)(
                        The Syrian arrives.

  Batiatus turns to see two CLOAKED FIGURES emerge from the 
  shadows at the far end of the street. Batiatus sags in 
  relief. It is short lived.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S.)
                        I have grown weary of these games, 
                        Batiatus.

  Batiatus whirls. Tullius and Vettius appear with Theron and 
  half a dozen well-armed THUGS. Solonius lurks nervously in 
  their wake. Batiatus tenses.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

                        And would see them to bitter end.

  Batiatus eyes Tullius  men -- and grins.

                                        BATIATUS
                      As would I.

  Rhaskos, Duratius, AMBIORIX, and half a dozen of Batiatus  
  armed Gladiators materialize from the darkness (NOTE: Crixus 
  and Dagan are not among them). The Syrian and his companion 
  throw back their hoods, revealing Ashur and Gnaeus. Tullius  
  face drops.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Come. Let us embrace, you fucking 
                        cunt.

  All hell breaks loose as Batiatus  Gladiators attack.  
  Gannicus fends off an attack with his chain, whipping it to 
  smash the teeth out of a Thug.

  OENOMAUS

  goes for Tullius. A Thug intercepts him. Oenomaus snarls, 
  rage exploding as he brutally lays into the Thug.

  WEAPONS CLASH

  in the night. Blood flows. One of Batiatus  men is struck 
  down, landing at Solonius  feet. Solonius gawks at the 
  carnage, paralyzed by blind fear.

  VETTIUS

  grabs up the sword of Batiatus  fallen man and desperately 
  attempts to aid Tullius -- only to be clocked by Gannicus  
  chain. Vettius goes down hard, unconscious.

  ASHUR

  splits a Thug open, laughing as the man s blood splashes the 
  ground. Gnaeus hacks a Thug s arm off nearby.

  TULLIUS

  kicks Rhaskos back, tries to make a break for it.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Stop him!

  Gannicus tries to get to him, his eyes wild with bloodlust 
  as he smashes Thugs out of the way with his chain.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

  THERON

  appears behind Batiatus, sword raised for the death blow.

                                        BARCA
                        Dominus!

  Batiatus whirls just as Barca slams into Theron. The two 
  exchange blows, but Barca is stabbed in the side. He grunts 
  in surprise as Theron moves in for the kill. Theron suddenly 
  stiffens, reaching in shock to feel the back of his head.

  THERON CRUMBLES,

  revealing a DAGGER sticking out of the back of his skull, 
  courtesy of Batiatus. Batiatus goes nuts, kicking at the 
  dead man s body.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fuck your cock! You fucking shit! 
                        Fuck!

  Tullius runs a man through. He raises his sword to strike 
  Oenomaus, who is distracted trading blows with a Thug.  
  Gannicus whips his chain around Tullius  neck, yanking him 
  back.

  TULLIUS GASPS,

  his sword falling as the chain bites into his flesh.  
  Gannicus tightens it with all his strength, his eyes wild 
  with the thirst for revenge.

  OENOMAUS

  spots the struggle. He finishes off his man and rears his 
  sword back with a snarl to kill Tullius.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Hold!

  Oenomaus whips his head around to find Batiatus approaching, 
  out of breath and splattered with blood. The fight is over.  
  Vettius lays unconscious. Barca wounded. Tullius  men dead 
  or nearly so.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Such a death... would be far too 
                        quick.

  Gannicus looks to Oenomaus. Willing to disobey if Oenomaus 
  chooses it. Oenomaus barely controls his rage, lowering his 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

  drops to his knees, gasping for air.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Bind him.

  Gannicus and Oenomaus move to comply. Batiatus levels his 
  gaze at Solonius, still frozen in place.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And you.

  Batiatus breaks into a shit-eating grin.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You fucking played this to 
                        perfection!

  Solonius bows with a humble smile. Ratting Batiatus out was 
  all part of the plan.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      It was not difficult. When passion 
                        for vengeance overtakes caution, 
                        even the keenest mind is easily 
                        deceived.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Modest to the fucking last.

  Ashur slits a dying Thug s throat. Checks his robes for 
  anything of worth.

                        You are sure to your purpose?

  Solonius  eyes gleam as they fall on the unconscious 
  Vettius.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      My path has never been clearer.

  Batiatus nods, turning to Tullius who has been bound and 
  gagged.

                        Good Tullius. Let us have final 
                        words.  Before you part this 
                        fucking life.

  OFF BATIATUS  deadly smile...



  The arena we are used to seeing from season one. The crowd 
  cheers as HORSEMEN parade around the sand. MEN follow 
  carrying the carcass of a SLAUGHTERED BULL split in half.

  PULVINUS

  Magistrate Sextus, VARUS, COSSUTIUS, and other Romans drink 
  and laugh. Batiatus stands with Lucretia (red wig). Naevia 
  attends. Batiatus takes in the arena, his heart swelling at 
  finally achieving a seat in the pulvinus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Have eyes ever beheld such a sight?

                        viewed from the pulvinus.

  Varus allows Batiatus and Lucretia a measured smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      An honor, to be invited by Tullius.

                                        BATIATUS
                        One I fear undeserved. Yet he is a 
                        difficult man to turn from.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        A fact well known to all present.

                        I am surprised by his delay. The 
                        opening of the arena has been the 
                        only subject on his tongue. Now he 
                        stands late to his own celebration.

  Vettius enters with Solonius in tow.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                        Apologies. Tullius regrets he will 
                      be absent altogether.

  The pulvinus erupts in stunned murmurs. Batiatus interjects, 
   concern  tinging his words.

                                        BATIATUS
                        What could wrest him from so high a 
                        perch?

  Vettius swallows his hatred for Batiatus with a smile.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Pressing concerns abroad in 
                        Antioch. His departure was... 
                        unexpected.

                        The arena would not exist without 
                        Tullius. We would not be standing 
                        here, were it not for his actions.

  Lucretia allows herself the hint of a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We must halt the ceremonies until 
                        his return.

                        Agreed. I shall address the crowd 
                        ---

                                          VETTIUS
                        Tullius sends hard instruction for 
                        ceremony to carry without him. This 
                        arena was a gift to his beloved 
                        city. He does not wish misfortune 
                      to stand in the way of the giving 
                      of it.

  Sextus considers the request with a troubled frown. Batiatus 
  tensely glances at Solonius. The moment of truth.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        A most gracious offer, well 
                        received.  Come. Haunt Tullius  
                        place by my side, possessing his 
                        spirit for the occasion.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Again I must offer apology. I make 
                        preparation to follow Tullius to

                      of the lanista. In favor of station 
                        more befitting a man of breeding.

  Batiatus frowns at the slight. Vettius takes satisfaction in 
  the minor victory.

                                        VARUS
                        All flee to dark corners!

                        What will become of your men? They

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would not see your brief years of 
                        labor turn to naught. Solonius and 
                        I can make fair offer to divide 
                        them.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Deeply appreciated. Yet 
                        unnecessary.  Solonius and I have 
                        already come to terms.

                        Terms?

  He shoots Solonius a look. Solonius returns it with a deadly 
  smile.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I have transferred deed to all my 
                        gladiators to Solonius, under whose

                        favor.

  Solonius bows, ever so humble.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I must take my leave. Give good 
                        Solonius all consideration towards 
                        future games.  Tullius and I would 
                        have it so.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You are overly generous. Come. I 
                        would see you away.

  Solonius exits with Vettius.

                        The boy all but runs from us.

  Batiatus sees suspicion flare in Varus  eyes. Quickly moves 
  to extinguish it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Vettius has always been little more 
                        than Tullius  pet. Is it no wonder 
                      he rushes to heel when leash is 
                        jerked?

                        Let us put absent friends from 
                        mind, and turn towards the glories 
                      of the day.

  Magistrate Sextus raises his cup. Batiatus follows suit with 
  a smile, barely hiding the sting of Solonius  betrayal...



  The CROWD loudly BOOS and throws garbage at an unseen 
  offense. Batiatus returns to the pulvinus, a tight smile 
  hiding his roiling emotions towards Solonius.

                                        LUCRETIA

                        What fucking excuse does Solonius 
                        give?

  Batiatus shoots a withering look at Solonius, who sits at 
  the Magistrate s side in Tullius  honored seat.

                                        BATIATUS
                        None that merit consideration.

  He shifts his attention to the crowd, wishing to change 
  subject.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        What has the crowd in such a state?

                        the games begin.

  Batiatus glances down to the arena where half naked 
  PRISONERS in chains are dragged out and forced to kneel. 
  Cossutius  eyes narrow, spotting a familiar face.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                      Is that not one of yours, Batiatus? 
                        The girl on the end, what was her 
                        name...

  Naevia constricts, heart sinking as she spots her.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Diona.

  DIONA, dirty and bruised, looks to the pulvinus, her eyes 
  wild with fear. Cossutius laughs, recalling her now.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        Diona, yes.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

                        Apologies, Batiatus. The girl was 
                        only rounded up this morning. If 
                        you wish her removed to be dealt 
                        with personally...

  Naevia tenses, hope surging. Only to be dashed as Batiatus 
  waves the offer away.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let her death stand as warning. To 
                        all others who would seek to betray 
                        me.

  He levels a veiled smile at Solonius. Naevia looks down at 
  Diona. Tears well in each of their eyes as CABURUS, a big 
  ugly gladiator from Vettius  stable, approaches with sword 
  in hand. He looks up to the pulvinus for the signal.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS

                      As you wish.

  He rises, basking in the moment as he gives the signal to 
  Caburus to begin. The crowd ROARS in approval. Batiatus 
  darkens. Naevia s heart seizes as Caburus rams his sword 
  through the back of Diona s throat and out her neck.



  The crowd ROARS. Naevia watches as Diona s corpse is dragged 
  off with the rest of the executed prisoners by LIBITINARII.

                        Glory to Rome!

  The ROAR of the crowd propels us into a glorious MONTAGE OF 
  BLOOD AND DEATH:

  - Gnaeus entangles a Gladiator in his net and spears him 
  with his trident.

  - A bloodied Ashur hacks open his opponent s throat.

  - One of Batiatus  GLADIATORS goes down in a spray of blood.  
  Batiatus glowers in the pulvinus.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

  bloody sword at Ashur in the chutes. You re next, fucker.

  - Crixus narrowly wins a vicious match.

  - Solonius  new acquisition Caburus decimates two of 
  Batiatus  men.

  - Gannicus returns the favor, slaughtering Tasgetius and 
  Synetos in a frenzy of blood. He raises his gore-drenched 
  swords to the pulvinus, framed in gold by the setting sun.

  The MONTAGE ends as Batiatus surges to his feet.

                        holds twice your men.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Numbers are meaningless. A lesson 
                        good Solonius is about to discover.

  Varus and the Romans laugh, delighted. Solonius glowers at 
  Batiatus. OFF BATIATUS  challenging grin...



  The victors from the day s matches take to the sands. From 
  the House of Batiatus: Gannicus, Crixus, Gnaeus, Ashur, 
  Dagan, Duratius, and Ambiorix. From the House of Solonius: 
  Caburus and twelve others. A total of twenty men.

  MAGISTRATE SEXTUS

  steps to the pulvinus railing. The crowd quiets.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Many have fought this day. Many 
                        have died, their blood staining the 
                        sands.  Yet this arena towers above 
                        all others in the republic. It is a 
                        vast beast. And it yet hungers!

  The crowd ROARS.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS(cont'd)
                        Two great houses face each other. 
                        Yet every man must ultimately stand 
                        for himself and himself alone.

  Sextus gives a signal. CALONES (arena attendants) rush in 
  with huge jugs of oil, pouring it in a gigantic ring around 
  the Gladiators. The crowd MURMURS. The Gladiators shift 
  nervously. All except Gannicus, who keeps steely focus on 
  the pulvinus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What are they doing?

  Batiatus notes Gannicus  hard purpose, waves the question 
  away.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It does not matter.

                        And it is fire that shall bind them 
                      in final contest!

  A Calone sets a torch to the oil. It ignites around the 
  Gladiators with an impressive WHOOSH. The crowd ERUPTS.

                        Take position!

  The two houses move to opposing sides within the ring of 
  fire. Ashur eyes the overwhelming force, whispers to Dagan.

                                        ASHUR
                                in Aramaic)(

                        [Perhaps it is wise to place 
                        grievance aside, and fight once 
                        more as brothers.  At least until 
                        our enemies have fallen.]

  Dagan chuckles in response. Ashur tightens, knowing he s in 
  deep shit. Crixus glances at Gannicus, his hand tightening 
  on his sword.

                                        CRIXUS
                      Do not die before we meet.

  Gannicus ignores him, his eyes fixed on Caburus. The brute 
  grins, lusting for blood.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Split heaven with the sound of your 
                        fury!  Begin!

  The crowd ROARS as the two houses rush each other. Except 
  Dagan, who immediately whirls on Ashur with his sword. Ashur 
  barely deflects with his shield, the blow staggering him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Batiatus  men think so little of 
                        his house, they seek to kill each 
                        other from the start.

  The Romans CHUCKLE. Batiatus seethes. Ashur manages to 
  scamper out of reach. Dagan is intercepted by a Gladiator 
  (S1) and is forced to engage him.

  GANNICUS

  flips an attacking gladiator (S2) out of his way and slams 
  into Caburus. Thunderous blows are traded. Caburus catches 
  Gannicus in the face with his shield, smashing him back.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  AMBIORIX

  rushes in, hacking at Caburus. Caburus counters, splitting 
  Ambiorex s head open in a SPRAY OF GORE. The Crowd CHEERS.  
  Varus laughs in delight.

                                        VARUS
                        First blood to Solonius!

  The Romans applaud. Solonius hits Batiatus with a smile.  
  Batiatus returns it tightly.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He seizes blessing and position

                        Pray he does not also seize title 
                      of Champion. It is leverage we must 
                        hold to regain favor.

  The crowd CHEERS as Gannicus severs a man s arm (S3), 
  spinning to send his head following. Crixus slices open a 
  man (S4) -- and finds himself facing Gannicus.

  CRIXUS ATTACKS,

  his sword flashing. Gannicus deflects, cracking him with his 
  hilt. Crixus stumbles, his face nearly going into the 
  flames.  He scampers back, but Gannicus has already moved on 
  to aid

  GNAEUS,

  against two Gladiators (S5, S6). Gnaeus sweeps S5 off his 
  feet with his net and spears him with his trident. Gannicus 
  cuts down S6, twin swords arcing blood.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yes! It is a pity you did not land 
                        more men in the primus, Solonius. I 
                        fear you to be eliminated 
                        prematurely.

  Solonius  turn to fume.

  ASHUR

  narrowly avoids an assault, stabbing the m an (S2) in the 
  groin and ripping him open to his chin. Dagan attacks.

  Ashur is driven back to the edge of the flames. Desperate, 
  he kicks up

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

  A SPRAY OF SAND

  with his sword, blinding Dagan s good eye. Dagan grunts in 
  surprise as Ashur runs him through to the hilt. Ashur grins 
  up at the dying man.

                                        ASHUR
                        Who now stands the cunt?

  Dagan spits blood in Ashur s face -- and grabs the sword in 
  his gut as he falls dead, depriving Ashur of his weapon. 
  Ashur frantically dodges Solonius  remaining men as he 
  scrambles for a replacement from one of the fallen 
  Gladiators.

  GNAEUS

  entangles a Gladiator (S7) in his net, yanking the man from 
  his feet. The man tumbles into the fire, screaming as his 
  flesh is set ablaze. The fire also ignites Gnaeus  net.

  CABURUS CHARGES,

  striking Duratius down as he rushes Gnaeus. Gnaeus throws 
  his flaming net. Caburus dives under it, slamming into 
  Gnaeus as he rolls to his feet. Gnaeus sails beyond the 
  flames. He lands hard, spitting blood. Out of the match.

  BATIATUS TIGHTENS,

  calculating the remaining odds. Only Gannicus, Crixus, and 
  Ashur remain against Caburus and Solonius  men.

  CRIXUS

  finds just the right angle to cleave a Hoplomachus  head 
  from his shoulders (S8). Ashur screams to him as he dodges a 
  Gladiator (S9) intent on ending him.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        A weapon! Give me a fucking weapon!

  Crixus kicks the Hoplomachus  spear up in the air. Ashur 
  snatches it and just manages to kill S9.

  GANNICUS

  trades blows with Caburus. One of Solonius  men (S10) joins 
  the assault, quickly gets hacked open by Gannicus. Caburus 
  seizes the distraction and slices open Gannicus  arm, 
  causing him to lose one of his swords.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  CRIXUS AND ASHUR

  battle the last of Solonius  men (S11, S12). Together they 
  manage to kill them, mostly due to Crixus  prowess. Ashur 
  turns attention to Gannicus across the sands, his back 
  towards them as he fights Caburus. Ashur grins.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Let us press advantage, brother! 
                        Then decide who is champion between 
                        us!

  Ashur rears back to hurl his spear at Gannicus.

                                        CRIXUS
                        No!

  Crixus knocks the spear up, attacking Ashur. Varus laughs in 
  disbelief up in the pulvinus.

                                        VARUS
                                to Batiatus)(

                      To be expected, when animals are 
                        not properly trained.

  Batiatus glares. Ashur screams at Crixus far below.

                                        ASHUR
                        What are you doing, you mad fuck?!

  Ashur stabs with his spear. Crixus blocks the attack, 
  spinning low to HACK OPEN ASHUR S RIGHT SHIN. Ashur screams.  
  Crixus surges up, smashing him in the face with his shield.

  ASHUR SAILS BACK,

  landing in the flames. He shrieks, rolling out of the ring 
  of fire -- and out of the match. He grunts in agony, barely 
  conscious. His left shoulder hideously burned. Right shin 
  mangled, the shattered BONE protruding.

  GANNICUS

  is getting hammered by Caburus. Crixus rushes in, aiding 
  Gannicus. Batiatus allows himself a relieved smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It appears odds have shifted.

  Batiatus brightens. Solonius forces a strained smile.

  GANNICUS AND CRIXUS

  hammer Caburus. Caburus counters, kicking Gannicus back and 
  slicing open Crixus. Crixus reels. Caburus raises his sword 
  for the death blow.

  GANNICUS

  makes a quick decision and HURLS HIMSELF AT Caburus and 
  Crixus. Caburus staggers. Crixus gets slammed back through 
  the flames, landing on the other side. Crixus slams his fist 
  into the sand in frustration, disqualified.

                                        SOLONIUS

                        The odds return to balance.

  CABURUS

  attacks the bloodied and exhausted Gannicus. Gannicus barely 
  fends him off. Caburus presses. Gannicus is hammered to his 
  knees, his remaining sword stripped from him in the process.  
  Caburus roars to the crowd. They respond in kind.

  THE CONCUSSIVE DIN

  reaches Gannicus in distorted waves, the world swimming in 
  and out of focus. His eyes look beyond Caburus to find

  OENOMAUS

  watching from the chutes. His face stricken with 
  disappointment.  And the hard loss of yet another so close 
  to him.

  CABURUS

  brings his sword down to finish Gannicus. But Gannicus bends 
  out of the way at the last moment, the blade SLICING OFF a 
  hunk of Gannicus  hair. Gannicus rolls and hurls the only 
  weapon within reach -- Gnaeus  fucking net.

  THE NET

  entangles Caburus  shield. He flings it aside, but Gannicus 
  has already grabbed up a spear. He attacks, running Caburus 
  through the thigh.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

  CABURUS

  grunts in pain, his sword smashing down to break the spear 
  off. He attacks Gannicus, who now only has the jagged shaft 
  of the spear left as a weapon.

  GANNICUS DEFENDS HIMSELF,

  grim purpose once again welling in his eyes. He deflects a 
  blow and RAMS THE BROKEN SPEAR SHAFT THROUGH CABURUS  MOUTH.  
  The crowd ROARS. Batiatus goes insane.

  CABURUS DROPS TO HIS KNEES,

  gushing blood but still alive as he grasps at the deadly 
  shaft. A faint smile tugs at Gannicus  lips.

                                        GANNICUS

  Gannicus jerks up hard on the shaft, RIPPING CABURUS  HEAD 
  APART. He goes down in a gory spray. The arena EXPLODES.

  OENOMAUS

  locks eyes with Gannicus. Nods to him with a proud smile.

  PULVINUS

  Solonius sags. Lucretia beams beside her exuberant husband.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Yes! The House of Batiatus stands

  He catches himself for the profanity slip, sheepishly 
  looking towards the Magistrate.

  He shoots Solonius a smug grin as the crowd chants Gannicus  
  name. He has once again reversed fortune towards his favor.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                        survived.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                      An excellent suggestion.
                                to Batiatus)(
                        You can always train another 
                        gladiator.  Yet to conclude the 
                        opening ceremonies with such a 
                        blessing...

  The Magistrate smiles politely. There is only one acceptable 
  answer, and Batiatus knows it. He forces a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                      As I said. I honor this city.

  Solonius gloats as the Magistrate rises to address the 
  crowd.  Batiatus is forced to watch as everything he has 
  struggled for slips from his grasp.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Gannicus has proven himself to the 
                        city of Capua! Let him be 
                        rewarded... With freedom!

  The crowd ERUPTS. OFF GANNICUS  SHOCK...                                                                                    52.



  Batiatus and Lucretia stand on the balcony. Naevia attends, 
  thoughts of Diona still fresh.

  Gannicus, now dressed in the simple tunic of a freedman, 
  says his somber good-byes to the men assembled in the square 
  below.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        After all we have suffered. 
                        Gannicus is still lost to us.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I offered the man coin. Freedom to 
                        come and go as he pleases. If he 
                        would yet fight for this house.

  He takes note of Gannicus  solemn mood and forced smile as 
  the other men laugh and celebrate his release.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Memories haunt the man. Driving him 
                        from our walls.

  Lucretia s eyes fall on Crixus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Crixus afforded himself well in the 
                        games. Let us turn hope towards 
                        him, that he may bring honor and 
                        good fortune.

  Batiatus notes the sparkle in her eyes. He is no fool, yet 
  sees the man pleases his wife. And would have it so.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Yes. Let us place stock in the 
                        Gaul.  And see what end he may 
                        service.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Gannicus nods and grips arms with the men as he heads for 
  the gate. Barca bids grinning farewell.

                                        BARCA
                        I shall join you one day, you mad 
                        fuck.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I have no doubt.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.
  CONTINUED:

  Gannicus moves on. Crixus grasps his arm, holds it.

                                        CRIXUS
                      We still have not had proper 
                        contest.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Win your own freedom, and seek me 
                        out.

  Gannicus turns away, pauses. He turns back, undoing his 
  leather necklace.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        This was given to me when I became 
                        champion of this house.

  He tosses it to a surprised Crixus.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        Wear it with more honor than I 
                        have.

  Gannicus heads for the gate. Crixus considers the gift, a 
  smile bending his lips as he puts it on. He doesn t see 
  Ashur glaring from the shadows. Shoulder scarred. Leg bound 
  in a familiar brace. Silently swearing vengeance.

  OENOMAUS

  greets Gannicus at the gate with a RUDIS. The traditional 
  wooden sword presented to a gladiator that has won freedom.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You have earned the rudis. Proof 
                        you no longer stand a slave.

  Gannicus takes it, eyeing all his victories carved into it.  
  There is not a square inch that has escaped.

                                        GANNICUS
                        A lifetime of blood.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        And victory. It lifts troubled 
                        heart, to see my brother gain his 
                        freedom. She would have been proud.

  Gannicus wrestles with his betrayal, his need to confess.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Oenomaus...


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    54.
  CONTINUED:

  He pauses, glancing up at Batiatus. Recalling his words of 
  warning.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                                  soft)(
                        She loved you. Above all others.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The thought shall keep me warm. 
                        Until I join her in the afterlife.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I shall meet you there.

  Oenomaus grasps his arm, his love for Gannicus obvious.  
  Gannicus takes a last look at the life he knew, then heads 
  out of the gate. Oenomaus watches him for a long beat.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Doctore. Begin the day s training.

  Oenomaus nods. He unfurls his whip and CRACKS it, calling to 
  the men in his familiar commanding voice.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Practice swords!

  BALCONY

  Batiatus looks out across his Gladiators as they begin 
  training. His jaw sets in grim determination.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Lucretia)(
                        I would not hear the name Gannicus 
                        spoken again. Nor that of Tullius 
                      or his cock eating apprentice. 
                        These things are of the past. We 
                        must look towards brighter future.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My eyes are firmly fixed.

  She steals a glance at Crixus below.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We will see this house elevated. 
                        Beyond my father. Beyond Solonius. 
                        Beyond the gods them fucking 
                        selves. We shall leave our mark 
                        upon this city. And one day, see 
                        proper reward for all we have done.                                                                                    55.
