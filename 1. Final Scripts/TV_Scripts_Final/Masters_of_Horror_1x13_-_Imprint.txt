1 EXT. A RIVER - NIGHT 
 
  A passenger boat sleeks along a river. 
 
A small island sandbar sits in the middle of the river.  
Flickering candlelights from a slum flicker in the  
  background. 
 
A JAPANESE BOATMAN oars onward. 
 
JAPANESE DAY LABORERS ready for a night on the town fill 
the boat. The men whisper, talk and LAUGH amongst 
  themselves. 
 
A DRUNK JAPANESE MAN with glittering eyes blankly stares 
ahead. 
 
  CHRISTOPHER KARGES, a 55-year-old AMERICAN, sits among them  
wearing a shabby old coat.  
 
Much of the dialogue in this film is delivered very slowly, 
eerily so, and at the speed we would expect from backwards 
country folk. All of the people speak in Japanese-accented  
English. 
 
The location is Japan sometime in the late 1800's. A  
couple of the Laborers look at Christopher: the stranger in  
  a strange land.  
 
                              LABORER 1 
                Stranger, is true you're all hung 
              like horses? 
 
                              LABORER 2 
              Guess he's had a taste of our 
              women and likes it. 
 
Vulgar LAUGHTER, and Christopher turns back to the  
  approaching islet.  
 
Years ago back in America, Christopher would have been too 
proper of a man to respond but by now he's way past caring. 
He's a traveling nobody. He's a man who has loved. A man 
like all men with fond memories and burdened with regrets. 
 
The boat cuts through the dark water. 
 
  Suddenly, a shock rolls through the boat. They've hit 
something. 
 
Reaction shot of Christopher.  
 
                              LABORER 1 
              What happened? 
 
  2 


    Laborer 2 SCREAMS. 
 
    A young woman's corpse drifts past. 
 
                              BOATMAN 
                    (as if he's seen this 
                      too many times before) 
              Another floater. 
 
    To his own displeasure, the boatman takes a bamboo pole 
    pushes the dead woman's body far away. 
 
    Her long hair coils around the pole. 
 
                              BOATMAN (CONT'D)  
              She's heavy as lead. Probably 
              with child. 
 
    A hand reaches out from the water and quietly grabs the 
    side of the boat. It's a female hand! 
 
    The boat puddles along again. 
 
    The laborers pour their sake in the river to purify the 
    scene. 
 
                              LABORER 2 
              Rest in peace. 
 
    In the middle of the sandbar island, Christopher spies the 
    paper lanterns of the red light district and its country 
    whorehouses. 
 
                              LABORER 1 
              Boys, my nose is a tingling with 
              the smell of fancy face powder! 
 
    The men revive to their lively selves. Okay, so men do 
    think with their dicks. 
 
    The female hand that hugged the rails of the boat gently 
    disappears into the water. 
 
    A lamp light draws near. 
 
 
    2 EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT SANDBAR - NIGHT 
 
    Paper lanterns line the street festively illuminating the 
    front of a house of ill repute. 
 
    The latticed windows of the establishment. 
 
    The men size up the situation looking over the goods for 
    sale inside as if they were at a cattle auction. 
  3 


    JAPANESE PROSTITUTES dangle their hands out the windows 
    propositioning the men. The features of every last one of 
    them reek of a bottom barrel whorehouse. None of them are 
    particularly attractive. They're either too fat, too old, 
    too young, have massive ears or inbred faces like the boy 
    in DELIVERANCE. 
 
    A mix of close-up of these women all with their reasons for 
    being there and their own complexes. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              Yoshi! Yoshi, I missed you!  
 
                            MAN 
              You're looking as fine and ready 
              as ever. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              I had an itchin' to see you.  
              Every time I see you, I just  
              wanna... mmm! Get on in here, 
                handsome.  
 
    Entering with a grin on his face and the whore cuddling up 
    to his side, they head for the back bedrooms. 
 
      Christopher wanders on past. 
 
    Upon seeing this stranger in a strange land, the girls are 
    surprised but reach out their hands. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              You in the fancy clothes. I'll 
              take you to heaven and back. The 
              door is open if you know what I  
              mean. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 3 
                Stranger, you're not half bad 
              lookin'. And honey...I'm lookin'. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              Get a gander at the size of his 
              nose. Big nose, big hands, big  
              feet, big...  
 
    One WOMAN squats on the floor away from the others stretching 
    out their hands and calling out with their lovely sing-song 
    voices. 
 
    She has a lovely profile, much too lovely for this place. 
    But she is distant, not welcoming, and appears afraid of 
    something. 
 
    The MADAM OF THE HOUSE scolds her. The woman obstinately 
    refuses.  4 


    The Madam of the House slaps the woman's face and leaves. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 (CONT'D) 
              How about it? Let's see if you're 
              as well equipped downstairs. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              I am looking for someone. I 
              wonder if you ladies can help me  
              find her... Her name is Komomo.  
 
    The name has an immediate effect. They fall SILENT all at 
    once. 
 
      Christopher studies their faces hoping for a hint. 
 
 
      3 FLASHBACK 
 
    to Komomo's smiling face. The picture of innocence. 
    Everything that is good and pure. Non-judgmental and 
    loving. 
 
 
    4 EXT. THE WHOREHOUSE 
 
    BACK TO CHRISTOPHER 
 
    A TOUTER solicits Christopher. He's missing his nose from 
    syphilis. 
 
                              TOUTER 
              Hey, what are you? Dutch? 
              English? American? 
 
      Christopher nods. 
 
                              TOUTER (CONT'D) 
                I thought so. Well, you'd better 
              get a move on or it'll be 
              morning. What is done here is 
              best done in the dark. Every man 
              that comes here is looking for 
              the same thing. Come to stick it 
              betwixt a girl's legs, didn't ya? 
              Well, the ladies at my house are 
              the finest. You can't go wrong. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              I'm looking for a girl. 
 
                              TOUTER 
              I have lots of girls. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER  
              A girl named Komomo.   5 


 
    The ladies of the night are watching Christopher. The Tout 
    looks at the girls, who hush, then back to Christopher.  
 
                              TOUTER  
              Never heard of a girl called 
              that. She is not on this island. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Then I guess it's time for me to 
              leave.  
 
    He starts to go. 
 
                              TOUTER 
              Not tonight you won't. No boat 
              until mornin', mister. You have  
              to spend the evening somewhere,  
              so it might as well be here. Come  
              on in and rest your bones. Pick 
              any Missy you please. I'll give 
              you a good price... and a better  
              lady.  
 
      Christopher points to the woman crouched down in the back.  
 
                              TOUTER (CONT'D)  
                Excellent choice! You sure know  
              how to pick them. 
                (lowering his voice) 
              She's very special girl.  
                (whispers, grinning  
              through rangy teeth)  
              As long as you come short of  
              killing her, she'll let you do 
                anything. 
 
    The touter takes Christopher by the arm and drags him into 
    the whorehouse. 
 
 
    5 INT. WHOREHOUSE, A LONG HALLWAY - NIGHT  
 
    A dimly torch-lit hallway.  
 
 
    6 INT. A ROOM IN THE WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT  
 
    A dimly lit room. Motionless pinwheels decorate the room. 
 
    A futon is laid out on the floor in the back.  
 
                              TOUTER 
              I'll bring her in soon enough. 
              Wait here a spell. 
  6 


 
      Christopher feels out of place, can't seem to relax but 
    sits down. 
 
    The room is stuffy. 
 
    An ELDERLY WOMAN opens the sliding screen door. 
 
    She sets down a small table, a bottle of sake and cups.  
 
    He slowly pours himself a cup of sake.  
 
    He takes a sip. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER (V.O.)  
              I once held a woman named Komomo 
              in my arms.  
 
 
7 INSERT SHOT: EXT. SOMEPLACE 
 
    Komomo sits near a lone tree in the hot summer  
    heat waiting for someone. We hear the cicadas chirping. 
    Could this be the time of her first trick as a whore? 
 
    She sits holding a pinwheel trying to catch the wind as she 
    searches for her own direction in life. She flutters around 
    lost in this kind of play. She finds the wind and smiles 
    into the camera.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER (V.O.) (CONT'D)  
              She was a sad, beautiful but most  
              of all...unfortunate. But I loved  
              her all the same. I had made up 
              my mind to take her back home  
              with me to America. I promised to  
              come back to her, but when I  
              returned she'd been sold off to 
              another bawdy house. I roamed  
              this land searching for her,  
                following any hint or clue for  
              her. Along the way, I've washed  
              away the filthy sludge from this 
                god-forsaken land and seen the  
              blank, empty faces of other  
                unfortunate women along the way.  
              I'm exhausted. But not too tired 
              to wonder what in the hell I am  
              doing in a place like this. 
 
 
    8 INSERT SHOT: CHRISTOPHER'S PAST. 
 
    He walks in the dark between white powdered faced whores.

    9 ANGLE ON BEAUTIFUL KOMOMO  
 
    A shot of Komomo dissolves to one of a blue-eyed young 
    girl. 
 
 
    10 INT. A ROOM IN THE WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT 
 
    The pinwheels starts to spin despite the air being still. 
 
    The door SLIDES open. 
 
    The WOMAN that Christopher selected enters. She has a 
    lovely profile. 
 
    She draws near facing him. The left side of her face is 
    stiff and cramped as if something is hanging from it: an  
    ugly counterpoint that threatens to destroy her beauty.  
    She wears a cloak of sadness and melancholy.  
 
      Christopher doesn't know what to make of her or her 
    deformed face. 
 
    She bows down before him pressing three fingers of each 
    hand on the floor. 
 
    Finally, we have met the true protagonist of our story. We 
    never learn her name because she represents the plight of 
    so many women.  
 
                              WOMAN 
              Tonight I am yours. You may do  
              what you wish with me.  
 
    She serves him some sake, then speaks with a quiet, gentle  
    voice.  
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              Are you from America? 
 
      Christopher NODS.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Why were you sitting away from  
              the window? Don't the girls  
              normally call out to the men?  
 
                              WOMAN 
                    (beat)  
              I'm afraid. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Afraid? Of what? 
 
  8 


 
                              WOMAN 
              The ones who grab my hands. The 
              lost souls. 
 
    Suddenly she SCREAMS and twists her body. 
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              Look, they're here! 
 
    Her fear is truly lifelike as she hallucinates seeing the 
    living dead. 
 
    But Christopher sees them, too, a group of souls -- the  
    kind of horrifying type you'd expect from Miike -- stand  
    within the shadows in the corner of the little room.  
 
    The GHOSTS shrink back into the shadows and disappear.  
 
    The Woman lets out a piercing shriek.  
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              I've been cursed from birth. I 
              feel closer to the dead than the  
              living. The living are the ones  
              who really scare me. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Well, it seems the living can do  
              you a lot more harm than the  
              dead.  
 
                              WOMAN 
              You don't think I'm strange? You  
              don't think I'm a freak?  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              There's not much that isn't  
              strange to me since I came to  
              Japan.  
 
    That calms her a bit. She looks at him.  
 
                              WOMAN 
              You are looking for Komomo?  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Do you know her? 
 
                              WOMAN 
              If you find her, what do you plan  
              to do?  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              I plan to take her back to  
              America with me.   9 


                              (MORE) 
                              CHRISTOPHER(CONT D) 
              We'll start ourlives over again.  
              I will give her the life she deserves.  
              I gave her my word.  
 
                              WOMAN 
              Poor Komomo.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Where is she? 
 
                              WOMAN 
              She came here to the island about  
              half a year ago but... I am  
              sorry; she passed away not long  
              ago.  
 
      Christopher is shocked. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER  
              What? How?  
 
                              WOMAN  
                    (looking down)  
              She hung herself. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Why? 
 
                              WOMAN 
              She could wait no longer for the  
              man she loved. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Liar!  
 
      Christopher angrily kicks over the table and stands up. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              It's no lie. She rests at the 
              temple on the bank of the river.

    We see a nagekomi-dera, literally throw in temple, which is 
    much different from a standard Buddhist temple. It is  
    Komomo's abandoned, impoverished potter's grave.  
 
 
    12 RESUME INT. A ROOM IN THE WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT 
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              So you...are that man. Her 
              special one.  10 


 
      Christopher is crushed by the news... and by his own guilt.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Komomo didn't tell you I was an  
                American? I guess she thought I  
              was a goddamn Yankee liar for not  
              coming back. 
 
      Christopher stands up getting ready to leave, his eyes  
    welling with tears.  
 
    The woman grabs him by the legs, frightened.  
 
                              WOMAN 
              Don't go. There's nothing but  
                cutthroats outside. This island 
              isn't in the human world. Demons 
              and whores are the only ones 
              living here. 
 
      Christopher sits down again. 
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              I know you suffer but you can't 
              change the past. Komomo is gone.  
              You cannot bring her back.  
 
    She pours him some sake. 
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              What did you love about her? 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              She reminded me of my little 
              sister. My dead sister. 
 
                              WOMAN  
              Your... sister?  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER  
              Do you find that strange?  
 
                              WOMAN 
              I am the last one to judge any  
              man. Have some sake. It's the  
              best way to forget. 
 
    He takes a stiff drink and then another. 
 
 
    13 EXT. POTTER'S GRAVE TEMPLE - NIGHT 
 
    Komomo's grave untended and laid in waste.

    14 INT. WHOREHOUSE, A LONG HALLWAY - NIGHT 
 
    A dimly lit hall. 
 
    Something moves in the corner. 
 
 
    15 INT. A ROOM IN THE WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT 
 
      Christopher is stretched out on the floor. 
 
    He's had several bottles of sake and has gotten drunk.  
 
    The woman cools him off with a fan. 
 
    We're not sure whether they've had sex or not.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER  
              Aren't you going to sleep?  
 
                              WOMAN 
              Showing your sleeping face is the 
              greatest disgrace for a lady in 
              my trade. 
 
      Christopher starts; he thinks he sees two of her. It's an  
    image of her face as if she'd been born without any  
    disfigurement.  
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              It's hot. But at least this keeps 
              the mosquitoes off.  
 
    The face of the other woman is no longer visible. 
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
                Something wrong? 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Nothing. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              Good sir, all of the men rave on  
              about me being a fine fit down  
              below. Would you care to try?  
              I'll let you do anything you 
              desire. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Not now.  
 
                              WOMAN 
                I understand. Who'd want to lay  
              with an ugly woman like me, eh?  
  12 


 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Please don't take this the wrong 
              way. I don't mean to offend you. 
                But...not tonight, I'm just not 
              in the mood. 
 
    A silent beat.  
 
                              WOMAN  
              Maybe you should just relax and  
              go to sleep. 
 
    He can't sleep and has to wait until morning. He wants to  
    be entertained and asks her to tell him a story.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              I'd like you to tell me about  
                yourself. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              About me? 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              I'm a journalist; listening to  
              people's stories is what I do. 
              Besides, I'm interested in you. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              You're a strange one, mister. Men 
              don't usually want to talk with  
              me. 
                    (a beat) 
              The place I was born is far from 
              here, a poor village deep in the 
                mountains where life is tough.

    Black skies. 
 
    Red earth. 
 
    A muddy river. 
 
    Thin, malnourished birds fly low and SCREECH.

    Her FATHER lies in bed sick in a dilapidated hovel. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              My dadda had a bad lung and spent  
              most of his time laid up in bed.   13

    Her MOTHER raises up a newborn baby.  
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)  
              My momma was a midwife,  
                delivering babies in the village  
              when she wasn't tending to my  
              dadda. 
 
    A NEW MOTHER holds the baby in her arms and smiles.

                              WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)  
              When I came along, their lives 
              got even more difficult. But they  
              were happy all the same.

    wrapped in cloth. 
 
 
    20 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 1- EXT. AN OPEN FIELD 
 
    A YOUNG GIRL (10) blows on a pinwheel. The left side of her 
    face is stiff and cramped. It's the woman as a child. 
 
    The girl picks Chinese lantern plants and wild 
      chrysanthemums. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              None of the other kids would play  
              with me because of my face. I was  
              all by myself. But it was easier  
              than being taunted and made fun  
              of.  
 
 
    21 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 1- IXT. A DESOLATED TEMPLE 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Everyone in town detested me. But 
                a Buddhist priest showed me 
                kindness. 
 
    The young girl peers at a storybook of pictures of sinners 
    suffering in hell. 
 
                              BUDDHIST PRIEST 
              Pretty scary, huh?   14 


                               MORE  
                              BUDDHIST PRIEST(CONT D) 
              These drawings were made with  
              real blood. Listen to me now:  
              if you do bad things, you'll go  
              straight to hell. If you want to 
              go to heaven, you must do all good  
              things.  
 
    The young girl stares at the pictures. It's a drawing of 
    the dead squirming in pain for all eternity. 
 
 
    22 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 1- EXT. A ROAD TO THE RIVER 
 
    The mother and the enthralled little girl walk to the river  
    carrying buckets. 
 
                              MOTHER 
              Oh, sweetheart, my parents were  
              filthy rich. You should have seen  
              us when I was a girl. We had bags  
              of rice stacked head high in our 
              garden. We used to play on top of 
              them. We had a big pond, too,  
              with carp swimming all around. 
              One time, my father went to Kobe 
              and brought me some Western 
              candy. They were blue and red and 
              yellow all wrapped so fancy. 
 
                            GIRL 
              Wow. I wanna eat candy like that  
              someday, Mamma.  
 
                              MOTHER 
              One day you will. When you grow 
              up, I hope you'll leave this 
              village. You'll be happy!  
 
 
    23 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 1- INT. A DILAPIDATED HOVEL 
    - NIGHT  
 
    The father checks to see his wife and child are sound 
    asleep and creeps out of the shack. 
 
    His cough is acting up and he spits out blood. 
 
 
    24 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 1- EXT. THE RIVER - NIGHT 
 
    The suffering father makes his way to the river under the  
    vast dark sky, takes a look up into the clouds above, and steps 
    into the water and sinks to the bottom, taking his  
    own life.   15 


 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              He didn't wanna cause us any more  
              trouble. Dadda died in that  
              river.  
 
 
    25 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 1- EXT. THE RIVER 
 
    The mother and child discover the corpse floating in the 
    river. They break down WEEPING. 
 
 
    26 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 1 - EXT. A DILAPIDATED HOVEL 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.)  
              My momma tried her damndest but 
              couldn't make a living with a 
              child around. 
 
    The ten-year-old girl is taken away by a man. He pulls 
    her by force dragging her away. 
 
    Her mother sees her off in tears. 
 
                              MOTHER 
                    (calling out to her)  
              You'll be happy, I promise! 
              Always keep your chin up. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              From here it's the same old 
              story. I was bought and sold from  
              place to place and finally wound 
              up on this island.  
 
 
    27 WOMAN'S FLASHBACK - THE WHOREHOUSE 1 
 
    The whorehouse at night. The woman squats in her usual 
    place back away from the window and the other whores 
    calling out to the men. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Being a 'daughter of joy' is a 
              living hell. This place is 
                something out of the pictures I 
              saw in that book at the temple.  
              The pictures drawn in blood.  
 
 
    28 THE WHOREHOUSE 1 - INT. WHOREHOUSE - DAY 
 
    The Madam scolds her. 
 
  16 


 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              Until you rope a man in here, you 
              don't get fed! All your parts are 
              there and working. If you can't 
              get them with your looks, make them 
              happy with something else. If you 
              don't wanna starve, get busy. You  
              make that pussy pay!  
 
    Her jade ring sparkles.  
 
    The woman sits in SILENCE as the other prostitutes have 
    their meal. 
 
    Komomo shares her food with the woman. 
 
    Komomo grins. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              But Komomo: she had a heart of  
              gold. 
 
    29 THE WHOREHOUSE 1 - INT. WHOREHOUSE - DAY 
 
    The women comb their long hair and gaze at picture books 
    enjoying their few moments of free time. 
 
    Komomo and the woman sit together. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              I wasn't sold into this like the 
              other girls. I've got a man who 
              loves me. I'm waiting for him to  
              come for me. He promised to take  
              me away from here.  
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              And I'm the Empress of Japan. 
              Komomo, you fool. Your foster 
              parents sold you to cover their 
              debts. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              No, my family is wealthy. If I 
              was born in another age, I'd be a 
                princess. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              So what are you doing here, Your 
                Highness? Face it, Komomo, you're 
              a whore just like the rest of us. 
 
    The other women LAUGH it up. 
  17 


                              KOMOMO 
              No, no...I'm no whore. 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              Well what kind of a princess 
              spreads her legs every night for 
              a few coins? 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              I know about you. You're the only  
              survivor in a family suicide. 
              Your money-grubbing foster  
              parents told the Madam so.  
 
                              KOMOMO 
              No, no! My family is wealthy.  
 
    The girls shove Komomo around. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              Stop it! If that's what Komomo 
              thinks then let it be. 
 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              Shut up, freak.  
 
                              WOMAN 
              Maybe I am a freak, but I'm a  
              better woman than you are. Want  
              me to make your face look like 
              mine? 
 
    They are overawed by the woman and reluctantly withdraw. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)  
              Komomo was the most popular with 
              the men. She was so sweet and  
                beautiful... The older women were  
              jealous and always out to get her 
              one way or another.

                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
                      (shouting) 
              My ring is gone! My jade ring!  
              Someone stole my ring!  
 
    The girls stand in a line. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE (CONT'D)  
              Who took it? 
 
    The girls are SILENT. 
  18 


                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE (CONT'D)  
              I found this on the floor in my room. 
 
    She flashes an ornate hairpin in front of the girls. 
 
    Komomo GASPS. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              That's Komomo's. You always said 
              you wanted that ring, right, 
              Komomo? 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              Yeah, she did, right. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
                I never... 
 
                              WOMAN 
              Stop your lies. I never heard her 
              say anything like that.  
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              I heard her with my own ears. 
 
    The Madam of the House points at Komomo. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              Komomo, is this yours? 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              I don't know how --- 
 
    The Madam gives her the third degree pressing her for an  
    answer.  
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE  
              Why was it in my room?  
 
                              KOMOMO 
                I honestly don't know. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              That ring is far more valuable  
              than your skin. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              I didn't steal it.  
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              We shall see. Lock her in the  
              linen room. 
 
                              KOMOMO  
              No, no! I didn't do it. Please 
              forgive me!   19 


 
    Komomo is being dragged away to the linen room by the girls. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              Madam, Komomo isn't that kind of 
              girl. 
 
    The Madam of the House SLAPS the woman. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              Silence! You wretched little 
              scum! 
 
    She kicks the woman who cowers down. 
 
 
    31 THE WHOREHOUSE 1 - INT. THE LINEN ROOM 
 
    Komomo is naked and has been gagged with a hand towel. 
 
    The other prostitutes abuse her. 
 
    The woman can't bear to watch. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              Don't touch her face. Only the 
              body, but nowhere noticeable.  
              Don't leave marks. She's valuable  
                merchandise, and my property.  
 
    The prostitutes burn her below her bound armpits with a 
    roll of 30 incense sticks. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 3 
              Filthy girl, you pissed yourself 
              again! 
 
 
    32 THE WHOREHOUSE 1 - INT. THE LINEN ROOM 
 
    The women bind her legs and string her up over the wooden 
    support beam. Now Komomo hangs upside down on the rope tied 
    to her legs. 
 
    The prostitutes shove her back and forth. 
 
    Heavy smoke rises up from the incense. 
 
    All the woman can do to endure this scene is to hide her  
    face. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              I'm sorry... It was me. I took  
              it. 
  20 


                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              Where is my ring?  
 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              I don't remember. Please forgive 
              me...It hurts...Have mercy. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              Stubborn little cunt. 
 
                              TOUTER 
              One of the customers probably  
              talked her into it. If she won't  
              tell you now, she never will. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              I always said, whores can't be 
              trusted! Fine then, I'll work her 
              to death! 
 
 
    33 THE WHOREHOUSE 1 - INT. LINEN ROOM 
 
    Komomo is tied to a wooden support pillar. She's physically 
    drained but lets out a faint smile. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              In the end, they never found the 
              ring. No matter how hard they 
              beat her, she never talked. 
 
    Komomo makes some slack in the rope and gets a hand free. 
 
 
    34 THE WHOREHOUSE 1 - LINEN ROOM 
 
    SOMETIME LATER  
 
    The woman sneaks in with some water. 
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
                I brought some water, Komomo... 
 
    The CAMERA whirls around her to reveal:  
 
    Komomo swinging by a rope around her neck, hanging from a  
    wooden support beam at the end of her life. 
 
    The woman spills the water. 
 
      Christopher stands behind the woman as part of the 
    visuals in the flashback. 
  21 


                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Liar! I don't believe you. Komomo  
              would never --- 
 
                              WOMAN 
              She hung herself. She's dead.  
 
      Christopher stares at her with disbelief and a broken  
    heart.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Nothing you say will bring her  
              back. But I need to know the  
              truth. 
 
    The woman LAUGHS. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              Of course you do. Whores never  
              tell the truth, do we?  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Tell me. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              I wonder why people always want 
              to know the truth. Sometimes it's 
              better to be oblivious.  
                Sometimes the lie is better.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Please. I have to know.  
 
    The Woman looks at him, considering. We see the veil of  
    dishonesty slide from her face as she continues her story.  
 
 
    WOMAN'S FLASHBACK - 2 
 
 
    35 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. WHOREHOUSE 
 
    AN UGLY, REPULSIVE MAN jackhammers his flopping belly up  
    and down on top of the Woman.  
 
    She is on her back showing the pretty side of her face. The 
    man holds her by the neck.  
 
    There is no pleasure on her part, only mental detachment as 
    she separates her mind from the repugnant reality.  
 
    She closes her eyes. 
  22 


                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Men don't like our holes, they 
              yearn for the hell behind them. 
              The hell they were in before 
              being born. 
 
    She turns exposing the ugly side of her face. She opens her 
    eyes as if to say, 'Do you love me now?' 
 
 
    The CUSTOMER slaps her face bends her over and has his way 
    with her from behind, her deformed face obviously putting a 
    damper on his performance.  
 
                              CUSTOMER 
              Don't show me your face, you 
              slut! 
 
 
    36 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. WHOREHOUSE - DAY 
 
    Komomo sits with the woman. 
 
    PROSTITUTE 3 puts on her make up getting ready for another 
    evening of work. 
 
    Her hands slips smudging her make up. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 3 
              Damn it! I wish I were anywhere  
              else. Eating delicious food,  
              taking naps all day, wearing 
                beautiful clothes and laughing 
              all the time. I wish there were  
              such a place. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              Heaven is like that. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 3 
              Stupid tart. You can't go to 
              heaven unless you're dead. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              Then I'd rather be dead. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              You hear this fool?  
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              How do you think women like us 
              get to heaven? We have done no  
              good. The only place we're going 
              is hell. 
  23 


                              KOMOMO 
              That's not true. 
 
    Komomo looks uneasy and terribly frightened. 
 
                              KOMOMO (CONT'D)  
              I don't wanna go to hell. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              Even the devil makes mistakes. 
              Since you're always so happy, he  
              just might send you to heaven. 
 
    Komomo is reassured and smiles happily. 
 
 
    37 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. THE WOMAN'S ROOM  
 
    The Woman PAUSES; she's getting to the difficult part of  
    her story.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER  
              Go on...  
 
    She averts her eyes. She is not proud of what is to  
    follow.  
 
 
    38 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. THE MADAM OF THE HOUSE'S ROOM 
 
    The Madam puts away her ring in a chest of drawers. 
 
    The woman takes a peek at this while cleaning up. 
 
    Later, she sneaks into the room. 
 
    She takes the ring from the bureau. We'll find out why 
    later in the story. 
 
    Exiting to the hallway, she bumps into Komomo. 
 
    Komomo gives her a look. 
 
    The woman runs away. 
 
 
    39 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. THE MADAM OF THE HOUSE'S ROOM 
 
    Later that day, the Madam desperately searches for her 
    ring. 
 
    The woman approaches.  
 
                              WOMAN 
              Excuse me, Madam...  
  24 


                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              What? 
 
    The woman says nothing. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE (CONT'D)  
              Do you know something? 
 
                              WOMAN 
              When I was cleaning earlier, I 
              found this in the corner. 
 
    She hands the Madam an ornate hairpin, Komomo's hairpin. 
 
 
    40 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. LINEN ROOM 
 
    Sometime later, Komomo is dragged to the linen room. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              No, no, please forgive me! 
 
    The woman watches with cold eyes. 
 
 
    41 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. LINEN ROOM 
 
    Sometime later. Komomo is naked and gagged with a hand 
    towel. The other prostitutes abuse her. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              Hey princess, come clean! 
 
    The woman joins in the abuse. 
 
    Their eyes meet. 
 
    The woman diverts her eyes and takes part in the torture of  
    Komomo. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 3 
              Filthy girl, you pissed yourself 
              again! 
 
 
    42 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. LINEN ROOM 
 
    Later, Komomo hangs upside down on a rope. 
 
    The prostitutes shove her back and forth. 
 
    Heavy smoke rises up from the incense. 
 
    Komomo SOBS. 
  25 


                              KOMOMO 
              I'm sorry...It was me. I took it. 
 
                              MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
              Where's my ring? 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              I don't remember. Please forgive 
              me...It hurts...Have mercy. 
 
      Christopher stands in the frame of the flashback scene. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              You betrayed her? How could you?  
              Did you hate her that much? 
 
    No response from the woman. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)  
              Why? How can you live with 
                yourself? 
 
 
    43 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. LINEN ROOM 
 
    Komomo is tied to a wooden support pillar. She's exhausted 
    but finds the strength to smile weakly. 
 
    The woman sneaks into the linen room with some water. 
 
                              WOMAN 
                I brought some water, Komomo. 
 
    The woman unties the ropes. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              Water. 
 
    She helps Komomo drink. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              Hurry before they see you. 
 
                              KOMOMO 
                    (little more than a whisper)  
              Thank you.  
 
    She moves behind Komomo, wraps the slack around her neck 
    and suddenly PULLS IT TIGHT, strangling her.  
 
    Komomo looks over her shoulder, her eyes bulging.  
 
    Their eyes meet. 
 
      Christopher and the woman appear in the flashback, 
    witnessing the scene.  26 


 
                              WOMAN 
                    (cold hearted,  
                      emotionless tone like  
                      talking about  
                      yesterday's weather)  
              I can stand any kind of cruelty. 
              But what I can't take is... 
                kindness.  Maybe she wasn't a whore  
              but a woman with a lovely heart. Even  
              though her body was in hell, her  
              mind was in heaven. Her soul  
              wanted to be there... needed to be.  
              Mister, her eyes were the most  
                beautiful I'd ever seen. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
                    (enraged)  
              Jesus! You killed her. An 
              innocent girl who never harmed 
              anyone. For some trinket you 
              wanted, you killed my Komomo.  
 
                              WOMAN 
                    (matter of factly)  
              You don't understand: I helped  
              her get to heaven. I had never 
              decided one thing, not a single  
              thing by myself until then. For 
              the first time, I took action by 
              myself. And I'm going to hell for 
              it. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
                      (muttering to himself) 
                  This...is...insane. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              I won't be damned to hell. I'll 
              go by myself. And so I hated 
              Komomo. I had to. I made myself  
              hate her.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              That doesn't make any sense! 
  27 


                              WOMAN 
              Suppose I like her. What would 
              the devil think of her having 
              such an evil friend! He'd think 
              if they are friends, then Komomo  
              must be a wicked person, too. He  
              would have sent her to hell!!  
                    (a beat) 
              So I hated Komomo. And now I'm  
              sure she's in heaven. What could 
              be more pitiful? To be strangled  
              to death by the one you trusted 
              the most. I'm sure Buddha grabbed 
              her by the hand and took her to 
              heaven. Right, sis?  
 
 
      Christopher doesn't know what to make of all this or who 
    she's talking to. He looks over his shoulder where she  
    seems to be looking, but there is nothing there but  
    shadows.  
 
    Komomo reaches out her hand in agony and grabs the woman's  
    hair. A strange SQUIRMING, SHUFFLING SOUND as the woman's  
    hair MOVES...  
 
    Komomo sees something that TERRIFIES her, and her EYES go  
    WIDE in HORROR.  
 
    Right before she dies, she tries to scream but is too 
    frightened to make a sound. 
 
 
    44 THE WHOREHOUSE 2 - INT. WOMAN'S ROOM 
 
      Christopher confronts the woman. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              What aren't you telling me?  
 
    She stares silently back at him.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)  
              What are you hiding from me?  
 
    A VOICE comes from the woman, possibly from the side of her  
    head. 
 
    But her lips do not move.  
 
                              A VOICE 
              Tell him the truth.  
 
    The pinwheels start to turn of their own volition, despite  
    the door being closed.  
  28 


      Christopher ponders where the voice is coming from. Since 
    he's already seen hallucinations and is now hearing voices, 
    he can't help but wonder what is next.  
 
    The Woman suddenly buckles, her face coiling into a  
    grimace.  
 
                              WOMAN 
              No! It hurts! 
 
    The woman holds her head in pain. 
 
                              A VOICE 
              You want to know, right? 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Yes, tell me. 
 
    The woman is in agony, but now she is determined to tell  
    the truth.  
 
                              WOMAN  
              Then I shall. I shall tell you my  
              story.  
 
 
    45 WOMAN'S FLASHBACK - THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              My dadda and mamma were beggars.  
              They called no one place home.  
 
    A HUSBAND AND WIFE, a COUPLE of beggars, walk down a  
    mountain village road.

                              WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)  
                Wandering from place to place, 
              they ended up in this place. 
              Folks called it Drought Gulch,  
              but no water flowed there.  
              It was a god-forsaken place where  
              it never rained, the poorest 
              village in the region. Compared 
              to there, this rotten island is  
                paradise.

    46 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. A DILAPIDATED HOVEL 
    NEAR THE RIVER 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Our shack was built right on top  
              of a cursed area. Folks said it 
              was the crossroads where goblins 
              and bad spirits roamed.  
 
 
    47 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. THE RIVER 
 
    A newborn baby is thrown into a river. 
 
    The woman's mother is the one doing the throwing. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Momma wasn't a midwife. She 
              worked with babies but was more 
              of a 'specialist'. I'm sure you  
              have the same practice in  
              America, right?  
 
    The mother gives an expressionless stare as she watches the  
    dead fetus float down stream. 
 
    48 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - INT. A DILAPIDATED HOVEL 
    NEAR THE RIVER 
 
    The mother returns home. 
 
    The father has been drinking since midday. His glass and 
    bottle has run dry. 
 
                              FATHER 
              More sake! 
 
                              MOTHER 
              With what money? 
 
    The man throws his glass at her and then starts hitting 
    her. 
 
                              MOTHER (CONT'D)  
              Forgive me. Please.  
 
 
    49 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - INT. SHED 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Despite his cruelty and drinking, 
              momma played the good wife. She 
              soon got pregnant with me. 
 
    SCREAMING in the shed, the mother is in labor giving birth. 
  30 


    The mother looks at the face of the child she just dropped 
    and SCREAMS with fear in her eyes. 
 
 
    50 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. THE RIVER  
 
    The mother exits the shed. She heads for the river right in 
    front of her staggering the whole time. 
 
    She throws the newborn baby into the river. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              You asked for the truth. Yes...I 
              was dumped in the river and left  
              to die, too.  
 
 
    51 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. THE RIVER - TWO DAYS 
    LATER 
 
    The mother comes to the river to dispose of another aborted 
    child. 
 
    She HEARS the sound of a baby CRYING. 
 
    REVEAL SHOT: A CRYING BABY behind the reeds. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              But two days later, I was still  
              alive and kicking. 
 
    The mother can't believe her eyes. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)  
              Momma made up her mind to raise 
              me. 
 
 
    52 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. AN OPEN FIELD - DAY 
 
    A young girl blows on a pinwheel, then places it in its  
    place next to several others, in memory of another baby  
    that will meet its fate at the time of its birth.  
 
    The left side of the young girl's face is stiff and  
    cramped. 
 
    The girl picks Chinese lantern plants and wild 
      chrysanthemums. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              As long as I can remember I 
              helped momma with her work.  
 
  31 


    53 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - INT. SOMEONE S ROOM - DAY 
 
    The young girl holds down the hands of a PREGNANT WOMAN. 
 
    Her mother takes one wild chrysanthemum from the bunch of 
    flowers that the little girl picked. 
 
    The root of the flower is inserted into the woman's vagina. 
    (All shot in a manner made for television.) 
 
    The pregnant woman SCREAMS from the pain. 
 
    She scowls at the little girl while yelling. 
 
    We see the mother churning her hand between the woman's 
    bloody midsection. (All shot in a manner made for 
    television.) 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              That hole is the one that leads 
              to hell. 
 
    The pregnant woman glares at the little girl. 
 
    Her mother throws the removed fetus into a bucket. 
 
 
                              MOTHER 
              Dump this. 
 
 
    54 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. THE RIVER - DAY 
 
    The girl scurries to the river's edge, and dumps the fetus  
    in the river. 
 
    The FETUS MOANS as it floats down stream. 
 
    It suddenly opens its eyes.  
 
    The girl is startled with fear. 
 
    The fetus keeps it eyes on the girl as it washes down 
    stream. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              To this day, I still wonder what 
              it was looking at.  
 
 
    55 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - INT. A DESOLATED TEMPLE 
    - DAY 
 
    The young girl peers at a storybook of pictures of sinners 
    suffering in hell. 
  32 


    A BUDDHIST PRIEST (39) LEERS over her, practically DROOLING  
    in sexual hunger over her. He caresses her suggestively  
    from behind. 
 
                              BUDDHIST PRIEST 
              Pretty scary, huh? These drawings 
              were made with real blood. 
 
    The priest strokes her body. 
 
                              BUDDHIST PRIEST (CONT'D)  
              Listen now, if you don't do as I 
              say, you'll go to straight to 
              hell. 
 
    The girl peers at the pictures. The look on her guilty and 
    violated face implies that she is being molested.  
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.)  
              And so this hole lead to hell 
              too. 
 
 
    56 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. THE RIVER - DAY 
 
    The mother and the little girl walk carrying buckets. 
 
    YOUNG BOYS from the village throws rocks at them. 
 
                              YOUNG BOY 1 
              Baby killer! 
 
                              YOUNG BOY 2 
              Beggar! 
 
                              YOUNG BOY 3 
              Freak!! 
 
                            ALL YOUNG BOYS 
              Freak! Freak! Freak! 
 
                              MOTHER 
              Go away, you little brats!  
 
    A rock HITS the girl and she drops the bucket. 
 
    The young boys SCREAM and scatter. 
 
    The girl says nothing and reaches to pick up the dead 
    fetus. 
 
 
    57 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - INT. A DILAPIDATED HOVEL 
 
    The father repeatedly HITS the mother. It is brutal, almost 
    impossible to watch.   33 


 
    Blood bleeds from her eye. 
 
    She makes a desperate escape, escaping from her pig of a  
    husband.  
 
    The young girl sits quaking in the corner of the room. Her 
    father turns from the fleeing mother to his lovely,  
    deformed little girl.  
 
    With bloodshot alcoholic eyes, the father stands, towering 
    over her, then sidles up to the girl and stares her down. She 
    tries to back away from him, but she is against the  
    wall. There is no escape.  
 
                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:  
 
 
    58 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - INT. A DILAPIDATED HOVEL 
    - LATER  
 
    Sometime later, after being raped by her father, the girl 
    lays stretched out on the floor with an expressionless 
    face. 
 
 
 
    59 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. THE RIVER - NIGHT 
 
    The father stumbles along the riverside, besotted by sake.  
 
    The girl suddenly jumps out from the underbrush brandishing 
    a wooden hammer. 
 
                              FATHER 
              Y-you. 
 
    He gets WHACKED on the back of the head making his escape. 
 
    Another blow is brought down upon his brains from behind. 
    Life and brains are running out the jagged hole in the back 
    of his head.  
 
    There's MOVEMENT on her SCALP: a RUSTLING in her hair.  
 
    With a final, victorious SCREAM, the girl grabs his head in  
    her hands, and drowns him in the river.  
 
    ANGLE - THEIR REFLECTION IN THE RIVER  
 
    An image of her OLDER SISTER with misshapen hair vaguely  
    reflects in the river, behind the horrified face of the  
    drunken, dying father.  
 
 
    RESUME SCENE   34 


 
    60 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. THE RIVER  - NIGHT 
 
    The father floats face down in the river. 
 
    As she watches him drift away, there is MOVEMENT behind  
    her.  
 
 
    61 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - EXT. A DILAPIDATED HOVEL 
    - DAY  
 
    The ten year old girl is taken away by a man who she's been  
    sold to. They pull her by force dragging her away.  
 
    Her mother watches her daughter being taken away with an  
    expressionless face. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              I had nothing. Only this hole 
              bound for hell. Trading it to 
              make my living was only natural.  
 
 
    62 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 2 - INT. A ROOM IN THE 
    WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT 
 
    The VOICE LAUGHS hideously. 
 
    The sound seems to be coming from inside the woman's head. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              Sis! It hurts! Please! Stop!  
 
    The woman holds her head and faints in agony. 
 
    Suddenly, her hair turns over strand by strand like pages 
    in a book. 
 
      Christopher doesn't know what to make of it. He takes a  
    step back, horrified, as the Woman's head seems to shift  
    and change shape!  
 
    Fingers poke out as if they were buried in the left side of 
    her head. (The fingers have hair growing on them so when 
    they are buried, they can easily hide in the woman's full 
    head of long hair. 
 
    As the fingers open up, another face clinging to the 
    woman's head appears. 
 
    It's the woman's TWIN SISTER. The sister's lower jaw is 
    buried in the woman's head and can't be seen. 
 
    The sister spits out the jade ring she holds in her mouth, 
    CACKLES and rests her front teeth on the woman's scalp.  35 


 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              Ohhh, stop it, sis! It hurts!  
 
      Christopher looks at the woman in disbelief, as the Woman  
    drags her face around toward him.  
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              I'll bet that got your attention, 
              mister. Yes. I'm a twin. This is  
              my sister. 
 
    The sister peers at Christopher. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Mary Mother of God!  
 
 
    63 WOMAN'S FLASHBACK - THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 3 
 
    After giving birth alone, the mother looks at her baby and 
    SCREAMS. 
    The child has two faces. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Nobody ever knew about my sister. 
              Nobody except momma. Oh, she  
              knew. 
 
 
    64 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 3 - EXT. THE RIVER - TWO DAYS 
    LATER 
 
    The mother discovers her crying baby. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              The fear of being possessed by  
              these twins would have scared 
              anyone. Momma brought us back  
              that day because she feared being 
              cursed. 
 
 
    65 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 3 - EXT. WATERSIDE - DAY 
 
    The little girl unties her hair by a deserted riverbank. 
 
    Her sister pops out. 
 
    She sings a song in a very CHILDISH VOICE. 
 
 
    66 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 3 - INT. A DILAPIDATED HOVEL 
 
    The little girl wriggles in pain in the corner as her 
    sister bites her.  36 


 
                            GIRL 
              Sis, it hurts. Stop it. 
 
                              SISTER 
              Kill, kill, kill. 
 
                            GIRL 
              Ow, no!  
 
                              SISTER 
              Kill, kill, kill, kill. 
 
 
    67 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 3 - EXT. THE RIVER - NIGHT 
 
    The little girl hides in the reeds, waiting to ambush her  
    drunken father, who is weaving unsteadily down the road.  
 
                              SISTER 
              Kill, kill, kill, kill. 
 
    The little girl whips out a wooden hammer. 
 
                              FATHER 
              Y-you! 
 
    She violently smashes the hammer into his head, over and  
    over.  
 
                            GIRL 
              Die, die, die, die!

    After killing her father, the face of her twin sister 
    reflects in the river. 
 
    Her twin happily LAUGHS. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              It turned out that Momma and  
              Dadda were brother and sister.  
              People found out and ran them out 
              of town. While begging their way 
              across the country, they escaped  
              to this place. My sister and I  
              were cursed long before coming  
              into this world.

    The woman gazes at the Madam's jade ring.

    The twin bites her. The woman frantically bears the pain.

              Please, anything but that, sis'.

              Sister always loved pretty, shiny  
              things. I couldn't fight her.

              always got it, no matter what.

      Christopher sits with the woman, horrified by these

    but believe.

              But I was the one who decided to 
              kill Komomo. All my sister wanted  
              was the ring. Either way, we're 
              stuck with each other and we're 
              both going to hell. Right, sis?  
 
    The sister GIGGLES.

    The sister TALKS IN KOMOMO'S VOICE. 
 
                              SISTER 
                    (talking like Komomo) 
              I waited and waited for you 
                Christopher. 
 
    He is horrified by the familiar voice.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER  
              ... Komomo?  
 
                              SISTER  
                    (giggles)  
              Your Komomo...  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER  
              I should have never come to this 
              damned place. 
 
                              SISTER 
              It doesn't matter where you go.  
              Your hell follows you. I know 
              what you did back in America. 
 
    The sister TALKS IN THE VOICE OF CHRISTOPHER'S DEAD SISTER 
    in unaccented English. 
 
                              SISTER (CONT'D)  
              You're hurting me. Stop it, 
                Christopher! Why did you kill me?  
              Why would you hurt me? Your own  
              little sister? I did what you  
              asked. Why?  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Enough! Stop it you freak! 
 
      Christopher takes out a pistol from his jacket. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)  
              I'll give you what you want. I'll 
              send you to hell. 
 
                              WOMAN 
              You can't do it. 
 
    He FIRES the pistol. 
 
    A shot hits the woman in the chest. But she is still alive, 
    almost unaffected and standing. 
 
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)  
              You can't kill us.  
 
    The sister CACKLES.  39 


 
      Christopher turns to see the shadows shifting all around  
    the room, taking shape in the corners to reveal:  
 
    The ghost of their father and other spirits standing and  
    rising from the shadows in the corner of the little wooden  
    room.  
 
      Christopher shakes all over but takes careful aim for the  
    woman's head and FIRES.  
 
    The woman suddenly morphs into Komomo with part of her head 
    blown off. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Komomo! 
 
                              KOMOMO 
              I waited for you.  
 
    Komomo falls over. Blood flows from Komomo's dead body onto 
    the tatami mat floor. 
 
      Christopher SCREAMS. 
 
    72 INT. A PRISON CELL 
 
    An isolation cell made of bricks. Water DRIPS. 
 
      Christopher GROANS with his hands and feet bound in 
    shackles. 
 
    His unfettered hair has grown several inches. Time has 
    passed. He's filthy.  
 
                              PRISON GUARD 1 
              Jesus! Get a whiff of that guy!  
 
    PRISON GUARD 2 tramples Christopher. 
 
                              PRISON GUARD 2 
              The bastard's a murderer.  
 
                              PRISON GUARD 1 
              Is that the American newspaperman  
              who killed that whore?  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
                Please... Help me...  
 
    Guard 1 kicks him. 
 
    Guard 2 ladles out some water from a bucket and dishes out 
    some cooked grains on a plate.

                              PRISON GUARD 2 
              Get this through your thick 
              skull. You'll be locked in here  
              until you die. That's the 
                punishment for killing an 
              innocent woman. But death won't 
              come soon. We'll have our fun. 
              This will be a living hell. 
 
    The cell door CLOSES. 
 
    He crawls over and drinks the water. 
 
    He then notices that the pail is stained with blood. A dead 
    fetus floats inside. 
 
    He SCREAMS. 
 
    He flips the pail over and moves away. 
 
    Komomo's ghost stands in the corner of his cell. 
 
    He SCREAMS. 
 
    She reaches out her hands to him but he's terrified, and  
    tries to get away. 
    He bangs his head on the wall over and over again. Each 
    blow gets more violent. 
 
    Suddenly, Komomo transforms into a little girl with blue  
    eyes. 
 
    Christopher's dead sister peers at him with eyes of stained 
    innocence.  
 
 
    73 INT. WHOREHOUSE, A LONG HALLWAY 
 
    A dimly lit hallway. 
 
 
    74 INT. WHOREHOUSE 
 
    The white powdered necks of prostitutes as they extend 
    their hands soliciting men. 
 
    A woman sits in the back behind the latticed window. 
 
    Her sister moves behind her hair. 
 
    The woman shakes off some unseen force. 
 
                                                                      FADE OUT. 
 
                                THE END
