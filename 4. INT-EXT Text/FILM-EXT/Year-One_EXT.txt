A TRIBE OF PRIMITIVE CAUCASIANS. Dozens of huts surround a
mmunal fire pit where WOMEN in loincloths roll flatbread
CO
and cook it on heated rocks. The drums start pounding out a
celebratory rhythm as the HUNTERS enter carrying a DEAD BOAR
on a pole, their faces marked with boar's blood, ritual signs
in honor of the kill.
The lead hunter MARLAK, is a hulking thug with a bony,
Neanderthal forehead. He cuts off the boar's head and drops
it at Maya's feet.
MARLAK
(blunt grunt)
For you.
MAYA
(forces a grateful smile)
Thank you, Marlak.

ZED'S HUT
Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut,
his guts still aching. His best friend OH sits next to him
sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy,
jealous of the attention they're getting from the women.
If Zed is over-confident and reckless, Oh is his polar
opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the kind of guy who would
apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear. He
may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been
invented he'd be wearing them.
OH
(GRUMBLING)
Look at them. Hunters think
they're so cool. They don't think
gathering is dangerous? There are
thorns-- bees-- those big stingy
ants. I could hunt-- I just don't
want to. And what's with the blood
on their faces? They think that's
sanitary?

ZED
(miserable with pain)
Do me a favor. Just kill me.
OH
Why did you eat that fruit? It's
forbidden. Everybody knows that.
ZED
I couldn't help myself! Maya was
just staring at me with those pouty
eyes-- and those perky breasts--
opposable thumbs. And how about
the name? "The Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil"? You
don't think that sounds tempting?
They should've just called it "The
Tree with the Fruit that Tastes
Like Shit." Then for sure nobody
would eat it.
Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind
his dwelling.
ZED
(cont'd)
(shouts testily)
Hey! Squanto! Give me a break,
would ya'! You got the whole
forest!
(to Oh)
Why does everyone have to crap
right behind my hut?
OH
I think, and I could be wrong, that
all the poop makes the ground more
fertile, which in turn, gives the
leaves in the area a softer feel.
It's a vicious circle.
Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the
communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps.
OH
(cont'd)
(calls out eagerly)
Hi, Eema!
Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave,
then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh
that makes them laugh.
Official White

OH
(cont'd)
She doesn't even know I exist.
(LOVE-STRUCK)
I want to lay with her so badly.
ZED
I don't see it. I mean she's cute,
but I don't think I'd lay with her.
OH
Of course not! She's your sister!
It'd be like sleeping with your
mother.
ZED
which was a big mistake. I see
that now. You think it won't be
awkward the next morning but--
trust me, you just want to rip your
eyeballs out.
(shakes off the memory)
Listen, if you want to impress
Eema, tonight at the feast, do the
fertility dance with her, then drag
her back to your hut.
OH
My hut's a mess. And what if she
struggles?
ZED
So you give her a little tap on the
head. Women respond to that--
OH
(SIGHS)
No. She only likes hunters-- not
gatherers.
They look over at Eema, who is now slowly stroking the shaft
of a hunter's spear.
ZED
I wouldn't read too much into that.
She kisses, then tongues the spear tip.
ZED
(cont'd)
Okay, that might mean something.
The hunter Marlak walks by and stops. He's clearly half a
rung lower on the human evolutionary scale.
Official White

MARLAK
You didn't hunt today.
ZED
Yes, Marlak. Very observant. I
was indisposed. Got that
intestinal thing that's been going
around.
Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the
walls of Zed's hut.
MARLAK
(points at a drawing)
What's that supposed to be?
ZED
It's a bear.
MARLAK
That's not a bear. That's just
some lines on a skin.
ZED
(SIGHS)
It's not a real bear. It's a
"representation" of a bear. You
know, a "picture."
MARLAK
That's stupid.
ZED
Yeah. Like you'd know.
MARLAK
And what's that?
He picks up a skin with another of Zed's drawings on it, this
one of a big-breasted naked girl. Zed quickly grabs it and
holds it upside down.
ZED
That-- would be an antelope-- or a
deer-- a deerpalope.
MARLAK
(trying to look at it
upside down)
It looks like Maya.
Official White

ZED
(hides it away)
How could it be Maya? It's just
some lines on a skin.
MARLAK
Stay away from my woman.
ZED
Your woman? I'm not sure dragging
her into the bushes kicking and
screaming means you have an actual
"thing" going.
Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head.

Stay away.

A ROARING FIRE
The DRUMS kick up another notch as the huge boar roasts on a
spit over a roaring fire.
The tribe is gathered around the big fire pit. The tribe's
SHAMAN, their medicine man and spirit leader, dances around
the fire in a boar's head mask, accessorized with way too
many bones, beads and feathers.
Zed and Oh are sitting near the fire, smoking something in a
long, decorated pipe.
ZED
Hey, Oh? Did it ever occur to you
that there may be more to life than
this?
OH
(taking the pipe from Zed)
Okay, I think somebody's had
enough.
Official White

ZED
No,
I'm serious.We're born into
thisworld, we hunt, we gather, we
eat,we sleep, we make babies--
OH
You make babies--
ZED
--but why? What's the point?
OH
You always get like this when you
smoke.
Oh takes a big toke on the pipe, chokes, and starts coughing
uncontrollably.
ZED
No. Last night I couldn't sleep,
so I just laid there looking up at
the sky, counting the stars. There
were over seventy. Kinda makes you
think, doesn't it?
OH
(looks up at the sky)
No.
ZED
Really? I've been thinking about
it ever since I ate that fruit.
Don't you ever wonder what's on the
other side of the mountains?
OH
There's nothing on the other side
of the mountains. Everybody knows
that. The world just ends. You'd
fall right off the edge.
(makes a sharp gesture)
ZED
But what if it doesn't? What if it
just goes on and on forever? Or
what if it's round?
(he picks up a round
ROCK))
And if you keep walking you
eventually come right back to where
you started?
He traces the circumference with his finger.

OH
(SCOFFS)
Oh, yeah, that's plausible.
Zed flings the rock away.
A VILLAGER (O.C.)
Oww!
ZED
(waves apologetically)
Sorry!
OH
(tries to cheer him up
Will you stop with that crazy talk?
We're at a feast. You love feasts.
There's women, there's boar meat,
there's an assortment of berries--
there's women--
Oh looks over at Eema. Zed picks up on it.
ZED
Do it, man! Go dance for her.
OH
You think? They're playing the
Jackal Dance. I don't do that one
so well.
ZED
Are you kidding? Go! Jackal
Dance!
Oh summons his courage, gets up and crosses to where the
girls are sitting.
Zed makes subtle eye contact with Maya, waggles his eyebrows
and licks his lips. She laughs and looks away.
Oh starts dancing timidly right in front of Eema, subtly
jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool.
Eema just stares at him for a moment, then goes back to
talking to her friends. Oh looks over at Zed for help.
Zed mimes clonking her on the head.
Oh picks up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin.
However, instead of submitting, she gets really pissed,
stands up and decks him with one punch.

THE FIRE PIT - MINUTES LATER
A hunter is slicing off hunks of boar meat for the other
tribesmen. Zed pushes through the small crowd waiting for
food and goes to the front.
ZED
Excuse me, hunter coming through.
VILLAGERS
Hey! Wait your turn! There's a
line here, buddy!
ZED
For your information I was in line
and I just stepped out to chew some
food for an elderly lady.
Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face, stopping
him. It's Marlak, who towers over Zed. His cohort,
ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him.
MARLAK
Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the
garden with Maya.
ZED
Oh, really? And what if I called
Enmebaragesi a liar?
ENMEBARAGESI
I'd kill you.
ZED
Calm down. I said "what
if"-- it
was a hypothetical.
Marlak gets right in Zed's face.
MARLAK
Enmebaragesi doesn't lie.
Villagers gather around them, Maya and Eema among them.
Marlak puts his spear point to Zed's throat.
MARLAK (cont'd)
The truth!

MAYA
Zed, just admit it. You're just
making it harder on yourself.
ZED

No, you just made it harder on
myself!
(to Marlak)
Okay, fine, you got me.
(gingerly moves the spear

Maya and I lay together on
occasion. We're consenting adults
and we have an adventurous sexual
relationship.
Maya looks shocked, and tries to signal Zed to shut up.
MARLAK
(STUNNED)
You laid with my woman?
ZED
Isn't that what we're talking
about?
Maya rolls her eyes.
ENMEBARAGESI
No, I saw you eat the Forbidden
Fruit.
ZED
Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the
fruit. I was just kidding about
humping Maya.
Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The DRUMMING stops.
Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed.

Marlak growls at him.

Oooh, shooting star.

Zed gets to his feet.
ZED
Look, Marlak, this is crazy.
You're two of me. I'm not gonna
fight you over a girl, okay?
Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD
HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an
unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose.
Zed
(cont'd)
(to Enmebaragesi)
And let that be a lesson to your
big friend-
Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid-
section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends
him sprawling to the ground.
MARLAK
(standing over Zed)
Your father was a great hunter, but
you're like-- a girl.
The hunters laugh.
ENMEBARAGESI
Good one, Marlak.
ANOTHER HUNTER
Zing.
MARLAK
Now I kill you.
He's about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and
jumps between them. The villagers step back as the Shaman
howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed.

Zed and the Shaman sit side by side on a log, talking

The Shaman is covered in skins, feathers, bones, beads,
animal teeth, antlers and horns, his hair a mass of long,
muddy dreadlocks, his face painted, his cheeks, nose, and
ears pierced by shards of bone. But if not for his
outlandish getup, zed could be talking to his pastor.
SHAMAN
You really ate the fruit?
ZED
One bite! What's the big deal?
SHAMAN
(halfheartedly shakes a
chicken-foot rattle at
HIM)
You don't eat the fruit! That's
been the number one rule from the
beginning of time. Since the Great
Turtle climbed from the sea with
the Earth on his back, drank the
ocean, pooped out the mountains and
the first man fell from the stars.
ZED
I've always had trouble with the
Great Turtle Theory-- too many
unexplained gaps.
SHAMAN
Whatever. You're screwed now.
ZED
Really? How screwed? Like I knew
it was a rule but I'm a little
fuzzy on the exact details.
SHAMAN
You're cursed, man, and if you stay
here then we'll all be cursed. You
have to leave.
ZED
Where am I supposed to go?
SHAMAN
Up to you. From now on you're
completely on your own.
ZED
(DEFIANT)
Oh, really?

ZED
(cont'd)
Am I detecting a little jealousy
here because I now have the
knowledge of good and evil and you
don't? Well, you know what? I say
what I did was a good thing-- a
very very good thing-- and I'm not
leaving. What do you think of
that?
A HUMAN SKULL comes flying in from off-camera and lands at
his feet.
ZED
(cont'd)
Okay, is that supposed to be funny?
He stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing
around them in a wide circle.
Marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal-hide shield,
starting a rhythmical beat. The other hunters join in,
keeping the beat, staring at Zed with lethal intent
SHAMAN
(to Zed, re the hunters)
You should probably get going now.
You better take this knife.
He hands him a flint knife with a leather-wrapped handle.
SHAMAN
(cont'd)
And some of the guys got together
and they want you to have this bow.
He hands him a strong hunter's bow.
ZED
I don't want to seem ungrateful or
anything, but you wouldn't happen
to have any arrows, would you?
An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head.
SHAMAN
(to Zed)
You'd better get moving.
Zed looks around at his fellow villagers, trying to summon
what dignity he has left.
ZED
(DEFIANT)
Okay, but before I go I just want
to say something. I know I'm not
the greatest hunter--
Official White

VILLAGER (O.S.)
--Or gatherer--
ZED
Yes, or gatherer-- but there's got
to be more to life than this--
(to Hunters)
Kinda hard to concentrate with that
rhythmic drumming, fellas.
The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed.
ZED
(cont'd)
(rolls his eyes; "these
guys are hopeless")
Anyways, I'm going away, not
because you're forcing me to--
which you are-- but because I
choose to. Yes, I ate from the
Tree of the Knowledge of Good and
Evil-- major misunderstanding on my
part-- and believe me I'm not
recommending it unless you're
interested in a very powerful
laxative-- but it got me thinking
about some pretty heavy stuff --
life questions, you know. So I'm
out of here, and anyone who wants
to join me is welcome.
He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak
staring at her and averts her eyes.
ZED
(cont'd)
ANYONE--
Zed looks at oh, who suddenly becomes very interested in an
imaginary piece of loincloth lint.
ZED

(looks directly at Oh)
I don't know where we're going or
when we're going to get there, but
I will lead the way--
(he picks up a burning
TORCH)
lighting up the darkness-- pointing
us in the right direction, and
keeping us entertained with
humorous anecdotes from my
childhood. Now who's with me?
He enthusiastically thrusts the torch in the air.

Oh looks at Eema, then at Zed, and lowers his eyes.
ZED
(cont'd)
Okay, then I guess I'll just have
to go it alone, which is fine with
ME--
(to Oh)
--better, in fact, because having a
partner would just slow me down.
Oh can't look at him.
Zed shakes his head, failing to notice that the torch he's
holding has ignited the roof of the hut next to him.
The Shaman shouts and points at the now blazing roof.
ZED
(cont'd)
Oops!
They all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to roof.
ZED

I know there's a lesson in here
somewhere. Any thoughts?
The villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts.
It's chaos.

Zed runs for his life through the dense forest.
The hunters chase him, shooting arrows at him on a dead run.
Zed dodges as the arrows zip around him. He veers left, then
right, then trips and tumbles down a muddy embankment.
The hunters stop at the top of the embankment. Marlak
listens for sounds of movement in the forest below, then
silently signals for the hunters to fan out.

Marlak nimbly makes his way down the embankment, reaches the
bottom and sees something in the moonlight.
It's Zed lying on the ground, badly camouflaged with sticks
and leaves, thinking he can't be seen, but the shape of his
body is clearly discernible. Marlak raises his spear.
MARLAK
I see you.
ZED
(long beat)
No, you don't.
MARLAK
Yes, I do.
ZED
How can you see me if I'm not here?
MARLAK
You're trying to trick me.
ZED
Okay, then tell me this-- who's
standing right behind you?
MARLAK
(nobody's fool)
You think I'm going to turn around
and look, but I'm not.
(pulls his knife)
I'm going to gut you like a pig.
He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is
struck from behind by a heavy tree branch. He falls heavily,
knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the
makeshift club.
Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh.
OH
I guess I'm with you.
ZED
Was it my speech?
OH
No, the fire. I lost everything.
Official White

You know what we should do? You

ever-- just huge!-- and take it
back to the village. Just to show
them. And we won't let anyone else
eat it. They'll have to watch us
eat it.
OH
If it's that huge how would we
carry it back?
ZED

Fine, we'll just start with
something small. A squirrel or
something.

eat a squirrel. Will you get real?
There's no going back! There's,

Yeah, like it's so hard to build a
new hut. It's just a pile of

You're a pile of sticks and dung.
Suddenly, Zed stops and stands perfectly still.
ZED

Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head. Oh looks up.
A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap.
Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists.
ZED
Don't move a muscle.
OH
Will that work?

I don't know. There's two

Oh sighs. His body is covered with long claw marks.
ZED
You really should put some maggots
on those scratches. They look
pretty deep.
OH

not to move, and you ran.

Because I honestly thought he'd go

OH
Yeah, big favor.
ZED
You didn't have to come with me,
you know. I didn't ask you to
come.
OH
Yes, you did! You looked right at
me-- twice.
ZED
Yes, that's a technique of public
speaking, but I didn't ask you
specifically. You chose to come.
You gotta take some responsibility
for that. And there's no point
coming if you're just gonna keep

stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and
they peer through the bushes.
THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond it, well-
tended fields of growing grain.
Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals
Oh to be quiet and stay put.
ZED

This one's mine.
He takes his bow, pulls an arrow from his quiver, and slowly
draws the bow, taking deadly aim at one of the cows. He
shoots.

bounces off. The cow looks up.

Lying on the ground, Zed looks up and sees TWO SURPRISED

at him.
FIRST YOUNG FARMER
Did you just shoot my cow?

ZED
We're not really that insulted--
CAIN

Take it back!

ABEL
(pushes back)
Make me!
Zed steps between them, trying to make peace.
ZED
Boys, boys! You're brothers!
Let's just relax and--
Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight
is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and
wrestle each other to the ground.
OH
Shouldn't we do something?
ZED
Just let them settle it.
Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head
with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and
lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing
hard.
ZED
(cont'd)
(SHOCKED)
I guess that settles it.
CAIN
(turns on him sharply,
still holding the bloody
ROCK)
What?!
ZED
Nothing!
Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground.
CAIN
He's all right. Probably just
RESTING--
OH
(humoring him)
Probably just tuckered out from the
fight.
CAIN
(looking around nervously)
Yeah.

CAIN

Maybe I should throw some dirt on
him-- keep him warm 'til he wakes
up.
He starts kicking dirt over Abel's body.
CAIN
(cont'd)
(getting worried)
This is bad. This is really bad.
We're in serious trouble.
ZED
Hey! What do you mean "we"? I
don't want to play the blame game,
but you're the one who hit him.
CAIN
(turns on them)
You could've stopped me! There's
two of you and only one of me.
ZED
We didn't know you were going to
kill him--
CAIN
You calling me a murderer?
(he clutches the rock)
ZED
Did I say that?
CAIN
It was an accident!
(to Oh)
Right?
OH
Right! You were holding the rock
and he-- accidentally ran into it--
really hard-- with his head.
CAIN
(calming down)
Okay-- yeah-- good. But it might
be better if we don't mention the
"accident" to anyone. People might
get the wrong idea. Understand?
OH
Oh, yeah, people could so easily
misinterpret that.

ZED
(SHRUGS)
Why even bring it up?
CAIN
(NODS)
I like you guys. You're all right.
Why don't you come with me? Have
supper with the family.
ZED
Unfortunately we already have
dinner plans.
CAIN
I think you should come with me.
OH

why don't we go with you?

Cain finishes loading bushels of grain onto an oxcart while
Zed and Oh closely inspect the big, heavy, solid wooden
wheels on the cart.
ZED
What are the big round things for?
CAIN
They're wheels, numbskull. They
make the cart roll.
ZED
(blown away)
Wow! That is like the greatest
invention since the vagina.
Cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward.
Oh screams as the HEAVY WHEELS ROLL OVER HIS FEET.

PULL BACK TO
REVEAL:
THE CART
with them riding on it, plodding slowly into a FARMING
HAMLET,a cluster of small, roughly plastered mud houses with
thatched roofs.
ADAM, dour, hard-working and long-suffering, but still strong
and upright, trudges home with a metal scythe over his
shoulder. He could be Max Von Sydow.
ADAM
(hailing Cain)
Cain, my son!
CAIN
Hail, Father.
Cain stops the cart and dismounts with Zed and Oh.
CAIN
(cont'd)
Can these guys stay for supper?
(off Adam's questioning
LOOK)
I bring strangers who would sojourn
with us this night.
Cain turns to Zed and Oh and furtively mimes an elaborate lip-
sewing gesture, ancient precursor to the modern lip-zipper.
ADAM
Greetings, strangers. I am called
Adam and you are welcome to share
the fruits of our toil.
ZED
Thanks, but I'm kind of staying
away from fruit for the time being.
Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them
into his crude dwelling.

In the yard behind the house, Oh is helping Cain as he chops
firewood with a metal axe. Oh now wears a tunic like the
farmers.
CAIN
It's been the same damn thing my
whole life.
(swings the axe-- thwack!)
"Why can't you be more like Abel?"
(thwack!)
"Oh, your sacrifice was good, too,
but Abel's was-- wow!"
(thwack!)
OH
(trying to change the
SUBJECT)
Your brother Seth is an interesting
guy. Did you know he can put his
penis in his mouth?
Adam and Zed come out of his dwelling.
KINSMEN from other dwellings start gathering.
ADAM

CAIN
Yeah, hey-- where's everybody
going?
ADAM
To look for Abel.
CAIN
(MUTTERS)
Good luck.
ADAM
What did you say?
Official White

CAIN
(louder, mock sincerity)
I said good luck. I'm really
worried about him.
He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's
benefit.
ADAM
You're not coming?
CAIN
Yeah, I am. I just have to finish
toiling over here, then I'm right
behind you.
Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone,
Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart.
CAIN
(cont'd)
(to Zed and Oh)
Now listen, I'm getting out of
here, and you better come with me.
I have a feeling they're going to
try and blame this whole "Abel-
killing-thing" on you.
ZED
Why would they blame us?
CAIN
Because when they find him and his
head is all bashed in, they're
going to start pointing fingers,
and you guys are drifters, so
they'll put two and two together
and that makes--
He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh.
CAIN

Four! It makes four! Now stop
asking so many questions and hop

He urgently whips the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart
lumbers forward.

Cain's cart lumbers along. He looks back over his shoulder.
CAIN
(urgently, to Zed and Oh)
They're gaining on us!
Zed and Oh look back.
THEIR POV
The other oxcarts are a hundred yards back, "chasing" them at
maybe two miles per hour.
Cain whips his oxen and they step up the pace to 3 MPH.
CAIN
(GLEEFUL)
Hah! They'll never catch us now!
An aerial view shows Cain's cart slowly pulling away from his
pursuers.
Suddenly a bolt of lightning splits the bright blue sky and
strikes Cain right on the forehead, knocking him back into
the cart. He sits up stunned, with a still-smoking, jagged
burn mark on his forehead.
Official White

CAIN
(cont'd)
(dazed but exhilarated)
Wow! What are the odds of that?!
(feeling the burn mark)
Am I lucky or what?
Zed and Oh exchange doubtful looks and glance nervously at
the sky.
CUT TO:

The ox cart approaches a small trading settlement on the
seacoast, a kind of makeshift tent city around a central
marketplace. Several dhows are tied up at the shore, camels
and pack animals are tethered on the fringes, while TRADERS
and MERCHANTS inspect newly arrived goods and haggle over
prices.
25

Zed, Oh and Cain wander through the crowded market. PEOPLE
OF EVERY RACE dressed in all manner of exotic garb buy, sell,
and barter goods from distant lands. Zed and oh gawk like a
couple of yokels.
ZED
Look at all these people! And this
stuff!
Oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the
bread.
OH
(to the Merchant)
Can I have one of those?
He reaches for a loaf but the MERCHANT strikes his hand with
a cane.
OH
(cont'd)
Ow!
MERCHANT
Two silver pieces.
CAIN
(HUNGRY)
We're gonna need some money.
Official White
41.
ZED
Yeah, we're gonna need money.
(an afterthought)
What's money?
They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around
a raised platform.
SLAVES IN SHACKLES are lined up on the raised wooden platform
while CUSTOMERS examine those waiting to be auctioned.
The AUCTIONEER brings up a fnuscular male slave in a
loincloth.
ZED
(cont'd)
It's Marlak!
Marlak's hands are bound and he's restrained by a chain
attached to a thick leather collar around his neck.
AUCTIONEER
(addresses the crowd)
Next up, an unusual item-- looks
like a Caucasian-- he's big, he's
strong, he's a good breeder, so I'm
going to start at
100
gold minas.
Do I hear
100?
As the bidding starts, Zed spots Maya, his sister Eema, and
Enmebaragesi among the chained-up slaves waiting to be sold.
Zed and Oh push their way through the crowd and go to them.
ZED
(amazed to see them)
Eema! Maya!
The women embrace him with relief and excitement.
OH
(SHEEPISH)
Hi, Eema.
EEMA
Oh.
ZED
What happened? How did you get
here?
Official white
42.
MAYA
Well, after the fire--
(she shoots him an
accusing look))
--the hill tribes raided the
village. The men fought them but
they were too many. They took us
captive, marched us to the sea,
then traded us to the boat people
who brought us here.
OH
(to Eema)
Are you all right? Did they-- rape
you?
EEMA
(SHRUGS)
Just a little.
Zed and Oh look at her curiously.
The SLAVE TRADER sees them talking to Eema and approaches.
SLAVE TRADER
You interested in some slaves?
ZED
(like a prospective buyer)
Yeah, this one looks pretty good--
He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's
buying fruit. Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's
breasts. She punches him.
Zed
(cont'd)
Ooh, feisty! So how does this work
if we want them?
The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes.
SLAVE TRADER
You have money?
ZED
(CAGEY)
Well, that depends on what you mean
by money?
SLAVE TRADER
Look, pal, money talks and bullshit
walks. I don't have time for looky-
loos.

Cain steps up and intercedes.
CAIN
(GRANDLY)
Perhaps I can help.

OH)
Let me talk to the guy. Maybe I
can make a deal with him. You guys
wait here.
Cain puts his arm around the slave trader's shoulder and
walks him away.
CAIN
(cont'd)
(to the slave trader)
So what are we lookin' at here?
From a distance, Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can't
hear what they're saying.
OH
(to Eema)
What an amazing coincidence--
running into you and Maya and them.
ZED
You still think it's all just a
coincidence?
All of us here right
now, at this particular place, at
this particular time?
OH
(THINKS)
I don't know. Why do you think?
ZED
I'm not sure yet, but I'm starting
to believe that everything happens
for a reason. Like, why did I eat
the forbidden fruit?
OH
To get laid?
MAYA
Hey!
ZED
Official White
44.
Okay, that might have been what I
was thinking at the time, but what
if some omnipotent force put the
fruit there because I was supposed
to eat it?
OH
which omnipotent force?
ZED
What do you mean "which" omnipotent
force? How many omnipotent forces
could there be?
OH
I don't know! What's "omnipotent"
mean?
ZED
Work with me-- I'm just speculating
here. Let's call this force "God";
and let's say this "God" is
controlling everything. Maybe God
wanted me to have the knowledge of
good and evil.
OH
Why would he want that?
MAYA
How do you know God's a "He?"
Zed rolls his eyes.
ZED
Don't you get what I'm saying?
What if we've been chosen?
MAYA
You think we've been chosen by God?
ZED
Well, no offense, but it's possible
that I was chosen and you all just
happened to be there.
OH
Why would God choose you? Why
wouldn't he choose Marlak? He's
stronger.

ZED
A chosen doesn't need to be strong.
I'm big this way.

OH
You do have a fat face.
ZED
Not my face, my brain. It's
enormous. I'm the smartest guy in
the village.
OH

You're not even-- I'm smarter than
you!
ZED
What?!
(to ANOTHER VILLAGER)
Which one of us is smarter?
VILLAGER
You're both idiots!
ZED
Oh yeah, then why are we free and
you're chained up?
VILLAGER
Because of you?
CAIN
(calls them over)
Hey! Come here. I think we worked
something out.
ZED
(confidently, to Maya)
Sit tight. I'm going to get you
out of here. Do you trust me?

Fair enough.
She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to

They see Cain riding off on a donkey. He holds up a bag of
coins and waves goodbye.
ZED
I never trusted that guy.
OH
(SARCASTIC

Why? Just 'cause he murdered his
brother and got hit by lightning?
They are pushed to the front of the platform.
SLAVE TRADER
(to the crowd)
All right! Next up is a twofer--
I'm selling them as a pair-- I know
they don't look like much-- but I'm
starting the bidding at sixty gold
minas. Do I hear sixty?
(NOTHING)
Remember, it's two for one here.
Do I hear fifty? Anyone? That's
only twenty-five apiece, folks.

Zed looks out at the crowd, starting to get offended.
SLAVE TRADER (cont'd)
You're breaking my heart here. How
about forty? Do I hear forty?

Finally, a Bedouin SHEIK raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk

A small CARAVAN OF CAMELS AND DONKEYS loaded with trade goods
moves across the arid wasteland. The effete SHEIKH rides the
lead camel, protected from the blistering sun by a colorful
canopy. A FEW ARMED BEDOUIN GUARDS ride alongside.
Bringing up the rear is A LARGE FOUR-WHEELED CART DRAWN BY
HORSES, basically a cage on wheels into which TWENTY NEWLY
PURCHASED SLAVES have been crammed, jammed together like
sardines.
Zed and Oh are in the middle of the body pile, literally
cheek by jowl with the other slaves, barely able to move.
I
Eema is right next to Oh, her body pressed tight against his.
Oh shifts around, repositioning his arms and body trying to
get more comfortable and give Eema a little space, but he
just ends up touching her even more.
OH
(EMBARRASSED)
Excuse me-- I'm sorry--
(his hand gets stuck
between her breasts)
That's not good--
He jerks his hand away, elbowing Marlak in the face.
Official White

Marlak growls and grabs Oh by the throat, but the struggle
forces everyone else to shift which causes even more
discomfort.
THE OTHER SLAVES
Ow! Hey! Cut that out!
Zed tries to turn his head to see who's behind him.
ZED
(CONT'D)
(GROUCHY)
Hey, pal! You can take your foot
out of my ass anytime now.
(BEAT)
And your foot is still there. If I
turn around, you will be sorry.
Zed twists violently and manages a full turn which brings him
face to face and crotch to crotch with Maya.
ZED
(cont'd)
That's better.
MAYA
For you maybe.
ZED
Look, I want you to know I blame
myself for everything that
happened.
MAYA
So does everybody else.
MARLAK
(over his shoulder)
Get away from my woman!
ZED
(IRRITATED)
I don't think that's going to be
possible. And I told you before,
she's not "your woman."
MARLAK
I'll kill you!
Marlak starts muscling and squirming his way through the body
pile trying to get to Zed.
THE OTHER SLAVES
Hey! Watch it, jerk!

It's too cramped to even throw a punch, so Marlak uses a
RANDOM SLAVE'S HEAD as a weapon to bang against zed's head
repeatedly.
RANDOM SLAVE

Suddenly Zed feels Marlak's hands around his neck, grabbing
him from behind. Zed struggles but Marlak manages to pull
him into a full headlock, forcing Zed's face into his hairy
armpit.
ZED
(MUFFLED)
Ecchhh!
Oh is vaguely aware of the fight going on but can't move.
OH

Hold on! I'm coming!
Oh tries to maneuver to Zed, but can't move an inch.

If everyone could just move to the
right. Please? Thank you in
advance for your cooperation.

You can do it, Zed! Use his weight

Marlak now has Zed locked in a lethal choke hold.

A BEDOUIN GUARD notices the commotion and bangs the bars of
the cage with his staff.
BEDOUIN
(shouts at the slaves)
Knock it off! Don't make me come
in there!

The Bedouin is just about to respond when suddenly A METAL
TIPPED ARROW FLIES IN AND PIERCES HIS THROAT. He drops to

A BATTLE CHARIOT
comes flying over the crest of the wadi followed by TWENTY
ARMORED FOOT SOLDIERS wearing bronze helmets and
breastplates.
The soldiers attack the caravan, slashing and slicing the
Bedouin guards.
Their commander, SARGON, his helmet topped with a magnificent
plume, rides up in the chariot and with one mighty stroke of
his sword cuts the head off ANOTHER BEDOUIN GUARD.
Marlak reaches through the bars, grabs the fallen Bedouin's
sword and hacks off the lock on the door of the slave wagon.
The door flies open and the slaves tumble, jump and stumble
out onto the ground.
Zed and Oh look around, gawking at the massacre taking place.
Then Zed sees Marlak, sword in hand, looking for him.
SARGON

Take the slaves!
Marlak starts for Zed but two soldiers ride up and throw a
heavy restraining net over him.
Zed grabs oh and takes off running over the nearest sand
dune.

"Gee, what a great hat."

It wasn't my very first thought,

He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees
nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction.

Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes

Okay, it's possible I dreamed that--

Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry

Excuse me?
I'm not clear--
ISAAC
Here we go again--
ABRAHAM
we will grasp the foreskins of our
penises and cut therefrom the extra
flesh.
ZED
(AGHAST)
I'm not sure I have any extra.
OH
Couldn't we could just get our ears
pierced?
ISAAC
(aside to Zed)
Okay, what did I tell you-- nuts?
ZED
You know, Abe, it's late, and we've
all had a lot to drink, and I know
this whole foreskin thing sounds
like a good idea now, but you may
just want to sleep on it. we could
always cut 'em off in the morning,
but if we do it now, there's just
no putting it back on later.
ABRAHAM
No. So it shall be written, so it
shall be done.
(to Isaac)
Get my big knife.
Zed and Oh both reflexively cover their crotches.

Zed and oh stumble over the rocky hills. They hear a PAINED
SCREAM from someone being circumcised back at Abraham's camp.
OH
You have any idea where we're
going?
ZED
To the city. I have to find Maya.
OH
The city! He said God's going to
smite them with holy fire!
ZED
And you're going to listen to him?
You think he's more chosen than me?
OH
He seemed to know what he was
talking about.
ZED
Yes, and he also wanted to give his
dick a little trim.
VOICE
(O.C.)
Hey, wait up!
Zed and Oh turn to see Isaac running towards them.
ISAAC
(out of breath)
I'm coming with you.
ZED
You don't even know where we're
going.
ISAAC
You're going to Sodom, right?
ZED
No. Your dad specifically said
Sodom and Gomorrah were evil.
ISAAC
Yeah, whatever. If I show you how
to get there, will you buy me a
bottle of wine?
Official White
62.
ZED
No! I told you, that's not where
we're going.
ISAAC
Fine. Then we'll just stand here.
ZED
Fine.
They stand there for less than a beat.
ZED
(cont'd)
Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom.
Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points
off in the distance.
THEIR POV
Shining in the moonlight, the magnificent city of Sodom set
atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls.
ZED
I knew it was right around here.
ISAAC
Me and my friends sneak in on the
weekends. We hang around, pick up
on the babes, drink some wine, get
wasted on killer hash--
ZED
You shouldn't be smoking either.
ISAAC
Thanks, Grandpa, but I've been
smoking for four harvests, so I
think I'm okay.
They start down toward the city.

Zed, Oh and Isaac gape at the high masonry walls as they

OH
Gee, they're not open. We should
probably come back later.
ISAAC
You just have to knock. They
always let me in.
(to Oh)
Go ahead.
OH
Me? Why do I have to knock? What
if we're waking somebody up? Let's
just get out of here.
ZED
Where? Back to the penis-cutter?
Besides, Eema and Maya might be in
there. You want to get them out
before the city's destroyed, don't
you?
Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the
door.
ISAAC
(SHOUTING)
Hey! Anybody there? Hello?
Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and
slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries. Isaac quickly
runs away.
SENTRY
(shouts at him)
Halt!
Isaac stops a safe distance away and turns back to taunt the
guards.
ISAAC
You gonna make me?
(dancing and dodging like
a boxer)
You and what army?
ZED
(shouts to Isaac)
Get help! Tell your father!
ISAAC
(shouts back)
Yeah!

kill him.
The sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner
of the city gates.

Cain leads them through the narrow crowded streets. People

CAIN
You know, you guys are lucky that
sergeant is a friend of mine. I
let him sodomize me once right
after I got here and he's been real
nice to me ever since.
OH
(SARCASTIC)
Yeah, thanks for saving us. What
are you going to do to us now?
Cain stops and looks at them.
CAIN
wait a second. Do I detect a tone
here?
ZED
All right, honestly? You did sell
us into slavery.
CAIN
(instantly offended)
Whoa whoa whoa! Hold a grudge
much? That was like a fortnight
ago.
ZED
That was way less than a fortnight.
Half a fortnight, maybe.
CAIN
Give me a break! I was dealing
with the death of a close family
member and I needed some space.
But now I realize that you guys are
like my brothers. And it's so rare
to find a brother that you love.
Right?
He embraces them.
ZED AND OH
(UNEASILY)
Right.
CAIN
(EXUBERANT)
Now, you guys hungry? Watch this.
Cain walks up to a food vendor's stall and stares menacingly
at the VENDOR. He raises his fist. The vendor cowers.
Official White

CAIN

That's two for flinching.
Cain grabs two lamb kebabs and hands them to Zed and Oh.
CAIN

That's the kind of love I'm talkin'
about.
As they eat hungrily, Zed makes eye contact with a prostitute
lounging in a doorway.
ZED
Check out that woman across the
street! She's looking at us.
The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a
banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth.
OH
We are so in! She's eye-knowing us
like crazy.
CAIN
You're gonna love Sodom. Trust me.
It's crazy. This morning, I almost
got a handie behind that pita
stand.
OH
Well, I kind of have a girlfriend--
not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl I
like, so I shouldn't--
CAIN
Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays
in Sodom.
He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT.
The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut.
CAIN
(cont'd)
You know, if you guys are staying
you should join the guards. The
pay's not great, but there's tons
of perks. I'm telling you, it's
the only way to go.
Cain grabs a piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it
in his mouth. The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the
ass and she runs away.

A military drum roll and the blare of trumpets rouse the
garrison. GUARDSMEN come double-timing out of the barracks
and hurry to line up in formation.
Last to emerge are Zed and Oh who step leisurely out the door
now dressed as Royal Guards. Zed actually looks dashing, but
Oh's breastplate is too big and his helmet keeps slipping
down over his eyes.
ZED
This is great! How do I look?
OH
You look good, but I think my hat's
too big.
They notice an OFFICER staring at them.
OH
(cont'd)
(to the officer)
Do you happen to know where I could
get a smaller hat?
The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon.
OFFICER

Line up!
Zed and Oh hustle into line, orders are shouted and the troop
marches off.

Zed and Oh are on patrol with Cain in the heart of the city.
Official White

ZED
So is this it? We just walk
around?
CAIN
Pretty much. We just look for
troublemakers and kick the living
shit out of 'em.
ZED
What kind of trouble?
CAIN
If we see a thief or a pickpocket,
we just slap him around-- maybe cut
off a finger or an ear, or the tip
of his nose, lower lip-- anything
you can just grab and slice in one
fluid motion-- then we take our
share of the loot and let him go.
Mostly what we worry about are
activist types, rabble rousers,
getting people all riled up against
the King or the Temple Priests.
That's death for sure.
ZED
Pretty harsh, isn't it?
CAIN
Harsh times, brother. We're in the
middle of a famine. People are
starving. If we don't get some
rain soon, it could get ugly.
(looking forward to it)
Then we'll get to start kicking ass
big time.
He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out.
CAIN
(cont'd)
Beat it, you filthy beggar!
OH
You can't blame people for being
hungry.
CAIN
Yeah, well, just remember, it's the
palace that pays you, not the
people.
Official White
71.
Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets
and turn to look.
At the sound of the trumpets EVERYONE IN THE CROWDED SQUARE
falls to the ground and prostrates himself. Cain pulls Oh to
the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the
ROYAL ENTOURAGE approaches.
Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed
just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only
one standing.
EIGHT STRONG MALE SLAVES enter the square carrying an
ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy. On it
is the PRINCESS INANNA, a stunning young woman, richly
dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red
lips. A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big
ostrich plume fan.
Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty.
Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice
he's the only person in the square still standing. She gives
him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously.
As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at
Zed. He doesn't recognize her, but we do. It's Maya, now
elaborately costumed and made-up.
Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a ROYAL GUARD knocks
him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the
entourage passes.
ZED
(on the ground, excitedly
to Oh)
Did you see that girl? I think she
liked me! She looked right at me.
OH
Gee, I wonder why?
The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all
get back to their feet.
ZED
Who was she?
CAIN
The Princess Inanna. She's totally
hot, but don't even think about it.
Official White
72.
ZED
Why not?
CAIN
Because she's royalty and you're
scum?
The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the
royal entourage.
OH
Where's everybody going?
CAIN
To the temple. Let's go.
(starts walking)
You have to see this.
ZED
(FOLLOWING)
Will she be there?
CAIN
Everybody will be there.

At the center of the square is a magnificent temple adorned
with elaborate carvings and monumental statues of pagan gods.
Before it is a great altar in front of a HUGE STONE IDOL.
The idol's mouth is a gaping fiery furnace. Behind the
temple, is a towering ZIGGURAT still under construction.
A HUNDRED TRUMPETERS AND DRUMMERS blast a solemn fanfare as
ORNATELY GARBED PRIESTS ceremoniously climb the stairs to the
altar.
ZED AND OH
stare at the spectacle.

THE ROYAL PAVILION

The Princess Inanna takes her seat near the KING, the QUEEN,
the MINISTERS and other NOBLES. Maya stands behind the
Princess and continues fanning her.
Zed spots the Princess on the pavilion.

He starts edging toward the royal pavilion.

THE PAVILION
Under a broad awning, the King and Queen snack from a table
covered with platters of exotic fruits and sweetmeats.
The King, an imposing man with Shakespearean gravity, wipes
his mouth and glances at the Princess Inanna.
KING
The Princess isn't eating?
INANNA
I find it hard to eat when so many
are hungry.
KING
(as if )
Your concern is enviable.
INANNA
(POUTY)
And besides, I'm so fat.
The Queen,
40's, still beautiful, reacts.
QUEEN
(for the hundredth time)
You're not fat--
INANNA
Yes, I am, mother! Those new linen
pants you got me from Egypt make my
ass look just huge.
QUEEN
Well, you can't keep starving
yourself.
INANNA
Why not? Everybody else is
starving-- present company
excluded.
Official White

KING
Careful, Princess. You may be my
step-daughter, but these are
dangerous times and those are
dangerous words. I weep for the
suffering of my people, but the
spirit of rebellion is alive in the
city and if necessary I will crush
it with every means at my disposal.
INANNA
(SARCASTIC)
For the good of the people.
KING
(warning her)
For the good of everyone who enjoys
the favor of the throne.
INANNA
Whatever. I'm just so incredibly
bored.
46
THE TEMPLE DOORS

The fanfare climaxes as the great temple doors slowly open
and the HIGH PRIEST emerges followed by a retinue of
PRIESTESSES and a dozen VESTAL VIRGINS. They walk in solemn
silence to ritual positions around the altar.
The High Priest is even more elaborately costumed than the
nobles, ridiculously so, standing very tall on high platform
shoes, with heavy eye makeup, his hair and beard even oilier
than the others. He turns to the altar, raises his hands to
the heavens and begins his invocation.
HIGH PRIEST
(intoning pompously)
O El, lord of Heaven and Earth;
Baal, the Sublime; Shapash, goddess
of the sun; Hadad, the storm god,
over-ruling son of Dagon, the
bountiful, god of grain, our
earthly sustenance--
ZED
He makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion
and stares up at the Princess Inanna.
She sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice.
Official white

INANNA
Isn't that the idiot who was
standing up in the street?
Maya sees him, too, and starts fuming.
The High Priest continues.
HIGH PRIEST
We come before you in humble
supplication, invoking your
blessing, the sweet rain which
waters our fields, enriches the
harvest, fills our storehouses,
makes mighty the house of Ish-ka-bi-
baal and the city of Sodom--
The King nods graciously.
HIGH PRIEST
(cont'd)
--and feeds us, your children, with
the bounty of your grace.
PRINCESS INANNA
She glances at Zed again, but this time a slight smile
crosses her lips.
Zed grins back at her.
The Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and
subtly points Zed out to her. Maya nods obediently, glaring
at Zed, and starts fanning the princess a little too
vigorously.
THE ALTAR
HIGH PRIEST
Accept now this humble sacrifice to
the power and glory of your
magnificence.
He starts inspecting the Vestal Virgins, beautiful young
women in diaphanous, almost transparent white gowns.
ZED AND OH
have no idea what's going on. Zed turns to the GUY NEXT TO
HIM.
Official White

ZED
What's happening?
GUY
He's picking a virgin.
CAIN
(LASCIVIOUS)
Oh yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh.
AT THE ALTAR
the High Priest is moving down the line of beautiful young
maidens. He comes to one SLUTTY GIRL who seems so obviously
not a virgin, he does a double take and kicks her out of the
line.
ZED AND OH
watching curiously.
ZED
What do they want a virgin for?
GUY
To throw into the fire.
ZED
(SHOCKED)
Why?
GUY
(like talking to an idiot)
Offering to the Gods. There's a
famine going on. If we don't make
a good sacrifice, it won't rain.
No rain, no harvest. No harvest,
no food. Get it?
CAIN
It's pretty self-explanatory.
OH
You throw the virgin in the fire so
it'll rain?
GUY
Duh.
ZED
Seems like a waste of a perfectly
good virgin to me.
Official white
77.
OH
(CONCERNED)
These virgins-- it's always a girl,
right?
AT THE ALTAR
A great cheer goes up as a girl is chosen. She swoons as the
priestesses slip off her vestment and two priests escort her
to the fiery mouth of the furnace.
HIGH PRIEST
For the love of the Gods and the
glory of their Creation, the great
dome of Heaven, the green growing
Earth, we commit this maiden to
your Holy Fire.
Another great cheer from the crowd as they throw her into the
fire.
ZED
(APPALLED)
This is just crazy.
Maya approaches them but Zed and Oh still don't recognize
her.
MAYA
(eyes downcast)
The Princess wishes to see you.
CAIN
(staring at her cleavage)
Her wish is my command.
MAYA
Not you. Him.

ZED
Me? Cool.
(then, motioning to Oh)
We're kind of a package deal. Can
he come with?
CAIN
The three of us are inseparable.
We're like brothers.
Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an
artificial smile.

Maya ignores Cain and points to Zed and Oh.

Zed steps out onto the moonlit terrace. He crosses to the
balustrade and stands beside the Princess, gazing out over
the twinkling cityscape.

ZED
I didn't know it was so close.
INANNA
They're called the "twin cities."
ZED
Looks pretty from up here, but some
people think God is going to wipe
them out because they're so evil.
INANNA
(toying with him)
And what do you think? Am I evil?
ZED
I don't really know you. But you
don't look evil.
PRINCESS
Do you find me attractive?
ZED
Well, yeah. I think you're--
incredible.
INANNA
(moving closer)
I have body issues.
ZED
No, you're perfect. Your face,
your hair--

Your eyes are like the sea.
INANNA

My eyes are brown.
ZED
Well, it's kinda dark. I took a
shot. I know they're big, though--

She pulls him close.
ZED
(cont'd)
Can I ask you one thing? What
would a girl like you want with a
guy like me?
Official white

INANNA
I don't know. I just find you--
interesting. They say it's the
will of the gods that some men
should suffer while others rule--
that we're all just victims of our
fate. And I believed that until
this morning when I saw you
standing up, alone, in the square.
And I said to myself, finally
here's one man who refuses to bow
down to anything--
ZED
UH--
(considers explaining but
just lets it go)
Yeah. That's me.
INANNA
Yes, finally a man who has the
courage to question the order of
things--- a man chosen by the Gods
to do something great.
ZED
(EXHILARATED)
That's exactly what I've been
thinking! You wouldn't believe the
things that have been happening to
me lately. I just didn't know why.
INANNA
(gets very, very close)
I know why. To bring you here-- to
this place-- to me.
ZED
(SMITTEN)
I couldn't agree more. I'm trying
to agree more, but I can't. That's

A curious, jeering MOB is gathering as Zed and Oh, in
shackles, are led by a SQUAD OF GUARDS to a raised platform
in the middle of the square.
The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd. Cain
presides over the execution. He addresses the crowd.
CAIN
For the crimes of blasphemy--
(the crowd grumbles its
DISAPPROVAL)
HERESY--
(grumble, grumble)
CONSPIRACY--
(serious grumbling)
SODOMY--
(admiring oohs and aahs)
And the murder of my brother Abel--
ZED
Oh, come on!
CAIN
Shut up! For these and other
crimes they may not actually have
done yet but we're pretty sure they
were thinking about, the prisoners
will be stoned to death.
The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull
canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to
grab stones to throw.
Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other.
PALACE BALCONY
The King, Queen, High Priest and Royal Ministers observe the
stoning from their vantage point above the square. Princess
Inanna refuses to look.

Observe, my dear. It seems the
least you could do, since it was
you who lured him to his death.
She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed.
INANNA
I didn't intend for this to happen.
THE SQUARE
The people move in and surround the platform on all sides,
baseball-size rocks in their hands.
CAIN

Anything to say before the sentence
is carried out?
ZED
(to the crowd)
I just want to say this is really
messed up--
CAIN
OKAY--
(SHOUTS)
STONE THEM!
The people fling their rocks with all their might.
Zed and Oh duck.
The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on
the opposite sides, several bystanders taking painful hits in
the head, some falling down unconscious.
Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks
from all directions.
CAIN
(cont'd)
Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it! This
isn't working.
ZED
Can I make a suggestion?
CAIN
(IRKED)
What?
Official White

ZED
Why don't you just pick one person
to throw?
The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement.
ZED
(cont'd)
(pressing the advantage)
In fact, don't you think it would
be fair for us to get to pick the
person who stones us?
Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently
fair.
CROWD
(some eagerly raising
their hands and waving
like school children)
Yes! Ooh, me! Pick me! Me!
ON THE BALCONY
The King grabs Sargon.
KING

What is that idiot doing?
IN THE SQUARE
Zed spots a good candidate in the crowd.
ZED
We pick him!
Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily muscled, eagerly waving his
hand.
CAIN
Him?
ZED
No, next to him!
He points at a BOY, about nine years old and not very big.
CAIN
He's just a kid!

So? You got something against
kids?
Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval.
ZED

This guy hates kids!
CROWD
Yeah! What's he got against kids?
Children are the future! Give the
kid a shot! The kid! The kid!
On the balcony, the King shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by
the power of the mob. He nods to Sargon who signals to Cain.
CAIN
All right! All right! We'll try
it. Kid! Grab a rock.
The boy picks up a good-size rock.
Zed turns to Oh.
ZED
Good thinking, huh?
They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws.
The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that
smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers.
ZED
(cont'd)
Holy shit! That kid's got an arm!
OH
(DAZED)
I think he hit me.
The boy fires again.
Oh spins and tries to duck but takes the rock right on the
head.
OH

Hey! There's two of us!
The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back.
CAIN
Okay, everybody on this side now!
On the count of three! One-- two--

Wait! I have a question for the
King!
The crowd goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the
palace balcony.
ZED

(shouts to the King)
Why didn't I die in the Holy of
Holies?
On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question.
One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be
stumped.
In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed seizes the
initiative.
ZED
(cont'd)
I entered the Holy of Holies and,
lo, I did not die! Why? Because I
am chosen by the Gods!
PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
He is chosen! He is the Chosen
One. The Chosen One!
Zed gives Oh a look: "See? I told you."

(starts chanting)
Spare the Chosen One! Spare the
Chosen One! Spare the Chosen One!
OH
And his friend! Don't forget his

On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer
with the High Priest.
KING
Could it be? Is he truly chosen?
HIGH PRIEST
I don't-- I suppose it's possible-
I'd have to examine some new
INTESTINES--
KING
Imbecile!
Official White

PRIME MINISTER
Majesty, with respect, whether he's
chosen or not is no longer the
issue. To kill him now, given the
public mood, could inflame the
situation enough to prompt a
radical "regime change," if you
take my meaning.
The King looks grimly at his ministers, all of whom have lean

Princess Inanna smiles contemptuously at him.

(cont'd)
Don't tell me you're still mad
about Maya. That's so over. I
have a thing going with the
princess now-- well, almost had a
thing. I'm a slave now-- just like
you.
MARLAK
No. You're not just like me.
ZED
Okay. We do have our differences--
like about a cup and half of brain
tissue-- but that doesn't mean we
can't work together.
Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick.
GUARD #2
Take those bricks to the top. The
masons are waiting.
Official white
108.
Marlak and Enmebaragesi glower at the guard as they pick up
ropes and harness themselves to a cart loaded with bricks.
GUARD #2
(cont'd)
(to Zed)
You! Help them!
He grabs another rope harness off the cart and throws it to
Zed.
ZED
You know, I'd like to, but I did
something to my neck--
(massages his neck)
I must've slept on it funny-- those
dungeon pillows are like rocks--
well, they are rocks-- so I should
probably take it easy or I'll be no
damn good for work tomorrow.
GUARD #2
(strikes him across the
back with his stick)
I said move!
ZED
Okay! But I should tell you, this
isn't really my area. I'm just on
a break from the mud department--
The Guard draws his short sword and raises it over Zed.
GUARD #2
One more word and you die--
ZED
(putting on the harness)
Okay, okay. I'm going.
(to Marlak and
ENMEBARAGESI)
Okay, boys, on the count of three.
One-- two-- three!
Marlak and Enmebaragesi lunge against the ropes, but Zed
makes no effort to pull. They glare at him.
ZED
(cont'd)
Learned that from Maya. Good
trick, huh? Okay, together this
time. Go!
Official White
109.
They pull together and the heavy cart starts to move.
CUT TO:
65
65
Zed, Marlak and Enmebaragesi haul the heavy cart of bricks to
the very top of the tower.
TWO BRICKLAYERS are working on the wall. Zed leans against
the wall next to them tb rest.
ZED
How high you guys think we're going
with this?
BRICKLAYER ONE
Up to Heaven, I guess. That's how
tall they usually build 'em.
ZED
(looking up)
That's ambitious.
BRICKLAYER TWO
We worked on the Tower of Babel.
Now that was a ziggurat.
BRICKLAYER ONE
Incredible erection.
Zed looks down at his crotch.
ZED
(MODESTLY)
That's nothing. You should see it
when I'm excited.
BRICKLAYER ONE
The tower.
ZED
Oh, right, the tower. Incredible
erection.
(snickers to himself)
BRICKLAYER ONE
See, the Egyptians are working on
an entirely different concept.
Four sides, slanting walls, pointy
top.
Official White
110.
BRICKLAYER TWO
Like a pyramid?
BRICKLAYER ONE
Exactly.
BRICKLAYER TWO
Wow. Far out. Yet timeless in a
way.
A SLAVE CHILD approaches with a water bucket.
SLAVE CHILD
(to Zed)
Want some water?
As the child offers him the ladle, Zed recognizes her.
ZED
You're from the village, aren't
you?
The child nods.
ZED
(cont'd)
I bet you wish you were back there
right now, don't you.
The child nods again.
ZED
(cont'd)
Well, don't give up. You're going
to get home someday.
Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over.
MARLAK
(standing over him)
Who's going to take her there? The
Chosen One?
Marlak kicks gravel and dirt in Zed's face. Zed just lies
there and takes it, feeling like he's failed everyone.
Then he hears the beating of drums and trumpet fanfares
coming from the temple square below.
CUT TO:
66
- SAME TIME
66
Oh and the other slaves are mustered by the guards.
Official White
111.
GUARD
Get in line! Now! Move!
OH
Where're we going?
GUARD
To watch the sacrifice. The King
demands it.
OH
Is that compulsory? Because I saw
one when I first got here and it
made me a little sick--
The guard's whip catches him across the back.
OH
(cont'd)
Ow! Why don't you try using your
words for a change?
CUT TO:
67
67
The square is filling up with people. The ROYAL PROCESSION
is moving to the seats of honor to watch the sacrifice.
Cain is now among the Royal Guard having been promoted for
his treachery. He bows and helps the Queen to her seat.
CAIN
(leering seductively)
At your service, my lady. Anytime,
anywhere.
QUEEN
(FLIRTATIOUS)
There's a depraved thought. You're
so delightfully low. Absolute
filth.
CAIN
(SUAVELY)
Thank you, your majesty.
He touches his tongue to the tip of his nose and waggles his
eyebrows.
The King arrives with Sargon to loud booing from the crowd.
Official White
112.
KING
Are they booing me? How dare they!
CAIN
Your Highness, with all due
respect, those were "Woos." They
love you. They were "wooing" you.
The King looks doubtfully at the hostile crowd.
SARGON
All is in readiness, Majesty.
INANNA
(glares at the King)
What now? More virgins to
sacrifice?
KING
Yes, two, followers of the Chosen
One, discovered by this loyal
soldier.
Cain bows to the King.
CAIN
Just doing my duty.
KING
And one more to demonstrate our own
faith and charity.
The King stands and makes a proclamation loud enough for
everyone to hear.
KING
(cont'd)
In supplication to the Gods, for
the love of the People, we offer a
humble sacrifice to the sacred
temple fire-- our own step-
daughter, the Princess Inanna!
The crowd gasps.
KING
(cont'd)
(to Inanna)
For the good of the people.
QUEEN
(stands in protest)
You wouldn't dare!
Official white
113.
KING
Wouldn't I? If you like, I could
arrange for you to join her.
The Queen slowly sits back down.
KING
(cont'd)
(to Inanna)
How long did you think I'd tolerate
your insolence?
(to Sargon)
Burn her.-
Sargon and Cain seize Inanna, but she shrugs them off and
rises with dignity.
INANNA
I'll see you all in Hell.
CUT TO:
68
THE GREAT STONE IDOL
68
The flames are starting to build inside the idol's mouth.
69
69
Oh and the slaves are confined behind a barrier, watched by a
squad of guards, waiting for the ceremony to start.
THE TEMPLE DOORS open slowly, and the High Priest appears
holding a long jewelled staff.
Oh turns to the EDOMITE SLAVE next to him.
OH
(casually name-dropping)
See the High Priest? I know him.
Dear friend of mine.
THE TEMPLE
Now the procession of SACRIFICIAL VIRGINS is led out by the
HIGH PRIESTESS. Maya and Eema are among them, their hands
tied. They look like they've been drugged.
Oh spots Eema and Maya among the virgins.
Official White
114.
OH
(PANICKED)
That's Eema! And Maya! I know
them!
EDOMITE SLAVE
(SARCASTIC)
I guess you know everybody, don't
you.
Oh shoulders his way right up to the barrier where a BIG
GUARD stops him with a spear to his neck.
BIG GUARD
That's far enough, slave.
Oh stops right there, frustrated and frightened.
THE TEMPLE
Inanna is led out last, now also having been drugged.
70
TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT
70
Zed, Marlak and the sharp-eyed Enmebaragesi look down, trying
to see what's going on.
ENMEBARAGESI
They're bringing out the women.
ZED
(AMAZED)
How are you seeing that far?
ENMEBARAGESI
I see your sister, Eema--
TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT
ZED
(SQUINTING)
It's Maya!
CUT TO:
71
THE TEMPLE
71
The drums and trumpets kick up the tempo and the High Priest
starts leading the virgins to the idol's fiery mouth.
Oh pushes against the barrier, restrained by the guard.
Official White
115.
OH
We have to do something! Somebody
has to stop it.
(turning to the other
SLAVES)
We can't let them do this!
The slaves start to mutter. The guards draw their swords and
heft their spears, now on high alert.
CUT TO:
72
TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT
72
Zed looks around desperately, trying to figure out what to
do.
ZED
(to Marlak)
I have to get down there.
GUARD #2
(SNORTS)
Over my dead body.
MARLAK
All right.
Without a moment's hesitation, Marlak grabs him and tosses
him off the top of the ziggurat. He screams all the way
down.
ZED
Wow. Who saw that coming?
Thanks, Marlak.
MARLAK
Now what?
Zed looks around quickly, grabs the end of a long coiled rope
attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak the other end.
ZED
(looping the rope around
his waist)
Lower me down.
Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top
of the ziggurat holding the rope.
Official White
116.
Marlak looks at the rope in his hands, pulls it a little and
sees that it's not attached to the rope Zed was holding.
CUT TO:
ZED
He's descending rapidly, rappelling off the side of the
ziggurat. He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and
slow him down.
ZED
(CALLING)
Any time now, Marlak!
Marlak and Enmebaragesi watch his descent, dumbly interested
in what happens next.
Zed sees he's not slowing down and tries to swing himself
onto one of the upper levels of the ziggurat. However, when
he swings in, he hits a cart loaded with bricks and bounces
off painfully.
THE BRICK CART
The sudden jolt dislodges the wheel chock that was holding
the cart on the sloping ramp of the tower. The cart starts
to roll down the ramp, gathering speed as it careens toward
the edge.
CUT TO:
73
THE HIGH PRIEST
73
He raises his staff and invokes the Gods.
HIGH PRIEST
We implore the great Gods of heaven
to show us a sign that we may honor
your divine will and be worthy of
your blessing.
CUT TO:
Official White
117.
74
THE ZIGGURAT
74
The brick cart explodes through the scaffolding on the side
of the ziggurat and sails into the air.
CUT TO:
THE ROYAL ENCLOSURE
Everybody turns at the sound of the crash and looks up at the
ziggurat.
CUT TO:
THE BRICK PITS
The NASTY GUARD who whipped Oh earlier glances up and is
instantly crushed by a ton of falling bricks.
THE ZIGGURAT
Zed is still descending as the broken scaffolding starts to
give way.
TEMPLE SQUARE
The whole crowd watches in amazement as the 250
foot
scaffolding slowly collapses and crashes to the ground,
bringing tons of debris with it, sending up a great cloud of
dust.
THE HIGH PRIEST
He looks shocked.
OH
He seizes the opportunity.
OH
A sign! It's a sign! The Chosen
One comes!
The other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his
excitement.
Official White
118.
CROWD
The Chosen One! A sign from the
Gods!
THE HIGH PRIEST
He doesn't quite know how to respond to the growing fervor of
the crowd.
HIGH PRIEST
Yes! Well and truly, the Gods are
with us--
The crowd drowns him out.
75
THE BASE OF THE ZIGGURAT
75
A guard is standing there staring at the rubble of the
scaffolding as Zed comes screaming down the side of the
ziggurat and lands right on top of him. Zed quickly strips
the unconscious guard of his weapons, starts to run off,
stops, comes back and grabs the guard's helmet, then takes
off running to the temple square.
CUT TO:
76
THE ALTAR
76
The High Priest is getting frantic now.
HIGH PRIEST
Burn them! Now!
He grabs Maya and starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth
of the idol and the raging fire within. She struggles but is
too drugged to put up much resistance. He grabs the
sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing her.
HIGH PRIEST
(cont'd)
(RUSHING)
May the balm of this healing oil
soothe your journey through the
sacred fire!
(DESPERATELY)
Don't fight it! It's the will of
the Gods!
Then, a voice from above.
Official White
119.
ZED
(SHOUTS)
I don't think so!
Zed is standing atop the idol's head, brandishing a sword and
shield.
MAYA
She sees him and starts to revive.
MAYA
Zed!
THE HIGH PRIEST
looks up, unable to hear Zed over the crowd noise.
HIGH PRIEST
(cupping his ear)
What did you say?
ZED
(SHOUTS)
I said, 'I don't think so!'
HIGH PRIEST
(shakes his head)
Still not getting it.
Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively
climbing down from the top of the idol. He jumps the last
few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the
High Priest's way.
ZED
I Said, 'I don't think so.'
HIGH PRIEST
(CONFUSED)
You don't think what?
ZED
Whatever that last thing you said
was.
HIGH PRIEST
(THINKS)
I forgot.
(SHOUTS)
Guards!
Official White
120.
Guards rush toward Zed from all sides, but he fights like a
demon, slashing, spinning, stabbing, fending off their blows
with his shield.
Oh is inspired by Zed's courage.
OH
(to the Edomite slave)
I know him, too.
Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of
him. The other slaves see that and start fighting with their
guards, a genuine slave revolt.
THE CROWD
Guards start moving to help their comrades, but the spirit of
insurrection takes hold of the crowd and people start
grappling with the guards.
A PLATOON OF REINFORCEMENTS comes double-timing into the
square.
Suddenly, A STOOPED OLD MAN throws off his cloak and pulls a
sword. It's Abraham!
ABRAHAM
Death to the idolators!
Abraham's small army of HEBREWS reveal themselves, draw their
weapons and attack the reinforcements.
The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands there
observing the growing chaos.
ISAAC
(shaking his head)
Just fucking nuts.
77
MARLAK AND ENMEBARAGESI
77
They come running into the battle swinging clubs, randomly
bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike.
Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground.
CAIN
Tough guy, huh? You want a piece
of me? Get ready to have your head
bashed in!
Official White
121.
As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak HEAD-BUTTS him.
CAIN
(cont'd)
(nose bleeding, stunned)
Nice move!
He passes out and goes down.
78
THE KING
78
He starts to panic at the full-scale revolt and rises
nervously. His ministers surround him, he thinks to protect
him.
KING
I knew I could depend on your
loyalty.
The ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in
for the kill.
KING
(cont'd)
(MUTTERS)
Assholes.
He falls to their flashing knives.
79
THE TEMPLE
79
Oh fights his way to the temple stairs, runs up and confronts
a PRIEST who is trying to drag Eema away. He fights with
very little skill but tremendous energy, finally overwhelming
the guard and grabbing Eema.
OH
(suddenly shy again)
Hello, Eema.
EEMA
(still a little dazed)
Oh?
He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes.
OH
(suddenly forceful)
Eema, you're my woman! You hear
me?
EEMA
Okay.
Official White
122.
OH
Really? It's okay?
He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the
mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard
rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform,
accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him.
80
THE HIGH PRIEST
80
While Zed is busy with the guards, the High Priest pulls Maya
toward the fire.
Zed sees him, finishes the last of the guards, and starts
slowly moving toward the High Priest who starts backing away
until he sees Oh moving toward him from the other side. He
holds the helpless Maya close to the flames.
HIGH PRIEST
(screaming and crying)
Keep away!
ZED
Let her go.
HIGH PRIEST
(his mascara running)
No! The Gods demand a sacrifice!
And you ruined it!
He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire.
ZED
(trying to keep him calm)
Why don't we just sacrifice
something small-- a rabbit maybe.
Or a duck. That'd be good, don't
you think?
HIGH PRIEST
(SCREAMS)
No! A duck would not be good!
OH
(U.S.)
Then how about this?
The High Priest turns to Oh.
Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher.
OH
(cont'd)
More oil?
Official White
123.
He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him
from head to toe. As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed
dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp.
The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap
around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform
shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's
fiery mouth. Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame
like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the
mouth of the furnace.
HIGH PRIEST
(SCREAMS)
Hot!
TEMPLE SQUARE
Everyone goes silent, stunned by the incredible turn of
events. All eyes turn to Zed and Oh, now standing before
them on the center stage of the temple.
ZED AND OH
They look at each other. Someone has to say something.
Finally, Zed clears his throat.
ZED
I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess,
and on behalf of, well, the whole
city, I want to thank the High
Priest for his incredible
sacrifice. That was really
something, wasn't it?
He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the
people in the square are applauding.
At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in
the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady
rain starts to fall.
The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they
all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as
it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied
muttering begins.
ZED
(cont'd)
(jumping in quickly)
People! Friends! Sodomites!
Okay, that was a little confusing,
wasn't it?
(MORE)
Official White
124.
ZED
(cont'd)
Was that a sign from God? Wasn't
it a sign? What's the deal? We
all want to know. But I'm not sure
anybody really knows-- and I'd be
real suspicious of people who say
they do. If I've learned one
thing, it's this: the world and
everything in it is a miracle. And
what that miracle means is for each
and every one of us to figure out
for himself. Are the Gods going to
destroy us? Maybe-- I don't know--
I guess it's possible. But if we
keep going the way we are, they
won't have to. We're doing a
pretty good job of destroying
ourselves. So maybe we should all
just go home now, and think about
what happened-- and be very, very
good to each other. I know I'm
going to try.
(raises his hand in salute
to the people)
Peace.
The crowd stares at him blankly. Nobody knows what to make
of it all. Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear.
MARLAK
All hail the Chosen One!
With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers.
In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks around and scowls.
ABRAHAM
What am I? Chopped liver?
At the altar, Maya, revived now, embraces Zed.
MAYA
You're incredible, you know that?
ZED
That's what I've been trying to
tell you.
Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the
gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on.
DISSOLVE TO:
Official white

A caravan is assembling, making ready to leave the city.
Marlak, Enmebaragesi, Maya, Eema and the other villagers are
there, as well as a great number of freed slaves and Hebrews.
Isaac is checking out Maya's breasts.
ISAAC
Hey, babe. Ever made it with a
circumcised guy?
Marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife.
ISAAC
(cont'd)
(BACKPEDALING)
Is she with you? I did not realize
that. Sorry.
Marlak and Maya cross to Zed who is loading a packhorse.
Marlak looks at him for a long moment then punches him hard
on the shoulder.
MARLAK
(GRUDGING)
You did good.
Zed waits for more, but nothing comes.
ZED
(rubbing his shoulder)
Well said, Marlak. You really have
a way with words.
They clasp hands.
MARLAK
We'll tell stories about you around
the fire.
ZED
Not much to tell, is there? Just
an average guy who saw his destiny
and had the courage to defy a
powerful empire. No big deal.
Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one
is listening to him. Zed joins him.
ZED
(cont'd)
Everybody ready?
Official White
126.
OH
(WORRIED)
Yeah, just about-- I guess so. The
Hebrews are going to lead us to the
sea and we can get boats from
there. We can trade all this stuff
everybody gave us for the trip
home.
(NERVOUS)
I don't think I should be the
leader. Nobody's listening to me.
EEMA
(by his side)
I'll listen to you.
Oh swells up with pride.
OH
(turns to Zed)
Come back to the village sometime.
Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a
tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel.
OH
(cont'd)
(shouting at camel)
Hee-ya!
(beat, quietly to camel)
Come on. People are watching.
The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off.
Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow.
As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there
with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground
beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet.
Maya joins him.
MAYA
Where will you go now?
ZED
Might head down to Egypt. I hear
it's a happening kinda place.
MAYA
Are you going alone?
ZED
Not necessarily. You want to come?
Official White
127.
MAYA
I'll get my things.
She gestures off and he sees a small train of camels and
horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions.
MAYA (cont'd)
The Princess gave me a few gifts
when she freed us.
ZED
Traveling light, huh? Okay, here
we go.
(POINTS)
To the west!
MAYA
(correcting him)
That's west.
ZED
I knew that. Just wanted to see if
you did.
Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of
sheep and goats, tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the
opposite direction.
As THE LAST OF THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something
masculine about her build and posture. Zed nods politely to
her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him.
CAIN
(in a high unconvincing
woman's voice)
Peace--- brother.
zed does a double take at the voice, shrugs, and walks off
with Maya-- as a torrential rain begins to fall.
