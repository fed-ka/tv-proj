inky sky is awash with stars.
ON THE CREST OF A DUNE
A U.S. ARMY BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE and matching HUMMER
sit, waiting.
KUWAIT, 1991
Muffled THUMP of rap music thrums from the Bradley, and low
voices stray from the open doors of the Hummer.
MARCO (O.S.)
Why can't we go directly in ...

A topographical MAP glows on the LCD screen of a laptop

his big, gentle, French guide, LAURENT TOKAR.
MARCO
(pointing)
... this way --?
LAURENT
Yes, well -- I see the Captain enjoys the
road less travelled.
Marco is seemingly unflappable, completely engaged by life.
MARCO
The Captain enjoys not dragging his ass
down the highway for every Tom, Dick and
Qadhafi to take a whack at.
Laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach.

Well. Of course it is very bad, here.

Nordic fuckers are planted.
MARCO

Sgt. Shaw!
No response.
And we RUSH TOWARD: A SOLDIER IN A LAWN CHAIR, face lifted
to the heavens, sitting directly between the two armored
vehicles. This is SGT. RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW, late
twenties, haunted and aloof.
MARCO

Rolling in two minutes.
RAYMOND
Yes sir.

darkness ... circling ... NO SOUND --
MARCO (V.O.)
I couldn't hear anything, as I was
temporarily deaf from the explosion of
the Bradley ...
-- SOLDIERS WITH GAS MASKS lean out of the open doors of the
helicopters and drop GAS CANISTERS down on Marco's team.
IN SLOWING MOTION:

MARCO'S SQUAD -- the effect of the gas is immediate: Mavole

FIRES a burst that goes harmlessly wide of a helicopter.
Then he falls on his back. HEAVY, LUMINOUS, YELLOW-ORANGE
VAPOR swirls across the battle --

he wheels to get away from the drifting gas, feet unsteady.
Grabs a dazed Bobby Baker by the collar --

An elegant ALL-WOMAN HARP ORCHESTRA plays new-age patriotic

members jostle between elegant food stations, or cue up for
thirty seconds with presidential-hopeful Robert Arthur.
MOVING WITH - MARCO
who has two retired, old bastard Generals in his company,
stars gleaming on their shoulders. Marco's eyes scan the
room; he's a man on a mission:
GENERAL SLOAN
No offense, Major, but it chaps my ass we
gotta have a babysitter.
MARCO
Sir, I'm just here to keep you from
getting into fist-fights with the Navy
guys.
The old generals laugh, appreciate this.
Marco stops --
eureka -- he's found his target:
MARCO'S P.O.V. - ACROSS THE HUGE ROOM - RAYMOND
holding side-show vice-presidential court for some enamored
young women and their banker husbands. SECRET SERVICE
agents, including his everpresent Anderson, maintaining a
careful perimeter.

Whereupon
SENATOR ELEANOR SHAW

disastrous foreign policy which has only
served to galvanize our enemies --
ELLIE
MARCO
Excuse us please --
Whoa --
FOR AN INSTANT Ellie and Marco lock eyes -- then the crowd
swallows her again --
GENERAL WILSON
They oughta put up a crossing guard.
GENERAL SLOAN
Or rig her with an air horn.

JORDAN) near the entrance.
RAYMOND

DONOVAN is a man possessed of a commanding presence,
radiating charm, brilliance and stealth. J.B. (JAY)
JOHNSTON is younger than the others, a three-sport letterman
who graduated with distinction from Princeton and happily
works until there's no one left in the office to give
instructions to. MARK WHITING is gracious and warm.
ELLIE
Hello Mark.
Ellie greets Whiting with a fondness she reserves for old
friends -- as a former Tyler Prentiss protg, he now stands
comfortably at the fertile crossroads where big industry
meets big government, and profits soar.
WHITING
Eleanor! Congratulations, Raymond. Your
grandad would be so goddamn proud of you.
RAYMOND
Nice to see you Mark.

The following flows, overlapping, easy:
ELLIE

Manchurian Global --
RAYMOND
Yes, hi --

Director.
RAYMOND

chuckle appreciatively.

Ellie glides off, unfazed.
The men banter on:
RAYMOND
Gentlemen, how's business?
WHITING
Good, Raymond. Business is good.
JOHNSTON

RAYMOND
Careful. Any better, you'll be a

DONOVAN
There's the challenge. Maximizing the

WHITING
Or a country.
Off their shared, collegial laughter --
ACROSS THE ROOM - MARCO - MONETS LATER
watches Raymond take his leave from the Manchurian Global
guys -- while, at the bar, the generals have established
their beachhead of Bloody Marys with a couple of younger men
in NAVY WHITES:
REAR ADMIRAL GLICK
Every great civilization has been
anchored by a great Navy.
GENERAL SLOAN
Bullshit. You guys are sea chum, ripe

Marco laughs deliberately, trying to diffuse the tension.
MARCO

If you can't behave yourselves, Generals,

him:)
I need to talk to you.
But he keeps walking --
MARCO

towards Jocie, at the entrance. Marco follows, passing:
ELLIE AND JORDAN

rising out of the din:
JORDAN

bid so that --
ELLIE

reflected limelight from your son --
ELLIE

Tom, please, just because the party felt
a younger, more dynamic man could help
the ticket, I don't think it's fair for
you to single me out and --
JORDAN
You know, I have such contempt for you,
Eleanor, that when I think of you, I
actually fear for this country. Raymond
is nothing. A riddle. A wild card at
worst. But you, you are the smiler who
wraps her dagger in the cloak of the flag
and waits for her chance to strike.

He starts to move away, but Marco grabs his arm --

Raymond yanks his arm away --

Don't touch me.

... the five-term Senator -- and recent
front-runner for his party's vice
presidential nomination -- appears to
have accidentally drowned when his kayak
overturned near his Chesapeake Bay home.
Police say his daughter, Jocelyn, 35, may
have been trying to rescue Jordan when
she was, herself, overcome by the icy
water ...

Horrible, horrible thing. Senator Jordan
was a statesman of the highest integrity.
(fighting emotions)
Tom Jordan was a friend. A damn fine
man. A great American.

Whiting just behind them.
DONOVAN
You trusted us to bring your son back to
you, and we deliver. We trusted you with
our technology -- and now you turn him
into a common hit man.

ELLIE
Oh, don't lecture me --
DONOVAN
You didn't even ask us.
You needed to
ask.
ELLIE
Tom Jordan was going to destroy
everything we've worked toward, and every
one of us along with it, and you want me
to call a meeting?
WHITING
David, if Jordan had gone public --
DONOVAN
In any endeavor, there are key players
and role players, and Raymond -- or you,
or me, for that matter -- I'm sorry -- we
are role players, with fixed values and
fixed agendas, that get weighed against
other factors.
Ellie stops, looks at him.
ELLIE
Bullshit.
(then)
You can tell yourself that as you go to
bed tonight, David, and I hope it helps
you wake up tomorrow with a clean
conscience -- but we are talking about my
son and the future of this country.
(beat)
My father, Tyler Prentiss, never asked.
He just did what needed to be done.

WE ARE JETTING LOW and impossibly fast across whitecapped
azure water, toward crumbled ruins of a long-abandoned
village on an empty beach -- we remember it vividly from
Marco's memory -- arriving to slowly SPIN and hover over the
remnants of an ancient caravansary:

HIGH ANGLE, DOWN on Marco, moving across the intricate, sun-
bleached tile work we remember from Noyle's lab.

Dissipated trace of a scaffolding superstructure inside
crumbling ruins ...
MARCO
You don't develop a technology like that
and waste it on two guys.
He looks to Rosie, who stands in an archway. There are
SOLDIERS here, with weapons -- could be here to guard Marco.
Could be here to protect him.
ROSIE
We know that.
Marco looks past her, to the water, which stretches out from
here, as if to forever.
MARCO
I remember running.
His arm is in a simple sling. He moves like a man who's
been shot, and not quite recovered -- moves past Rosie, out
of the broken-down ruins ...
MARCO
I had to get out where the sky was.
... Rosie motions the soldiers to stay back, follows him by
herself ...
MARCO
I had to get to the water.
PULL BACK as they walk down the beach to the sea. A few
tumble-down buildings are all that remains of an ancient
seaside town.
MARCO
I thought: if I can just get to the
water, everything will be okay.
Marco approaches the water's edge, staring out at the
uncertain horizon.
Nothing but water as far as the eye can see.
PULL BACK.
And back.
And back ...
FADE OUT.
