                equal from the lowest working person *

                to the richest titan of industry. *

                                  CRISTELA*

                Yeah, that great Texas tradition, *

                where girls learn they re not quite as *

                  important as boys.*

                                  FELIX*

                Why shouldn t women cheer for men?*

                Then how come we never play that game *

                  anymore?*

                                  NATALIA*

                We didn t have cheerleading in my *

                village. We had fun games like getting *

                water from the well... and digging the *

                well.*

                                  CRISTELA*

                was disappointed in their kid for *

                Yes, but wherever he went, I m sure he *

                kept working very hard.  *

                                  FELIX*

                If we gave Cristela s room to my *

                                  CRISTELA*

                Pretty good.  The boss s daughter *

                insulted me, I insulted the boss s *

                best friend.*

                                  NATALIA*

                It s just as well. *

                                  CRISTELA*

                No.  It s not  just as well.   It s *

                less well.  It would be more well if *

                the interview had gone well. *

                                  NATALIA*

                worse when you go in the kitchen. *

                                  CRISTELA*

                How much worse?*

                                  CRISTELA*

                His truck is a piece of crap and it *

                was barely a dent.  It was like *

                getting yelled at for throwing a candy *

                wrapper into a landfill. *

                I think she s probably a little *

                  delirious from the injury.  What kind *

                                  DANIELA*

                                  DANIELA*
