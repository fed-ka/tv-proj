11OMITTED

22EXT. VICTORIAN STREET #1 - DAY 1

      FX: a quiet corner; wheeze & grind, and the TARDIS appears.

      THE DOCTOR steps out.  It's snowing.  He likes snow!  He
      strolls out of the quiet corner, into...

      A STREET MARKET.  Working class London, busy and bustling. 
      Vendors, cocky lads, working girls, crones, braziers,
      beggars in doorways, hot chestnuts, smoke, steam, the works.

      The Doctor walking through.  Smiling.  He's loving it, the
      colour and bustle and noise; this is what he travels for.

      Throughout all this, a CAROL can be heard; a new Murray
      Gold Christmas Carol.  Jolly & sinister, like the best
      hymns.  The Doctor passes the CAROLLERS, stops for a listen. 

      Then he wanders on, calls out to an URCHIN:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You there, boy, what day is this?

                                                          Tale
                                      URCHIN
                    Christmas Eve, sir!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    In what year?

                                      URCHIN
                    You thick or something?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oy!  Answer the question!

                    Year of our Lord 1851, sir.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                  The 
                    Right.  Nice year.  Bit dull -

      Suddenly, a woman's voice, a distance away, yelling -

                                      ROSITA OOV
                    Doctor!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...who, me?

                                      ROSITA OOV
                    Doctor!!!

      Big grin!  And he's running - !

      TRACK with him, racing through the snow, exhilarated -
      he's actually glad to hear someone calling his name -

                                                                            CUT TO:

33 *EXT. COURTYARD - DAY 1

      VERY HIGH WAREHOUSES on all sides, with barrels & stuff.  *
      Falling snow, but lighter.  THE DOCTOR comes running in - *

      In the middle: ROSITA, serving-girl, mid-20s, black, feisty.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Right then, don't worry, stand
                    back, what have we got here then..?

      Because Rosita is facing a big WOODEN DOOR.  Which has got
      SOMETHING TRAPPED BEHIND IT.  Trying to get out!  The door
      shudders, at regular intervals, as though being hit by
      something powerful -  Boom!  Boom!  Boom!

      The Doctor & Rosita wary of the door throughout dialogue:

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                      ...ohhkay, I've got it!  And
                                                          Tale
                      whatever's behind that door, I
                    think you should get out of here -

                                      ROSITA
                          (yells off)
                      Doctaaaaaa!!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, I'm standing right here, hello! 

                                      ROSITA
                                  Writer's 
                    Don't be so stupid, who are you?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm the Doctor.

                  The 
                                      ROSITA
                    Doctor who?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just, the Doctor.

                                      ROSITA
                    Well there can't be two of you!
                          (to the MAN)
                    Where the hell have you been??

      As the MAN comes running into the courtyard - he's lively,
        exhilarated, in frock coat & waistcoat, ever-so-slightly
      dandified.  He sees the door boom!, and loves it (all
      dialogue stays mindful of that about-to-break door) -

                    Right then, don't worry, stand
                    back, what have we got here then..?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Hold on, who are you?!

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    I'm the Doctor.  Simply, the Doctor. 
                    The one, the only, and the best.

      - then a bigger boom! makes the Other Doctor face the door.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Rosita!  Give me the sonic
                      screwdriver!

      Rosita hands him a screwdriver (no CU on it).

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The what?!

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                          (still to Rosita)
                    Now quickly, get back to the Tardis!
                                                          Tale

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Back to the what??

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    If you could stand back, sir - 
                    this is a job for a Time Lord!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Job for a what Lord??!
                                  Writer's 
      BOOM! - PRAC SPLINTERS fly, the door bursts open - !

      And framed in the DOORWAY is a CYBERSHADE!  It has the
      face of a Cyberman, like a mask; but the rest of it seems
      more supernatural, swathed in black robes, a black hood,
                  The 
      the whole outfit trailing off into back rags; it's a
      Cyberman crossed with a Dementor.  The only other signs of
      metal are its two METAL HANDS, more spindly and witchy
      than a Cyberman's.  Both Doctors (and Rosita) gobsmacked:

                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)OTHER DOCTOR
        That's different!Oh, that's new!

      The CYBERSHADE rears up, with a hissssss, about to attack!

      2-SHOT, both Doctors lift their screwdrivers.  Heroes! 

                                    THE DOCTOR/OTHER DOCTOR
                    Allons-y!

        CLIFFHANGER, INTO TITLES.

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 14 - Pink Amendments - 03/04/08       page 4.



44INT. CYBER HQ - DAY 1

      Darkness.  Shot tight, to be revealed in full later; an
      underground Victorian cellar, converted into CYBER HQ. 

      The hydraulic stomp! of Cyberfootsteps as the CYBERLEADER -
      brain visible in its helmet, like the Cybercontroller -
      walks into place, behind a CYBERMAN, on duty watching
      COMPUTER SCREENS.  (All the hardware is cannibalised;
      steampunk Victorian - Cybertechnology welded to the
      Industrial Revolution, cogs and wheels mixed with computer
      screens.  Screens at head height; Cybermen don't sit.)

                                      CYBERLEADER
                    Report.

                      Cybershade 16 has been discovered.

      On one screen: Cybershade's POV, the two Doctors from sc.3.

                                      CYBERLEADER
                    Order it to withdraw.  This man is
                      dangerous.  This man is our enemy. 
                    This man... is the Doctor.
                                                          Tale

      Cyberleader's finger points, CU pixellated screen image...

      Passing over the Doctor, pointing out the Other Doctor!

55 *EXT. COURTYARD - DAY 1

      This dialogue to play into sc.4 Cyber-screens only, from
      CYBERSHADE POV, THE DOCTOR & OTHER DOCTOR facing it -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    But what's it doing here?!

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                  The 
                    It's fallen into my trap!  Oh,
                    I've been hunting this beast for a
                    good fortnight, now step back, sir -

      SCENE 5 STARTS:

      CYBERSHADE turns left, crouches down...

      Then it LEAPS UP, out of shot -*

      FX: landing 6 ft up on the wall to the left of the Doctors
      & Rosita - it clings to the wall, like Spider Man, staying
      in this position (ie, for these leaps, CYBERSHADES exist
      as CG models also; again, like Spider Man.)

      CU Cybershade, turning its head round and hissing at them.

      THE DOCTOR, OTHER DOCTOR & ROSITA looking up, boggling -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Some sort of primitive conversion,
                    like they took the brain of a cat
                    or a dog...

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Talking's all very well - Rosita!

                                      ROSITA
                    I'm ready!

      And she hands the Other Doctor a coil of rope, tied at one
      end in a lasso - he readies it -

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Now watch, and learn -

      He throws the lasso -

      The Cybershade's reaching out one arm to claw at them, so
      the lasso loops around its arm & opposite shoulder -

      The Other Doctor wraps the rope around his wrist, tight -

                                      OTHER DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                                                          Tale
                      Excellent!  Now then, let's pull
                    this timorous beastie down to earth -

      FX: CYBERSHADE scuttles up the wall, fast - rope tightening -

      PRAC MID-SHOT Other Doctor - pulled up out of frame!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Or not.

      SIDE-ON SHOT, the Other Doctor holding the rope (wrist
                                  Writer's 
      trapped), scrabbling against the wall, his feet finding
      purchase on the brickwork, so he's like an abseiler -

      CU Cybershade - it's stopped again, looking down, hissing -

                  The 
      HIGH ANGLE looking down at the Other Doctor in that
      position, the Doctor & Rosita below him -

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    I think I might be in a little bit
                    of trouble...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Nothing changes.  I've got you - !

      The rope's long - the Doctor grabbing hold of the trailing
      end, wrapping it round his wrist -

      FX: CYBERSHADE scuttles further up the wall, fast -

      CU on the Other Doctor, yanked up - 

      PRAC SHOT - and the Doctor's yanked upwards - !

5 CONTINUED: (2)5

      SIDE-ON SHOT of the Doctor, as he's yanked up into shot,
      hits the wall, a few feet up, finds his feet, scrabbling
      into the abseiling position.

      CU Cybershade, stopped again, looking round, calculating... 

      CUT TO ground level, ROSITA grabbing hold of an AXE, which
      is lying around with all the crates & junk -

                                      ROSITA
                    You idiots - !

      And she runs into the warehouse -

      FX: HIGH ANGLE, looking down on the Other Doctor, abseiling, *
      then the Doctor, abseiling below him, this intercut with
      PRAC: LOW ANGLE, looking up at Doctor, Other Doctor above *
      him, then the Cybershade above both.  Also covered with
      normal, non-FX side-on CUs of the Doctors.  As they have a
      perfectly normal conversation:

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Perhaps if you could pull..?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                                                          Tale
                    I am pulling!  In this position, I
                    couldn't not pull, could I?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Then I'd suggest you let go, sir!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm not letting you out of my sight,
                    Doctor!  Don't you recognise me?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                                  Writer's 
                    Should I?  Have we met?  It's hardly
                    the right time to go through my
                    social calendar - whoa!

      CU on the Other Doctor pulled up out of frame again -
                  The 
      CU on the Doctor, being yanked up -

      FX: CYBERSHADE scuttling up, then a CG leap up, through a
      high-up window (no glass, just a gaping space).

      abseiling in reverse, running up the wall, both yelling -

66INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 1

      Big, empty, echoing space -

      The OTHER DOCTOR, still with his wrist wrapped around the

      CUT TO THE CYBERSHADE; indoors, it scuttles on all fours,
      like an animal, and it's now racing along the warehouse
      floor, pulling the rope tight behind it -

      The Other Doctor's in a sitting-up position - he's being
      pulled along the floor, on his arse, followed by - 

      CUT TO THE DOCTOR, wrist wrapped around the rope, being
      pulled over the sill, on to the floor -

      FX: WIDE SHOT, the scuttling all-fours Cybershade racing
      along the floor, like a husky with a sled, dragging Other
      Doctor and then the Doctor behind it, fast - both Doctors
      now sliding along on their arses, sending up dust -

      CUs on both men, holding on to the rope, sliding along!

      DEEP 2-SHOT, both men sliding along!

      CUT TO the Doctors' POV of the CYBERSHADE, rope pulled
      tight, as it scuttles towards the opposite wall, where
      there's another big, wide, open window -

      CUT TO BOTH MEN sliding along -

                    - we're gonna fall - !

      FX: DOCTORS' POV, the CYBERSHADE ahead of them - trailing
      its rope - it does a CG LEAP up towards the window -

      - and suddenly, running in at a right angle - ROSITA - 
                                  Writer's 
      - she's between Cybershade & Doctors, slams down the axe -

      And cutting the rope!  Bang on the windowsill!

      The Doctors stop!  Tumble into a heap!  Action stopped
                  The 
      dead, both men on the floor.  They unravel the rope off
      their wrists with 'ow!'s and 'ooh's.  Then they look at
      each other.  And they laugh.  Really laugh.  The relief! 

      They stand, dazed, and give each other a great big hug!

                                                                            CUT TO: *

      REVEAL the OTHER DOCTOR & ROSITA, in hiding on the opposite
      side of the street, like spies.  On a mission.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    The late Reverend Fairchild. 
                    Leaving his place of residence for
                    the last time, God rest his soul. 

      CUT TO FURTHER BEHIND THEM, THE DOCTOR keeping hidden. 
      Spying on the spies. 

                                      OTHER DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Now!  With the house empty, I'll
                    effect an entrance at the rear,
                    while you go back to the Tardis. 
                    This is hardly work for a woman.

                                      ROSITA
                    Oh don't mind me saving your life,
                    that's work for a woman, isn't it?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    The Doctor's companion does what
                    the Doctor says, now off you go!

      CUT TO THE DOCTOR, listening, a smile; he liked that!
                                                          Tale

      Rosita huffs, stomps off (down the street, away from the
      funeral, not turning towards the Doctor behind her).

      The Other Doctor waits...  The last MOURNERS filtering
      away...  Then the street's empty.

      He runs across the road.

      The Doctor steps out of hiding, follows.
                                  Writer's 
      But a distance away, in shadow; A CYBERSHADE, watching. *

1313EXT. BACK OF TOWNHOUSE - DAY 1

      Behind the house; a back door, maybe a servants' door.

      THE OTHER DOCTOR sneaks in, like a thief.  Kneels down,
      gets out his SCREWDRIVER (not in CU), works on the lock...

      When the door opens!  He looks up - !

      And there's THE DOCTOR!  Already inside!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Hello!

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    But... how did you get in?

                    Front door.  I'm good at doors. 
                    D'you mind my asking... is that
                    your sonic screwdriver?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    I'd be lost without it.

      He holds it up, proud; a plain 1850's workman's tool.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    But... that's a screwdriver.  How
                    is it sonic?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Well.  It makes a noise.

      And he taps it on the wall, tap-tap.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    That's sonic, isn't it?  Now since
                    we're acting like common burglars,
                    I suggest we get out of plain view!

      He heads in, the Doctor slamming the door shut behind him -

1414INT. TOWNHOUSE - DAY 1

      (Including hall, drawing room, stairs, etc.)  Once the
      home of an elderly man; the house is dark, empty, spooky.

      THE DOCTOR & OTHER DOCTOR walk from the back of the house,
      into the hall, Other Doctor creeping about, investigating,
      looking in drawers, under picture frames, anywhere.  The
                                  Writer's 
      Doctor more intent on studying the Other Doctor.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    You should make your escape, Mr
                    Smith, I have work to do.
                  The 
                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Ohh, can't I stay?  I could be
                    your companion.  Always room for
                    one more!  Oh I like this!  So
                    what are we looking for, Doctor?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Signs of alien infiltration.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh good! 

      And he heads into the DRAWING ROOM, the Doctor following. 

      Large, austere room.  Curtains drawn against the light. 
      Dust in the air.  Both Doctors poking about, searching.

                    This investigation of yours, what's
                    it all about..?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    It started with a murder.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh good.  I mean, bad, but whose?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Mr Jackson Lake.  A teacher of
                      Mathematics, from Sussex.  He came
                    to London three weeks ago, and
                    died a terrible death.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Cybermen?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Hard to say, his body was never
                    found.  But then it started.  More
                    secret murders.  Then abductions. 
                    Children, stolen away in silence.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    So whose house is this..?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    The latest murder.  The Reverend
                    Aubrey Fairchild.  Found with burns
                    to his forehead, like some advanced
                    form of electrocution.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    But who was he, was he important..?

                    You ask a lot of questions.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                  The 
                    I'm your companion!

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    The Reverend was a pillar of the
                      community.  A member of many Parish
                    Boards.  A keen advocate of
                      children's charity.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Children again...

                    Oh, he was famously good to them. 
                    He'd discipline them, birch them,
                    send them to the Workhouse.

                    Lovely.  Nice man.  But why would
                    the Cybermen want him dead?  And
                    what's his connection to the first
                    death, Mr Jackson Lake..?

      But the Other Doctor stops, looks at the Doctor, disturbed.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    It's funny, I seem to be telling
                    you everything.  As though you
                    engender some sort of... trust.
                          (closer)
                    You do seem familiar, Mr Smith.  I
                    know your face...  But how?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I wonder.  Can't help noticing...
                    you're wearing a fobwatch.

      The Other Doctor has a fobwatch-on-chain, on his waistcoat,
      now takes it out.  All very solemn between them:

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Is that important?
                                                          Tale

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Legend has it that the memories of
                    a Time Lord can be contained. 
                    Within a watch.  D'you mind..?

      The Doctor takes hold of it.  Reverential.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    It's said, that if it's opened...

      Both men look at each other.  Almost scared

      The Doctor opens the fobwatch...

      Then tips it up.  And all the cogs fall out.  Oh.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Maybe not.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    It's more for decoration.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yup.  Anyway!  Alien infiltration!

      The Other Doctor busies himself at a desk, searching:

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Just look for anything different,
                    possibly metal, anything that
                    doesn't seem to belong, perhaps a
                      mechanical device that would fit

                    no earthly engine, it could even
                    seem to be organic, though unlike
                    any organism of the natural world...

      During this, behind him, to save time, the Doctor sneaks
      out the sonic, then quickly whirrs it in a semicircle,
      ending with a blip! as it points towards a bureau -

      The Other Doctor turns round, the Doctor pockets the sonic.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    What's that noise?

                    Oh just me.  Whistling.
                          (he whistles a whirr)
                    Wonder what's in here, though...

      Going to the bureau, opening it, Other Doctor joining him -

      Inside, three SMALL METAL OBJECTS.  Steel; like the valve
      on top of a pressure cooker.

                          (both pick one up)
                    They're Infostamps!  I mean, at a
                    guess, if I were you, I'd say they
                    worked something like this...

      Holds up the INFOSTAMP, presses a button at one end:

      FX (MORE THAN 1 SHOT): a PROJECTION streams from the
      INFOSTAMP, yellow GRAPHICS, projected in a circle on the
      wall - flickering projection beam visible from stamp to
                                  Writer's 
      wall - an ever-changing display of writing, charts, maps,
      never stopping, too fast to read.

                    D'you see?  Compressed information. 
                  The 
                    Tons of it!  That's the history of
                    London, 1066 to the present day,
                    this thing's like a disk, a
                      Cyberdisk!  But why would the
                    Cybermen need something so simple..? 
                    They've gotta be wireless.  Unless! 
                    They're in the wrong century, they
                    haven't got much power, they need
                    plain old basic Infostamps to update
                      themselves...  Are you all right?

      FX: GRAPHICS PROJECTION dies as the Doctor turns to Other
      Doctor, who's clutching his Infostamp, as though in pain.

1818INT. TOWNHOUSE - DAY 1

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    ...the Cybermen.  They made me
                    change.  My face.  My mind.  My
                    whole self...  And you were there. 
                          (touches the Doctor's
                            face, scared)
                    Who are you?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm a friend.  I swear. 

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Then I beg of you, John.  Help me.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Ah.  Two words I never refuse.

      THE DOCTOR with more energy, now, stepping back, going
      round the room, searching, quickly -

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    But it's not a conversation for a
                    dead man's house, it'll make more
                                                          Tale
                    sense if we go back to the Tardis,
                    your Tardis, hold on, I just need
                    to do a little final check, won't
                    take a tick, cos there's one more
                    thing, I can't help thinking, if
                    this room's got Infostamps, then
                    maybe, just maybe, it's got
                    something that needs infostamping...

      In checking everything, he's heading for an interior door...
                                  Writer's 
      He opens it.

      There's a CYBERMAN standing there.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                  The 
                    Okay.

      And he shuts the door.  Calm:

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    I think we should run.

      - then he leaps out of the way as BAM - !  The door's
      knocked flat, the Cyberman striding out - big CU for -

                                      CYBERMAN
                    Delete!

      The OTHER DOCTOR boggling - on his face, as - 

      His POV of the Cyberman flickers with a fast FLASHBACK of
      the sc.7 Cybermen - terrifying him, frozen to the spot -

                    Run Doctor, now Doctor!!!

      Said, pulling the Other Doctor out into the HALL - the
      Doctor slams the drawing room door, whirrs the sonic to
      lock it - both run towards the rear of the house -

      But there's a SECOND CYBERMAN, advancing from that direction -
      the stomp! stomp! stomp! of its feet -

      - both Doctors run back the way they came -

      BAM!  The Drawing Room door is knocked flat, the FIRST
      CYBERMAN striding out -

      The Doctor sees an umbrella stand, goes to grab a weapon; *
      a golf club, walking stick, umbrella...nah.  Over this: *

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    - stairs! - can't lead it outside -

      Then he sees a CUTLASS on the wall, grabs it -*

      The Doctor now backing up the stairs, Other Doctor behind
      him - terrified - CYBERMEN marching up.  This speech
                                                          Tale
      covering the stairs as they all head up, step by step:

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    I'm a dab hand with a cutlass, you
                    don't want to come near me when
                    I've got one of these!  This is
                    your last warning!  No?  Okay, this
                    is your last warning!...  Okay,
                    this is really your last warning. 
                    Okay, I give up!
                                  Writer's 
      They've reached the landing -

                                                                            CUT TO:

1919INT. TOWNHOUSE, UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY 1
                  The 
      Dark corridor.  THE DOCTOR & OTHER DOCTOR backing away - 
      CYBERMEN advancing, stomp! - the Doctor more serious now:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Listen to me, properly, whatever
                    you're doing, stuck in 1851, I can
                    help, I mean it, I'm the only person
                    in the world who can help you -

      CYBERMAN #1 closer now, lunges forward, hand reaching out -

      The Doctor swings the cutlass -

      FX: SPARKS as it hits the Cyberarm!

      And this becomes a duel now, the advancing Cyberman lifting
      up its arm, swinging it down, karate-chop, and every time -

      All on the move, both Doctors backing away down the corridor -

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Listen to me, I'm the Doctor, you

                    my name is the Doctor, just leave
                    this man alone, the Doctor is me!

      CUT TO CU Other Doctor, behind the Doctor - and during
      this, he's so scared - genuinely, gibbering - but not only
      by the Cybermen, he's scared because he hears what the
      Doctor's saying, and he's remembering -

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FX: SC.20, CYBERMEN, ELECTRICITY zapping round its head -

      INTERCUT with NOW, and the Other Doctor stands forward,
      alongside the Doctor, does the same again, flicks open one
      end of his Infostamp -

      FX: BLAZE OF ELECTRICITY streaming out of the infostamp -

      Silence.  MID-SHOT Cybermen, headless, kneeling, topple to *
      the ground -*

      WIDER, on their knees, they topple to the ground, clang!

      Other Doctor sinks to the ground.  The Doctor joins him. 
      Phew!  Both breathing hard, exhausted.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                                  Writer's

                    Come here, you'll be all right,
                    let me just check...

      Gets out his stethoscope, listens to the Other Doctor's
      heart, both sides, the Other Doctor still upset:

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    But you told them you were the

                    Just protecting you.

                    I've got.  Just like they did. 
                    They stole something... something

                          (starts to cry)
                    But I can't remember.  What happened
                    to me?  What did they do?

      He's helpless.  The Doctor puts his arm round him, gentle:

                    We'll find out.  You and me,

                    heart of yours is still beating,

2222EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY 1

      A Victorian graveyard.  Out-of-town, lined by trees.  HEAVY
      SNOW, and a MIST has descended.  Gloomy.

                                                          Tale
      The GRAVE lined by 20 MOURNERS.  No women.  The VICAR
        officiating; 40s, thin, chinless. 

                                      VICAR
                    Forasmuch as it hath pleased
                    Almighty God of his great mercy,
                    to take unto Himself the soul of
                    our dear brother here departed, we
                    therefore commit his body to the
                    ground.  Earth to earth, ashes to
                    ashes, dust to dust, in sure and
                                  Writer's 
                    certain hope of the Resurrection
                    to eternal life, through our Lord
                    Jesus Christ; who shall change our
                    vile body, that it may be like
                    unto his glorious body, according
                  The 
                    to the mighty working...

      He glances up, falters.

      A FIGURE is walking towards them, through the MIST & SNOW. 
      A SILHOUETTE.  The Vicar perturbed, tries to carry on:

                                      VICAR (CONT'D)
                    ...um, shall change our vile body,
                    that it may be, um, like unto his...

      But he looks up again.  Can't believe what he's seeing.

      Other mourners turn to look.

      The silhouette taking shape...

      The mourners now open-mouthed with shock.


                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode 14 - Shooting Script  - 31/03/08      page 23.

      Coming closer...  it's MISS HARTIGAN.  Looking spectacular
      and classy in a vivid RED DRESS.  Tight bodice; lipstick. 
      She's even carrying a parasol.

      Everyone outraged! 

      She loves it.  Takes her time, holding the silence, going
      to her place, at the end of the grave.

                                    MISS HARTIGAN
                    Do continue.

                                      VICAR
                    ...uh, whereby he is able to subdue
                    all things - Madam, I must protest!

                                    MISS HARTIGAN
                    Whatever for?

                                      VICAR
                    A lady at the graveside is debatable
                    enough.  But your apparel..!

                                    MISS HARTIGAN
                    Is it too exciting?
                                                          Tale

      MR COLE, one of the mourners, 60 y/o gent:

                    Smiling.  Bestowing your beneficence
                    upon the poor.  While I scrubbed

                    that.  Would you like to meet them? 
                    Hark!  I can hear them now.

      In the distance...

      Stomp, stomp, stomp...

      Mourners looking round...

      SILHOUETTES appearing in the SNOW & MIST.  Tall shapes.

      Mourners look the other way, fearful, now...

      More SILHOUETTES. 

      Stomp, stomp, stomp, getting louder...

      Mourners looking in all directions...

                    But what manner of men are they?

                                    MISS HARTIGAN
                    Cybermen.

      And suddenly -

      THREE CYBERSHADES leap out from behind GRAVESTONES, close
      to the GRAVE - squatting, threatening, hissss!

      And it's instant panic - MOURNERS running, terrified - !

      FX: MAN #2 being zapped!  (NB Cybermen do NOT grab anyone
      by the neck.  No throttling.  They clamp their hand down
      on the shoulder, or forehead, and zap.)

      FX: MORE CG CYBERSHADES bounding across the graveyard, in
      pursuit of the men, chasing them like hounds -

      Miss Hartigan strong now:

      Those four men scared - but they dare not move, the 3
      CYBERSHADES surrounding them, as guards, crouching, hissing -

      CUT TO mourners, fleeing, desperate - stumbling through
      the snow, panicking, all dignity gone -

      MAN #7 being pulled towards a Cyberman by a Cybershade -

                    Now then, Rosita.  A little decorum.

                    Looking forward to this...

      And Rosita's leading them into a brick building...

2424INT. FACTORY OUTHOUSE - NIGHT 1

      Once an abandoned brick building, full of barrels and
      crates, now with a layer of junk added on top.  Piles of
      luggage.  A wooden bed, a table laid out for tea; they've
      made this a home.  And it works, it's oddly comfortable.

      As THE DOCTOR looks round, fascinated, the OTHER DOCTOR
      goes to a sink, splashes water on his face, towels dry.

                    You were right though, Rosita. 
                    The Reverend Fairchild's death was
                    the work of the Cybermen!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    So... you live here?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                      A temporary base, till we rout the
                    enemy.  The Tardis is magnificent,
                    but it's hardly a home.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And where's the Tardis now?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    In the yard!  But the chill of
                    Christmas demands a better coat...

      He busies himself, ransacking piles of clothes.  

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Um.  What's all this luggage?

                    Evidence!  The property of Jackson
                    Lake, the first man to be murdered./ 
                    Oh, but my new friend is a fighter,
                    Rosita, much like myself!  He faced
                    the Cybermen with a cutlass!  I'm
                    not ashamed to say, he was braver
                    than I, he was quite brilliant.

      But from / on the Doctor.  Again, he sneaks out the sonic,
      does a surreptitious whirr of the luggage, gets a blip,
                                  Writer's 
      pockets the sonic again as the Other Doctor turns round -

                                      OTHER DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Are you whistling again?

                  The 
                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yes.  Yes I am.

      The Other Doctor gets back to finding a coat.  Rosita saw 
      the sonic; the Doctor gives her a silent sssh.  He opens a
      trunk, the one which caused the blip.  Full of clothes. 
      Rosita joins him (Other Doctor busy in b/g).

                                      ROSITA
                    That's another man's property.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Well, a dead man.

                    He saved my life.  Late one night,
                    by the Osterman's Wharf, this
                    creature came out of the shadows. 
                    A man made of metal.  I thought I
                    was going to die.  And then... 
                    There he was.  The Doctor.
                          (quieter)
                    Can you help him, sir?  He has
                    such terrible dreams.  Wakes at
                    night.  In such a state of terror.

      But the Other Doctor, with coat, joins them, now.  Quiet:

                    He must surely have bad dreams.

      FX: A BALLOON.  Like a hot-air balloon, though it's the
      wrong age for that, this is a gas balloon, but it looks

      JED's a cheery Factory Lad, 25. The Other Doctor gives him

2727INT. FACTORY OUTHOUSE - NIGHT 1

      THE DOCTOR, OTHER DOCTOR & ROSITA sit together.  Dark, a
      brazier burning.  Solemn, like a ghost story:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The story begins with the Cybermen. 
                    Creatures from a universe hidden
                    beneath our own, just out of sight. 
                    But then a long time away, and not
                    so far from here... the Cybermen
                    were fought, and they were beaten,
                    and they were sent into a howling
                      wilderness, called the Void.  Locked
                    inside forevermore.  But then a
                    greater battle rose up, so great
                    that everything inside the Void
                    perished.  But as the walls of the
                    world weakened, the last of the
                    Cybermen must have fallen through
                                                          Tale
                    the dimensions.  Back in time.  To
                    land here.  And they found you.

      CU Other Doctor, enthralled, but remembering...  INTERCUT
      with DARK, ENCLOSED SPACE FLASHBACKS as before fast, harsh -

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    I fought them.  I know that.  But
                    what happened..?

      The Doctor goes to the luggage.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    At the same time...  Another man
                    came to London.  Mr Jackson Lake! 
                    Plenty of luggage.  Money in his
                  The 
                    pocket.  Maybe coming to town for
                    the Winter season, I don't know. 
                    But he found the Cybermen, too. 
                    And just like you, exactly like
                    you, he took hold of an Infostamp...

      The Other Doctor scared, quiet; realising, but in denial:

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    But he's dead.  Jackson Lake is
                    dead.  The Cybermen murdered him.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You said no body was ever found. 
                    And you kept all his suitcases,
                    but you could never bring yourself
                    to open them.

                    You became the Doctor.  Because
                    the Infostamp you picked up was a
                    book about one, particular man.

      ROSITA puts her arm round him.  All three just sit there. 
      Hold, and then...

          Bleep-bleep-bleep...

      THE DOCTOR looks round.  Eh?

      He holds up the Infostamp.  It's going bleep-bleep-bleep. 
      Digs in his pocket, gets out the first Infostamp, from the
      Townhouse, it's going bleep-bleep-bleep...

      But the noise is building, even more bleeps...

      The Doctor runs to the luggage - tips out a suitcase -

      There's 3 plastic packs, in long strips of 20 INFOSTAMPS
      each, bundles of them.  Bleep-bleep-bleep -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oh, you found a whole cache of

      Rosita's torn, but runs out.  Leaving poor Jackson alone.

      Quieter, now, though with a few crones and lads; hot food
      and gin still being sold from some of the stalls.  THE
      DOCTOR runs into the street, stops, looks for something,
      anything.  Then, at the far end of the street, he sees...

      Long lens, a blur, at first.  PEOPLE, walking.  Lanterns.

      ROSITA runs up, joins the Doctor.

                    Someone's on the march.

      The figures resolving...

      MR COLE.  Blank-faced.  Marching with CHILDREN, down the
      middle of the road.  Workhouse kids, looking miserable and
      cold, in their Workhouse rags.  All glum and servile. 
      Some as young as possible, some OLDER BOYS at the front,
      trudging along, holding lanterns.  A formal procession.

      Some bystanders bemused, laughing.

                                    LAD
                    Nice night for it, sir!

                    Hazel Street Workhouse.  Maybe
                    he's taking them to prayers.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Ohh, nothing as holy as that.

      Because Mr Cole is passing by.  And the Doctor sees:

      His ear-piece, light blinking.  The Doctor runs to join
      him, then trots alongside him...

      He's getting out the sonic.  But he hears a hisss...

      Looks up -

      On the rooftops, a good distance away, a CYBERSHADE.  Not
      attacking, just ready to, staring down, twitching.

      The Doctor stops, lets the procession carry on, passing
      by, as Rosita runs up to him.

                    They're on guard.  Can't risk a

      TWO CYBERMEN.  They step out to stand guard, either side

                    Oh, you'll see.  Very soon now,
                    the whole Empire will see.  And
                    they will bow down, in worship.

                  The

                    a woman of this world have?

                    Hartigan.  And yes, it's the perfect
                    day for a birth, with a new message
                    for the people.  But this time, it
                    won't be the words of a man.

                    That stronghold.  Down by the river. 
                    I need to find away in.

                    I'm ahead of you!  My wife and I
                    were moving to London so that I
                    could take a post at the University.

      to...  THE HEAD OF THE CYBERKING, its BODY below
        disappearing into the depths, though it's so big, it's
      still not seen in full; it should be hard to work out
      exactly what it is.  On her level, from this side of the
      gangway, all Miss Hartigan can see, across from her, is a
      huge, metal shape, in Cyber-Victorian-steampunk design,
      which has, inlaid at the centre, a PRAC BUILD THRONE.

      CLOSER on the THRONE, ie, the real, set-build-throne.  A
      CHAIR, like an antique electric chair, wires running out
      of it into the metal cogs-and-wires walls.  CYBERMEN stand
      to attention, either side of the chair, on guard.

                    is not intended for me.  My function

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    They want us.  That's what Cybermen
                    are, Human beings, with their brains
                    put into metal shells.  They want

                    Correct.

      The Helmet is right above her; not covering her face, the
      top resting like a metal coronet above, the ear-handles in
      place, and now -

      SCHUNK!  The handles clamp around her head (the prongs are
      going in through her ears; not too close on that).

      realising that, at times like this, the Doctor does not.

      Hold; then the Doctor turns, runs away.

      Silence.  Then:

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    That offer of Christmas dinner. 
                                                          Tale
                    It's not a request.  It's a demand!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...in memory of those we have lost.
                          (pause; big smile)
                    Ohh, go on then!

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    Really?!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                                  Writer's 
                    Just this once.  You've actually
                    gone and changed my mind - and not
                    many people can do that!  Jackson,*
                    if anyone had to be the Doctor,*
                    I'm glad it was you.*
                  The 
                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    And I'm glad it's you!  The best! *
                    The one, and the only! *

                                    THE DOCTOR*
                    Oh yes!*

                                      JACKSON LAKE*
                    The feast is waiting, come sir,*
                    walk with me!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                      I certainly will!  Merry Christmas
                    to you, Jackson.

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    Merry Christmas indeed, Doctor!

      And the Doctor joins him, claps his arm around Jackson's
      shoulder, as both turn away. 

      The carol soars up to full volume, and the snow tumbles
      down, as both men walk away, together.
