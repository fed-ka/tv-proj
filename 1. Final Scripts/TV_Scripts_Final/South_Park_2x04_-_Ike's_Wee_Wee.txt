               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

               Mr. Garrison stands in front of the chalkboard. It reads 
               "Drugs are Bad". The students are in their seats.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, children, let's take our seats. 
                         This morning we're going to have a 
                         special lecture from your school 
                         counselor, Mr. Mackey.

               The counselor steps in front of Mr. Garrison.

                         Now, now who was that? That is not 
                         appropriate behavior. Okay?

                         happen again.

                         Mackey, Okay?

               The boys laugh merrily.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay, Okay that's fine.

                         Okay?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay. Now, uh, as your counselor, 
                         I'm here to tell you about drugs and 
                         alcohol and why they are bad, okay?

               The kids just sit there and blink.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         So, first of all... Smokin's bad... 
                         You shouldn't smoke. And uh, alcohol 
                         is bad, you shouldn't drink alcohol. 
                         And as for drugs, well, drugs are 
                         bad you shouldn't do drugs. Okay, 
                         that about wraps up my introduction, 
                         now are there any questions? Yes, 
                         Stan?

                                     STAN
                         Why do dogs have cold noses?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh... I'm not sure.

                                     STAN
                         Oh.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Now, uh, let's focus our discussion 
                         first on Marijuana. Marijuana is 
                         bad. And it also has a very distinct 
                         smell, Okay? I'm going to pass around 
                         just a little tiny bit, and I want 
                         you all to take a smell, so you know 
                         when someone is smokin' Marijuana 
                         near you.

               He hands a small tray with a bud of pot on it to the first 
               kid on the end. (Pip). Pip smells it, grimaces, then passes 
               it on.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay, Just take a smell, pass it on, 
                         and when it gets back up to me, we'll 
                         finish talking about it. In the 
                         meantime, I want to get into alcohol 
                         a little... Okay, Uh, alcohol is 
                         bad... If you drink alcohol...

               As the counselor AD LIBs the rest of his speech, the boys 
               whisper to each other.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's

                         ...and so that's why alcohol is bad.

                         here yet?

                         children, LSD is bad. it's a drug 
                         made famous by John Lennon and Paul 
                         McCartney...

               INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

               Principal Victoria is sitting at her desk with a stern look 
               on her face, and her hands folded.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         I am VERY disappointed in you young 
                         man... You should be ashamed of 
                         yourself! What could have possessed 
                         you to be so stupid?

               Now we see who's sitting opposite the Principal: Mr. Mackey.

                         Well, sorry isn't going to cut the 
                         cheese, this time, mister. I'm afraid 
                         I'm going to have to suspend you 
                         from school.

                         You mean I'm fired?

                         Well, I guess that's the grown up 
                         way to put it, yes.

                         But it was an honest error of 
                         judgement, okay? I really thought it 
                         was important for the kids to know 
                         the smell of marijuana so that --

                         It was an error of judgement, Mr. 
                         Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let 
                         you go for it. We searched each one 
                         of those kids but came up empty. We 
                         had to let them go home, and one of 
                         them now has half a lid of Jamaican 
                         grass because of you.

                         How am I going to make ends meet, 
                         okay? What will I do for money?

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         There, there now, maybe this will 
                         all blow over someday and we can 
                         give you a job as a janitor cleaning 
                         up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.

                         Children, I heard about what happened 
                         at school today. Now... none of YOU 
                         took that nasty marijuana, did you?

                         you do drugs, you're a hippy, and 
                         hippies suck!

                         Look, children, this is all I'm going 
                         to say about drugs... Stay AWAY from 
                         them. There's a time and a place for 
                         everything -- and it's called college. 
                         Do you understand?

               Chef starts to walk away.

                         Oh hell no. I can't bear to see that.

                         They're going to circumcise him.

                                     CARTMAN

                         that is more sacred to a man than 
                         anything else in the world?

                                     CHEF

                         about the most important part of a 
                         man's body.

               The boys look confused.

                                     KYLE

               Finally, Kenny gets it --

                         to call it a penis Kenny! You're 
                         supposed to call it a fireman.

                         That's the proper way to say it. Or 
                         else you get a spanking.

                         this stuff to you. Ask your parents 
                         for once!

               Chef drives away.

                         Hey! Wait!

               The boys just stand there for a while.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, something tells me this Bris 
                         thing isn't good.

               EXT. BAR - DAY

               The counselor is walking alone down the desolate Avenue De 
               Los Mexicanos. His head is down, is hands in his pockets, as 
               snow gently falls around him. Just then a car drives by with 
               two parents in the car.

                                     PARENT
                         HEY, MACKEY! YOU GOT ANY MORE POT? 
                         MY FOUR YEAR OLD NEEDS A FIX!!

               The parents laugh and drive away. Mackey lowers his head, 
               but another car pulls up.

                                     PARENT #2
                         HEY, MACKEY! NOW WE SEE WHAT YOU AND 
                         HOMER SIMPSON HAVE IN COMMON... 
                         DOPE!!!

               The parents laugh hysterically. Mackey cowers. Another car 
               pulls up.

                                     PARENT #3
                         Hey, MACKEY!!

               Mackey looks up to see a FULL STREAM OF CARS, hundreds of 
               them, all waiting in line to pull up and insult the counselor, 
               BEEPING their horns and YELLING.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         UGH!!!

               Mackey takes off into a building.

               TILT UP to reveal that it is the South Park bar.

               INT. SOUTH PARK BREW PUB

               Mackey hops over to the bar and sits down.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey, I don't think I've seen you 
                         around here, before.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         No, I just, I had to get away. 
                         Okay?... I just lost my job...

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh, that's weak man. You know what 
                         you need? You need a good stiff drink.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, I don't drink. Okay?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Trust me, man, it'll make you feel 
                         better.

               The bartender pushes a beer in front of Mr. Mackey.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh... Drinkin's bad...

               Mackey looks at the glass... A deep, thinking gaze... Just 
               then, a little devil Mr. Mackey appears next to the 
               counselor's head.

                                     DEVIL MACKEY
                         Go ahead... Drink the beer! It'll 
                         calm you down.

               Then, a little angel Mr. Mackey pops up on the other side.

                                     ANGEL MACKEY
                         Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a 
                         beer. Don't be such a pussy. Okay?

               Mackey reaches out, takes the beer, and gulps down a large 
               sip very quickly.

                                     BARTENDER
                         How do you feel?

               The counselor belches.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         About the same.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh, you just need something a little 
                         stronger...

               The bartender pulls out a large bottle of scotch.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK

               Kyle, Cartman and Kenny are outside building a snow castle.

               Suddenly, Stan comes running up.

                                     STAN

                         It's called a circumstition!

                         They said all Jewish boys have 
                         circumstitions, and they make it 
                         into a party called a Bris!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Dude! You... You don't just CHOP off

               Kyle runs towards his house. The boys follow.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

               Mackey walks down the lonely street, drunk off his ass.

                                     COUNSELOR

                         heartache we stand... Okay? No 
                         promises, no demands.

               Mackey stumbles up to a house, and tries the key, but the 
               key doesn't fit.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Is this my house?

                                     HOMEOWNER
                         YOUR KEY AIN'T GONNA WORK, MACKEY! I 
                         changed the locks!

               Mackey turns to see the elderly homeowner, who has a stern 
               look on his face.

                                     COUNSELOR

                         I'm not renting to you anymore! I 
                         heard you got fired from your job 
                         for selling drugs to children!

                                     COUNSELOR

                         that.

                                     HOMEOWNER
                         DRUGS ARE AN ILLEGAL NARCOTIC! AND 
                         HAVING NEVER TAKEN DRUGS, I CAN SAY 
                         THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER!

                                     HOMEOWNER
                         I'VE never taken drugs and look at 
                         me! I'm totally FINE!! Now get off 
                         my property before I lose control 
                         and KILL YOU!!!

               The homeowner picks up a rock, and hurls it at Mackey. The 
               rock hits him in the head.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         OW!! Okay?

               The counselor falls to the ground.

                                     HOMEOWNER
                         DRUG USER!! DRUG USER!!!

               The counselor picks himself up and runs away to avoid more 
               rocks which fly at him.

                         Mom, dad... What EXACTLY is this 
                         party for?

               Kyle's mom and dad look at each other.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         To celebrate your little brother's 
                         passage into life.

                         Meaning what?

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Meaning we're going to circumcise 
                         him.

                         It's Jewish tradition, boobie.

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Normally we do it right after the 
                         baby is born. But we had to do it 
                         later for Ike because he's a --

                                     KYLE
                         Aaahhhhh

               Kyle runs into his room.

               Stan, Cartman and Kenny are left alone with the parents.

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, 
                         will you go talk to him?

               The boys start to shake. From Stan's POV the parents mutate 
               into horrible monsters. They have huge, metallic claws for 
               hands.

                                     KYLE'S PARENTS
                         LET US CUT OFF YOUR PEE-PEE STAN!!!

                                     STAN
                         Aagh!!!

               Stan runs away too. The parents, who of course are just their 
               normal selves, look at each other with puzzled faces.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Oi, What is the matter with them?

               INT. KYLE'S ROOM

                                     KYLE
                         I can't believe my parents are 
                         cannibals!

                                     STAN
                         What are you gonna do, dude?

                                     KYLE
                         I have to save my little brother! I 
                         have to send him away until my parents 
                         come to their senses!

               Kyle opens his window and steps outside.

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, Ike!

                         Cover me for a while, I'll find a 
                         place to hide him and come back!

                                     CARTMAN
                         No way, dude! We're not staying alone 
                         in your house with your wee-wee 
                         chopping parents!!

                                     KYLE
                         Just give me thirty minutes! Come 
                         on, IKE!

               Kyle and Ike run off into the night. The boys swallow hard 
               and look scared.

               EXT. ALLEY - SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

               The counselor is curled up covered in newspaper trying to 
               sleep.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh... I can't sleep it's too cold. 
                         Okay?

               Suddenly, another bum pops up.

                                     BUM
                         Hey, you want something to warm you 
                         up?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, I didn't know this dark alley 
                         was taken...

                         Here, try this, it'll warm you up.

               The bum hands the counselor a joint.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh... Marijuana's bad.

                         What?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Marijuana makes you feel depressed 
                         and low. Okay?

                                     BUM
                         And you don't feel that way now?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Good point.

               The counselor grabs the joint and takes a huge drag.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Hmm... I don't feel any diff --

                         Uh huh.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Man, this alley is cool! It's so 
                         alive and beautiful.

               Kyle walks away.

               But as he passes the train, he notices an open door. Kyle 
               looks around to see if anybody is watching.

               Mackey is walking around in the woods, looking haggard and 
               beaten.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh man, where am I?

               A couple long haired hippies walk up to Mr. Mackey.

                                     HIPPIE
                         Hey wow, it's that counselor from 
                         elementary school, Mr. Mackey.

                         Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked 
                         out of town for doing drugs.

                                     HIPPIE

                         Yeah, remember you caught us smokin' 
                         weed in the bathroom and got us 
                         suspended.

                                     HIPPIE
                         Oh cheer up, bro, all you need is 
                         some clear liquid to get your head 
                         straight.

               The hippie hands the counselor some clear liquid.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh, boys, LSD is bad.

               Mackey quickly drops the acid.

                              (echoing)

                         in my mouth?

               Mackey's head starts to inflate like a giant balloon.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Yeah, baby. The world is so small.

               Mackey's head detaches from his body and starts to float 
               away delicately.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I'm Free... I'm Free...

               Just then, a large dog (The big mean one from Big Gay Al's) 
               comes up to the dummy and starts sniffing at it.

                         Dude, what did you make that doll 
                         out of?

                                     KYLE
                         I used a bunch of bones from the 
                         butcher shop.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Is that why it stinks so bad?

               Just then, the great balloon head of Mr. Mackey floats through 
               frame.

                                     KYLE
                         Yes.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay, I'm just gonna go over here 
                         for a while...

               Mr. Mackey floats on through.

                                     KYLE
                         Anyways, I need you guys to help me 
                         so that my parents don't realize Ike 
                         is gone.

               The dog again tries to bite into the doll.

                                     KYLE
                         Knock it off, asshole!

                                     CARTMAN
                         No way! I'm NEVER going back to your 
                         parents house!

                                     STAN
                         Come on dude, if it were YOUR little 
                         brother we'd help you!

               The boys start to walk away. Just when they're all about out 
               of frame.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Wait a minute! No you wouldn't!!

               EXT. NEBRASKA TRAIN STATION

               The train comes to a stop. Ike gets tossed out. Ike just 
               stands there looking around.

               Finally, a conservative looking couple walks up.

                                     WOMAN
                         Would you look at that, honey? 
                         Somebody dropped off a perfectly 
                         good trash can.

               The couple walks off. Ike blinks, and then bounces off to 
               the corn fields of Nebraska.

               INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kyle walks in the door with his dummy Ike.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Boobie, where have you been?! Dinner's 
                         been ready for five minutes.

                                     KYLE
                         Sorry, mom, I just had to deal with 
                         Ike. He's being cranky.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         How is my little jelly bean?

                                     KYLE
                              (throwing his voice)
                         Baba mimi sama.
                              (his own voice)
                         I'm gonna take him to the bathroom 
                         to get washed up.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Okay, but first let mommy give you a 
                         kiss.

               The boys look worried.

                                     KYLE
                         Uh, no mom, he doesn't want you 
                         kissing him.

               Mom walks over, Kyle tries to hold the Ike doll away. Just 
               then, the huge dog runs in the door and grabs the Ike doll 
               with his sharp teeth.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         AAGHGH!!

               In a split second, the dog rips the dummy Ike from Kyle's 
               grasp and starts shaking it violently around the room.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         OH MY GOD MAKE IT STOP!!

                                     KYLE
                         PUT IT DOWN YOU STUPID DOG!!

               But the dog tears the doll to shreds. Then runs outside with 
               it, and eats it in the road.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         MY BABY, OH GOD THE HORROR!!!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Get out of here you mutt. Let him 
                         go.

               Finally, a gas truck slams on its brakes, slams into the dog 
               and bursts into flames.

               Kyle's mother hides her head in Gerald's chest.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                              (weeping)
                         Oh he's dead! He's dead! My little 
                         boobala's dead!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         There, there, Sheila. There's nothing 
                         we can do.

               Kyle's father breaks out crying as well.

               Kyle just stands there, looking nervous.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               A small coffin is lowered into the ground. Everyone is dressed 
               in black.

               Kyle and Stan peer down into the large hole as the coffin 
               settles on the ground.

                                     PRIEST
                         Yea... Usher us unto the Lord sayeth 
                         some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes 
                         dust to dust.

               The priest throws some crap into the grave. A bagpipe player 
               starts to play 'Hava negila', horribly.

               Everybody starts walking away.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey wait a minute, how come Ike's 
                         tombstone has a Canadian flag on it?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Well Boobie, there's something you 
                         have to know. Ike wasn't really your 
                         brother. He was adopted.

                                     KYLE
                         WHAT?!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         He was not really a Broflovski. He 
                         was Canadian. But we loved him all 
                         the same.

                                     KYLE
                         You mean to tell me that all this 
                         time I've been trying to protect Ike 
                         from having his fireman cut off and 
                         he's not even my real brother?!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         What are you talking about?

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in 
                         Nebraska.

               Kyle storms off with a pissed off look.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         What what what?!?!

                                     STAN
                         Dude, you shouldn't have told them 
                         that. Now they're gonna find him and 
                         cut off his penis.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh, who the hell cares. He's not 
                         even my responsibility.

               Kenny walks into an open grave and a tombstone falls on him 
               killing him.

                                     STAN
                         Oh my God they killed Kenny!

                                     KYLE
                         You bastards.

               The crowd gathers around the open grave.

                                     PRIEST
                         Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. 
                         Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

               The counselor, now wearing some cool clothes and beads walks 
               down Avenue De Los Mexicanos.

               He passes Jimbo and Ned.

               Kyle gets off the train along with his mother and father.

                         you're gonna be grounded for a month!

               The mother and father start looking around. Under benches 
               and inside mail boxes.

                                     KYLE

                         Kyle, just because Ike is adopted

               Kyle and his mom and dad walk into the crappy old bar and 
               look around.

               They see a few truckers, drinking and listening to a slow 
               country song.

               PAN along the room, slowly. It's pretty dead, nothing 
               unusual... Then the PAN does a double take --

               There's Ike. Holding up a table with his head. Somebody has 
               chosen to use him as a table post. Ike blinks, happily.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         IKE!!!

               Kyle's mother runs to him, takes the table off his head and 
               embraces him.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey lady! That's my table post! You 
                         can't have that!

               EXT. SOUTH PARK

               The sun sets.

               EXT. SOMEBODY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mr. Mackey is lying naked (except for his tie) next to the 
               hippie girl. Both of them are staring up at the ceiling.

               Fingerpaints are all over the place.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Wow, man... You know it's like... 
                         You go through life thinking that 
                         you're an individual, Okay? and then 
                         you realize you're more than that. 
                         We're all just one big individual. 
                         Okay?

               They just sit there for a few moments.

                         Okay.

               The counselor finally removes his tie. His head actually 
               balloons down to an almost normal shape.

               Kyle walks into his room and slams the door. Ike looks sad.

               EXT. INDIA - DAY

               Mr. Mackey is hiking up a beautiful mountain that overlooks 
               the entire country. Ravi Shankar music plays in the 
               background.

                                     HIPPIE WOMAN
                         Wow, this is so beautiful.

               A white bird flies down and lands on Mackey's shoulder.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I am one with the animals. And the

                         start a new....

               Suddenly a group of five men, the "A-Team", jump Mackey and 
               start beating the shit out of him.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         OW! HEY!

               The men throw Mackey into the A-Team van and speed away, 
               leaving the hippie girl all alone.

                         Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure

               EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

               A large banner is strung outside the house it says 'Welcome 
               to Ike's Funeral'. But 'funeral' is crossed out and BRIS is 
               written in its place.

               A few cars pull up, and people are getting out with presents.

               INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

               The party has started. Several people are conversing and 
               drinking merrily.

               Kyle's mother and father are standing by the door, welcoming 
               guests.

               A man and woman walk in, bearing Bris gifts.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for 
                         coming to Ike's Bris!

                         Oh, oh.

               Another man walks in.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Look, Ike! It's your Uncle Murray!

                                     UNCLE MURRAY
                         Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         He's been sent to his room for being 
                         a bastard. He's decided that Ike 
                         isn't his brother, since he's adopted.

               Ike looks sad, and bounces off towards Kyle's room. Another 
               guest walks in.

                                     GUY
                         Hi there!

                         Hello... Do I know you?

                                     GUY
                         Oh no, but I never miss a Bris! Here, 
                         I brought some dip.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Oh... Thanks.

               INT. KYLE'S ROOM

               Kyle is pouting on his bed. Stan and Cartman are on the floor.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well... I guess the chopping is about 
                         to commence.

               Just then, Ike comes running in, holding a photo album.

                                     IKE
                         A baba simi mama!

                         A baba simi

               Ike hands Kyle the photo album, and opens it up to a page 
               with a picture of a younger Kyle, with a younger Ike. Kyle 
               is holding Ike in his arms.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh no you don't... That isn't gonna 
                         work on me, Canadian!

                                     STAN
                         Maybe you're being too hard on him, 
                         dude.

                                     KYLE
                         No way. There's no real connection 
                         between us. It was all a big lie.

               Ike turns the page and points to more pictures. Then Kyle 
               looks up and sees that Ike has put on a green Kyle hat.

                                     IKE
                         Cookie monter!

                         Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through 
                         getting in trouble for you!

               Ike sadly bounces away.

               Kyle looks again at the picture in the photo album, and 
               actually looks sad himself.

                         Hello, doctor Schwartz! Thank you so 
                         much for coming all this way to 
                         perform Ike's Bris.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought 
                         the normal cutting device...

               Doctor Schwartz holds up a metal tool.

                         ...But then I remembered that Ike 
                         was Canadian. So I brought the right 
                         one.

               Doctor Schwartz holds up a completely different looking 
               device.

                         Kyle... Protect me.

               Kyle looks almost like he wants to cry. MUSIC SWELLS. Ike 
               wraps his little arms around Kyle's neck. Kyle is shocked.

               Just then, Kyle's door opens and the doctor walks in holding 
               his metal tool.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         There you are. Come on, Ike. It's 
                         time. Kyle stands, Ike is still 
                         holding onto him.

                                     KYLE
                         YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY LITTLE 
                         BROTHER!!!

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         But son, I just --

                                     KYLE
                         You aren't going to cut off his wee-
                         wee. Not today you sick ass weirdo!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Kyle, what are you talking about?

                                     KYLE
                         AND YOU! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF 
                         YOURSELF! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
                         US MALES ARE DEFINED BY OUR FIREMEN?!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes, the fireman is very magical. If 
                         you rub his helmet he spits in your 
                         eye.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         Kyle... A circumcision is very common 
                         thing for Ike to have. His father 
                         had it... His grandfather had it... 
                         And... his BROTHER had it.

               Kyle's eyes grow wide.

                                     KYLE
                         No... No, it isn't true!

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         We're not going to cut it off. We're 
                         just going to snip it, so that it 
                         looks bigger.

                                     STAN
                         Oh... Hey that doesn't sound like a 
                         bad idea.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, I wanna get a circumstition 
                         too!

               Kyle thinks.

               EXT. BETTY FORD CLINIC

               Mr. Mackey looks like his old self as he is led out the 
               clinic's door.

                                     SOCIAL WORKER
                         Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are 
                         fully recovered.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I can't thank you enough for 
                         everything, okay. I feel like my old 
                         self again.

                                     SOCIAL WORKER
                         Just one more thing...

               She takes Mackey's tie and puts it around his neck. She 
               tightens it so tight that his head goes back to the odd shape 
               it always was.

                                     SOCIAL WORKER
                         Remember that you CAN stay sober!

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I will, Ms. Social Worker, I will! 
                         Okay?

               INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Everybody is gathered around Ike and the Doctor in a big 
               circle with wide eyed anticipation.

                                     KYLE
                         It's okay, Ike. I'm here.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         And a one, and a two and a... BRIS! 
                         SNIP!

                                     IKE
                         ABA BABA!!

               Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny all pass out.

               The small crowd does a cocktail clap and then immediately 
               starts dispersing and conversing.

               Ike hobbles over to Kyle.

                                     IKE
                         Baba ama mama.

               Kyle wakes up.

                                     KYLE
                         Ike... You're okay.

               The boys all get up.

                                     STAN
                         Wow, dude. I guess having a Bris 
                         isn't all that bad.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, you know I've learned something 
                         today. Family isn't about who's blood 
                         you have. It's about who you care 
                         about.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah.

                                     KYLE
                         And that's why I feel like you guys 
                         are more than just friends. You're 
                         my family.

               Everybody smiles and starts to wonder off.

                                     KYLE
                         Except for Cartman.

                                     STAN
                         Naturally.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Screw you guys! I don't WANT to be 
                         in your penis chopping family anyway!

               Mr. Mackey walks up to the front looking like his old self.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay, kids, you shouldn't do drugs. 
                         Okay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was 
                         at the bottom of the barrel. I was a 
                         wreck.

               The kids stare on, wide-eyed.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Why, I didn't even care about 
                         money....

               Garrison shakes his head.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I was wasting my life, hiking in the

                         You can't have your Bris tomorrow 
                         Cartman. That's when I'm having mine.

                                     CARTMAN
