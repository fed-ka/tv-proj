      A distinctive building.  A sign over the door announces THE
      DELIO GROUP.

      The streets are empty.  A limo pulls up to the entrance. 
      THE DRIVER (BOBBY), a linebacker squeezed into a suit, gets
      out and opens the back door for DOMINIC DELIO, a ruthless
      businessman in a Sulka tie.

                                      BOBBY
                    First one here again today, Mr. DeLio.

      DeLio barely acknowledges him, Bobby rushes to get the
      building door for him.


      Blues music wafting out.


      A giant warehouse.


      As Johnny slaloms down the concrete, reaches a door, stomps
      his board, flipping it up into his hands -- and keys open
      his padlock.  He disappears inside.


      As MacLeod locks the door, he gets the BUZZ.  He looks around,
      alert -- coming from somewhere in the storage facility.  He
      lowers the TOOLBOX, and heads toward it.


      MacLeod domes down an aisle, moving warily his hand on his
      sword.  The BUZZ growing stronger.  He rounds a corner, and
      comes face to face with --

      JOHNNY

      They stare at each other a BEAT, in recognition.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Well, whaddaya know.  Duncan MacLeod.

                    Surprised to see me alive, MacLeod?

                                      MACLEOD
                    A little.

      MacLeod smiles in acknowledgement and OFF this --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      A BRICK STOREFRONT, the sign on the wall proclaiming  PUCCINI
        APPRECIATION SOCIETY".

                                      JIMMY (O.S.)
                    I got ten, says my luck's gonna
                    change.


      Johnny cruises down the street, carrying a brown bag.

      Jimmy steps from Gino's storefront, scowling, takes a pack
      of cigarettes out.

      Johnny sees him, ducks into a stoop.  He hasn't exactly made
      pals with this guy.  Down the street --

      A FORD PHAETON approaches, driven by TOMMY, a squash-nosed
      pug.

      Jimmy lifts the smoke, thumb-nailing a match with his other
      hand.  He sucks in smoke, looks up just as --

      THE CAR

      passes.  Windows go down,  black barrels of MACHINE GUNS
      slide out of the windows and SPURT FIRE, raking Jimmy.

      JIMMY

      bounces against the wall, clutching smoke and matches, body
      jerking with the hits, he's a spastic marionette.

      RESUME JOHNNY

      hidden in the doorway, staring as the cat speeds away.  He
      has a clear view of the driver: TOMMY.  Johnny steps from
      the stoop, stares down at Jimmy.  A low whistle.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Boy, are you dead.

      And OFF this --


      A sheet over Jimmy's body.  The poker players and MacLeod
      hover over him, looking grim.  Two COPS have Johnny pinned
      to the wall.  One is O'GRADY.

                                      O'GRADY
                    Don't lie to me, punk.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I told ya, I was takin' a leak, I
                    had my back turned!  There some kinda
                    law about takin' a leak?

      O'Grady slaps Johnny hard across the mouth.  A slim trickle
      of blood flows.

                                      O'GRADY
                    If I say there is.

      MacLeod steps in, placating, puts a hand on Johnny.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Easy, officer.
                          (beat)
                    Why don't you give him some time to
                    think about it.  Maybe something
                    will come to him.

      O'Grady eyes MacLeod, then turns to the kid.

                                      O'GRADY
                    I want to hear from you... soon.

      O'Grady and Malone move off, as well as the poker players. 
      MacLeod stays with Johnny, pulls him aside.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why'd you lie to the cops, Johnny? 
                    You saw the killer.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Maybe I did, maybe I didn t.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Whoever iced Jimmy will know they
                    were talking to you.

                                      JOHNNY

                          (pointing to his mouth)
                    This yap stays closed.  The big

                    It doesn't have to be that way for

                    What are you, a priest or something?

      He starts away.  MacLeod puts a hand on his arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm trying to help you.

                    You wanna help?

      He shoves the brown bag into MacLeod's hand.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Give this to Gino.  Compliments of
                    Johnny K.  Tell 'im I quit.

      He pushes off.  MacLeod watches him go, shaking his head.


      Johnny knocks loudly on the door.  The WINDOW SLOT opens to
      reveal a smash-nosed face: TOMMY.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Tell Mr. Luca that Johnny K wants to
                    see him.

                                      TOMMY
                    Get lost, pipsqueak.

      Tommy makes a face -- friggin' pipsqueak -- the window slot
      slams shut.  Johnny bangs on it.

                    He's gonna want to talk to me about
                    what happened outside Gino's today.

      A BEAT -- the door opens.  Tommy towers menacingly over
      Johnny.

                                      TOMMY
                    Nothing happened.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah, right.  And you were driving
                    when it didn't.

      Tommy grabs Johnny, lifts him right off the ground.  Johnny's
      scared but he doesn't back down.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Leggo the threads.

      Tommy holds his eyes, a BEAT, impassive.

                                      TOMMY
                    You're right.  I think Mr. Luca's
                    gonna wanna see you.
                          (beat)
                    C'mon.

      Johnny looks triumphant as Tommy puts his arm around him,
      draws him outside, around the corner.


      The FORD PHAETON drives along the street.  It slows, a door
      opens -- a BODY tumbles out onto the pavement.  It's JOHNNY. 
      The Phaeton squeals off into the night.


      MacLeod searches the street, looking for the source of the
      BUZZ he's getting.  Then he spots, behind some garbage and
      boxes --

      JOHNNY, lying dead in the gutter, a wound in his belly. 
      MacLeod lifts his head up.

      A moment later, Johnny coughs back to life for the first
      time.  Disoriented and groggy at first -- then growing angry.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Leggo...!  That friggin' Luca -- he
                    shot me!  Tried to kill me!

                    He did more than try.

      Johnny feels his belly.  No more pain.  Baffled.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What gives?  He shot me, right here! 
                    I felt it!

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know.

      Johnny stares at him, freaked, scrambles to his feet.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You know what?!  What the hell's

                          (shaking his head)
                    I'm glad to see you're doing okay.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah, you always were a real Father
                    Flanagan.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I watched some pirate movies.
                          (beat)
                    What I needed to know, I learned.

                          (beat)
                    Take care of yourself, Johnny.

      Johnny smiles, throws his hands wide.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Always do.

      MacLeod turns to go.

      Johnny doesn't waste a second.  The smile fades, he pulls
      the gun from his belt -- and shoots.

      MacLeod is hit.  He tumbles to the concrete, rolls painfully
      to his back.  Johnny is already standing over him with his
      sword out.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, MacLeod.  In my line of work,
                    nobody knows my face.
                          (beat)
                    And "nobody" includes you.

      He raises the sword, brings it down as --

      MACLEOD

      rolls clear, as the blade strikes the ground.

      JOHNNY

      winds up again for the death blow.  MacLeod can't even get
      to his feet.  He's done for.  SFX a truck approaching.

      Johnny freezes, looks up as --

      A RENT-A-TRUCK arrives, and two ROADIES get out: long hair,
      big, beefy, tattoos -- straight from the Meatloaf school. 
      From the truck radio, the grind of HEAVY METAL.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Your lucky day, MacLeod.
                          (beat)
                    Be seein' you.

      He slips away.  MacLeod struggles painfully over to the wall,
      tries to rise.  The ROADIES see him, come over, and help him
      to his feet.

                    Been better.

      MacLeod slumps against the wall, his wound hidden from them,
      manages a grimace.  The one with more tattoos, a Deadhead T-
      shirt, looks at him in sympathy.

                                      ROADIE

                    You said it.
                          (beat)
                    But I'll know better next time.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Betsy, looking great, waits with anticipation as Dawson gets
      out of the car, comes around to open her door.

                                      BETSY
                    Hi!  Mmmm, you smell good.

      She gives him a kiss on the cheek, then notices the cane.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                          (light)
                    What happened, hurt your knee changing
                    the beer tap?

                                      DAWSON
                    Betsy.
                          (beat)
                    I can't hurt my knee.

      She looks at him, puzzled, not getting it.  Dawson tries to
      make light of it, but doesn't succeed.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                          (a nervous smile)
                    No knees.

                                      BETSY
                    What?

      Dawson can't face her eyes.

                                      DAWSON
                    No legs either.
                          (looking at her;
                            quietly)
                    Nam.

      Betsy looks at him, at his legs -- for a moment, doesn't
      know what to say.

                                      BETSY
                    Oh my God.  Joe.  Joe, I never...
                    You never...
                          (beat)
                    Why didn't you tell me?

                                      DAWSON
                    I dunno.

                                      BETSY
                          (beat, realizing)
                    That's why you never called?  Never
                    got in touch?
                          (welling up)
                    What did you think I'd do, Joe?

      Dawson shrugs.

                                      BETSY (CONT'D)
                    I thought you'd found someone else...
                    I gave up waiting.

                                      DAWSON
                    I figured you would.
                          (beat)
                    Look, if you don't want to do
                    dinner...

      Betsy regroups quickly.  He's misjudged her.  She pulls open
      the car door, looks him in the eye.  She is still the woman
      he once loved.

                                      BETSY
                    After all these years, you think I m
                    going to let you go now?
                          (off his look)
                    I don t know about you, but I'm
                    starved.  Get your butt in the car.

      She's waiting.  Dawson holds the door as she gets in, closes
      it for her.  A relieved breath: got that over with.


      Johnny on a cell phone.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (offended)
                    I got money.  Guy in my line of work
                    doesn't like to put down roots.  No

      MACLEOD S EYES

      scanning the room, the windows.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Where are you, Johnny?

                    Read it in the funny papers.

      ANGLE - A TABLE

      and on it, a package wrapped in the Sunday cartoons.  Just
      enough warning.  MacLeod DIVES for the window -- goes through
      it.


      As MacLeod sails out through the window into the street just
      as the window behind him EXPLODES OUTWARD from the force of
      the bomb.

      MacLeod gets to his feet, brushes off glass and dirt.  His
      car is a few yards away -- and the CELL PHONE inside it is
      ringing.  He moves to it, picks up the phone.

                                      JOHNNY (on phone)
                    Good reflexes for an old guy.

                    That's good.  Wouldn't want you to
                    make it too easy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Enough, Johnny!

                                      JOHNNY
                    Says who?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Last time.  It ends now or I find
                    you.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You got it wrong, MacLeod.  I'll
                    find you.

      He hangs up.  DIAL TONE.  And OFF MacLeod's look --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      MacLeod looks out his window edgy.  The elevator gate opens,
      behind him.  Dawson enters, whistling, cheerfully.

                    was incredible.

                    I have a proposition, Johnny.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You?  What have you got that I want? 
                    Besides your head?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're a hired gun, right?  What if
                    I hire you to point it somewhere
                    else?

                                      DAWSON
                          (shocked)
                    MacLeod?!

      MacLeod gestures -- I know what I'm doing.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Maybe.
                          (beat)
                    For two hundred G's.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Too much.  One hundred.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I might consider it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Meet me at Christ Church at three.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're a smart guy, MacLeod.  You
                    know when to cut your losses.  But
                    I'm warning you, don't screw with
                    me.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I wouldn't think of it.

      He hangs up.  Dawson staring at him.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're actually gonna go through
                    with this?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You bet.
                          (beat)
                    So are you.

      And OFF Dawson's baffled look --


      Johnny storms past a WEDDING PARTY having their pictures
      taken on the front steps.  The wedding GUESTS are laughing,
      throwing rice.  Among them --

      A PHOTOGRAPHER

      dark suit, snapping pictures.  As Johnny passes, he swivels
      the camera: he's been taking pix of Johnny.  He lowers his
      camera -- it's Joe Dawson.


      A DONUT AND COFFEE CART wheels down the street.  Pushing it,
      a guy with dark curly hair, white stained uniform over a big
      belly.  Johnny K, in disguise.

      He pulls the cart close to a building, bends down and pulls
      a brown bag out of the cart.  Pulls a knock-down RIFLE from
      it.  Screws in barrel, stock, slides it between milk cartons,
      hidden from view.  Sights through it.

      POV JOHNNY - THROUGH SIGHT - TELESCOPIC MATTE

      Across the street, a large storefront with a sign: DELIO
      INSURANCE.  On the street before it, a LIMO pulls up.

      Then a man, dark suited, exits the store -- it's the man
      from Johnny's second photo: MICHAEL DELIO.

      RESUME JOHNNY

      taking aim, getting ready.  His finger on the trigger.

      RESUME SCENE

      The Driver of the limo is blocking his target.

                                                                                INTERCUT:

      JOHNNY

      ready.  As soon as the Driver moves, DeLio is dead.

      JOHNNY'S POV - TELESCOPIC MATTE - DELIO

      as the Driver moves, a perfect target.  As Johnny's about to
      shoot -- a BLUE BLUR passes in front of him.  A BUS.

      RESUME JOHNNY

      No longer looking through the sight.  Frozen, an astounded
      look on his face as he stares at --

444CONTINUED:444

      THE BUS

      Across the street.  On its side is a huge PUBLIC SERVICE AD
      with a photo: a larger-then-than life JOHNNY K with the legend
      "Have you seen this boy?"

      RESUME JOHNNY

      turning white.  He looks to the side --

      A BILLBOARD

      with the same ad.  Across the street, ANOTHER BILLBOARD.

      Johnny looking around wildly.  On a lamp post -- a POSTER of
      his face.  Frantic, furious, he RIPS the poster off.  Sees
      ANOTHER, on the side of the building.

      He grabs he cart to push it, and sees on a milk carton --
      his PICTURE!  He's so rattled he knocks his gun loose, fumbles
      to catch it.  A CUSTOMER walks up to him.  Johnny scrambles
      to hide the gun.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (screaming)
                    I'm closed!

      She backs off, like, what's his problem?

      And HOLD on Johnny's seething hate.


      From the dojo entrance, pan to the building across the street
      and up to the roof.


      The roof is flat, with a chimney, a door to the stairwell. 
      Johnny stands by the ledge, facing the dojo.  He lowers a
      LEATHER BAG, takes out a RIFLE with a NIGHT-SCOPE, and scans
      the dojo.




                                                                (CONTINUED)96504      "Glory Days"      45.      Final Shooting Script 7/29/96

      JOHNNY'S POV - TELESCOPIC MATTE - THE DOJO WINDOW

      Nothing.  Then, a quick shot -- MACLEOD'S SHADOW moves part
      way into the room, then turns and moves away.

      ON JOHNNY

      Satisfied with his view and his plan.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Sitting duck.

      He props his rifle on the ledge, peers through the scope.

      POV JOHNNY - TELESCOPIC MATTE - THE DOJO WINDOW

      Blurry and grainy, drawing into sharper focus.  Nothing. 
      Then -- MACLEOD'S SHADOW moves part way past the window --
      then back again.  Out of sight.

      RESUME JOHNNY

      Looking past his gun, pissed that he's lost his target.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (through his teeth)
                    Two seconds, you son-of-a-bitch...
                    Then you're dead.


      Johnny has had it with trying to get MacLeod in his sight. 
      He reaches into his satchel, pulls out a cell phone, punches
      numbers.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Two seconds, man.  All I need.

      Leans into the rifle as OVER we hear the phone RINGING at
      MacLeod's place.


      JOHNNY'S POV - TELESCOPIC MATTE - DOJO WINDOW

      As MACLEOD S SHADOW moves into the window and stops.

                                      MACLEOD (V.O.)
                          (over phone)
                    MacLeod here.

      JOHNNY

      as he FIRES, THREE FAST POPS.

      RESUME - DOJO WINDOW

      As the glass shatters, MacLeod spins over and down, hit every
      time.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Not any more.

      Whistling a Jolson tune, Johnny puts the gun down, opens the
      bag and takes out his sword.

                                      JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                    Now for the slice 'n' dice.

      Then -- alarm fills his face: he's feeling the BUZZ.  He
      whirls around --

      ANGLE ON STAIRWELL

      MacLeod appears, unharmed, tapping his CELL PHONE.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I lost you, Johnny.  Think we had a
                    bad connection?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I got nothin' to say to you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Fine.

      Johnny starts backing to the ledge.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You think I'm scared?  I'm not.

      MacLeod shrugs.  Immaterial whether he's scared or not.

      Johnny lunges for the rifle -- but MacLeod kicks it out of
      the way.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not this time, Johnny.

      Johnny yanks a PISTOL from his jacket -- MacLeod chops it
      out of his hand.  The pistol flies off the roof.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    With swords, Johnny.  Remember? 
                    That's how we do it.

                                      JOHNNY
                    No problem.  If it kills, I know how
                    to use it.

      Johnny grabs his sword, and with the other hand, pulls
      something from his hip pocket: a KNIFE.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're a regular Swiss-army knife.

      Johnny swings.  MacLeod parries, and they move across the
      roof, clashing swords.  Johnny's good, but not good enough. 
      He takes a swing, misses then darts behind the chimney.

      MacLeod watches for him --

      Johnny blasts out, throws the knife, charging MacLeod as he
      does.

      MACLEOD

      ducks the knife, lands a blow in Johnny's side.  Johnny
      doubles over, gasping.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    How many people you kill?  Two-hundred
                    and forty-nine, was it?
                          (harder)
                    Not any more.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Make it two-fifty.

      Johnny swings wildly -- MacLeod counters -- Johnny's sword
      clatters to the ground.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Make it two forty-nine.

      MacLeod winds up and swings.  Johnny's headless body falls
      to the ground.  MacLeod stands for the quickening.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT : TAG

      FADE IN:


      The kitchen is strewn with debris -- shattered glass, wires,
      a wig block.

      The old DRESSMAKER'S DUMMY from Dawson's locker, clothed in
      one of MacLeod's coats, is toppled on the floor, ripped by
      the bullets, with a network of LIONEL TRAIN TRACKS.

                                      DAWSON (O.S.)
                    I knew there was a reason I was saving
                    that thing.

      Dawson at the kitchen counter.  MacLeod is de-rigging the
        contraptions he used to fool Johnny.  He lifts model train
      tracks, detaches an ENGINE from the dummy stand.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                          (musing)
                    Funny.  I thought the risk was all
                    mine... Turns out I was wrong.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (turning)
                    Betsy?

                                      DAWSON
                    She's married.  Has a family.
                          (almost proud)
                    Thirty years later, and the lady's
                    still got it for me.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with a smile)
                    I think it's the beard.

      He straightens the dummy up, looks at the holes.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I can get you a new one.

                                      DAWSON
                    Not a chance.  That storage room's
                    never been so clean.

      He notices the FOOTBALL from the storage room sitting on the
      counter.  Picks it up, idly.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    What'd you need this for?

                    Go long.

      He cocks his arm back to throw it and, as MacLeod goes racing
      for the other end of the loft, vaulting the couch, the ball
      spiraling overhead, we --

                                                                          FREEZE FRAME.
