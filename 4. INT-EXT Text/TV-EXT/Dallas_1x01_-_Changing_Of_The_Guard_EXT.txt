Affronted, Christopher throws his napkin on the table, 
but before he can leave, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN IN 
TENNIS WHITES blocks his exit.  She has green-catlike 
eyes and exudes sensuality.  She seems alarmed.

Hey, Ewing, bring some capital to 
the table if you want better 
terms.  Or maybe the president can 
help with a public subsidy -- 

The men laugh.  Christopher never looks back.  

TRACKING WITH CHRISTOPHER AND THE FRENCH GIRL

She quickens her pace, animatedly talking to Christopher 
 Locker over her shoulder.  As they arrive at the Ladies 
Room, she enters.  But Christopher stops.  He regards the 
 LockerLadies  sign as he might a Border Patrol fence.  
Then he does a quick look around...what the hell...He 
enters.

CREDITS OVER - MAIN TITLES AND DALLAS THEME 

Southfork Ranch.  Two hundred thousand acres of gentle 
rises, bluffs and grassy plains, dotted with cattle and 
horses -- a vast kingdom over which the Southworths and 
Ewings have reigned for over 150 years.  

Bobby gallops toward the unscathed horizon, past gray-
green mesquite and juniper, past spring-fed stream beds. 

Finally, he slows.  He sees RANCH HANDS building fences, 
branding cattle; hears a clanging bell calling the men to 
lunch.  The men wave to Bobby.  They respect their 
patr n.  Bobby waves back.  The sights, sounds, smells of 
Southfork never fail to renew him.
