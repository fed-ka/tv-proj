
    Lois is standing alone... in a low-cut evening gown,
    superbly sexy. She's watching something on the ground below
    with bemused interest. CRASH!



    It looks like a battlefield... the orange glow of FIRES,
    destroyed CARS.  In the middle of it all -- a fatigued
    SUPERMAN is fighting a super-battle with a HUGE MAN, who's
    dressed in street fighting gear: work boots, long baggy
    shorts, a shirt with ripped sleeves.  This huge fellow is
    called... KOMBAT.  Muscles bulging, Kombat is a specimen --
    a comic book artist couldn't draw a more powerful and
    statuesque figure.


 4  A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS                                          4   

    roped off like spectators, is gathered on the street corner,
    next to a RED CAPUCCINO CART, watching the two gladiators      (X)
    with amazement. Some eat popcorn, others sip sodas, coffee.


 5  SUPERMAN                                                      5   

    bravely sets his jaw, and FLIES right at Kombat -- a BLUE
    BLUR, which RICOCHETS off Kombat's chest like a pinball,
    then CRASHES through the window of a building across the
    street.

    Kombat pulls Superman from the window and THROWS him across
    the street -- destroying a car.


 6  A MAN                                                         6   

    watching with the other onlookers, stares with awe, munching
    caramel corn.

                  Hey, that's _my_ car.  Well, I                   (X)

                  Superman?  I don't think so.  Meet
                  your replacement.

    Kombat rips open his shirt to reveal an "X" on his chest.
    It's very similar to Superman's "S".

    Superman steps weakly from the wreckage, almost collapses.
    He leans on the car for support.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  Enough.  You win.  You're the

    Superman looks sadly to Lois at her veranda, then flies off.

    smiles, then FLOATS up to --



    where Lois looks at him.

                                   LOIS
                  You beat Superman.

                                   KOMBAT
                  To a pulp.

                       Thank God!

    They come together in an embrace.

                                   LOIS
                  I was getting so sick of him.

    Kombat breaks away from the kiss, flashes Lois a killer

    Lois and Clark find themselves standing next to the ocean.

                  I just wish you'd told me                        (X)
                  before.  I mean, this is big.                    (X)

                                   CLARK
                  I didn't exactly know how to bring               (X)
                  it up.                                           (X)

                                   LOIS
                  And it puts a little more pressure               (X)
                  on a situation where there's                     (X)
                  plenty of pressure already...                    (X)

                                   CLARK
                  Lois, there's no pressure.                       (X)
                  Because I'm sure I've made the                   (X)
                  right choice.  You're the one I've               (X)

                                   LOIS
                  Well, I do.  Especially since they               (X)
                  were all practically federal                     (X)

                  be your first... non-federal                     (X)

    Suddenly a BLACK CAR BARRELS DOWN ON THEM!                     (X)

                                   LOIS

    Clark grabs Lois, tries to fly. Nothing.

                  I can't fly! Run!

    They start running, the car gaining and gaining, closer and
    closer, Lois trips and rolls out of the way.  The car          (X)
    shoots past her, staying on Clark.                             (X)

    hops up on the sidewalk -- the car jumps up on the sidewalk    (X)
    behind him -- smashing everything in its path, including a
    fire hydrant, which SPEWS WATER.


30  LOIS                                                         30(X)

    watches Clark run, starts to her feet.  A HAND helps her       (X)
    up.  It's SUPERMAN.                                            (X)

                                   LOIS
                  Thanks, Superman.
                       (double takes)
                  Superman...?!?

    Superman smiles grandly at Lois.

    is still running -- the car almost on top of him!  At the
    last possible second, Clark LEAPS in the air -- catches hold
    of a flagpole sticking out from the side of a building -
    hoisting himself up, and out of the car's path!

    The car CAREENS out of control, and comes to a SMASHING HALT
    as it SLAMS into a bus stop!

    Lois looks at Superman, then backs up in fear and runs to      (X)
    Clark.                                                         (X)

    Superman smiles, waves, then TAKES OFF.  Lois and Clark        (X)
    stare.  Then Clark unbuttons his shirt.                        (X)

                  He sounded more like Robocop than                (X)
                  me.

    Lois looks back at the capuccino cart, the woman in the red
    dress still there, the bystanders who go on with their
    business as though nothing has happened, and Lois
    understands.

    Superman, and Lois on the deserted street, standing High       (X)
    Noon-like at one end.  A long shadow slides into view from

                  Shut up.

    As she's talking, Jimmy begins to circle away from cart,       (X)
    around behind Kombat.  Lois and Superman pivot, keeping        (X)
    Kombat from seeing Jimmy.

                                   LOIS
                  Lex probably thought of you as a 
                  mistake.  And he was never very 
                  good at acknowledging mistakes.

                                   KOMBAT

                  He kept you around so he wouldn't 
                  feel too guilty but he never told 
                  anyone you were his son, did he?  
                  Never said he was proud of all the 
                  work you did for his company?  
                  Never gave you his name?  In fact, 
                  he told people you were dead!

    ... Kombat getting smaller, thinner...

                                   SUPERMAN
                  No wonder you like it in here.  You 
                  can shut all that out, pretend it 
                  never happened.

                                   LOIS
                  It _did_ happen and no matter where 
                  you run, you can't hide what you 
                  really are.

    ... finally revealing himself to be... Jaxon.  A very sad, 
    very angry boy in a big man's Kombat clothes.

    At that moment, Jimmy jumps on Jaxon's back.  Superman grabs 
    the watch off him.

    Lois clicks it.  Lois Jimmy, and Superman DISAPPEAR in a 
    FLASH.

                  No... no...
                       (looks at his wrist)
                  NOOOOO!
