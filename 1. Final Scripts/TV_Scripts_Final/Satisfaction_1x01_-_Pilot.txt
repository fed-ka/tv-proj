                    My name is Neil Truman and I have 
                    what every man in America wants...


      INT. LIVING ROOM/TRUMAN HOME - MORNING11

      NEIL Truman, 40, eating a bowl of Cheerios in his boxers and 
      a t-shirt, slips on glasses as he points a remote toward --

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    ...an 80-inch 3D TV.  I watch 
                    Sports Center on it.  That fishing 

                    show on the Discovery Channel.  And 
                      sometimes, when my wife is getting 
                    dressed, I ll sneak in, find one of 
                    those soft core movies you can get 
                    on cable 24-hours a day.

      As Neil checks to make sure the coast is clear, changes the 
      channel and finds some skin, CUT TO:


      INT. MASTER BATHROOM/TRUMAN HOME - MORNING22

      GRACE Truman, late 30s, stands at the bathroom sink in a 
      sports bra and workout pants, brushing her teeth.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Not that my wife doesn t satisfy 
                    me. She still gets mistaken for 25.  
                    Even though that s when we first 
                    met -- eighteen years ago.

      Grace steps back to consider her cleavage.  

                                  NEIL (V.O.) (cont d)
                    She s a knockout.

                    My daughter doesn t do drugs or 
                    have sex yet.  And for sixteen, 
                    that s not just a blessing these 
                    days, it s an anomaly.

      INT. MASTER BEDROOM CLOSET/TRUMAN HOME - MORNING44

      Neil stands at a tie rack thumbing through a selection that 
      could be Macy s entire fall collection.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    I m current on my mortgage, my 
                      cholesterol just dipped below 170 
                    and most nights I get eight hours 
                    of sleep.

      He selects a dark blue one, holds it up to his dress shirt.

                                  NEIL (V.O.) (cont d)
                      ...everything a reasonable man 
                    could ask for. 

      Grace exits the bathroom as --

                                  GRACE
                    The yellow one, honey.  Brings out 
                    your eyes more.

      Neil dutifully switches ties, begins to thread the yellow one 
      through his collar -- then stops, stares directly at us.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    So what the hell is wrong with me?


      INT. HEALTH CLUB - DAY55

      Drenched in sweat, Neil sprints at full speed on a treadmill.  
      Another man, LAWRENCE, his gym buddy, also 40s, does some 
      half-ass stretching nearby.

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Mid-life crisis.

                                  NEIL
                    This feels bigger.  More universal.

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Now you re losing me.

      Neil ups his pace on the treadmill.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  3.


                                  NEIL
                    You realize seventy five percent of 
                    the world is covered in water and 
                    we re running out of fish?  Fish.  
                    And the bees?  Where are they 
                    going?  Millions of  em, just 
                      disappearing.  Then you got the 
                    rain forests burning, the ice caps 
                    melting -- even the polar bears are 
                    drowning.  

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Poor bastards.

                                  NEIL
                    I m serious.  What s the point of 
                    busting your ass everyday and 
                    paying a mortgage if the world is 
                    coming to an end.

      Lawrence grabs a couple dumbbells, starts doing curls.

                                  LAWRENCE (cont d)
                    You gotta chill out, man.  2012 s 
                    over.  Nostradamus was wrong.  

                                  NEIL
                    But what s it all mean?

                                  LAWRENCE
                    What, like in a biblical sense?

                    I wasn t raised with religion...

      He turns his head sideways to scan the spines.

                      ...Figured I d look into it.  
                    Y know, get some perspective.

      We see titles like,  Christianity and You!    The Torah 
      Explained  and  A Baptist s Guide to Life.  He pauses -- 
      something s caught his eye.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    But I wanted to go outside the box.

      He selects  Zen In The Modern World,  flips through.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  4.

                    You know that the Buddha was 
                    actually a prince before he became

77INT. HEALTH CLUB - PRESENT DAY 

      Neil spots Lawrence as he struggles on a bench press.

                                  NEIL
                    Then one day, he just gave it all 
                    up.  Left his family to travel the 
                    world in search of meaning.  
                    Personal fulfillment.

      Lawrence finishes, re-racks the weight.

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Who hasn t felt that way?

      INT. UPSCALE BROKERAGE FIRM - DAY - FLASHBACK88

      Neil sits in an office overlooking a bullpen full of BROKERS 
      as he studies a monitor full of charts and ever-changing 
      stock quotes, bored.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Eighty hours a week and all I do is 
                    make the rich richer.

      BROKER outside hangs up his phone, jumps up like a halfback 
      who just broke through for a touchdown, high-fiving the other 
      men around him.

                    see in their lifetime.  And for

      Post shower.  Neil and Lawrence finish getting dressed.

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Oh, I don t know...nice house?  Two 
                    cars?  Private school?

                                  NEIL
                    Last month we helped refinance the 
                    Romanian debt.  Know what they did?  
                    Three guys in the government kept 
                    all the money, unemployment went up 
                    three percent and they raised taxes 
                    on the poor.  Am I supposed to feel 
                    good about that?

      Lawrence applies some deodorant.

                                  LAWRENCE
                    You need a change my friend.

                                  NEIL
                    I was thinking of going to 
                    carpentry school, working with my

                    He made thirty grand a year his 
                    whole life, but at least he was 
                    happy.

                                  LAWRENCE
                    He also died at fifty-eight.
                          (then)
                    I was gonna suggest Lexapro.  You

                    you right up.  Better than drinking

                    don t worry about any of that crap.

      Neil shuts his locker, grabs his gym bag.

                    I think the problem is I need to

      INT. BULLPEN/NEIL S DESK - DAY1010

      Neil thumbs through a book on his desk, ignoring the stock 
      alarms on the monitors in front of him.

      He clicks off the stock quotes on his monitor, opens up a new 
      screen.

      before it hits him in the head.  DARRYL PECK, 30s, slight 
      paunch, enters, the would-be pitcher.

                    Whaddya think?  Had some good 
                    movement on it, right?

      Neil looks ready to beat him with it.

      snaps the book shut.

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY1111

      Neil and Darryl enter a packed room of mostly MEN in suits 
      who chatter and roughhouse like frat boys at a keg party.

                                  DARRYL
                    Check it out -- we re all wearing 
                    the same tie again.

      As Neil looks down at his own tie, door opens and VICTOR 
      O CONNELL, 50s, head of the firm, enters like Patton 
      addressing his troops.

                                  VICTOR

                    They re trying to get FDA approved

                    After two people died in clinical

                    Which is good for us.  They left 
                    their current brokerage house and

      He looks directly at Neil.

                    You got kind of a gift with the gab 
                    so this should be easy.  Gonna mean 
                    a lot of money for us.  Whaddya 
                    think?  Can you close the deal?

      The room turns to Neil, waiting for a response.

                                  VICTOR (cont d) (CONT D)
                    Well don t just stand there with 
                    your dick in your hand, say 
                      something.

      Neil hesitates, considers the eager faces of everyone here. 

                                  NEIL
                    I don t what to say... because I 
                    hate this job.  None of what I do 
                    really matters.  I don t even get 
                    to see what I m actually trading on 
                    a daily basis.  It s just numbers 
                    on a screen, it s not real.

                    We re not contributing anything to 
                    the world in any meaningful way.  
                    Just hoarding money.
                          (then, to Victor)
                    And I always thought you were an 
                    asshole for making that a virtue.

      A long, awkward silence -- until Victor grins.

                                  VICTOR
                    You son of a bitch.

                    You all could learn a thing or two 
                    from this man.  Could sell ice to

                          (back to Neil)
                    Almost had me there for a minute.

                      Alright...next order of business...

      Neil sits back down, Darryl leans over.

                                  DARRYL
                    Dude, that?  Was awesome.

      INT. ENTRYWAY/TRUMAN HOME - NIGHT1212

      Neil enters, drops his briefcase.  He listens for a beat, 
      hears some guitar playing coming from:


      INT. LIVING ROOM/TRUMAN HOME - NIGHT1313

      Neil enters, sees Anika strumming her guitar, working on the 
      same melody we heard earlier, trying out some lyrics.  Neil 
      is moved -- when did she get so good?

                                  NEIL
                    That s beautiful.

      Anika looks up, wasn t aware he was standing there.

                                  ANIKA
                    It s still a little rough.

                                  NEIL
                    What s it about?

                                  ANIKA
                    ...You ll see tomorrow night.
                          (off his guilty look)
                    You forgot about the talent show, 
                    didn t you?

                                  NEIL
                    Sweetie, I have this thing I have

                    You don t need to explain it to me 
                    if it s not a new excuse.

      She stands, marches out.  Neil exhales, heads into:


      INT. KITCHEN/TRUMAN HOME - NIGHT1414

      Neil enters, finds Grace on her cell phone, pacing back and 
      forth, trying to put out a fire on the other end.

                                  GRACE
                          (into phone)
                    ...no way, Frank.  I can t get it 
                    done by then...

                    Alright, fine.  I ll make some 
                    calls, see what I can do.  But only 
                    because I love you.

      She hangs up, exhales.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    How was your day?

                    I tried to quit my job.

                    shoulda told him to go to hell.

      Neil gives her a thin smile.  Grace gives him a kiss.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)

      Neil nods.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)

      She studies him.

                                  GRACE
                    Stay here, I got you something.

      She hustles out of the room and comes back with a box, hands 
      it to Neil.  He opens it, pulls out --

                                  NEIL
                    A tie...

                                  GRACE
                    I just loved the color you had on 
                    this morning.  Made you look sexy. 
                    You can wear it to New York now.

      Neil gives her a slight smile -- she s not reading him at 
      all.  He drops the tie back in the box.

                                  NEIL
                    Thanks...
                          (then)
                    Think I m gonna go take a swim.

                                  GRACE
                    ...It s freezing outside.

      He simply exits.  Grace watches him go, uneasy.


      EXT. YARD/TRUMAN HOME - NIGHT1515

      Neil, wearing swim trunks now, walks out to the pool.  He 
      climbs onto a diving board, walks to the end as if it was the 
      plank on a pirate ship, looks down into

      THE SURFACE OF THE WATER

      We can make out a layer of leaves, sticks, gunk -- it s like 
      a dirty pond.

      Neil hops off the board, picks up a long net to scoop out 
      some of the trash.  He takes one pass over the water then 
      stops, drops the net and walks off.


      INT. MASTER BEDROOM/TRUMAN HOME - NIGHT1616

      Neil lies in bed next to Grace, stares up at the ceiling.

                                  NEIL 
                    We need a vacation.  On a beach 
                      somewhere.  Far away.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  12.


      Grace doesn t answer.  Neil turns to her... slides a hand 
      under her nightgown.  She gently moves it away.

                                  GRACE
                    I m tired now, honey.  

      He rolls back over, stares up at the ceiling again.  

                                  NEIL
                    I think we need to fire the pool 
                    guy.

      No response.  When Neil finally closes his eyes, they 
      immediately shoot open in:


      INT. AIRPORT - THE NEXT MORNING1717

      Having dozed off, Neil awakes in a sea of other MEN in suits 
      at the gate area for his flight.  A VOICE is crackling over 
      the P.A. 

                                  VOICE
                    Ladies and gentlemen, we can now 
                    begin general boarding...

      Still groggy, Neil looks over at a balding BUSINESSMAN across 
      from him who s putting on his jacket.

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Three hours late and not even a 
                     sorry for the delay.... 

      Neil blends into the sea of other PASSENGERS, everyone 
      showing signs of stress already.


      INT. AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER1818

      Neil wedges into an aisle seat, sees Businessman two rows up, 
      trying to get his air to work.  FLIGHT ATTENDANT hustles by.

                                  NEIL
                     Scuse me, is there any way to get 
                    some water before --

      She keeps going.

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Does your air work?

      Neil reaches up, gives it a twist -- nothing.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  13.

                    Ladies and gentlemen, looks like 
                    that initial delay has held us here 
                    at the gate.  Might be another hour 
                    before we can push back... 

      As groans drown out the rest of the announcement, we CUT TO:


      INT. AIRPLANE - LATER1919

      Still at the gate.  Flight Attendant hustles by once more.  
      Neil stops her.

                                  NEIL
                    Scuse me, it s really hot in here --

                    I know, sir.  And I am so sorry 
                    you re uncomfortable.

                                  NEIL
                    If we would just get some water --

      She moves off.  Neil looks at the Businessman who simply 
      mouths the word  bitch. 

      30 MINUTES LATER --

      Neil flips through the SkyMall mag for the fifth time when 
      the captain comes on the P.A.

                                    CAPTIAN (V.O.)
                    Folks, hate to say this but we re 
                    over our limit here in the 
                      cockpit...Gonna have to power down 
                    now, keep ya here while we call for 
                    another flight crew...

      Passengers start screaming.  Neil tries once more to snag the 
      Flight Attendant.

                                  NEIL
                    We re all really thirsty --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Now you re harassing me.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  14.


      Neil reaches out to calm her.

                                  NEIL
                    It s been nearly five hours --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Touch me again, I ll have you 
                    removed from this flight.
                          (moving away)
                      Asshole...

      Neil watches as Flight Attendant moves to the back of the 
      plane and grabs the mic.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT D)
                    Ladies and gentlemen, we need you 
                    to stay seated.  I promise we re

                      comfortable while we re 
                      experiencing this delay...

      Neil turns back, makes serious eye contact with the Flight 
      Attendant -- just as she takes a sip from a bottle of water.  

        Whoosshhh...All SOUND FADES OUT.  FILM SPEED SLOWS.  

      Neil turns back, overcome with a sudden sense of calm.

      He undoes his seat belt.  Rises.

      FLIGHT ATTENDANT --

      Sees him leave his seat, calls out.

      NEIL --

      Walks calmly to the front of the plane.

      FLIGHT ATTENDANT --

      Charges down the aisle after him.

      PASSENGERS --

      Take notice, start taping the scene on their cell phones.  

      NEIL --

      Reaches for the mic at the front the cabin.  He picks it up, 
      turns back and starts to deliver a sermon (though we do not 
      hear the words, just his voice over)                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  15.


                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    I don t remember what I said or
                    where the impulse came from... 

      Flight Attendant closes in.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Just that something snapped inside 
                    of me.  And I was overcome by this 
                    sense of courage... Clarity.

      Neil drops the mic, turns to the cabin door.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                      I realized: I was the one who built 
                    this prison I was in... 

      With the strength of Hercules, Neil rips open the cabin door. 

      THE EMERGENCY SLIDE --

      Unfolds like a ribbon to the ground.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    And I could break free...

      Inhaling deeply, Neil closes his eyes and jumps.  In SLOW 
      MOTION he hits the slide, glides for what seems like 
      eternity, a huge smile on his face.  

      Other Passengers appear behind him.  One by one they jump 
      down the slide like kids on a playground.  As Neil turns back 
      to take in their smiling faces... then sees SIRENS 
        approaching, we CUT TO:


      INT. TSA OFFICE - DAY2020

      Neil sits on a folding chair in small office, water bottle in 
      hand, talking to his LAWYER as a TSA OFFICER hovers just 
      outside.

                                  NEIL
                    Have you ever had that experience?

                    No.  And, as your lawyer, I want 
                    you to forget you ever said that.

                    But since they passed that 
                       Passenger s Bill of Rights  last 
                    year, you wedged your way into this

                    your ass.  Not to mention everyone 
                    on board is coming to your defense.

                                  NEIL
                    Really?

                                  LAWYER
                    They re saying the Flight Attendant 
                    attacked you.

                    She didn t  attack  me --

                    You let me handle that.  Right now 
                    you got 200 people backing you up 
                    so I d keep my mouth shut.

      He motions for Neil to stand.

                    C mon.  Let s get out of here 
                    before anyone changes their mind.

      He leads Neil out to:


      EXT. HALLWAY/TSA OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER2121

      Neil and his Lawyer exit the room.  Just before they reach 
      freedom, Neil sees the Flight Attendant in another office 
      being grilled by a TSA OFFICER.  She makes eye contact with 
      Neil just as he absently takes a sip from his water bottle.  
      As Lawyer pulls Neil away, hustles him off, CUT TO:


      EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY2222

      Establish the impressive high-rise that is Neil s firm.  


      INT. VICTOR S OFFICE - DAY2323

      Victor stands behind his desk, laying into Neil.  Darryl is 
      off to the side, fingering his baseball, enjoying this.

                    ...a no fly list?  Well I m not

                          (to Darryl)
                    Show him that thing you showed me.

      Darryl moves to Victor s computer, does a few keystrokes.

      ON SCREEN: A cell phone video of Neil rallying the Passengers 
      on the plane, ripping open the door and pulling the slide.

                                  VICTOR (cont d) (CONT D)
                    Lemme ask you: what do you think 
                    the guys at Updike are gonna say 
                    when they see this now?  Huh?  
                    Hell, any of our clients.

                                  DARRYL
                    It s embarrassing.

                                  NEIL
                    They kept us waiting almost five 
                    hours.

      Victor studies Neil for a beat then snatches a paper off his 
      desk.

                                  VICTOR
                    Our lawyers advised us to put out a 
                      statement.  You were off your 
                      medication -- diabetic dementia, 
                    some shit like that.  

      He thrusts the paper at Neil.

                                  VICTOR (cont d) (CONT D)
                    You re gonna sign this and offer a 
                    public apology on behalf of the 
                    firm.  You re also gonna take a 
                    leave of absence and agree not to 
                    talk to the press.  Then you re 
                    gonna thank me for not firing you 
                    right now.

      Neil looks at the paper, back to Victor.

                                  NEIL
                    I m not signing that.
                          (off Victor)
                    They treated us like animals.  Why 
                    should I apologize?

      Victor looks to Darryl -- is he serious?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  18.


                                  VICTOR
                          (back to Neil)
                    Do you realize what kind of trouble 
                    you re in right now?  I m giving 
                    you a gift here.  

                                  NEIL
                    Oh, I m sorry, I didn t realize it 
                    was a gift.  Lemme see that --

      He takes the paper from Victor, mock reads it -- then tears 
      it in half.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    Oops, guess I m in really big 
                    trouble now, aren t I?  But just to 
                    make sure I  close  the deal --

      Neil grabs the baseball out of Darryl s hand, hurls it at a 
      mirror on the wall -- a BIG SMASH.  He pats Darryl on the 
      back.

                                  NEIL (cont d) (CONT D)
                    Now that had some movement on it.

      As Neil exits, exhilarated, we CUT TO:


      INT. PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER2424

      WHOOSH -- Neil explodes out of the elevator like a man shot 
      from a cannon.  He rips off his tie, drops it on the ground.

      He whips out his car keys, a smile spreading across his face.  

      He jumps in his car.  

      REVS the engine.

      SQUEALS out of his parking space and fishtails for the exit.


2525INT. NEIL S CAR - DRIVING 

      Neil weaves in and out of traffic as he dials a number on his 
      cell.  There s a lightness in him we haven t seen before, a 
      glow.  As the call connects, he talks through his bluetooth.

                                  NEIL 
                    Frank... is my wife there?  I can t 
                    get her cell... yes, she mentioned 
                    that house last night...what s the

      Neil pulls over, inputs the address into his Navigation.

                                  NEIL (cont d) (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Got it, thanks.

      He hangs up, turns on the radio.  Upbeat SONG TBD plays.  
      Neil cranks it up, rocking like a teenager going to a house 
      party.  As he punches the gas, never more alive, CUT TO:


      EXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - DAY2626

      SONG CONTINUES.  Neil s car squeals around the corner on a 
      wide street in a housing development filled with model homes.

                    ...you have reached your 
                      destination...

      Neil sees Grace s car.  He swerves over and parks.


      INT. STAGED HOME - CONTINUOUS2828

      Neil enters like a linebacker on his way to picking off a 
      pass, calls out:

                                  NEIL
                    Grace...?  Babe...?  I got some 
                    great news...

      He sees her purse and cell phone on a entry table, moves into


      INT. KITCHEN/STAGED HOME - CONTINUOUS2929

      Neil enters, walks past the sliding door to the backyard and 
      glances out at the small, gated yard.  He turns back... 
      listens.  There s some KNOCKING upstairs.


      INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/STAGED HOME - DAY3030

      Neil bounds up the stairs, his mood rising with every step.

                                  NEIL
                    Babe...?

      He heads toward the Master Bedroom -- then freezes.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  20.


      NEIL S POV -- 

      Grace is holding onto the headboard as an unseen MAN is 
      taking her hard from behind.  

      They re both so engaged, they don t realize Neil is watching 
      them from the open door, dizzy from shock.

                    Grace... tell me a little bit about 
                      yourself...


      INT. OFFICE - DAY3131

      Grace stares back at us, face bright and eager.

                                  GRACE
                    Well... I m married.  Eighteen 
                    years -- we met in college.  We 
                    have a sixteen year old daughter.  
                    She s starting to look at colleges 
                    this year.  It s so crazy how fast 
                    the time goes --

                                  VOICE
                    I meant tell me why I should hire 
                    you.

                                  GRACE
                    Right, of course...

      REVEAL for the first time that she is sitting across a desk 
      from a young man (LEON), mid-twenties, hipster-cool.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Because I m an amazing designer.
                          (off Leon)
                    With a sense of humor.

      Leon gives her a thin smile, turns to a computer.

                                  LEON
                    What s your website?  So I can see 
                    some of your work.

      She reaches down for a large portfolio.

                                  GRACE
                    I brought this instead if that s 
                    okay...

      She lays it on the desk.  It s almost foreign to him.

                                  LEON
                    Wow... old-school.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  22.


      She opens it and we go

      CLOSE ON THE PAGES --

      Hand-drawn sketches of room layouts and color palettes.

      Leon turns the pages, considering the body of work.

                                  LEON (CONT D)
                    Have you never created on 
                      Micropoint before? 

                                  GRACE
                    I ve always preferred to work with 
                    my hands.  Makes me feel more 
                    connected to the process.

                                  LEON
                    They probably didn t have those 
                    programs when you went to school I 
                    bet.  That was what, twenty years 
                    ago?

                                  GRACE
                    Oh, yeah, electricity wasn t 
                    invented yet so computers weren t 
                    really around.

      She smiles, but he doesn t find her funny (again).  She turns 
      to another section, undaunted.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    This layout was part of a project I 
                    did that got me a Fullbright 
                      scholarship to study in Florence.

      Now Leon seems impressed.

                                  LEON
                      A Fullbright?  Really?  Tell me 
                    about that.  You studied in 
                    Florence?

                                  GRACE
                    Funny story, actually.  I never 
                    took the scholarship.

      Leon looks at her, confused.

                    I d just gotten pregnant when I

                    things just kinda got put on hold --                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  23.


                                  LEON
                    So you don t have any real 
                      experience since college.

      Clearly she s losing him, but Grace tries to stay positive.

                                  GRACE
                    I do stage open houses right now.

                    Mrs. Truman.  You clearly have 
                    talent.  But that is not the only 
                    thing I like to consider when I 
                    bring someone onto the team --

      He gestures to the wide-open workspace just outside his 
      office.  Young, hip PROFESSIONALS work at computer stations 
      designing room layouts and custom furniture concepts.  

                                  LEON (CONT D)
                    I have designers that come to me 
                    from all over the world.  

                                  GRACE
                    My mother was French --

                    I need people with real life 
                      experience.

      Grace looks to the faces in the office -- they re barely out 
      of college themselves.

                                  LEON (CONT D)
                    And frankly, it sounds like you ve 
                    had a pretty normal life.  

      As that lands on Grace like a cold shower we CUT TO:


      INT. SPINNING CLASS - MORNING3232

      Grace grabs a towel and a bottle of water from her gym bag as 
      she sets up on a bike next to her sister, STEPHANIE, early 
      30s, bohemian.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  24.


                                  STEPHANIE
                    Oh, my god, he actually said that?  
                      I would ve keyed his car when I 
                    left.

                                  GRACE
                    But he was right.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    About what?  He was twenty-five 
                    years old.  What does he know about 
                    life?  You ve had an amazing life.

                                  GRACE
                    No, you know what I realized?  I ve 
                    had mom s life.  She gave up her 
                    dreams to stay home and raise her 
                    kids, too.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Barely.
                          (off Grace)
                    You turned out okay.
                          (to prove her point)
                    You have a great husband, beautiful 
                    home, amazing daughter -- 

                                  GRACE
                    I know.  And I sound like some 
                    whiny bitch to even complain, but I 
                    also know why mom had a screwdriver 
                    every day at two o clock.
                          (off Stephanie)
                    I had this whole other life I was 
                    planning on living.  I considered 
                    myself an artist once.  And then I 
                    turned into... Neil s wife --

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Um, excuse me?

      Stephanie had been preparing to set up on the bike next to 
      Grace when another WOMAN swoops in to lay her claim.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    A towel on the bike means it s 
                    spoken for.

      Woman shoots her a  fuck you  glance, moves off.  Stephanie 
      flips her off with a look, turns back to Grace.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    So how are things with Neil?                                          Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  25.


                                  GRACE
                    Fine.  They re always fine.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    That mean you guys are still, 
                    y know... fine in the bedroom?
                          (off Grace)
                    What, like three times a week?

      Grace is shocked -- are you kidding?

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Once a week?
                          (off Grace)
                    Once a month?

                                  GRACE
                    You re not married.  Sex just 
                    doesn t become that important after 
                    a certain point.
                          (off Stephanie)
                    Our schedules are so different 
                    anyway, we re barely ever in the 
                    house at the same time.  And when 
                    we are, Anika s there.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    That s your excuse?
                          (off Grace)
                    Doesn t she have a driver s license 
                    now?  What s she doing home anyway?

                                  GRACE
                    I m not gonna let her drive on her 
                    own, are you crazy?
                          (off Stephanie)
                    Do you realize teenagers are the 
                    age group most prone to accidents?  
                    I saw this thing on the news the 
                    other day?  About texting behind 
                    the wheel?  They all do it.  What 
                    kind of mother would I be if I just 
                    handed her my keys and -- 

      Stephanie finally has to cut her off.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    You know what the problem is?  
                          (leans in, sotto)
                    You need to be getting laid more 
                    often.

      Grace flinches -- what?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  26.


                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Look at you, you re so wound up.  
                    You got all this tension and no 
                    release.  
                          (off Grace)
                    It s a lot cheaper than going to 
                    therapy.

      Grace wants to respond, but the SPINNING INSTRUCTOR has taken 
      his spot at the front of the class, calls out:

                                  SPINNING INSTRUCTOR
                    Alllll riiiggggtttt!  Who s ready 
                    to pump out a twenty mile ride?

      The class SCREAMS.  Spinning Instructor kills the lights and 
      a disco ball drops -- it s like a nightclub in here now.

                                  GRACE
                    How many miles would you say we ve 
                    peddled in this class?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    20 miles a session?  Four days a 
                    week for six years?  What is that?

      MUSIC BLARES.  Stephanie puts her game face on, ready to 
      roll.  As class begins but Grace remains frozen, we CUT TO:

      A CELL PHONE SCREEN --

      A FINGER taps some numbers into a calculator.

       20 x 4 = 80   A few more taps.

      80 x 52 = 4160  A few more taps.

      4160 x 6 = 24,960

                      Mom...what are you doing?


      INT. MASTER BEDROOM/TRUMAN HOME - NIGHT3333

      Grace stands in her closet, mid-way through getting dressed, 
      staring at her cell phone screen in mild shock.  Anika has 
      wandered in.

                                  ANIKA
                    I m totally running late, let s go.

                                  GRACE
                    Do you know how many miles it is 
                    around the earth?

      Anika winces -- what?

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    A little over twenty thousand.  I 
                    may have actually peddled all the 
                    way around the planet and never 
                    left the same room.  

      Anika studies her mom for a beat.

                                  ANIKA
                    Ring...
                          (to Grace)
                    Hold on, I have to get this.

      She pulls out her cell, answers the  call. 

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    Hi, crazy town?  Yes, my mom is on 
                    her way to you right now.  Just as 
                    soon as she drops me off at Jenny s 
                    so we can study for our history 
                    test.

      She hangs up, looks to Grace -- can we go now?

                                  GRACE
                    Your father s driving you.  I have 
                    book club tonight.

                                  ANIKA
                    Dad s in his force field right now.  
                    He said you have to.


      INT. HOME OFFICE/TRUMAN HOME - MOMENTS LATER3434

      Grace enters, finds Neil on his computer reviewing stacks of   
      papers like a man trying to decipher the Rosetta Stone.  
      Anika trails in behind to watch this unfold.

                                  GRACE
                    Neil?

      He holds up a hand -- lemme just finish this one part.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    I have my book club tonight.

                    When did that happen? 

      He looks up at her -- he just forgot to tell her.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    This is the one night a month I get 
                    with my friends.

                    If I don t have this done by the 
                    morning, we could lose an account.

                                  GRACE
                    It s always life or death, Neil.  
                    What about my life?

                                  NEIL
                    Do you think this is how I want to 
                    spend my evening?

      DOORBELL rings.  Grace holds on Neil for a beat then moves 
      off.  Anika looks to her dad, then walks out as --

                                  ANIKA
                    Someone has to drive me.


      INT. ENTRY WAY/TRUMAN HOME - SAME TIME3535

      Grace opens the door as a group of THREE WOMEN enter: MONICA, 
      NANCY and BETH, all around the same age, all close friends.  
      They ad-lib greetings.  Monica holds up a bottle of wine.

                                  MONICA
                    This needs to breathe.

      She moves off as the other girls move to the living room to 
      get comfy.  Neil comes marching out of his office, laptop 
      under his arm, lugging an overstuffed briefcase.

                                  NEIL
                    I ll drive her and then go into the 
                    office to finish.  I ll probably 
                    sleep there.
                          (off Grace)
                    I ll be out of your hair.

                    Okay.

      He gives her a perfunctory kiss, heads out.  Anika follows, 
      looks at her mom.

                                  ANIKA
                    Don t party too hard.

      Grace watches them go, then turns back to watch her friends 
      gathering in the living room -- so subdued. 


      INT. LIVING ROOM/TRUMAN HOME - LATER3636

      The women sip Chardonnay as they talk about the hardcover 
      book on the coffee table in front of them.

                                  NANCY
                    ...I thought the author was trying 
                    to say we should move past our 
                    fears and let go of our childhood.

                                  MONICA
                    Uh-oh... 

      She holds up the bottle of wine they had all been sharing.

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    No mas vino.  Grace?

      She turns -- she d been a million miles way.

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                          (re: the bottle)
                    I m gonna need a little more before 
                    we talk about those last few 
                    chapters.

      Grace considers her friends for a moment.

                                  GRACE
                    Let s go out.
                          (off their looks)
                    This is our one night a month to 
                    actually get together and have fun 
                    and all we do is sit and discuss 
                    what fake people are doing with 
                    their lives.  What adventures 
                    they re having.  That s pathetic, 
                    isn t it?

      She stands.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  30.


                                  GRACE (CONT D)

                    stories.  Talk about those instead.  
                    Get some... life experience.  

      A silent beat.  Then:

                                  MONICA
                    I think if we just opened another 
                    bottle --

      Grace marches out of the room, re-enters a beat later with 
      her coat on and her car keys.

                                  GRACE
                    I m driving.  Let s go.

      Off the group, trying to catch up, we PRE-LAP the sound of 
      CLUB MUSIC and smash cut to:


      INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT3737

      Packed, sweaty and full of young, uninhibited PEOPLE who are 
      dancing with abandon.

      ON THE DANCE FLOOR --

      Grace is letting loose under the pulsating lights, blending 
      into the crowd, but clearly in her own world.

      ON THE EDGE OF THE FLOOR --

      Monica, Nancy and Beth watch Grace with a mix of fascination 
      and concern, trying to make sense of how they even got here. 
      They re shouting to be heard despite the fact they re 
      standing next to each other.

                                  NANCY
                    Did you see how much she tipped the 
                    bouncer to get us in?  

      Monica scans the faces moving by.

                                  MONICA
                    I swear some of these kids have 
                    baby sat for Evan and I.

      Beth watches Grace dancing, then turns back to the group.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  31.


                                  BETH
                    You didn t catch it, but she and 
                    Neil had this thing and Neil said 
                    he was gonna sleep at the office.  
                    You think everything s alright?

                                  MONICA
                    He lives at the office, I wouldn t 
                    read into it.

                                  NANCY
                    I don t know, look at her.

      The girls all turn to watch

      GRACE --

      Dancing up a storm, lost in her experience.

      The girls look at each other, suddenly self-conscious.  

                                  MONICA
                    You know, the book did suck.

      Monica looks to Nancy and Beth, then moves out to the dance 
      floor.  Beth looks to Nancy.

                                  BETH
                    I don t have the right shoes.

      Nancy moves off.  Beth stays put.

      THE DANCE FLOOR --

      The women join up with Grace.  She s bursting at the seams, 
      smiling brighter than the lights in here.

                                  GRACE
                    I just got offered ecstasy.  Isn t 
                    that cool?

      Her spirit is contagious -- this is so much better than book 
      club.  And as the moment just seems to keep expanding, Grace 
      looks across the dance floor and makes eye-contact with

      A YOUNG, SEXY MAN --

      He locks eyes with Grace.  Monica sees it.

                                  MONICA
                      Hell-lo...

      Grace can t turn away from him.  And he won t look away from 
      her.  She finally does, refocuses on her friends.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  32.


                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    ...he s coming over.

      Grace can t bring herself to look.  But he comes right up to 
      her, drawn in like a tractor beam.

                                  MAN
                    It worked.

                                  GRACE
                          (it s so loud)
                    ...What?

                                  MAN
                    The way you were looking at me.  I 
                    couldn t resist.

      Whether she hears him or not, she s in a trance -- he s 
      gorgeous.  He finally takes her hand, leads her off toward

      THE BAR --

      A little quieter here.  

                                  MAN (CONT D)
                    What s your name?

                                  GRACE
                    ...Grace.  I m married.

                                  MAN
                      Congratulations.  

      She can t takes her eyes off him.

                                  MAN (CONT D)
                    I m Simon.  

      As he leans in a little closer, we move back to

      THE DANCE FLOOR --

      Nancy and Monica are watching this exchange -- whoa.

      BACK AT THE BAR --

      Simon moves a little closer to Grace.

                                  SIMON
                    What are you doing here tonight, 
                    Grace?                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  33.


                                  GRACE
                    Doing here... well, it s kind of a 
                    long story.

                                  SIMON
                    Tell me.  I want to hear your 
                    story.

      Grace is bumped hard from behind.

                                  GRACE
                    Hey --

      She turns and another WOMAN pushes her aside, starts berating 
      Simon.

                                  WOMAN
                    I go to the bathroom and you start 
                    picking up other women?  She looks 
                    like someone s mother for Christ s 
                    sake -- 
                          (at Grace)
                    Run along to your PTA meeting, 
                    ma am.

      ACROSS THE FLOOR --

      Nancy and Grace have rejoined Beth.  They start to head over 
      just as

      THE WOMAN --

      Shoves Grace.  This time, Grace isn t having it.  She turns 
      to the bar, grabs a drink -- and dumps it on her.  Simon 
      tries to step in between them.  Nancy, Beth and Monica rush 
      up just as the Woman lunges at Grace.  As a scuffle breaks 
      out, we CUT TO: 


      EXT. DANCE CLUB - LATER3838

      PATRONS file out to find an after party, slowing to gawk at a 
      couple of COP CARS at the curb.  Looking closer, we see Grace 
      in the back seat of one, her foe in the other.

      NANCY, BETH and MONICA --

      Huddle off to the side, waiting for the final outcome.

      A COP --

      Finishes talking to his PARTNER, then approaches the car with 
      Grace inside, opens the door.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  34.


                                  COP
                    If you re not willing to press 
                    charges, neither is she.

      Grace turns to look at her foe, then back to the Cop -- this 
      is the most fun she s had in years.

                                  GRACE
                    I ve never been in a bar fight 
                    before.
                          (off Cop)
                    You know, in college?  I used to 
                    study so much, I never went out to  
                    clubs.  I was kind of a geek.  

      Cop is completely uninterested, hands Grace a cell phone.

                                  COP
                    Evidently you dropped this during 
                    your  bar fight.   Gentlemen over 
                    there wanted me to make sure you 
                    got it back.

      Grace takes the phone, looks over to where the Cop indicates 
      and sees SIMON looking back at her.  He smiles, motions for 
      her to check her phone.  Grace looks down, sees something she 
      wasn t expecting just before --

                                  NEIL (O.S.)
                    Grace...?

      She looks up as Neil approaches.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    What the hell... are you okay?

                                  COP
                          (to Neil)
                    You re the husband?

                                  NEIL
                    What happened?

      Cop gestures for Grace to get out of the car.  

                                  COP
                    I ll let her explain.

      Neil nods his thanks to the cop, turns to wave to Monica, 
      Nancy and Beth.

                                  NEIL
                    Can you drive her car back?  I ll 
                    have her ride with me.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  35.


      They hesitate a beat before moving off.  Neil turns back to 
      Grace, his face tight.

                                  GRACE
                    You re never gonna believe this.  
                    I, me, Grace, got into a bar fight. 
                          (off Neil)
                    You re mad.  I totally get it --

                                  NEIL
                    Is this what you do at your book 
                    club when I m not around?

                                  GRACE
                    We just wanted to try something a 
                    little different.

                                  NEIL
                    Jenny s mom called me completely 
                    panicked, I had no idea where you 
                    were --

      Grace realizes -- Anffika.  Shit.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    I m gonna completely miss my 
                    deadline now -- 

                                  GRACE
                    I m sorry --

                                  NEIL
                    You almost got arrested? 

                                  GRACE
                    Okay, that woman shoved me first.

                                  NEIL
                    What woman?  What are you even 
                    doing here?

                                  GRACE
                    We just wanted to have some fun.  
                    I m still allowed to fun, aren t I?

      Neil studies her.

                                  NEIL
                    How much have you had to drink?

                                  GRACE
                    Well... I could have another...

      She leans on his shoulder.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  36.

                    We could fool around when we get 
                    home --

      He pulls away.

                                  NEIL
                    What is wrong with you?

                                  GRACE
                    Nothing.  I feel like myself.  

                                  NEIL
                    What does that mean?  I don t even 
                    know who you are right now.

                                  GRACE
                    I don t know who I ve been, Neil.  
                    And you don t even notice.  Why 
                    don t you notice me anymore?

      She s making a scene now. 

                                  NEIL
                    Can we just get in the car --?

                                  GRACE
                    No.  Dammit, Neil do you realize 
                    this is the first time we ve even 
                    seen each other outside the house

                    eat, grab a coffee -- take me on a

      He takes her arm.

                                  NEIL
                    I think I just need to get you 
                    home.

      She pushes him off.

                                  GRACE
                    Where I belong, right?

      She studies him, then marches off.  Neil holds a beat, not

      INT. MASTER BEDROOM/TRUMAN HOME - MORNING3939

      Grace s eyes shoot open and she stares up at us from the 
      bed... winces from a screaming headache.  She looks at the 
      clock.

                                  GRACE
                    Shit...


      INT. KITCHEN/TRUMAN HOME - MORNING4040

      Grace enters, moving slow.

                                  GRACE
                    Neil...?  Anika...?

      No answer.  She sees some breakfast dishes left on the 
      kitchen table then sees Neil and Anika getting into Neil s 
      car outside.  She waves, but they don t see her, hop in the 
      car and drive off.

      Grace turns back to the empty kitchen.  

      The quiet house.

      It s almost deafening.  

      She sees her cell phone on the counter.  She moves to it, 
      picks it up and searches for something (which we don t see).  
      The phone rings.  She recognizes the number, answers.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Steph... spinning?  Um...no.  
                    I think I m really done riding in

      Off Grace we CUT TO:

      A GARAGE DOOR --

      Whirring upwards, letting light into:

      EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER4242

      Grace glides by on her bike, serpentines down the open road 
      like a kid who just got their training wheels off.

      But she s not just going where ever the road takes her.  She 
      has a destination in mind.  As she looks up at a street sign, 
       Dante Circle,  makes a tight turn, we CUT TO: 


      EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY4343

      Grace turns a corner, peddles past a row of houses.  She s 
      slowing down, reading the addresses, finally stops at one 
      near the middle of the block.

      She pulls out her phone and this time we go

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN --

      There s a text.   Sorry about the club.  I just wanted to 
      know your story   Below that is an address.  It matches the 
      building in front of her.

      Grace considers the front door -- then suddenly snaps back to 
      reality -- this is crazy.  She peddles a half-turn forward, 
      stops again.  Looks back.  Visibly torn.  

      Then she gets really nervous -- could someone be watching 
      her?  She turns back down the driveway to peddle off when --

      A PORSCHE --

      Pulls up.  Grace freezes.  Simon gets out.  They stare at 
      each other.  She finally smiles.  As he approaches...

      Neil staggers out the sliding door from the kitchen, runs 
      outside and vomits.  

      When he recovers he looks back at the house, sees Grace pass 
      by an upstairs window.  Then he hears the door open out 
      front... a car alarm CHIRPS.  

      His anger coming into focus now, Neil races down the side of 
      the house and sees 

      SIMON

      Climbing into a Porsche.  He revs the engine and pulls away.

      NEIL

      Hops the fence, stumbles onto the other side. 

      He watches as Simon s car heads out of the development then 
      hops in his own car and races down

      ANOTHER STREET

      Neil s car speeds through the subdivision.*

      EXT. ANOTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS5050*

      Neil s car whips around another curve just as Simon car *
      approaches.  Neil s car slams on its brakes at the 
      intersection, forcing Simon s car to screech to a halt.

      around to the driver s side, tries to open the door as --                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  40.


                                  NEIL
                    C mere --

      It s locked.  

                                  SIMON
                    What are you doing, man --? 

      Neil tugs on it again and Simon opens it, sending Neil 
      backwards.  Simon gets out of the car.  

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    I don t know what your problem is, 
                    buddy, but you need to calm the fu--

      Neil comes back, takes a wild swing.  Simon ducks it, using 
      Neil s momentum to toss him into a body of water. 

      Neil leaps up, rushes Simon again.  This time Simon puts him 
      in a rear naked choke, cutting off his air.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Relax, okay?   

                                  NEIL
                    ...I saw you with my wife.

      Simon cocks his head -- what?

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    I just saw you and Grace at the 
                    house...I can t breathe...

      Simon lets him go, turns Neil around to get a look at him.

                                  SIMON
                    You re Grace s husband?  
                          (off Neil)
                    Shit.  You were just at the house?
                          (off Neil)
                    So you saw what we were...

      He trails off.  Neil is still trying to catch his breath.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Does she know you were there?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  41.


      Neil finally shakes his head, takes a seat on Simon s car, 
      wet and defeated.  Simon looks back toward the house, then 
      back to Neil.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Listen to me.  You can t go back 
                    there.  Don t go home either.
                          (off Neil)
                    You gotta trust me on this, okay?  
                    You need to wait.  Twenty-four 
                    hours.  Especially if you have 
                    kids.  You don t want to do 
                    anything you ll regret.

                                  NEIL
                    A little late for that today.

      Neil takes in Simon for the first time.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    You re a kid... What s your name?

      He doesn t answer.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    Where d she meet you?

                                  SIMON
                    It was a professional arrangement.
                          (off Neil)
                    Your wife pays me.

                                  NEIL
                    Pays you...?  For what?

      Simon raises an eyebrow.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    Sex?

                                  SIMON
                    Lotta times it s more than that.  
                    There s an emotional component -- 

                                  NEIL
                    How long?  You and her, how long?

                                  SIMON
                    I d have to check the books...six 
                    months?

      Neil is dizzy.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  42.


                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    If it helps, she did say she was 
                    happily married -- and I know the 
                    ones that aren t.

                                  NEIL
                    ...my wife has been sleeping with a 
                    hooker...

                                  SIMON
                    Escort is more the industry term.

                                  NEIL
                    I can t believe this.  

                                  SIMON
                    You wouldn t believe how common it 
                    is, actually.  With the economy 
                    these days?  You got husbands 
                    working longer hours, wives at home 
                    with no companionship.  Then 
                    there s the women who ve had to 
                    return to the workforce.  They re 
                    older, well-paid, hitting their 
                    sexual peak --

                                  NEIL
                    So you actually do this for a 
                    living?

                                  SIMON
                    I started doing it for fun. It just 
                    happens to be a very good living.
                          (off Neil)
                    Look, if you love her, I wouldn t 
                    throw it all away just yet.  
                    Marriage is about a lot more than 
                    just sex.

                                  NEIL
                    You married?  How would you know?

                                  SIMON
                    Because I ve slept with a lot more 
                    married women than you ever will.  
                    And believe me, when all is said 
                    and done, you don t want to throw 
                    it all away over a few orgasms.

      Simon studies Neil with real empathy, impulsively peels off 
      his jacket, puts it over Neil s shoulders.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  43.


                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    You got a friend you can call...?

      Neil stands, considers Simon for a beat, heads for his car.

      Simon reaches out for him, but Neil shoves him away -- don t 
      touch me.  They hold each other s stare for a long beat 
      before Neil gets in his car and drives off.

      As Simon watches him go, CUT TO:




      INT. STAGED HOME - SAME TIME5151

      Grace puts the final touches on the kitchen table, arranges 
      some fresh cut flowers.  She sees the back door open.  That s 
      odd.  She walks over and closes it, looks out at the yard... 
      Notices the row of tress behind it.

      She finally turns away, moves into the entry way, grabs her 
      keys and purse.


      EXT. STAGED HOME - CONTINUOUS51A51A

      Front door opens and Grace steps outside.  She locks the door 
      back then turns and sees 

      AN OLDER COUPLE

      In the distance, holding hands as they walk across a field 
      out front.  Grace watches the couple for a beat and we notice 
      Neil s car is gone.  As Grace closes the door to the house 
      and locks it, heads for her car, we CUT TO:

      Neil s car pulls up and parks outside the garage.  Neil

      THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

      Neil is headed for one of the sliding glass doors, but is 
      distracted by something in the pool -- a WHOOSHING NOISE.

      He heads over and sees the pool vacuum hung up and struggling 
      on one of the steps, sucking mostly air.  Neil yanks up the 
      hose and tosses the vacuum back into the water, watches it 
      sink.

      The yard quiet now, he turns back toward the house and 
      studies it.  The emptiness inside.  He takes a seat, unable 
      to go in.


      INT. BACK STAGE/HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT5252

      A handful of TEACHERS try to impose order on the dozens of 
      STUDENTS who are warming up for their high school talent 
      show.  As the CAMERA TRACKS through the activity, we pass 
      some KIDS JUGGLING, a small DANCE TROUPE, a MAGICIAN etc.                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  44.


      We finally pick up Anika, dressed all in black, strolling 
      through the chaos with her guitar.  A couple of SNOTTY GIRLS 
      check her out, talk loud enough for her to hear.

                                  SNOTTY GIRL #1
                    Check out freak show.

                                  SNOTTY GIRL #2 
                    She s so creepy.

      Anika pretends not to notice, but we can tell she s used to 
      such comments.  Her cell rings.  She checks the screen and 
      her face hardens.  She finally answers.

                                  ANIKA
                    Hello...

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Hey, sweetie. 

                                  ANIKA
                    I m about to go on.  You ll have to 
                    call me back --

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Wait -- I m outside.  In the 
                    parking lot.

      Anika is thrown, but heads for an exit and out to:


      EXT. PARKING LOT/HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT5353

      Anika opens the stage door, sees Neil waiting for her.

                                  ANIKA
                    What are you doing here?  You re 
                    supposed to be in New York --

      He comes to her, gives her a hug.

                                  NEIL
                    It s your big debut.  I couldn t 
                    miss that.

                                  NEIL
                      ...probably inside already.  I was

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    Neil...? 

      They both turn as Grace approaches.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    ...I thought you had a flight this 
                    morning.

      She gives Neil a kiss; he pulls back.

                                  NEIL
                    Trip was canceled.

                                  GRACE
                    ...Why didn t you call?

      Before Neil can answer a TEACHER pokes her head out of the 
      stage door.

                                    TEACHER
                    Anika -- you re almost on.

                                  ANIKA
                    Oh, my God -- coming.

                                  GRACE
                    Go.  Dad and I ll grab our seats.

      She turns to race off.

                                  NEIL
                    Hey --

      She turns back.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    We re proud of you.  Just have fun.

      She studies her parents for a tortured beat.

                                  ANIKA
                    I will.

      She turns and races off.  Grace looks to Neil.

                                  GRACE
                    Why didn t you leave me a message?

      Neil starts to move off.

      He turns back. 

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Something happen?

                                  NEIL
                    ...It got rescheduled.

      Grace studies him.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    It s not a big deal.

      Grace finally comes to him, takes his hand.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  46.

                    I know it means a lot to Anika that 
                    you re here.  Me, too.

      Neil gives her a thin smile.  

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    We should get our seats.

      As she leads him off, CUT TO:

      PICK UP Neil and Grace settled in their seats off the aisle 
      near the front as an ACT finishes on stage.  APPLAUSE.

      VOICE comes over the P.A.

                                  VOICE

      Mild APPLAUSE as Anika approaches the mike with her guitar.  
      The spotlight hits her.  It takes a moment to find her nerve.  
      She gestures to the front row.

      singled out.  Neil leans forward as Anika starts to sing:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  47.

                    Dear hider and seeker there under 
                    the bleachers, I caught you there 
                    riding my favorite math teacher.  
                    You held her, you ruled her like 
                    Julius Ceaser.  You handled her 
                    like a stud...

      Neil and Grace look at each other -- what is she singing 
      about?

                                  ANIKA (cont d) (CONT D)
                    But when it was over, heard tell of 
                    abortion.  And fear of exposure and 
                    threats of extortion.  Did mister 
                    Tigh find out and try to divorce 
                    her?  Was it even ever love...?

        A collective gasp.

                                  ANIKA (cont d) (CONT D)
                    What a shame, we re all to blame...
                    Look out now here it comes here it 
                    comes.  The truth s a loaded gun 
                    loaded gun.  Pointing at everyone 
                    everyone fa la la la la la la la.

      A panicked Teacher rushes on stage.

                    Don t it make you wanna cry?

                    fa la la la la la la la la --   

      Anika s mic goes dead.  Mrs. Tigh races from the auditorium 
      and McKernon runs after her.  Crickets.  The Audience is in 
      shock.

      Then Neil stands.  

      Starts to applaud.

      INT. SCHOOL DIRECTOR S OFFICE - NIGHT5555

      Anika sits between Neil and Grace.  In the hallway behind 
      them, we see the School Director, LIONEL ELKORT, 40s, 
      chatting with an emotional Mrs. Tigh.  He turns and enters 
      the office, takes a seat behind his desk.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  48.

                    We confiscated all the cell phones 
                    we could.  The last thing we need 
                    is this all over the internet.

                                  GRACE
                    That was smart.

      Elkort studies the Trumans.

                                  ELKORT
                    I m going to expel her.

                    Hold on, I thought we were here to 
                    discuss this.

      She reads it on Elkort s face -- there s nothing to discuss.

                                  NEIL
                    What about these teachers having an 
                    affair on school grounds?  What are 
                    you doing about that?

                                  ELKORT

                    We pay a lot of money in tuition to 
                    this school.  I think that entitles 
                    us to an opportunity to resolve

                    one of our other more... committed

                    I totally agree.

      Grace turns to her.

                                  GRACE
                    You hated it here that much you had 
                    to sabotage your chances at an 
                    education with that stunt?

      Grace exhales -- clearly there s bigger issues going on here. 
      She turns to Neil.

                    I ll drive her home.  Then you and

      EXT. BACK YARD/TRUMAN HOME - NIGHT5757

      Neil walks to the edge of the pool, looks across the water -- 
      it s still littered with leaves and gunk.  He scans the yard, 
      spots the automated pool cleaner, moves to pick it up.

                                  GRACE
                    Neil?

      Grace has appeared at the sliding door.

                    Now?

      Neil uncurls the hose, tosses the cleaner into the pool, 
      watches it sink.

                                  NEIL
                    I can t remember the last time any 
                    of us spent time out here.  We used 
                    to love this thing.  What happened?

      Grace studies him for a long beat then goes.

      As Neil adjusts the hose, watches the cleaner go to work, he 
      hears a cell phone RING from

      THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

      Neil appears, realizes the ringing is coming from the garbage 
      can.  He considers it for a moment, opens the lid and digs 
      around, pulls out Simon s jacket... then the ringing cell 
      phone... answers.

      lights disappearing down the street, we CUT TO:


      INT. ROYAL HOTEL - NIGHT5959

      A high-end boutique hotel.  Neil s car stops at the Valet.  
      He gets out, takes his ticket and looks to the entrance, 
      frozen.

      A DOORMAN opens the door.  Neil hesitates then enters.  He 
      pauses in the lobby, gathering his nerve then moves toward:


      INT. BAR/ROYAL HOTEL - NIGHT6060

      Neil enters, moving slowly as he scans the faces throughout.

      He stops when he catches sight of a short-haired brunette 
      (MALLORY, 30s) sitting at the bar, nursing a cosmopolitan.  
      She gives him a small nod as if to say,  I m the one you re

      then awkwardly leans in for a kiss.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  53.

                    Nice to meet you.

      He takes a seat, scans the bar, trying to hide his face in 
      case anyone might see him.

                                    MALLORY
                    Is everything alright?

                    been here in a while.

      She gives him a polite smile. Neil s on the verge of bolting.

                                    MALLORY
                    Sorry I called in such a panic.

                                  NEIL
                    No, no -- I m sorry I m late.

      A beat.  Mallory is drawn to Neil s left hand.

                                    MALLORY
                    You re not really married are you?

      Neil looks down at his wedding ring.

                                  NEIL
                    Oh, this...yeah...I wear this 
                    sometimes to...give the appearance

      She shows him her wedding band; platinum, lots of diamonds.

                                    MALLORY
                    Thank you.

      She takes another heavy sip of her drink.  There s a long 
      awkward silence.  Finally:

      She hesitates.

      Now Mallory s uncomfortable.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    Silly question.  Why would anyone 
                    be here if they weren t married, 
                    right? 
                          (then)
                    Why are you here?

                    Clearly we both know what you want.

      She s mortified, reaches for her purse, stands.

                                    MALLORY
                    This was a mistake --

      She starts to move off, Neil reaches for her.

                                  NEIL
                    No, wait, I m sorry.  I didn t mean 
                    it like that.  It s just... you re 
                    so beautiful it didn t make sense 
                    that you d need to...
                          (off Mallory)
                    Can we start over?  Please.

      She considers him for a beat.

                                    MALLORY
                    This was really hard for me.  I ve 
                    never done anything like this 
                    before.

                                  NEIL
                    Me neither.

      Mallory laughs.

                                    MALLORY
                    You seem so... normal.

                                  NEIL
                    I m trying very hard right now.

      Bartender approaches.

                          (to Mallory)

      She hesitates, then nods.

                          (to Bartender)
                    ...and I ll have a vodka soda.

      Bartender nods, takes her glass and moves off.  Neil gestures 
      to the stool and Mallory retakes her seat.  After a beat.

                                    MALLORY
                    To answer your question, I m not 
                    sure what I want.

                                  NEIL
                    Why don t you just tell me why you 
                    called.

      Mallory considers how to say this.

                                    MALLORY
                    I ve been married a long time.  And 
                    I love my husband.  But he s just 
                    never around.

                                  NEIL
                    Works a lot?

                                    MALLORY
                    And even when he is home, he s on 
                    his laptop and completely ignores 
                    me when I try to talk to him.  
                    There s always some deadline he s 
                    worried about.

      That resonates for Neil -- he s done that with Grace.

                                  NEIL
                    I m sure he still cares about you.  
                    Men -- we feel a lot of pressure to 
                    perform at the office.

                                    MALLORY
                    I just wish he felt the same way 
                    about our marriage.
                          (off Neil)
                    I want to feel wanted.  No one has 
                    wanted me in so long.  

      More serious eye contact.  Neil reaches out and puts a hand 
      on her leg.  It s exhilarating.  For both of them.

      Mallory starts to move his hand up her leg.  As she pulls it 
      up farther and farther, the excitement building for both of 
      them, we CUT TO:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  56.

      Sprinklers pop on the front lawn, shooting water everywhere.


      INT. MASTER BEDROOM/TRUMAN HOME - MORNING6262

      Grace rolls over, opens her eyes, realizes she s alone.  


      INT. KITCHEN/TRUMAN HOME - MORNING6363

      Grace enters.

                    Neil?

      She looks at the flat screen in the living room, moves to:

      Grace looks out at the driveway -- his car isn t there.


      INT. SUITE/ROYAL HOTEL - MORNING6565

      Clothes litter the floor; there s an empty champagne bottle 
      on the night stand.  Neil pops from under the covers when his 
      CELL PHONE RINGS.  He grabs it quickly, moves into:

      Grace paces on her cell phone.  INTERCUT as needed.

                    I turned my phone off.

                    of town again.  

      Another long pause.

                                  GRACE
                    Who s this new client, Neil?

      Neil looks in the bedroom, sees Mallory roll out of bed, 
      naked, start to get dressed.

                                  NEIL
                    No one you d know.

                    I have to go, I ll call you later.

      He hangs up, reeling from his own behavior.  He takes a 
      moment to collect himself, then re-enters the bedroom.  
      Mallory nods to an envelope on a pillow.

                                    MALLORY
                    I put it all there -- plus tip.

      Neil takes it, looks inside -- must be a thousand dollars.

      Mallory gives him a quick hug.  When she pulls back --

                    I hate to just run, but I want to 
                    get back home to Daniel, see if 
                      anything s changed now.

      She exits.  As Neil watches her go his smile fades -- he sees 
      he s still wearing his wedding ring.


      INT. RECEPTION AREA/NEIL S OFFICE - DAY6868

      Grace steps off the elevator, approaches the reception desk, 
      really taking in the space.

      Darryl, juggling his baseball, stands with Grace at Neil s 
      desk as he puts the last of Neil s belongings in a bankers 
      box.  Grace is in shock.

                                  GRACE
                    ...then he did what?

      EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - DAY7070

      Just outside the city.  Neil approaches a gated entrance, 
      stepping lightly past a flowering garden. 


      EXT. ZEN GARDEN - CONTINUOUS7171

      Neil enters, takes in the sparse, quiet surroundings.  

      Ahead of him, a bevy of bald-headed monks kneel in prayer as 
      incense wafts throughout the air.  A young APPRENTICE MONK 
      approaches.

                                  NEIL 
                    Hi...I m not sure if you can help 
                    me, but...

      As Neil begins to tell the Apprentice Monk his story, the 
      words fade out and we PRE-LAP:

                    marriage.


      INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - DAY7272

      A large, open space with an alter at one end.  Neil sits 
      across from the wise, old Zen Master.

                                  NEIL
                    There must be something you can 
                    tell me to help make sense of all 
                    this.

      The Zen Master considers Neil, then picks a lotus flower from 
      a vase, places it between them.

                                  ZEN MASTER
                    All of your answers are here.

      Neil looks down.

                                  NEIL (cont d)
                      Seriously?  My entire life just 
                    went Enron and that s your answer?  
                    A flower?

                    Is that all you see?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  60.


      Neil chuckles to himself, starting to crack.

                                  NEIL
                    You know what I see?  You re the 
                    one that s crazy.  I read your 
                    story about how the Buddha left his 
                    family?  It s insane.  If people 
                    like me give up everything, I m 
                      certifiable.  Course I could take 
                      anti-depressants, become just 
                    another zombie trying to pay his 
                    mortgage, put all my passions into 
                    building a home theater system -- 
                    but what s the point?  Who wants to 
                    live like that --?

      Neil s cell starts to RING.  He empties his pockets to search 
      for his phone.  First he tosses some condoms on ground... a 
      thick stack of hundred dollar bills... finally he pulls out 
      Simon s phone.

                    I can work with that, sure. 
                      Alright... text me the address.

      Neil hangs up, looks to the Zen Master.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    That was a woman who wants to pay 
                    me five thousand dollars to have

                          (off Zen Master)
                    I think I m gonna go.

                    And when you are ready, you will 
                    come back.

      As he quickly re-pockets the condoms, money and phone --

                                  NEIL (cont d)
                    You ask me, anyone can be Zen if 
                    you meditate all day.  Try having a 
                    family.  Sit in rush hour traffic 
                    half your life and work eighty 
                    hours a week.  You do that with a 
                    smile on your face, then I ll think 
                    you re really enlightened.

      EXT. BACKYARD/STEPHANIE S HOME - DAY7373

      Grace paces, mind racing.  Then she sees those annoying wind 
      chimes, rips them down just as Stephanie exits the house with 
      a cup of tea.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    You gave me those for Christmas.

                    Valerian root.  Calms the nerves.

      Grace sips it -- yuck.

                    Sorry.  I m on a juice cleanse.  I 
                    got rid of all alcohol and sugar in

      Grace dumps the tea in one of the potted plants.

                    What are you going to tell Anika?

                                  GRACE
                    I don t know... The whole thing 
                    might be my fault.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I m sorry -- what?

                                  GRACE
                    He came home the other night and 
                    said he tried to quit but I... I 
                    thought he was joking.  I should ve 
                    been paying better attention.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    And that makes it your fault? 

                                  GRACE
                    He s been so unhappy lately.  I ve 
                    tried to cheer him up, I bought him 
                    a tie --                                       Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  61A.


                                  STEPHANIE
                    Grace.  You have been nothing but 
                      supportive of him since the first 
                    day you were together.  Nothing you 
                    said or didn t say could ve made 
                    him do what he did... unless 
                    there s something else going on.

      Grace looks up at her sister, conflicted.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Is something else going on?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  62.


      As Grace hesitates, not sure how much to say, a gray-haired 
      MAN, 50, pops his head out, wearing only boxers.

                                  MAN
                    Hey, um, shower?  Which way is hot?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Left.  But you have to let it run.  
                    Takes forever.

                                  MAN
                    Got it.
                          (then, to Grace)
                    Hi.

      He disappears.  Grace looks to Stephanie -- seriously?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I met him at bikram, what?

      Grace considers Stephanie, switching gears.

                                  GRACE
                    You know what his office said?  
                    That when he went to New York the 
                    other day, he freaked out on the 
                    plane and pulled the emergency 
                    slide.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    You re kidding.

                                  GRACE
                    I guess you can see the whole thing 
                    online.

      Stephanie leaps up, runs into the house leaving Grace alone 
      with her thoughts.  We PUSH IN on her face, seeing the 
      tension until --

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I think I found it...

      Stephanie sits back down with an IPad, shows Grace.

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN --

      The same video we saw earlier in Victor s office of Neil 
      talking to the plane and then pulling the emergency slide.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Oh, my god... he looks completely 
                    crazy.                                       Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  62A.


      Grace sees something else.  

      CLOSER ON THE SCREEN --

      Neil is in the middle of his speech.  And there s something 
      oddly noble about him.  Revolutionary.

                                  GRACE
                    I m not so sure...

      Stephanie turns to Grace -- what?  As Grace leans in closer 
      to the screen, marveling at Neil s performance, we CUT TO:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  63.


      EXT. ROAD - DUSKA74A74

      PICK UP Neil s car as it drives down a windy canyon road.


      EXT. ADRIANA S HOME - DUSK7474

      Neil s car pulls into a driveway outside a gated home.  Neil 
      exits, approaches the entrance, stops.  He pulls off his 
      wedding ring and pockets it before he rings the buzzer.  
      After a beat:

                                    WOMAN S VOICE
                    Step back from the camera, please.

      Neil obliges.

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (CONT D)
                    Turn around.

      He does.  Waits.  BUZZER rings and the gate opens.


      EXT. COURTYARD/ADRIANA S HOME - MOMENTS LATER7575

      Neil walks toward the front door; it s been left open.  


      INT. ADRIANA S HOME - CONTINUOUS7676

      Neil enters a high-ceilinged space, all of it furnished with 
      custom-made pieces and striking art work.  

      He moves farther in before catching sight of a beautiful 
      WOMAN pacing with a cell phone on a balcony off the kitchen.  
      She sees Neil, holds up a finger -- one minute.

                                    ADRIANA
                          (into phone)
                    I have a contact in customs, 
                    paperwork won t be an issue... 
                    Transfer the funds and I ll put you 
                    in touch... merci.

      As she continues to talk, Neil notices a SEXY YOUNG WOMAN 
      (VERONICA) reclined on a couch in the Living Room, smoking.  
      She is paying him no attention. 

      Adriana finally hangs up, looks to Veronica.

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    Darling, can you call George for 
                    me, tell him we re all set?                                       Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  63A.


      She crushes out her cigarette and slinks out of the room.  
      Adriana turns her attention to Neil now, approaches.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  64.


                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    On time.  That s good.

      She offers a hand.  

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    Adriana.

      Neil takes it, gives it an awkward kiss.

                                  NEIL
                    Nice to meet you.

      She considers him for a moment like a dress on a sales rack.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Are those the only clothes you 
                    have, Simon?

                                  NEIL
                    I have a business suit in the car.
                          (off her look)
                    I didn t know what we were doing.

                                    ADRIANA
                    When a woman makes the date, you 
                    should always come prepared for any 
                    occasion.
                          (off Neil)
                    How big are you?

                                  NEIL
                    ...Do you mean like --?

                                    ADRIANA
                    Don t tell me, I want to guess.

      She circles him, running a hand along his torso.

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    Jacket, 44 regular.  Shirt, 18...

      She faces him up close, reaches down and grabs his crotch.  
      Considers her handful.

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    Size 11 shoe?

                                  NEIL
                    ...11 and a half.

                                    ADRIANA
                    You sure?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  65.


                                  NEIL
                    Yep.  Pretty sure.

      She lets go, backs up and considers him once more.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Alright.  Let s get you out of 
                    those clothes... Come.

      As Adriana leads him off, we TIME CUT TO:


      INT. UPSTAIRS DRESSING ROOM/ADRIANA S HOME - LATER7777

      Neil trails in after Adriana who leads him toward a closet 
      filled with designer shirts, shoes and jackets.

                                    ADRIANA
                    We re going to a fund raiser 
                    tonight.  There will be a lot men 
                    with a lot of money there.  You 
                    should be able to find something 
                    more stylish in here.

      Neil thumbs through some of the clothes.

                                  NEIL
                    Anything specific?

                                    ADRIANA
                    Something that will make me look 
                    good.

      She turns and exits.  Neil watches her go then turns back to 
      the closet.

      He thumbs through the shirts before settling on a tie rack... 
      sees a yellow one.  It freezes him.  As he pushes it aside, 
      we CUT TO:


7878EXT. ADRIANA S HOME - NIGHT 

      The magic hour, nowhere else you d want to be.


      INT. ADRIANA S HOME - NIGHT7979

      Neil re-enters dressed sharply in a fitted jacket with an 
      open collar shirt.  He looks dapper and sexy.

                                    ADRIANA
                    That looks great on you.  I want 
                    you to keep it.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  66.


                                  NEIL
                    Oh, no, I really can t.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Hmm.  Strike two now.  A woman s 
                      generosity should never be taken 
                    for granted.

      That lands hard with Neil.  He nods, embarrassed.

                                  NEIL
                    You re right.  Thank you.  I was 
                    just confused...
                            (approaches)
                    Because you stole the view right 
                    out of the room. You look gorgeous.

      Adriana cracks a slight smile, nods with approval.  

                                    ADRIANA
                    I was beginning to get a little 
                    worried about you.

      Neil holds out his arm.

                                  NEIL (cont d)
                    I just needed a little time to warm 
                    up.

      Adriana takes Neil s arm as he leads her toward the door.  As 
      he opens it for her, we MATCH CUT TO

      ANOTHER DOOR OPENING --

      As Grace enters:


      INT. ENTRY WAY/TRUMAN HOME - NIGHT8080

      She closes the door, holding the bankers box and moves to:

      THE LIVING ROOM

      Just outside the kitchen.  She sets the bankers box down on 
      the long counter, lingering on the contents.  First she pulls 
      out a FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH -- happier times.  Then she notices a 
      book: Zen in the Modern World.  She pulls it out, curious -- 
      what was Neil doing reading this?  She flips through it for a 
      beat before she notices

      ANIKA 

      Asleep in the Den on a the couch, magazine on her chest, ear 
      buds in with MUSIC still playing.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  67.


      Grace goes to her, shuts off the music and pulls out the 
      earbuds.  She brushes the hair from her face, watches her 
      sleep... then starts to cry.  She stifles it when Anika stirs 
      awake.

                                  ANIKA
                    ...Mom?

                                  GRACE
                    Let s get you to bed.

      As Grace helps Anika from the couch and leads her off to bed, 
      we CUT TO:


      INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT8181

      A large high-walled space filled with the upper crust who ve 
      come for a charity auction.  Neil and Adriana enter, weave 
      their way through the crowd ogling the art on the walls.

                                    ADRIANA
                    ...so we re here tonight as friends 
                    of the gallery owner.  All proceeds 
                    from this auction will go to help 
                    build wells for water in Africa.  
                    You re familiar with those 
                    politics?  
                          (off Neil)
                    Good.  Now look at this.

      They make their way through the crowd and over to:

                      I absolutely have to have it.

      CLOSE ON THE PAINTING/PHOTOGRAPH: It s an abstract piece with 
      what looks like two lovers underwater.

                                  NEIL
                      Beautiful...

      As he drinks in the painting, an attractive Older Woman (the 
      GALLERY OWNER) approaches with a younger, HANDSOME MAN.

                                    GALLERY OWNER

                    You know Dane...

                                    ADRIANA
                    Of course.  Nice to see you.  And 
                    this is Simon.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  68.


      A brief beat of introductions as everyone shakes hands.

                                    GALLERY OWNER
                    Can you come with me?  There s some 
                    friends I d love you to meet.

      As Adriana and Neil move off we BEGIN MONTAGE: 

      Neil and Adriana are introduced to various men and women, all 
      of whom appear to carry some weight in the world.  Neil seems 
      at ease in conversation, laughing and holding his own.  
      Adriana is clearly impressed with his social skills.  As the 
      montage comes to an end, we HEAR A VOICE over a loudspeaker.

                                  VOICE
                    Ladies and gentlemen, five minutes 
                    until we close bids.  Thank you.

      Adriana turns to Neil, rattled.

                                    ADRIANA
                    The piece I wanted.  We never bid.

                                  NEIL
                    I ll take care of it.  
                          (off Adriana s concern)
                    If there s one thing I know know 
                    how to do, it s close a deal.

      Neil hustles back to the auction, finds an AUCTIONEER pacing 
      the rows of merchandise with an IPad (you give your assigned 
      number, he enters the bid).  Neil pulls out the wad of 
      hundreds he got earlier from Mallory, palms a bunch.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    Would you like to bid, sir?
                          (off Neil)
                    Just tell me your assigned number, 
                    I can go ahead and do it for you.  
                    Which item?

      Neil motions to the art piece.

                                  NEIL
                    And my number is Five-zero-zero.

      Auctioneer types...frowns.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    I m sorry, that s not coming up.

                                  NEIL
                    Sure it is.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  69.


      Neil slips the Auctioneer five hundred dollar bills.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    You know who s bid on that and how 
                    much.  I need to go home with it 
                    tonight.

      Auctioneer casually slips the money in his pocket.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    Of course, sir.  What was that 
                    number again?

                                  NEIL
                    Try one-seven-five.

      Auctioneer puts it in -- voila.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    I think you re all set.

      Neil nods and Auctioneer moves off just as --

                                    CHARLES
                    Is that Neil Truman?

      Neil turns, sees CHARLES LIPTON, 60s, approaching.  You d 
      only need look at him from afar to guess he s very rich and 
      very powerful.  And you d be right.

                                    CHARLES (CONT D)
                    You work with O Connell at Apex 
                      Financial, right?  
                          (offers his hand)
                    Charles Lipton.

      Neil immediately recognizes the name -- it s like saying 
      Buffet.  He puts his game face on.

                                  NEIL
                      Charles... I thought that was you. 
                    Nice to see you.
                          (they shake)
                    How are they treating your money 
                    over there at... Montgomery, was 
                    it?

                                    CHARLES
                    Like I pissed on it before I handed 
                    it over.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  70.


                                  NEIL
                      Everyone s getting killed in this 
                    market right now.  I wouldn t let 
                    it worry you.  In the short term.

      Charles looks suddenly concerned.

                                    CHARLES
                    Do you know something I don t?

                                  NEIL
                    Of course.  If I didn t, how could 
                    I do my job?

                                    CHARLES
                    From what I hear, you re doing it 
                    very well these days.  
                          (then)
                    Maybe you d like to take a look at 
                    my portfolio, tell me what you 
                    think.

                                  NEIL
                    You know what, Charles?  If you re 
                    really looking for some answers, I 
                    got just the thing.

      Neil turns, plucks a flower out of a vase, hands it to him.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    If you concentrate, all you need to 
                    know is right here.

      Off Charles  confusion, Adriana walks up.

                                    ADRIANA
                    ...hope I m not interrupting.

      She slips her arm into Neil s, motions for him to make the 
      introduction.

                                  NEIL
                    Adriana, this is Charles, Charles, 
                    Adriana.

      Charles turns to Adriana like a drunk uncle.

                                    CHARLES
                    Can you please tell your husband I 
                    need his help.  He s being coy with 
                    me. 

      Adriana looks to Neil -- husband?                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  71.


                                  NEIL
                          (to Charles, sotto)
                    I m not being coy, Charles.  I m 
                    trying to be polite.  Because I m 
                    really not interested in helping 
                    you.

      He motions for Adriana to go.  As they move off, Adriana 
      looks to Neil.  

                                    ADRIANA
                    Who was that?

                                  NEIL 
                    Someone from another life.

      As the Auctioneer calls for everyone s attention and Neil 
      guides Adriana off, WE CUT TO:


      INT. ADRIANA S HOME - LATER8282

      SOUNDS of lovemaking.  CAMERA tracks through the home toward:


      INT. BEDROOM/ADRIANA S HOME - CONTINUOUS8383

      CAMERA enters, finds Adriana, riding Neil and arching her 
      back just as they surrender together then fall apart.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Whew, I needed that.  Thank you.

      Adriana rolls off Neil, pulls the covers up around her before 
      leaning over to a night stand and taking a hit off a still-
      lit joint.  She exhales, considers the new painting above the 
      bed before grabbing an envelope and tossing it to Neil.

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    You can take a shower before you go 
                    if you d like.

      As if he s already gone, Adriana grabs a LAPTOP from the same 
      night stand, tunes Neil out as she focuses on checking her 
      email.  Neil watches her for a beat before getting out of bed 
      to get dressed, casually looks at the cash in the envelope -- 
      and he s confused. 

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                          (without looking up)
                    It s sixty percent less than what 
                    we discussed on the phone.  My cut.                                       Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  71A.


                                  NEIL
                    ...your cut?

      Adriana looks up for the first time.  Neil suddenly senses a 
      larger picture.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    What s this all been about?*                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  72.


                                    ADRIANA
                    Since you didn t figure it out from *
                    the party... I have a service that *
                    caters to very rich, very busy and *
                    very picky women who are looking 
                    for a man and not a husband.  And 
                    usually only for an evening.
                          (off Neil)
                    I d been hearing about you for 
                    awhile.  Word does travel in 
                    certain circles.  And because I m *
                    always on the look out for new *
                    talent... A little test drive *
                    before I make the offer.

                                  NEIL
                    So this whole evening has been some *
                    sort of job interview.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Come work for me.  I think you d *
                    really appreciate how much your 
                    business will improve.  Unless you *
                    like banging all those lonely 
                      housewives you ve been filling your 
                    phonebook with.

                                  NEIL
                    Yeah.  Not interested.*

      Neil picks up the pace now as he gets dressed, wants to get 
      the hell out of here now.

                                    ADRIANA
                    What were you before?  
                          (off Neil s silence)
                    You re not the typical personal 
                    trainer or model I usually come 
                    across.  You have...a soul.

                                  NEIL
                    I managed other people s money.  I 
                    was pretty sure I didn t have a 
                    soul anymore.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  73.


                                    ADRIANA
                    Well thankfully it s not a 
                      requirement for the job.  Though it 
                    is a plus.

      Neil turns to her, fully dressed now and ready to go.

                                  NEIL
                    Thank you.  For a lovely evening.

      He heads for the door as --

                                    ADRIANA
                    When you re ready to make a real 
                    change, I ll be here for you... 

      Neil turns back to consider her for a long beat, then exits.  
      As Adriana smiles, goes back to her work, we...

      Grace stirs awake after a horrible night s sleep.


      INT. ANIKA S ROOM/TRUMAN HOME - MOMENTS LATER8787

      Grace comes to the doorway, finds Anika strumming her guitar, 
      working on another song.  Soon as she sees Grace she stops.

                                  ANIKA
                          (re: the song)
                    Don t worry, it s not about you.

      Grace comes in, sits across from her.  Takes her hand.  And 
      places something inside it.  Anika s opens her palm and we 
      see a set of CAR KEYS.

                                  GRACE
                    One hour.  No freeways, just 
                    surface streets.  Five miles under 
                    the speed limit at all times.  And 
                    if I see you texted someone after 
                    you left this house, I m going to 
                    home school you and never let you 
                    have any friends.  Is that 
                      understood?  

      Anika looks at her mom, shocked, confused... excited.

                                  ANIKA
                    Can I bring my Ipod?
                          (off Grace)
                    That s okay, I can just listen to 
                    the radio.

                                  GRACE
                    No you can t listen to the radio.
                          (then)
                    Just not too loud.

      Anika jumps up, races for the door.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  75.

                    Hey --

      She turns back.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Thank you?

      Anika rushes back to her mom, gives her a big hug.

                                  ANIKA
                    If you see my real mom, tell I 
                    think she s amazing.

                                  GRACE
                    Believe it or not...

      She pulls back from Anika.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    This is your real mom.

      Anika turns and rushes out.  As Grace watches her go, uneasy 
      now, we CUT TO:


      EXT. TRUMAN HOME - DAY8888

      Neil s car pulls up the driveway, parks.


      INT. NEIL S CAR - CONTINUOUS8989

      Neil sits behind the wheel, staring at his front door -- 
        KNOCK-KNOCK.

      Neil s startled, turns and sees his neighbor and gym-buddy 
      Lawrence tapping on the passenger-side window, motioning for 
      him to roll it down.  As he does:

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Check out what I just got --

      Lawrence points to two WORKMEN across the street moving a 
      giant flat-screen TV box out of a Van.

                                  LAWRENCE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    104 inches of high-def, 3D, LCD 
                    clarity, baby.  Biggest on the 
                    market.  What do you think?

                                  NEIL
                    ...look forward to it.

      Lawrence squeals with delight as he practically skips back to 
      his house.  Neil gets out of the car.


      INT. ENTRY WAY/TRUMAN HOME - DAY9090

      Neil enters, gently closes the door behind him.  He takes a 
      beat to steel himself before:

                                  NEIL
                    Grace?

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    In here.


      INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS9191

      Neil enters and stops short.  Grace is sitting at the kitchen 
      table with Victor.

                    I bought two years ago.  
                          (to Grace, realizes)
                    Y'know, I think we kept half that 
                      furniture, too.

      Neil half-smiles, trying to act casual.  Victor rises, looks 
      to Grace.

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    Mind if I steal him for a bit?


      EXT. BACK YARD/TRUMAN HOME - MOMENTS LATER9292

      Neil walks with Victor along the pool, mid-conversation.

                                  VICTOR
                    ...you took me by surprise.  Twice 
                    in one week.  That s not something 
                    I m used to.                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  77.


                                  NEIL
                    Sorry about the tv --

                                  VICTOR
                    Don t be.  The reality is it s that 
                    kind of passion -- and recklessness 
                    that s made this firm great.  And I 
                    don t want to lose it.

      Neil turns to Victor, way ahead of him.

                                  NEIL
                    I don t want my job back.

                                  VICTOR
                    Good.  Because I m offering you 
                    something better.  A partnership.  
                          (off Neil)
                    I got a call from Charles Lipton 
                    this morning.  Said he ran in to 
                    you at a party the other night.  I 
                    don t know what you said to him, 
                    but he s insisting you take over 
                    his hedge fund.  I told him you 
                    couldn t wait to get started. 

      Neil looks back to the house, sees Grace watching them from 
      the kitchen.  He turns back to Victor.

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    Don t make me beg.  You know how 
                    much money a partner makes, Neil?

                                  NEIL
                    I don t care about the money.

                                  VICTOR
                    ...What do you care about?


      INT. KITCHEN/TRUMAN HOME - CONTINUOUS9393

      Grace watches intently at the window as Neil calmly and 
        methodically talks to Victor, tries to read his body 
      language.  Finally, Neil holds out his hand and Victor moves 
      it away -- grabs Neil and hugs him tight, all smiles.  Victor 
      peels off, walks out of the yard and disappears.


      EXT. BACK YARD/TRUMAN HOME - CONTINUOUS9494

      Grace comes out of the house, approaches Neil who s staring 
      at the pool (it s shimmering and clean).  Grace stands 
      alongside him.  There s a long beat.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  78.


                                  GRACE
                    I fired the pool guy.
                          (off Neil)
                    You were right, he was lazy.  I 
                    don t know why I never saw that 
                    before.

                                  NEIL
                    We never spend time out here any 
                    more.

                                  GRACE
                    It was the whole reason we bought 
                    the house, remember?

      A beat.  Grace looks to him for the first time.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    How come you never told me?

                                  NEIL
                    About the job?

                                  GRACE
                      Everything.

                                  NEIL
                    I didn t want to worry you.  
                          (off Grace)
                    All worked out.

                                  GRACE 
                    What about us?  Are we going to 
                    work out?

      Neil looks to her for the first time.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    I m scared Neil.  What s happening 
                    to us?

      He reaches for her and she clings to him as if he were her 
      last breath.  After a long beat.

                                  NEIL
                    Do you still have that tie you 
                    bought me?

      She pulls back to face him -- what?

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    That color, it really does --                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  79.


                                  GRACE
                    Bring out your eyes more, I know.

      Neil searches for how to say the next few words.

                                  NEIL
                    I want you to know I appreciate 
                    when you give me things and... I 
                    should never take that for granted. 

                                  GRACE
                    ...Thank you.  I returned it.

      He laughs -- of course she did.  There s a moment between 
      them before Anika pops her head out of the house. 

                                  ANIKA
                    Mom, I m back.  Leave the keys on 
                    the counter?

      She nods.  Anika turns to go, turns back.

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    Hi, dad.

      Then she disappears inside.  Neil looks to Grace -- keys?

                                  GRACE
                    I let her drive on her own today.
                          (off Neil)
                    It was a moment of weakness, I 
                    know.  I ll lock her back in her 
                    room until she s twenty-five, don t 
                    worry.  That way we won t have to 
                    deal with the school issue.

                                  NEIL
                    ...I think I had an idea how to fix 
                    that.


      INT. ELKORT S OFFICE - DAY9595

      Elkort reads from a file folder, looks up at Neil and Grace 
      who sit across his desk.

                                  ELKORT
                    How exactly did you --?

                                  NEIL
                    This school s accounting firm 
                    happens to work closely with my 
                    office.  
                                  (MORE)                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  80.

                                  NEIL (CONT'D)
                    I had them send over your filings 
                    so I could crunch the numbers on 
                    the endowment. Frankly it was 
                    criminal the returns you were 
                    getting.  By allowing me to roll 
                    those monies into some of the 
                    bigger hedge funds I manage, you ll 
                    begin to see consistent double 
                    digit gains in the next ten years.

      Elkort is trying to do the math in his head.

                                  GRACE
                    My husband is very good at what he 
                    does, so if he says he can do it, 
                    then he can do it.

      Neil looks to Grace -- that s the first time he ever heard 
      her take pride in his work.

                                  ELKORT
                    This is very generous of you.
                          (then)
                    What s the catch?

                                  GRACE
                    Anika serves a one week suspension.  
                    After she writes a letter of 
                    apology to the school and the 
                    teachers, she will be readmitted 
                    and there will be no mark on her 
                    record.  This all goes away.

      Elkort studies them both.

                                  ELKORT
                    I m not sure it s as simple a fix 
                    as you re making it sound.

                                  NEIL
                    I m not sure the school s board of 
                    directors would appreciate an 
                      investigation into allegations of 
                    faculty affairs either.

      Grace pulls out a business card, lays it on the desk.

                                  GRACE
                    We ve contacted an attorney.  If 
                    you d like to have him explain it 
                    to you in more detail, feel free to 
                    give him a call.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER9696

      Neil and Grace exit the building, the encounter still 
      settling. 

                                  GRACE
                    That went well.

                                  NEIL
                    Yeah.  You were really good in 
                    there.

                                  GRACE
                    ...you, too.

      They consider each other for a beat until Anika comes running 
      up from down the hall where she was chatting with FRIENDS.

                                  ANIKA
                    Are they letting me back in?

      Neil nods.  She hugs him.

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    Thank you, thank you --

                                  GRACE
                    We still have to discuss how we re 
                    going to deal with this at home.

                                  ANIKA
                    Oh, yes, I totally get it.

      Neil s still a bit confused though.

                                  NEIL
                    Can I ask you something?  If you 
                    hated it here so much, why so happy 
                    now?

                                  ANIKA
                    I did hate it here.  But after what 
                    happened, I m finally popular.

      As Anika looks back to the girls she was chatting with, gives 
      her parents a hopeful smile, we CUT TO:


9797INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY 

      Neil s car pulls in and he drives past his usual spot to 
      another one closer to the elevator with his name on it.  He 
      parks, gets out.  He considers the plaque for a moment, then 
      turns to head for the elevator when --                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  82.


                                  VOICE
                    So this is your real job...

      Neil turns, Simon has been waiting for him.

                                  SIMON
                    Grace told me you were some 
                    financial guy.  Looks like you do 
                    okay for yourself.

      Simon approaches Neil now, calm but menacing.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    I know you had my phone, I know you 
                    slept with one of my clients.  That 
                    bartender at the hotel is a friend 
                    of mine.

      Neil looks around the parking lot -- who s seeing this?

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    What d you do with all my contacts?  
                    I can t access them online anymore.

      Neil turns back, bold now.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    That s my livelihood, man.  What 
                    are you trying to do to me?

                                  NEIL
                    Same thing you did to my wife, I 
                    think.

      Simon half-laughs -- touch .  The smile fades quickly.

                                  SIMON
                    I know where you live, now I know 
                    where you work.  You don t undo 
                    what you did, I m coming after you.  
                    You got it?

      Now Neil moves in close to Simon, matching his attitude.

                                  NEIL
                    That s not a threat, you know what 
                    a real threat is?  The IRS looking 
                    into your finances for the last ten 
                    years and discovering exactly what

                    would take is one phone call.

                    I heard the good news.  We got our

                    Why don t you go grab the elevator.

                                  DARRYL
                    ...So that s how it s gonna be now, 
                    huh?  New title, new parking space

                    Of course, my liege.
                          (to Simon)
                    Nice to meet you.

      Darryl moves off.  Neil looks back to Simon.

                                  NEIL
                    There anything else you wanted to 
                    discuss?

      Simon considers Neil for a moment.

                                  SIMON

      He turns and exits.  DING.  Neil turns, sees Darryl waving.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    I ve been thinking a lot about that 
                    story again lately.

      INT. KITCHEN/TRUMAN HOME - DAY9898

      Grace sits at the kitchen table on her laptop.

                    About the Buddha leaving his family 
                    to search for meaning...?

      She hits a few keys, leans in close and we go:

      It s a travel site.  Florence.  Options abound.

                    when I first read it.  


      INT. CELL PHONE STORE - DAY9999

      Neil browses a row phones as a SALES ASSOCIATE approaches.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    I mean, what kind of man would you 
                    have to be to leave everything 
                    you ve ever loved to search for the

      EXT. ZEN GARDEN - DAY100100

      Neil sits across from the Zen Master holding the RED PHONE.

                                  NEIL
                    I got this the other day.  It s 
                    Simon s number.  If someone calls, 
                    we start talking and they re still

                    Guess you never really do know 
                    where enlightenment is going to

      Zen Master smiles for the first time.  Then Neil.  As his

      EXT. BACK YARD/TRUMAN HOME - DAY101101

       I Can See Clearly Now  by Jimmy Cliff plays on source radio.  
      Neil stands on the diving board, looking into the crystal 
      clear water beneath him. 

                                  ANIKA
                    It s freezing dad, don t do it.

      Reveal Anika watching from a chaise, in a jacket -- it s cold 
      out here.  Neil takes a deep breath, dives in.

      UNDERWATER -- Neil swims to the bottom, rests there for a 
      long time as if floating in space.  All SOUND DROPS OUT.

      Lungs ready to burst, Neil shoots to the surface, gasping.

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    God, Dad.  I thought you were dead.

                                  NEIL
                    Me, too.

      Graces approaches, sets down a tray with mugs of hot 
      chocolate.

                                  GRACE
                    See?  We didn t need a vacation, 
                    babe.  Just a little family time 
                    around the pool.

                                  ANIKA
                    I think actually going some where 
                    warm would ve been better.

                                  GRACE
                    That s not the point, honey.
                          (off Neil)
                    I was gonna make lunch.  Who s 
                    hungry?

      Anika and Neil raise their hands.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  86.


                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Tuna fish.  Coming up.

      She turns to go.

                    Grace...
                          (she turns back)
                    You should come in.  It s not that 
                    bad.

      She lifts up her coverall, shows off a new bikini.

                                  GRACE
                    I was planning on it.

      Neil wasn t expecting that -- and he loves it.

                                  ANIKA
                    Wow, mom, you look hot.

                                  GRACE
                    I know.

      She dances into the house as Neil pushes off from the side to 
      do a few laps in water.  His cell phone RINGS.

                                  ANIKA
                    I knew it was too good to be true.  
                    You re gonna have to go into the 
                    office now, aren t you?

                                  NEIL
                    Let s just see who it is first.

      Neil hops out of the pool, grabs a towel and reaches in his 
      robe -- there are two cell phones inside -- the Red Phone is 
      ringing.  He s about to decline when he notices the number. 

                                  ANIKA
                    Well?  Who is it?

      Neil looks back toward the house, sees Grace inside on her 
      cell -- clearly she s calling Simon s number right now but 
      doesn t know it s Neil.  As Neil studies the phone, we...
