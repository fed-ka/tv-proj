      The CEMENT PICNIC TABLE where three members of the East Side 
      Catorce were shot is littered with FIVE OR SIX BOTTLES OF 
      BEER. Some bottles are empty; some will never get finished.

                    We had a 40, smoked some good mota 
                    before he left.

      NUMBER CARDS dot the beer bottles, LETTER CARDS show where 
      two Catorce members were shot. The third was hit running away 
      from the table. A LETTER CARD,  C,  in the BLOODY DIRT marks 
      where he died...

      A DEPT. OF SANITATION DUDE scoops the blood-soaked DIRT into 
      a RED BIOHAZARD BAG. DET. GABRIEL kneels down beside him for

      ...DET. SANCHEZ speaking with SHY GIRL. She wears her hair in 
      pigtails even though she s too old for it. GUERO interrupts--

                                  GUERO
                          (to Shy Girl)
                    Callate, chocha! Vete a la casa. 

      She does as she was told and leaves, trying not to cry. Guero 
      starts to follow when Sanchez stops him. 

                                    SANCHEZ
                    You re new, ese.

                    Got your stripes?

      Guero starts to walk away, dissing Sanchez.

                      Chavala...

                    This park used to be mine.

      Guero stops.

                    Sanchez.

      And off Sanchez, we...

      Guero shifts his weight from foot to foot.


                                  GUERO
                    We don t keep no hood rats.

      BEHIND HIM, PICK UP DET. PROVENZA who s just arrived, as he 
      joins Flynn. They walk to the picnic table where S.I.D. s are 
      removing the NUMBER CARDS. 

                                  FLYNN
                    Bullets didn t spray. Each  victim  
                    died from a single shot to the T-zone.


      He indicates the space between his eyes, a.k.a. the T-zone.

                                  PROVENZA
                    Don t learn to shoot like that on 
                    the streets. Too bad he only got 
                    three of them. 

                                  FLYNN
                    We should give the killer a medal 
                    for cleaning up the neighborhood.
                    Why is Priority Homicide here?

                                  PROVENZA 
                    I guess a triple homicide s our 
                    automatic invitation.

                                  FLYNN
                    These are not Priority murders.

                                  PROVENZA
                          (looking around)
                    Where is Scarlett O Hara?

                                  FLYNN
                    The only thing she was getting out 
                    of our homies here was different 
                    ways they d like to  do her.  She s 
                    in the van.

                                  PROVENZA
                    We should process all our scenes 
                    this way.


      COLONEL D.B. WALTER paces the distance from the third body to 
      the picnic table. He turns to the south and takes his small 
      SCOPE -- we see now that it s a rifle scope -- and eyes the 
      roofs of the nearest buildings.


      POV: RIFLE SCOPE

      Through the cross-hairs, we see the roof of the building on 
      the right is obscured by trees. But there is a clear sight to 
      the roof of the Park Plaza Hotel.

      The cross-hairs follow DOWN the stories of the building 
      until, at street level, we observe a FIGURE coming toward us.

      RACK FOCUS and see that it s BRENDA.

 

      Brenda approaches the Colonel.

                                  BRENDA
                    Excuse me, sir. May I help you?

                                  WALTER
                    Depends who you are.

                                  BRENDA
                          (BADGING him)
                    Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. 

      Col. Walter shows her his GOV T ID.; looks Brenda in the eye. 
      He looks everyone straight in the eye. 

                                  WALTER
                    Colonel D. B. Walter, United States 
                    Marine Corps, retired.

      He says nothing more. So with more of an edge, she repeats...

                                  BRENDA
                    May I help you?

                                  WALTER
                    Did you have any witnesses?

                                  BRENDA
                    Why are you here, sir?

                                  WALTER
                    How many shots did they hear fired?


                                  BRENDA
                    I asked why you were here.

                                  WALTER
                    Three, right? And did the shootings 
                    happen around eight last night?

                                  BRENDA
                    Let s get one thing straight: this 
                    is not the place of your questions. 
                    This is the place of my questions.

                                  WALTER
                    Let s get one thing straight: I m 
                    not answering any of your questions 
                    unless you answer mine. 

                                  BRENDA
                    It is a crime to withhold material 
                      information about a homicide, 
                    Colonel Walter.

                                  WALTER
                    It s not a crime to withhold my 
                    opinion. 

                                  BRENDA
                    And what would that be?

                                  WALTER
                    In my opinion, the shooter was on 
                    the roof at the Park Plaza Hotel. 
                    You might not believe me because 
                    you won t find any casings there.

                          (then)
                    I ll ask your next question for 
                    you: How do I know that? Because in 
                    my opinion, we are not dealing with 
                    an ordinary shooter. We are dealing 
                    with a sniper. And snipers are 
                    trained to be invisible.
                          (then)
                    I believe I can help you find him.

                                  BRENDA
                    How could you do that?

                                  WALTER
                    I think I was his first instructor.


                                  BRENDA
                    You know his name?

                                  WALTER
                    No. 
                          (then)
                    But he s my son.

      Brenda takes this in. As do we.

                                  BRENDA
                    And you don t know his name?

                                  WALTER
                    I haven t seen or heard from my boy 
                    in over a year. I thought he was 
                    dead... until these killings 
                    started happening.

                                  BRENDA
                    There ve been more than this?

                                  WALTER
                    Yes. And, back to my opinion, he ll 
                    do it again. I think, if we help 
                    each other, we can stop him. Leave 
                    the killing to the gangs. But we d 
                    have to keep my opinion about a 
                    sniper from the media. Otherwise, 
                    we both lose control of this case.

                                  BRENDA 
                    I don t make deals with someone 
                    I ve just met at a crime scene.

                                  WALTER
                          (hands her his CARD)
                    Get to know me.

      He heads off in the direction of the PARK S FOUNTAIN, which 
      has just sprung to life. 

      Brenda watches him go, then turns her attention to the roof of 
      the PARK PLAZA HOTEL. 


      POV: BRENDA S BINOCULARS

      It is indeed a clean sight to the picnic table where the 
      three men were shot. We re...


      Brenda drops her BINOS, looks at the park unaided. Hear the 
      SOUNDS of the city coming to life. Gabriel is at her side. 

      She looks at the sight lines from the roofs of the other 
      buildings. Re: the building to the left,  

                                  BRENDA
                    Trees block the view of the park 
                    from over there...
                          (looks to the right)
                    And that roof offers no protection.

      Brenda then looks around this roof: it has a three-foot-lip 
      and a few antennas rise up from its gravel top.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Good eye, Chief.

      Brenda examines the roof. Sure enough: no trace of anyone having 
      been there. No cigarette butts. No indentations in the gravel.  


                                  BRENDA 
                    There has to be some trace of the 
                    shooter. If Mr. Nobody even was here. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Not even a Mr. Nobody leaves 
                    nothing behind. 

                                  BRENDA
                    I want every last pebble on this 
                    roof processed by S.I.D. 

                                    GABRIEL
                    You got it, ma am.
                          (then)
                    How did you know to come up here?

                                  BRENDA
                          (considers what to reveal)
                    Lucky guess. The only way up to this 
                    roof is through the building. Let s 
                    see if they have security tapes.

      Tao arrives weighted down with equipment -- the department s 
      OUTDATED LAPTOP and BULKY VIDEO CAMERA. He s winded from 
      climbing three stories. He joins Brenda at the roof s edge. 
      Reaching for the camera....

                                  TAO
                    This looks like a good place to 
                    shoot from.

                                  BRENDA
                    I don t think you re the first person 
                    to have that idea.

      Tao sets up his tripod probably not too far from where the 
      shooter set up his. Tao aims his lens at the park. 


      POV: TAO S CAMERA

      The cement of the picnic table is white as bones.

                    The shooter waited until he had the 
                      protection of night. His first 
                    victim was probably Lil  Mousy -- 
                    the guy sitting on top of the 
                    table. He was the easiest target.  

      A SHOT is fired from the roof of the Park Plaza Hotel. A RED 
      LINE illustrates THE BULLET S trajectory. 

      The bullet hits the silhouette on the table in the head. The 
      silhouette falls back, arms splayed across the table. PULL 
      BACK and we re...


      Colonel Walter heads toward the restaurant, wearing a RED 
      SWEATSHIRT. 

                                  PROVENZA (O.S.)
                    Told you he was stopping for lunch. 
                    Still fuzzy to me why we re on him.

      He walks with A PAL FROM THE GAS COMPANY, who wears BLUE GAS 
      CO. COVERALLS and A BLUE BASEBALL CAP. They pause before the 
      restaurant. The Gas company guy looks like he doesn t want to 
      come in. Colonel Walter holds up a hand. Two fingers. They 
      enter the restaurant famous for its French Dip sandwiches.

                                  FLYNN (O.S.)
                    I m not sure this is more fun than the 
                    cooking convention.

      PULL BACK and FIND Flynn and Provenza parked across the 
      street.

      The MAN IN BLUE OVERALLS turns the corner and we PAN UP to 
      see it s COLONEL WALTER, who s exchanged clothes with his 
      friend.


      But the tarp isn t long enough to conceal the THICK RIVER of 
      SLUDGY BLOOD that oozed from the dead homie s head. One or two 
      good chunks of SKULL and BRAIN MATTER wait to be picked up. 

                                    OFFICER LURIE (O.S.) 
                    He was killed by a single--

      We go from the brain matter to a pair of good shoes belonging 
      to BRENDA. She finishes OFFICER LURIE s sentence--


                                  BRENDA
                    Single shot to the head.

      Brenda looks around, at the black & white patrol cars, at the 
      apartment building in front of her, at the faces looking 
      down. She sees ACROSS the street:

      Another tall APARTMENT BUILDING. It offers a clear sight to the 
      dead body. She looks DOWN each story of the building until her 
      eyes land at street level, where she sees a man in blue Gas Co. 
      coveralls looking at the roof. It s COL. WALTER. He turns toward 
      the body. And that s when he and Brenda make eye contact.

                                    OFFICER LURIE
                    Somebody briefed you already?

      She ignores him, moving immediately to the edge of the crime 
      scene. The Colonel stands on the other side of the tape.

                                  BRENDA 
                    How d you get here so fast?

                                  WALTER
                    Police scanner.

      Brenda looks him up and down. She doesn t buy it.


                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    You don t have to believe me--

                                  BRENDA
                    I don t.

                                  WALTER
                    I haven t lied to you yet, why 
                    would I start now?

                                  BRENDA
                    Because you found your son. Or... 
                    because you did this.

                                  WALTER
                    You had me followed. You know I 
                    didn t.

                                  BRENDA
                    You deliberately evaded 
                      surveillance. You paid some guy 
                    from the Gas Company 200 bucks to 
                    swap clothes with you.

      In the distance, shouts in Spanish --  Viva Las Catorces...  

                                  WALTER
                    I didn t kill this--

                                  BRENDA
                    I m bringing you in for 
                      questioning.

      Then -- POP POP POP -- the sound of gunfire -- but not like 
      it is in the movies. Here, it sounds like firecrackers going 
      off. The Colonel MOVES to protect Brenda--

                                  WALTER
                    Get down!

      Two Uni s shout at each other then take off down the street. 
      Officer Lurie runs past them.


      Brenda, crouched, looks at The Colonel, who has covered her. 
      The crime scene tape has come undone but remains between them. 
      Brenda looks at Walter s arms around her, protecting her. 
      Slowly, he pulls back.


      Brenda exits to find FRITZ waiting for her beside his Toyota 
      Avalon. He brightens when he sees her.

                                  FRITZ
                    Hey beautiful.

      She s all business. She kisses him so fast on the cheek her 
      lipstick doesn t have time to make an impression. She 
      beelines past him and dives into the back seat.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    I ll drive.


      Fritz tails the Colonel, switching lanes to keep up with him.

      Taylor and his men surround Toker s house.

      Taylor looks to Tao. Tao has his GUN drawn, as does everyone 
      except Taylor. Tao looks to Sanchez, gets a thumbs up. 
      Sanchez looks to Gabriel -- thumbs up. Gabriel, swallowed by 
      his BULLET-PROOF VEST, looks to Provenza -- gets a nod. 
      Provenza nods to Tao. Tao gives Taylor thumbs up. Taylor 
      looks... 

      ACROSS THE STREET

      Where Flynn is ATOP the apartment building. No sniper 
      visible, Flynn gives thumbs up. He s got Taylor covered.

      Out of the car, the Colonel scans the rooftops nearby. He 
      approaches the modest house. Knocks. 


      Taylor approaches the door. Knocks. A Young Man answers the door.


      The Colonel pulls away from the curb. Fritz starts his car 
      up, follows him.


      The mood is dramatically different. GUNS are relaxed. People 
      return to their cars. Flynn has made it down from the roof. 

                                  FLYNN
                    She set us up.

                                    GABRIEL
                    No, she didn t.

                                  PROVENZA
                    Then where is she?

                                  FLYNN
                    She was never planning to show.

                                  TAYLOR
                    You know, I had her all wrong.
                          (after a beat)
                    She s an even bigger bitch than I 
                    thought she was.


      Gabriel stands on the lawn, clutching his PHONE.

                                    GABRIEL
                          (into phone)
                    It s Gabriel...Toker s in County. 
                    He was busted two days ago.
                          (we hear exasperation in 
                            Brenda s voice)
                    Didn t even cross my mind to check... 
                    no, his cousin told us. Word is 
                    everyone on the street knew.


      Fritz barely slows the car to a stop when Brenda throws open 
      the door. He yells to her--

                                  FRITZ
                    I ll park the car and meet you. 
                    Wait for me--

      Tell a charging bull to stop, it d be easier. Fritz s car 
      SPEEDS around the corner. Brenda, carrying her PHONE, runs to 
      the next block and sees...

      GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL  

      Looming, as hospitals do. She runs closer, passes the 
      Colonel s car. She looks at the buildings around the hospital.

      ACROSS THE STREET 

      From the hospital: a mail truck is parked between an office-
      supply building and a bank. It s a little late to be 
      delivering mail.

      As she s moving toward the truck, Brenda s mind races--


                                  BRENDA
                          (into phone)
                    He wasn t looking at the guy in the 
                    Dashiki. He was looking at the mail 
                    man.

                                  FRITZ (O.S.)
                    What mail man?

      She runs to the truck, lifts open the back door.


      Brenda climbs out of the truck and scans both buildings -- the 
      office supply building and the bank. The truck is equidistant 
      from each. Each offers a clear sight to the hospital. Which one 
      did Walter Jr. choose? Brenda looks between the two buildings.

                                  BRENDA
                          (on phone)
                    Damn it. I m going into the bank.


      WALTER JR. leans away from the RIFLE SCOPE to look at his 
      target with both eyes. He wears the same mail man uniform we 
      saw on tape.

      BRENDA

      Cracks the door, slicing the pie. She sees Walter Jr., trains 
      her GUN on his back.

                                  BRENDA
                    Police! Put your hands in the air!

      Without turning around to even see who it is, Walter Jr. 
      freezes for a moment, putting both hands in the air.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)

                    Step away from the gun. 

      He does.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Put your hands behind your head and 
                    kneel to the ground.

      As he does so, he starts to turn around.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Freeze! Don t move! Do not turn 
                    around. Do not turn! Stop!

      But he does. And as he moves, he slides one hand from behind 
      his head down his neck, down toward his back -- suddenly --

      A SHOT RINGS OUT

      Walter Jr. jerks to the left and drops to the ground. Dead. 
      One shot to the head.

      BRENDA

      has both hands on her gun, which is still aimed right at him. 
      But she didn t fire the shot. She glances to the right -- in 
      the direction where the shot came from -- then moves toward 
      Walter Jr. s body. Sees what he was reaching for--

      A SECOND GUN 

      that he had harnessed to his back. It lies on the roof, 
      inches from his lifeless hand. 

      She looks again to where the shot came from--

      THE OTHER ROOF.

      Colonel Walter must ve chosen to run up the office supply 
      building. From there, he had a perfect sight to this roof. He 
      could see his son was seconds away from killing Brenda.

      The Colonel shot his son.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Colonel Walter!

      But he is nowhere to be seen.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Colonel Walter, show yourself! 
                          (then)
                    I know you re here. Don t leave me!

      FRITZ

      pushes through the door to the roof, breathing heavily. He 
      takes in the sight: Brenda standing over the dead body, 
      calling out into the empty night.

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Please... Colonel Walter! 

      And we SWIRL UP to the sky...

                                  BRENDA (CONT D)
                    Show yourself...

      The buildings of Los Angeles a centrifuge spinning round in 
      the starless sky.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
