      An imposing property.  Lake walks out the front door toward a 
      Bentley convertible.  Standing there, leaning against his SUV 
      is Don -- waiting.  Lake doesn t show a trace of surprise.

                                  LAKE
                    Really should consider something a 
                    bit more fuel efficient.

                                  DON
                    Gate was open.

                                  LAKE
                    Let me guess -- this is where you 
                    tell me that it s not over, that 
                    you re going to find another way to 
                    put me in jail.

      Don nods matter-of-factly.

                                  DON
                    You got a half dozen federal agencies 
                    on your ass. Just a matter of time. 

                                  LAKE
                          (dry)
                    I m haunted by my inescapable fate.  
                    Happy now?

                                  DON
                    Just know -- when you go down, 
                    it ll be for killing Erica Daniels. 

                                  LAKE
                    That s a legal impossibility.  
                    Something called  double jeopardy.   
                    Maybe you ve heard of it.

                                  DON
                    Yeah?  Ever heard of a mistrial? 

      Don smiles slightly, knowingly.  Lake stares.  Trying to 
      gauge what Don knows or doesn t know.

                                  LAKE
                    Maybe -- it s just that you and the 
                    DA did a bad job.  I m a innocent 
                    man, free to leave the country.  Go 
                    wherever I want.  There s a world 
                    of places where you can t touch me.

      Lake pulls around the SUV and drives out the gate.


      Robin and Don, on the move --

                                  ROBIN
                    The judge reviewed the evidence of 
                    software hacking into the 
                      Qualitative Jury Software. He s 
                    releasing the names of the jurors 
                    to the FBI.  

                                  DON
                    Do we have enough to get a 
                    mistrial?

                                  ROBIN
                    No. Not yet. 

      She stops.  Don s beside her --

                                  ROBIN (cont d)
                    We can t prove what, if anything, 
                    Logan did with the information he 
                    obtained from the system.

                                  DON
                    Charlie s working on the jury math.

                                  ROBIN
                    I can t go to the judge with an 
                    equation.

      Don smiles, off Robin s look --

                                  DON
                    I m usually the one saying that.


      STREET LEVEL P.O.V. -- of a DOZEN BLACK BOOTS creeping 
      towards the property...

      DAVID AND COLBY -- with FOUR FBI SWAT, approaching, stealth.              NUMB3RS: 515/94: "Guilt Trip" - Rev. Green - 1/12/09    35.

                    white van across the street. Think 
                    we ll find any illegal firearms?

      Fox shakes his head, exasperated.

                    Go look in the van if you want.

                    lot of people -- bagged out on

      Silver emerges onto the roof.  No way off -- except for a 
      fire escape.  Colby and David appear as Silver climbs onto 
      the fire escape.  David quickly backtracks as Colby pursues.

      Silver makes his precarious descent, racing down the stairs -- 
      until he sees David emerge out of the building, onto the fire 
      escape platform one story below.

                                  DAVID
                    Hey!  Stop right there.

      Silver glances up -- Colby above him. Options dwindling.  40 
      feet away, an OPEN WINDOW.  Desperation drives him out --

      -- onto a narrow LEDGE.  Silver starts traversing the ledge.  
      David watching -- not sure what to do.

      Silver inches toward the open window -- hand reaching out to 
      the edge of the window frame.  But he suddenly loses balance, 
      one foot slips -- about to fall, when -- 

      Colby grabs Silver s arm, pulls him to safety.

                    Leave it on the table.
