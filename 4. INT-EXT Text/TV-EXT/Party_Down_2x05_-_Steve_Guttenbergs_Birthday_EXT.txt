      Henry stands outside the gate of a nice house, checking his *
      clipboard. Behind him, Casey peers through the gate.*

                                  HENRY
                    How s this different from the old 
                    New Ron?

      RON stands with a white shirt on a hanger. Hair shorn to his 
      old crewcut. The rest idle by the van. Henry dials his cell--

                                  RON
                    This s New New Ron. Locked in that 
                    coffin, Henry, I was mano a mano 
                    with some heavy shit. What is a 
                    life? Who am I--?

                                  HENRY
                    And you were how high during this?

                                  RON
                      Unimportant. Don t do grass. Get 
                    high on life.

      Henry listens on the phone. Casey approaches from the house.

                                  CASEY
                    That cereal? You can smoke it--?*

                                  RON
                    No, existence. I was drifting in *
                    darkness and I heard a voice.  Only 
                    dead fish go with the flow-- 

                                  CASEY
                    Sarah Palin spoke to you--

                                  RON
                    Or maybe God, or Jesus. But it hit 
                    home. So I went right out, cut my 
                    hair, signed up with AA, got a new 
                    backup shirt. Don t drift through 
                    life. My take-away from being 
                    locked in a coffin while high.

      He heads off to join Lydia, Kyle, and Roman, who wait across 
      the driveway, gawking at him. Henry hangs up.

                                  HENRY
                    My take-away, don t get in a coffin

      The gate opens, as a porsche pulls up. STEVE GUTTENBERG, *
      expensive work-out gear, sits at the wheel.*

                    I see why he changed it to Danson.

      She gets out. Steve pulls off his shirt. As Casey grabs her 
      clothes and exits, Steve drops his pants. Steve goes 
      commando. Naked, he walks to the tub, slides in.
