                        Zenithoptera lanei.  Look at that.  
                        Gorgeous adaptations for flight.

        INT. CHAUVET-PONT-D ARC CAVE - FRANCE - DAY

        The 90s now.  Cole with HIS WIFE, TESS.  Smarter than he 
        is, but hampered by practicality.  They walk through the 
          ancient, hand-painted cave.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        26,000 years since a human set foot 
                        in here.  Yet all these images of 
                        bison, elk... they look like they 
                        were painted yesterday.  I think 
                        art was born, right here.


        EXT. OFF THE COAST OF JAPAN - THE MAGUS - DAY

        Cole in a SCUBA SUIT, climbing back aboard their boat, THE 
          MAGUS.  Coming up from a dive, thrilled.                                                                                      2.

                        A frilled shark, near the surface!  
                        Came right up to me.  Did you get 
                        it?  Tell me you got it!

          Camera catches Tess.  She s got a YOUNG BOY in her lap.  
          Their SON, LINCOLN.  A family growing up together on film.

                        We got it.


        EXT. COSTA RICAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

        Cole is draped in a large SNAKE.  Gross.  He loves it.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        He s like a Palm Viper, only the 
                        color variegation is different.  
                        Look at that.  We re filming a 
                        species no one has ever even seen 
                        before.  There are 4 million known 
                        species, but more than 500 million 
                          undiscovered.  We just found one.  
                        Lincoln!  Come.  He wants to play.

          Camera finds his son, NOW 12, hanging back, scared.

          Camera catches A YOUNG GIRL.  Playing with a SPIDER.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        Lena s not scared of a spider.  
                        Come, he won t hurt you.  He eats 
                        frogs and birds, not little boys.

        The boy comes, reluctantly.  Father puts son s hand on the 
          snake.  The boy cries.  Uncharmed by nature.  Cole looks 
        up, giving up.  TO CAMERA --

          CLOSE ON:  LINCOLN COLE.  28 now.  All his father s rugged 
            independence, with none of his exhibitionism.  Sharp, 
          tough, happiest in quiet settings, which this is not.  He 
        is currently being hugged way too hard by someone --

                                            LINCOLN
                        You didn t have to come all this 
                        way.

        We see the squeezer is an emotional Hispanic man, EMILIO 
          VALENZUELA (50s, out of place among this sea of suits).  He 
          speaks English intelligently, but haltingly.

                                            EMILIO
                        For Doc, I go anywhere in the 
                        world.  I owe him my life.  I come 
                        out of prison, no one want me.  Doc 
                        give me a home on that boat.  I 
                        should have been with him.

          Lincoln moves on.  Walks towards the stage.  WELL-WISHERS 
        stop him to offer condolences.  He presses through --

          Until he sees LENA LANDRY (mid-20s now, still fearless, 
          abrasively competent).  The only other person here who 
          knows exactly what he s going through.  Beat.  So much to 
        say there s nowhere to start.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Hell of a place to catch up.                                                                                      4.

                                            LENA
                        Tell me we re not doing this too 
                        soon?  We should ve kept looking.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You did.  Everyone did.  After six 
                        months... we need to let them go.

        She nods.  Knowing he s right.  Hating it.

                                            LENA
                        Your mom didn t come.  How is she?

          Lincoln shakes his head.  Not good.  JUMP CUT TO:


        INT. STAGE - MINUTES LATER

          Lincoln takes to the podium.  Looks out at the audience.

          QUIET.  Someone COUGHS.  He is about to eulogize his own 
          father.  He looks to the CAMERA FOLLOWING his every move.  
          Cracks a smile.  He knows the game: to the world his family 
        is all sunshine and lollipops.  Regardless of the truth.

                                            LINCOLN
                         Keep the cameras rolling, they 
                        might strike gold. 
                                (LAUGHTER, beat)
                        This is all hard to believe.  As a 
                        kid I d watch my father on TV and 
                        the voice would come up,  Next 
                        week, Emmet Cole may not survive 
                        what he finds in the cave...   I d 
                        be terrified he wouldn t come home.  
                        He always did.
                                (beat)
                        Then six months ago we got the call.

                        I m not alone in loss today.

                        His crew went where they shouldn t.  
                        Because my father... he believed 
                        more than anything that the age of 
                        discovery was only just beginning.                                                                                      5.

                                            LINCOLN (V.O.)
                        Before the Amazon expedition, he 
                        said this was going to be his 
                        greatest discovery.  The one that 
                        changes everything.  He had hope 
                        like most people have troubles...

        BACK ON LINCOLN.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Today we give up hope.
                                (beat)
                        My father spent his life making the 
                        show you all loved.  He missed a 
                        lot of things for it.  I can t tell 
                        you how many times in my life 
                        people ve stopped me and said, 
                         Hey, your dad s my hero.   He was 
                        a lot of people s hero.

                        I wish I could...

        He stops.  Trails off...  Almost getting real for a moment.  
          People in the audience sense the tension.  Uneasy.

          Lincoln looks at his speech.  Three pages to go.  A long 
          beat.  Then... folds up the pages.  Puts on a smile for the 
          crowd.  Finding a booster shot of charm:

                                            LINCOLN
                        Aw hell, my father was the show 
                        more than anything.  Let s watch 
                        some.  Lights, please --

        And somehow every time he says it, it feels true.  The 
          CROWD adores it.  The only one still uncharmed is... 

          Lincoln.  The projected IMAGES overshadow him.  Nothing 
        he s not used to.


        INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - THAT NIGHT

          A CAMERA TEST.  DIFFERENT LENSES TRIED OUT.  FOCUSING ON:                                                                                      6.

        This documentary s PRODUCER.  No accident he s framed with 
        his EMMYS behind him.  He competed for his success.  
          Roughly.  A gift for inserting/extracting himself from the

          Camera finds...  TESS (late 40s now).  Cole s wife.  We 
          recognize her from the old footage.  Time and loss has 
          taken the laugh out of her eyes, replacing it with 
            thoughtfulness.  Determination.  A beat.

                                            TESS
                        We shouldn t do this to him.
                                (Clark holds silent)
                        Yeah.  Let s go.


        EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

        THE TWO CAMERAS follow Tess, into...


        INT. CRAPASS BAR - CONTINUOUS

          A place to get drunk and be left alone.  Tess finds 
          Lincoln, striving for both.  Still in his suit.

                                            TESS
                        You re drinking too much.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Yes, I have that good fortune.

                                            TESS
                        Take a break.  We need to talk.

                                            LINCOLN
                        I had a shitty day.  We buried my 
                        father.  Why are they following 
                        you?

        He means the CAMERAS, the crew.  Following his mother.  
          There s little in life he hates more than being filmed.                                                                                      7.

          (NOTE:  As in a true documentary, characters will swear 
          naturally and we ll BLEEP it out.  Similarly, we won t use 
           fake  brands, only blur out real ones.)

                                            TESS
                        We need to talk.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Turn off the cameras, talk all day.
                              (but the camera stays)
                        I let you cover the memorial, you 
                        have an episode.  Make it a two 
                        hour.  Enough already.

                                            TESS
                        You didn t bury him.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We said goodbye.  We let go.  You 
                        should have been there.

                                            TESS
                        I couldn t come because he s not 
                        dead --

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom -- we had this conversation.  
                        He s legally dead.  He s actually 
                        dead.  I wish he wasn t --

                                            TESS
                        -- He s not dead.  I d know.  I 
                        spent my life with him.  We had no 
                        secrets.  I know everything about 
                        him.  I d know if he was dead.

          Something in her insistence rankles Lincoln, making him 
        less kind than he ought to be.

                                            LINCOLN
                        That s the difference.  I didn t 
                        spend my whole life with him.  My 
                        whole life was waiting for him to 
                        come back from Kenya or Peru for my 
                        birthday, graduation...  You d be 
                        there.  And I d just know he was 
                        gonna make it too...  He never did.  
                        To me, this feels like just another 
                        birthday.  See?  We re talking.  
                        This is fun.

                                            TESS
                        You re pissed at me -- I m sure you 
                        think you have a reason.  I don t 
                        care.  I m going down there.  To 
                        find him.  
                                            (MORE)                                                                                      8.

                                            TESS (CONT'D)
                        Listen to me -- we have a boat -- 
                        we have a crew.  The network is 
                        paying for everything if I let them 
                        shoot --

                          LINCOLNTESS
          What?  You can t go back to -- He knows the Amazon 
        the Amazon --better than anyone, no 
                                                    matter what happened, he d 
                                                    survive there --

                                            LINCOLN
                        Yeah, he would.  He could survive 
                        anywhere, eating bugs and filtering 
                        water through his socks as long as 
                        it took to get to a phone and call 
                        you.  But he didn t.  He didn t.

          A long beat.  Tess drops her bomb.

                                            TESS
                        They found his beacon.  Yesterday.  
                        4:02 PM, Eastern.  The emergency 
                        signal went off.  His personal 
                        frequency.  After six months.

          Lincoln stops.  Weighing the news.  Deciding whether to 
          allow hope back in.

                                            LINCOLN
                        That doesn t -- it could have been 
                        anything.

                                            TESS
                        It could have been him.
                                (then)
                        I m going down there.  We have a 
                        boat and a crew.  We ll find his 
                        ship.  And we ll find him.
                              (and then)
                        I need you to come with me.

        He finishes his drink.  Sets it down.  Striving for calm.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This hasn t been easy for me 
                        either.  I wish he was still alive, 
                        because I have a lot I wish I d 
                        said to him.  I said my goodbyes.  
                        I m done putting my grief on 
                        display --

                                            TESS
                        You had your differences, but he s 
                        your father --                                                                                      9.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom.  Listen to me.  I m going back 
                        to school in a week, I start my 
                        residency in Chicago.  I got a 
                        really good placement -- they 
                        approved my research on the NMDA 
                        mouse, the allosteric site, so I 
                        can work on my PhD too.  You might 
                        even be proud.  Come visit.

        He kisses her, tosses a few bills.  Walks out.  Tess 
          follows, out to --


        EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

          CAMERA JOSTLES, FOLLOWING, as --

                                            TESS
                        I need you, Lincoln.  I need you.

                                            LINCOLN
                              (had it)
                        No -- I gave enough to him -- that 
                        show.  He missed my life to inspire 
                        a billion people I could give a 
                        shit about.  For the  500 million 
                        undiscovered species.   You know 
                        what animals are to me?  Chicken, 
                        steak, bacon.  Lab rat.  Amazon is 
                        a website.  There s no magic out 
                        there.  I m not going --

                                            TESS
                        They won t pay if you don t go --

        This stops him.  Tess s voice breaks.  Small.

                                            TESS
                        The network.  They said it s both 
                        of us or no show...  I can t do it 
                        without you.

          Disbelief.  Lincoln looks to camera.  We catch CLARK.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You re serious?

                                            CLARK
                        That s the deal.  We pay for the 
                          expedition.  As long as it takes to 
                        find him.  But we get full 
                        unfettered access.  To both of you.

          Lincoln ignores Clark.  He hates him.  Talks low, to Tess:                                                                                    10.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Why?  They know Dad and I hated 
                        each other.

          Clark shoots straight.  Maybe even enjoying it:

                                            CLARK
                        That s why we want you.

                                            TESS
                                (beat)
                        Please...  Lincoln...  I need you.

        HOLD ON LINCOLN.  Seeing his mother.  So desperate.  They 
        may have their problems, their fights... but she s still 
        his mother.  And she s suffering.  And we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          SUPER CLOSE ON:  SAMMY S FACE.  OUR SECOND CAMERAMAN (25, 
        cool side of gearhead, MythBusters chic, game for 
          anything).  He tests the works on a WIDE-ANGLE CAMERA.

                                            SAMMY
                        We re good.   Eject Laserbeak! 

        AND HE... THROWS THE CAMERA!  INSTEAD OF FALLING, IT... 
          TAKES OFF... INTO THE AIR!  RISING HIGHER!  OVER...

        THE AMAZON RIVER!

          CHYRON:  DAY 2.  TONANTINS, BRAZIL.  AMAZONAS.

        WIDE ANGLES taken from A REMOTE CONTROLLED PLANE, dorkily 
          named  LASERBEAK  to the amusement of few.

          A STUNNING AERIAL VIEW OF THE S.S. HOPEWELL (a Red Cross 
          rescue vessel) chugging around a snaky bend in the river.

        The DRONE catches incredible shots no helicopter can.  
          Swooping insanely CLOSE to the emergent layer of the trees... 
          skimming the water alongside river dolphins who actually 
          wave... goosing a flock of herons, scattering them...


        EXT. RIVER / S.S. HOPEWELL - MAIN DECK - DAY

          CAMERA FINDS LINCOLN --

        On the bow.  He came.  He s scraping down a heavy dredge, 
        no stranger to hard work.  He takes a moment to stare out 
        at the endless rainforest lining the Amazon... the red and 
          purple crush of bromeliads... the kapoks and orchids and 
          water lilies.  God s fattest brushstrokes.                                                                                    11.

                                            CLARK (O.S.)
                        Pretty amazing, right?

                                            LINCOLN
                                (right into camera)
                        Go fuck yourself.

        He walks off, hauling more gear.  Camera lands on Clark.

                                            CLARK
                        He ll come around.

          LASERBEAK CAMERA POV AS -- IT FLIES BACK TO THE BOAT... 
          right up to Sammy.  HE CATCHES IT.  Brings it in.  Pleased 
        with himself, Sammy points the camera to a self-portrait, 
        the river behind him.  Waves like a doof.

          CHYRON:  SAMMY KIRSCH, SECOND CAMERAMAN.

                                            SAMMY
                        Hello!  I m on the Amazon!  Not a 
                        lot of other Jews out here!

        THE LEAD CAMERAMAN, ADJAY (tattoos, pretty much a dick), 
        PANS the TEN CREWMEN, shouting back and forth in SPANISH 
        and PORTUGUESE.  If you re white here, you stand out.

          ADJAY SHOOTS HIS OWN INTRO SHOT IN A MIRROR.  Toasts his 
          reflection with a BEER, then points where his CHYRON should 
        come up.  It does, right where he suggests:  ADJAY 
            CHANDRASEKARAN, LEAD CAMERAMAN.  (CHYRONS continue to 
          identify people as needed.)

                                            ADJAY
                        I just want to catch the close up 
                        when we find Cole s corpse and we 
                        get the wife crying.  Money shot.

        He finishes his beer, about to chuck it overboard.  TESS 
          GRABS IT.  WHACKS him upside the head.  She s CAPTAIN here.

                                            TESS
                        We re a green ship.  No waste.  
                        Nothing Emmet hated more than trash 
                        on the river.
                                (looks out)
                        Storm coming before we hit Tef .  
                        Don t throw up.


        INT. BRIDGE - LATER THAT DAY

          RAINING AGAINST THE WINDOW.  The fickle rainforest storms.  
        The boat ROCKS pukeably.  Get used to it.                                                                                    12.

        Tess steers them down the choppy river.  She holds a SONAR 
          SIGNAL FINDER, TRACKING THE BEACON.  It s miles ahead.  She 
          looks out, as if she could already see him.  Hoping.


        INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY

          Cramped quarters.  Noisy.  Where EMILIO feels most at home.  
        He s here too.  Sanding down a dinged prop.

                                            EMILIO
                        This Red Cross thing, this is no 
                        ship.  This is a boat.  The Magus, 
                        she s a ship.  I sail her for Doc 
                        23 years.

        JUMP CUT:  He fits the propeller onto an outboard engine.

                                            EMILIO
                        Year ago, Doc s fueling for the 
                        Amazon, he say,  Emilio, you don t 
                        come on this trip, go home.   I 
                        say,  Fuck you, this is my home.   
                        Next morning, they left without me.  
                        Left me keys to his sailboat, note 
                        says it s my pension.  After 23 
                        years.  I thought he was mad at me.
                                (beat)
                        Now I see.  He wanted to protect me.

                                            CLARK (O.S.)
                        Why did he want to protect you?

                                            EMILIO
                        Because of my daughter.

          Camera FINDS JAHEL VALENZUELA (ha-yel).  Not a lick of 
          English, but as good a mechanic as her father.  Liability 
          beautiful.  17, so don t even think it for at least a year.

                                            EMILIO
                        God hates me, I know.  Or he would 
                        have made her ugly.

          Sammy s camera lingers.  She s annoyed by it.  And him. 

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Hey there.  So you can, uh... fix 
                        things...

        She looks at him.  Answers in PORTUGUESE.  SUBTITLED:

        EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY

          Camera looks over Lincoln s shoulder at a MAP of the river, 
        then -- COMMOTION -- CAMERA JERKS to see:

          REESE BYRNE, (40s) a soldier s comportment, a boxer s 
          economy of movement.  Dedication and efficacy rubbed deep 
        into his skin.  Reese DRAGS a CREW MEMBER by his neck, 
          already has him zip-tied.  CHYRON:  CAPT. REESE BYRNE 
          (RETIRED), PRIVATE SECURITY.

        In one swift move Reese CUTS the zip tie and HURLS him over 
        the side of the boat -- onto shore.  Thrown off.

                                            REESE
                        Caught him trying to get into my 
                        gun safe.

          A slow turn back to the remaining CREW MEMBERS.  A warning.  
          Without words.  None needed.


        INT. BRIDGE - DAY

        ON REESE, checking the BEACON S LOCATION against a MAP.  
          Lincoln acting helmsman.  He knows his way around a boat.

                                            LINCOLN
                        How far are we?

                        Four kilometers.  We re close.

                        It s a rough map up there, Ma am.  
                        Drug runners here, hijackers here, 
                        civil war here and here -- and 
                        these folks... they re just bad.

                        Then get ready.


        INT. PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

          Reese brought guns, a Bible, and little else.  He re-
          inventories his guns, like a catechism.  Looks to camera:                                                                                    14.

                        Where we re headed... I m one of 
                        maybe twenty people on Earth who 
                        can say I ve seen worse and not be 
                        lying to get laid.  Folks like Mrs. 
                        Cole, they don t know how lucky 
                        they are they hired me.

        WE HEAR A SHOUT FROM ABOVE -- SOMEONE FOUND SOMETHING --

          SAMMY S CAMERA POV -- FOLLOWING REESE -- RUNNING TOPSIDE.  
          Sammy SLIPS on the deck, falls.  Looks at his Converse.  
          Definitely the wrong shoes for this.


        EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

        FIND TESS -- holding the signal detector.  It CHIMES 
          LOUDLY.  The BEEPS tight together.  She points ahead.

                                            TESS
                        The beacon s close!  That way!

        JUMP CUTTING as we get CLOSER.  The BEEPS on top of each 
          other now.  This is it.  What they came all this way to 
          find.  JUMP CUT:  BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP --


        EXT. RIVER / SHORELINE - MOMENTS LATER

        All hands in the river.  Combing everywhere.  Yelling in 
          three languages.  Floodlights probe the dark water.

          Camera catches MOVEMENT in the water -- a croc?

          Lincoln pushes ahead, furthest one out there.  Wading 
          through the marsh deep into the river, unafraid.

                        HERE!  Found something.

        THE BEEPING CONTINUES -- LOUDER -- AS WE --

        JUMP CUT:  SPLASHING IN THE WATER -- A HOOK ROOTS AROUND, 
          CATCHES SOMETHING --

        JUMP CUT:  A PIECE OF METAL SURFACES --

        JUMP CUT:  A WINCH CRANKS, TUGGING.  SOMETHING HEAVY IN THE 
          CHURNING WATER.  FINALLY -- IT COMES UP:

        AN ALUMINUM DIVING CAGE.  DENTED.  THE SHOW LOGO ON IT.  
          INSIDE...  THE SIGNAL BEACON.  NOTHING ELSE.  IT S EMPTY.                                                                                    15.


        EXT. BOW - LATER

        The smashed diving cage is splayed out.  Tess, Lincoln, 
          Emilio, Reese inspect.  All disheartened.

                                            REESE
                        I don t want to be the one to tell 
                        you what this looks like --

                                            TESS
                        I know what it looks like.  We 
                        don t know he was in that cage.

        She feels the weight of her own wishful thinking.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Whoever was, it was a long time 
                        ago.  That much oxidization, it 
                        could have been in the water three, 
                        four months.

                                            TESS
                                (holding faith)
                        Someone turned on the signal.  
                        Someone wanted us to come.

          Emilio has been going over the damaged cage.  Confused.

                                            EMILIO
                        It s backward.  Diving cage, when 
                        they break, something try to get 
                        in.  This lock, it was broke the 
                        other way...  Something try to get 
                        out.  Something strong.

          Everyone goes quiet.  Not sure what that means.  Not sure 
        of their next move.  Lincoln says what they re thinking.  
          Gentle with his mother s feelings:

                                            LINCOLN
                        The beacon s a dead end, Mom.  We 
                        got what we came for.  We have an 
                        answer.  We re done.

                                            TESS
                        No.  We keep going.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We don t even have a direction.

                                            TESS
                        I ll find one.

        Tess walks out.  HOLD ON THE BEACON.  A dead end.                                                                                    16.


          INT./EXT. S.S. HOPEWELL - VARIOUS - NIGHT

        THE MOON shines huge and star-supported in the unpolluted 
        sky.  The boat CHUGS on.  Crew wound down.  CAMERA GRABS:

        -- Tess combs the map for an idea.  Absolutely not crying.

        -- Lincoln tries to read on an iPad.  The light from the 
          screen draws fat BUGS.  He flicks them off.

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        What do you think?  Where to next?

                                            LINCOLN
                        Go fuck yourself.

        He walks out of frame.  Perfect place to... FADE TO BLACK.


        EXT. AMAZON RIVER - SUNRISE

          A GORGEOUS SUNRISE.  LASERBEAK S AERIAL FOOTAGE OF THE 
          RIVER.  Its epic beauty and mystery.  A sky alive with

        EXT. STERN - DAY

        Lena steps aboard off a dinghy.  Ready for a fight.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This place is dangerous, you 
                        shouldn t be here --

                        The beacon was a dead end.  We 
                        don t even know where to look.

        INT. BRIDGE - LATER

        Lena opens a touch screen.  AERIAL PICTURES, A DIGITAL MAP.

                        I modeled tide patterns from the 
                        beacon s location, came up with six 
                        probables.  This was the sixth.

                        It s river.  I flew three passes.  
                        It forks off at the Yutay.

          Something about this makes Emilio nervous.  His eyes flick 
        to his daughter, quiet Jahel.

        Tess pulls up GOOGLE MAPS of the region.  ON SCREEN:  ALL 
          IMAGES of the region are sharp and amazing...  EXCEPT THE

                        It s there.  I m telling you.  The 
                        river goes right through, branching 
                        East far as I could see.

                        No --

        All stop.  Look to Jahel.  She s never spoken up before.

                        That is the Boi na.  We cannot go 
                        there.  It is [UNTRANSLATABLE].

          Beat.  No one sure how to take her outburst.  Except Tess.

        EXT. MAIN DECK - MOMENTS LATER

        In private, Emilio tries to talk to Tess.  They speak in

                        The river there... nobody sails.  
                        The locals won t go near it.

                        Not this.  That is the Boi na.  The 
                        Black Snake.  The Boat Eater.  They 
                        believe it is full of spirits... 
                        bad magic... a... door to the

                        Every turn of the Amazon has some 
                        superstition or curse to keep out 
                        white people -- I m not here to cut 
                        down rainforest and grow coffee, 
                        I m trying to find Emmet -- 

          Reese comes.  Bad news in his eyes.

                        It s not going to be that easy.  I 
                        spoke to the captain -- the crew 
                        won t cross into the Boi na.  They 
                        don t want any part of it.

                        Not without trying to gut us first.

          Beat.  But Tess is undaunted.

                        Fine.  Get them to take us as far 
                        as the Yutay.  It s a day from 
                        there.  We ll make our own way.

        The Team exchanges looks, uncertain, and we -- CUT TO:


          A CAMERA SKIMS A CENTIMETER OVER THE RIVER S SURFACE --

        EXT. RIVER / ZODIAC - MORNING

        TWO ZODIACS (high impact rubber lifeboats) motor down 
          river.  OUR TEAM OF NINE -- Tess, Lincoln, Lena, Reese, 
          Emilio, Jahel, Clark, Adjay, and Sammy -- split over two.  
        They reach a FORK.  The mouth of the Boi na (bo-YU-nah) is 
          OBSCURED by thick, low hanging trees.  Something meant to 
        be hidden.  CHYRON:  DAY 4.

        ON ZODIAC 1

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        Pull ashore.  I want to get a shot 
                        of them crossing into the Boi na 
                        through the turtles.

                        We re losing light, shoot from here.                                                                                    20.

                        Use the B-7 filter at 24 and hold 
                        fucking steady.  I m not stopping.

        Tess GUNS her outboard engine.  Moving through the canopy.

        ON ZODIAC 2 -- ON CLARK, GRINNING AT HOW TESS CAN BE.

                                            CLARK
                        Not a lot of people know but... 
                        Cole s whole show was her concept.  
                        He always said, without Tess he d 
                        be teaching high school biology...  
                        Might ve been better off.

        And with that, the Zodiacs enter into the Boi na.  Into the 
          mist.  This is no longer merely the Amazon.  But a place 
          alive with its own awareness.  Quieter.  The water softly 
          rippling.  The INSECTS and BIRDS CALLING in new harmony.

        ON LENA AND LINCOLN

        Side by side on Zodiac 2.  An awkwardness between them.  A 
        long history neither plans to address on film.

                        Thought I d hear from you at some 
                        point.  After they went missing.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Sorry.  Just school...  The lab.

                        How s that going?  Make a new mouse 
                        yet?

                                            LINCOLN
                        Not yet.  Won an award.

                        And now the world is one base pair 
                        closer to a selectively activated 
                        NR2C in the internal granule cell 
                        layer of the mus musculus 
                          cerebellum.  Journal of Transgenics

                        You published your first article.  
                        Wouldn t miss it.

        He s surprised.  It actually means a lot to him.                                                                                    21.

                                            CLARK (O.S.)
                        That sounds... incredibly boring.

                                            LINCOLN
                        That s the point.  Beautifully 
                        boring.  Science isn t great big 
                        wonder anymore.  There are no huge 
                          discoveries left to be made.  Now, 
                        it s the steady push to fathom the 
                        details.  Micronic advancement.  
                        One base pair at a time.

                                            CLARK (O.S.)
                        You don t see magic out here?

          Camera PANS their gorgeous surroundings.  Lincoln gets what 
        he s gunning for --

                                            LINCOLN
                        You want me to wax poetic about the 
                        river... nature?  The Amazon is 68 
                        hundred kilometers long and lined 
                        with plastic bottles, cans, drug 
                        runners, and villages of people so 
                        poor they d be kings if they had 
                        just a week s trash of a family 
                        from Encino.  My father cut around 
                        what wasn t convenient to make the 
                        world look like it still had magic 
                        in it -- well it doesn t.  It has a 
                        million things that could ve killed 
                        him and one of them finally did.

                                            CLARK (O.S.)
                        Okay.  Then why d you come?

          Beat.  Lincoln has no answer.  Then --

          Seemingly from nowhere... a CLOUD OF DRAGONFLIES descends.  
          Surrounding them.  Brilliant blue.  The same Zenithoptera 
        Cole showed us in our opening shot.

        They engulf the boats.  Delicately.  As if for no other 
          reason than to enchant.  Crawling over them.  Landing on 
          their hands.  A truly magical moment.  Just for them.

        Even Lincoln can t help being charmed.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Okay that s pretty cool.

          Suddenly -- the dragonflies all disperse.  Scattering in a 
          single mass.  As if sensing something.

        Tess stands -- seeing it first.  They come round a bend in 
        the river... until... WE ALL SEE IT --                                                                                    22.

                        It s her.

        THE MAGUS.  COLE S BOAT.

        As much a character as any of our players.  A 70 footer, 
          powerful twin engines, currently afoul.  Wants a crew of 
        12, but can be handled by just one.  A pad on top holds a 
          badly damaged two-seater HELICOPTER.

        The ship is trapped in a shallow split of land.  Nose in 
        the mud.  Ass in the muck.  Hull beaten up.  Overgrown with 
        six months  worth of aggressive greenery.

        EXT. THE MAGUS - MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

        They fan out -- walking carefully over the inclined, mossy 
          deck.  They can see what bad shape the ship is in -- 
          clearly stuck here for months.  Tess fights fear --

                                            TESS
                        Is anyone here?  Hello!

        No answer.

        THEN -- A BELLOW ECHOES THROUGH THE SWAMP -- LIKE A GROWL -- 
        PART HUMAN, PART... NOT.  THEY ALL FREEZE --

                        The hell was --  HELLO!

        Tess shushes him.  Listening.  Quiet.  Nothing but the wind 
          through the trees.  Then --

          BANG!  BANGBANGBANG!  BANG!

          A rhythmic POUNDING -- COMING FROM BELOW THEM!

                        That was from inside -- someone s

        EXT. THE MAGUS - BOW - SUNRISE (PERSONAL INTERVIEW)

        ON CLARK -- taking it all in from the bow of The Magus, 
          which is RUNNING, sailing through the clear morning.  A 
          magical place.  A rare moment of introspection.

                                            CLARK
                        I liked Emmet.  We were colleagues 
                        a long time.  Argued a lot.  Won a 
                        lot of awards as a result.  What he 
                        never got is that all this wasn t 
                        about adventure.  It was a product.  
                        His show s syndicated around the 
                        world.  Translated into 65 
                        languages.  He sold them a belief 
                        in fantasy.   Magic.   So yeah, 
                        we re getting another bunch of 
                        episodes out of him, alive or dead.  
                        And it gives Tess something to do.
                                (beat)
                        He barely saw a dime.  He didn t 
                        care.  Just wanted to find new 
                        kinds of monkey.
                                (beat)
                        Hope we find him.

        Hard to tell if we believe him.

          NOTE:  This is our first example of a convention of the 
          show:  At times beginning acts with private interviews, 
        from other, safer times -- providing personal contrast --

        INT. THE MAGUS - DAY (RESUME)

        The Team RUSHES THROUGH the ship.  It s dark, cramped, 
          scuffed, tilted scary.  You re probably wishing we were 
        back on The Hopewell.  No such luck.  We live here now.

                        Emilio, get the gennie running, we 
                        need lights.

          Camera pans the ship.  Everything askew.  A SNAKE works its 
        way across the floor.  STAINS in strange places.

        DEEP GASHES DUG INTO THE METAL WALLS.

          Reese finds a METAL PIPE, uses it to BANG THE WALL.                                                                                    24.

        No answer.  He hits again, twice.  Then -- TWO BANGS BACK.  
        An intelligent response.  THEY FOLLOW IT TO --


        INT. LOWER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

        Even darker here, making them rely on the CAMERA LIGHTS.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Hello!  Is anyone here!

          BANG!  BANG!

                                            TESS
                        Coming from the panic room.


        INT. LOWER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

        They run.  A foot of fetid WATER on the floor.  They stop 
        in front of a heavy STEEL DOOR.  The source of the sound.  
        Tess POUNDS on it.

                                            EMILIO
                        We made the safe into a panic room, 
                        for in case of hijackers.

                                            TESS
                        Emmet!  Is that you?  Can you hear 
                        us -- we re here! --
                              (to the rest)
                        Open it.

                        It closes from the inside.

          Lincoln runs his fingers along the door s edge.

                                            LINCOLN
                        It s welded shut.  From the outside.

                                            REESE
                        Why would someone --

          WHAM!  WHAM!  Whatever s inside SHOULDERS against the door.  
          RATTLING THE HALL.  They startle.  But then... hope.  
          SOMEONE S INSIDE.  Tess SHOUTS to the door.

                                            TESS
                        We re here!  Listen -- we re here!  
                        Save your strength!   We re going 
                        to get you out.

          A small KNOCK of understanding.  Followed by sad 
          SCRATCHING.  Like a dog locked outside.  JUMP CUT TO:                                                                                    25.

          SPARKS -- FLYING OFF THE DOOR.

          Reese CUTS with a circular saw.  Lincoln keeps tension on 
        the door with a crowbar.  Rough work.  Lincoln doesn t 
          care.  His father -- or Lena s -- may actually be alive.

                                            REESE
                        This is gonna be a while.

                        Get a med kit, prep an IV -- who 
                        knows what shape they could be in.

        Lena goes.  Reese and Lincoln keep at it.  All the while, 
        that PAWING on the door from inside.

          Camera PANS THE WALLS.  Lines of SCRATCHES here too.


        INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

        The SAW ECHOES as... Clark and Tess find the editing suite.  
          A small room, PACKED with equipment, Avids, endless memory 
          towers, HUNDREDS of tapes.  And the heart of the room:

        104 SCREENS OF VARIOUS SIZE.  Like casino surveillance.

          A HUM FROM BELOW, THE GENERATOR COMES TO LIFE.  A SIREN 
          BLARES -- jolting them.  Quickly killed.  LIGHTS COME ON 
          THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.  The power is back on.

          Clark smiles, flicks on the video equipment.

        OVER HALF THE SCREENS COME TO LIFE.  MOUNTED CAMERAS FROM 
        ALL OVER THE SHIP.  STILL WORKING.  THE Magus HAS BEEN 
          WIRED WITH 104 CAMERAS, ALL NIGHT-VISION EQUIPPED, ABLE TO 
          CATCH ACTION ALL OVER THE BOAT.  INSIDE AND OUT, ABOVE AND 
          BELOW, BOW TO STERN.  EVEN A META-CAM COVERING THIS EDITING 
        BAY OVERHEAD.  ADJAY FILMS IT FILMING HIM, WAVES.

          Clark works the controls.  The camera overhead ZOOMS, 
          SWIVELS, TRACKING.  He lights up like a sparkler.

                                            CLARK
                        Hello old friend.

        In addition to Sammy and Adjay s cameras, we now have 
          access to all these.  WHICH WE CUT BETWEEN FREELY.  The 
          coverage game just exploded wide open.

                                            CLARK
                              (to Adjay)
                        Get the rest up.  I want every inch 
                        of this boat covered.  Get the 
                        editing bay live too -- log it all, 
                        we can cut as we go --                                                                                    26.

                                            TESS
                        Hold on.  You don t cut.  I cut.  
                        This is Emmet s bay, he had final 
                        say over every episode.

                                            CLARK
                        You re not him.  Unless he walks 
                        out of that safe, this is my bay.

        On Tess, her frustration covered by the overhead camera.  
        She looks to the MONITOR covering Reese as he CUTS into the 
          panic room.  Hopeful.


        INT. CORRIDOR - VARIOUS - DAY

        THE MOUNTED CAMERAS FIND LENA.  JUMP CUT THROUGH her 
          movements as we FOLLOW HER -- searching around the ship.  
          Unaware she can be seen.  Looking for something.

        She stops at -- A FOOT LOCKER.  Takes out a KEY, tries it.  
          Doesn t fit.  The LIGHTS FLICKER, grow BRIGHTER, as we --


        INT. ENGINE ROOM - THAT MOMENT

          Emilio tunes the generator, which HUMS louder.  Making the 
          LIGHTS throughout the ship BRIGHTEN.

          Emilio looks.  This is his and Jahel s room on the boat.  
        It s in shambles.  The engine, his baby, is beaten up.  
          METAL TWISTED.  DEEP GASHES.  Three inches of water on the 
          floor.  It hurts to look.  In PORTUGUESE, SUBTITLED:

                                            EMILIO
                          I should ve died young and drunk.  
                        Hard to see her like this.

                                            JAHEL
                        They shouldn t open it.

        She means the safe.  Emilio knows that look.  Fear.  It 
          makes her look 10 again.

                                            EMILIO
                        Doc could be inside.

                                            JAHEL
                        It s not him...  It s not him.

          Strange certainty.  Emilio s reaction suggests a bad memory.  
        He pushes it down.  Returns to the solidity of the engine.

                                            EMILIO
                        Help me take this apart.  See if 
                        there s hope for her.                                                                                    27.


        INT. EMMET S QUARTERS - DAY

        Tess enters alone.  She spent a good part of her life in 
        this room.  Sees the sad state of it, everything overturned.

          A fallen PHOTO of Emmet, Tess and Lincoln.  Happier days.  
        His FILE SAFE -- LOCKED.  His HAT.  Tess picks it up.  
          Feels for a moment like she s cradling his neck.

                                            TESS
                        Please be in there...

        Then sees ON THE FLOOR:  A SMALL, WATERPROOF CAMCORDER.


        INT. GALLEY - DAY

          Lena, Clark crowd around Tess as she sets fresh batteries 
        into the camcorder.  Turns it on, heart racing.

          (NOTE:  This will be our first taste of what the peak 
          horror moments of this show are like:  THE SUBJECT IS NEVER 
        SEEN STRAIGHT ON -- BUT IN HALF-CAUGHT MOMENTS -- MOVING 
          CAMERAS -- SUBJECTIVE GLIMPSES OF TERROR.  Something for 
        the audience to imagine -- and speculate on -- and post 
          about online -- and rewind a dozen times until they re 
          convinced it s safe to fall asleep.)

          COLE S LAST IMAGES RECORDED PLAY ON THE SMALL SCREEN:

          A CRISP DAY.  A pretty shot as he tracks a brightly colored 
        tree frog.  Then -- an abrupt shift to --

          NIGHT.  A RUNNING SHOT THROUGH THE MAGUS.  AS IF CHASED.  
          CLOSE, CRAMPED.  HARD TO SEE.  SCREAMS:   THIS WAY!    GO! 

          A BLOW -- THE CAMERA IS DROPPED -- SOMEONE FALLS -- AN 
          ANIMAL GROWL -- CRUNCH OF BONE --

        AN ARM FALLS INTO FRAME -- SEVERED -- THE RECORDING ENDS.

        Tess DROPS the camcorder.

                                            TESS
                        That s the kitchen --


        INT. KITCHEN GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

        PAN around as Tess enters.  The space matches the camcorder 
          footage.  Tess pulls at the overturned stove.  Too heavy.  
          Clark helps her.  SCREECHING as it DRAGS, REVEALING:

          Right where it fell in the video:  A HUMAN ARM.  
          Desiccated.  Tattered sleeve still attached.                                                                                    28.


        INT. LOWER CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE PANIC ROOM - DAY

          Reese still cutting.  Not slowing, despite the heat.  The 
        saw blade glows with the effort.  Lincoln still at his 
          side.  Both washed in sweat.

          Clark and Tess watch, impatient after their discovery.

        The pawing at the door has STOPPED.

                                            TESS
                        How long is this gonna take?

          Reese just keeps cutting.

                        Any one of those missing men could 
                        be trapped in there, for who knows 
                        how long.  My father -- Lena s --

                        No it isn t.

                        The portal.

                        Tide s up, I can dive under.

                        This used to be a smuggling ship, 
                        there s a portal underneath they 
                        used to unload drugs.  We used to 
                        play in here, swim under, scare the 
                        hell out of everyone.  My Dad bolted 
                        it shut.  Maybe he can cut through.

                                            CLARK
                        Hold it -- this isn t diving water, 
                        there could be piranha down there --

                                            LINCOLN
                                (masking fear)
                        Then you get one hell of an episode.


        EXT. AFT DECK - DAY

          Lincoln is in diving gear.  He lugs cutting tools, and a 
          handheld underwater camera platform.  KNIFE sheathed to his 
          thigh.  Sammy fits his MASK with a WATERPROOF CAMERA.                                                                                    29.

                        Be careful.  Please.

          A look between them.  A reminder that, despite everything, 
          she d die if anything happened to him.  A final moment, 
          Lincoln finding his courage and -- he jumps in the water --


        EXT. UNDERWATER - SCUBA FOOTAGE - DAY

          BUBBLES rise all around.  Labored scuba BREATHING.  Enough 
          sediment in the water to make long solid fingers of sunlight.

          Lincoln hugs the underside of the boat.  Skirts the viney 
          undergrowth.  Finds the HATCH.  PULLS it hard as he can.  

        It won t budge.  He LIGHTS an UNDERWATER BLOWTORCH, as --

          Directly below, a YELLOW-SPOTTED AMAZON STINGRAY breaks 
          camouflage.  Rising from the swampy bottom...

          HEADED RIGHT FOR HIM.  Lincoln sees the cloud of dust -- 
          DUCKS in time -- SWIMMING BACKWARDS and away -- into a 
          TANGLE OF VINES.  He tugs to keep from getting caught up in 
        them -- shaking something loose...

          A HUMAN BODY SINKS RIGHT ONTO HIS BACK!

          Mostly bones, limply clinging to him.  OFF LINCOLN S 
          UNDERWATER SCREAM -- SMASH TO:


        EXT. MAIN DECK - SUNSET

          A fireworks SUNSET, toybox colors, as the day gives out.

        The Team stands around the full corpse.  Full minus an ARM.  
        What flesh left shredded.  Lena s almost too afraid to ask.

                                            LENA
                        Who was it?

        Tess inspects the severed HAND.  A RING still on it.

        Tess holds Lena s hand.  Lincoln inspects the body.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This was brutal.  Compression 
                        fractures at the neck, vertebrae 
                        completely crushed.  Traumatic 
                          spondylolisthesis of C2, hangman s

                        And the arm wasn t cut -- it was 
                        torn out.  Complete avulsion like 
                        that, you need 2,000 psi of force.  
                        Like a car.  Or a bear.

                        basket.  You know this because 
                        you re, what, half a doctor?

                                            LINCOLN

                        yet.  I should be back in Chicago 
                        picking up the other half.  But I m

                                (rising)
                        We re almost into the safe.  
                        Everyone be ready.


        INT. LOWER CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

        THE SAW SPITS SPARKS.  Finally, Reese flicks it off.

                                            REESE
                        We re in.

        All tense.  It s time.  Lena has the medkit.  Reese grips 
        his sidearm.  Lincoln turns the handle -- A METAL CLUNK.

        He swings the vault door slowly.

        An acrid smell makes them cringe.  Darkness inside.

          Lincoln steps in, followed by camera.

          Steps past shredded cloth hanging from the ceiling.

          Steps on rotted food.  SOMETHING RUSTLES in the back.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Hello -- who s in here?

          A lump of blankets MOVES, as if rising and falling, as if 
        with shallow breaths.  Lincoln moves to it.

          KICKING A WOODEN OBJECT OUT OF THE WAY.

        He crouches low.  Reaches out a hand.  Touches the blanket.

          Slowly begins to peel it back.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We re here to help.                                                                                    31.

          Peels it back further.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Dad?

          Suddenly, the thing under the blanket STOPS MOVING -- 

        AND SCREAMS -- JERKS FORWARD -- TOO FAST TO SEE -- 

        IT KNOCKS LINCOLN BACK -- RACES THROUGH THE OTHERS --

        OUT OF THE VAULT --

        LENA IS THROWN DOWN --  SCREAMS -- REESE S GUN FIRES --


        INT. CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

          CAMERA FOLLOWS AN INDISTINCT FORM -- IT CHITTERS AWAY --

          A WINDOW SHATTERS, BLOWS OUT -- IT ESCAPES TO --

          CAMERA COMES OUT -- LOOKS AROUND -- HEARING MOTION --

        SEES NOTHING BUT WATER -- AND NIGHT -- AND A TERRIFIED CREW.

        ACT THREE

        FADE IN:


        INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY (PERSONAL INTERVIEW)

          Emilio nurses The Magus s engine, which RUNS.  Promising 
          better days ahead.

                                            EMILIO
                        When she was small, five, six, 
                        Jahel, she slept there --
                                (points under a shelf)
                        Always like a rock. One night she 
                        comes to me, I play cards upstairs 
                        with Doc, and she says,  Papa, 
                        come, you have to tell Ghost Friend 
                        to be quiet.   I think one of the 
                        new crew is bothering my girl.  I 
                        get my gun.  I come here, I say 
                        which man was it. She says it was 
                        not a man, it was Ghost Friend.  
                        She wants to sleep, but Ghost 
                        Friend... keeps talking to her.  
                         Tell him to be quiet.  So I say, 
                         Ghost friend, be quiet.  A few 
                        days later I ask her if there is 
                        still a voice bothering her. She 
                        says,  No.  No bother.  Ghost 
                        Friend talks more quiet now. 
                                (still unnerved, in 
                                  PORTUGUESE)
                        I did not like this Ghost Friend.

                                                                  SHOCK CUT BACK TO:


        EXT. AFT DECK - NIGHT (RESUME)

          Aftermath of the attack.  BLOOD ON THE FLOOR.  Nerves 
          frayed.  CHYRON:  NIGHT 4.  ABOARD THE MAGUS.  9:07 PM.

          ADJAY AND SAMMY -- film one another.  Sammy on edge.

                                            SAMMY
                        That was fucked.  That was fucked 
                        the fuck up.

                                            ADJAY
                        You think it was gonna be all sea 
                        turtles?  Strap on.

          REESE -- scans the area.  Relieved the Zodiacs are still 
          intact.  Cleated to The Magus, floating in the water.                                                                                    33.

                                            REESE
                        No sign.  Whatever it was is gone 
                        into the trees.  The lifeboats are 
                        fine.

          LINCOLN AND LENA -- he cleans her WOUND, a nasty MOTTLED 
        GASH to her THIGH.  If it hurts -- and it does -- she 
          doesn t let on.

                                            LENA
                        Always thought you d make a good 
                        doctor.  Really hoping I was right.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Sorry.  Only half a doctor.

                                            LENA
                        You ll do.  How bad?

        He threads a needle.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Know how you used to think scars 
                        were sexy?  You re about to be much 
                        sexier.

        He STITCHES.  To take her mind off it, Lena eyes a familiar 
        old mounted barometer.  Pulls it off its hinge.  A small 
          hiding place behind it.

                                            LENA
                        I used to keep pot in there.

                                            LINCOLN
                        I know.  I used to steal it.

          A shared smile.  Some naked high school history to explore 
          someday.  Lincoln finishes.  Dresses her wound.  STOPS --

            A PRETERNATURAL GROWL coats the night.  Whatever that thing 
          was... it s out there.  Distant.  Not far enough.

        They catch eyes.  Nervous to be in the open.  Lincoln helps 
        Lena up.  Follow them into...


        INT. GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

          ...Where Tess looks over Emmet s camcorder.  The ATTACK 
          FOOTAGE.  The SOUNDS.  The savagery.  A FORM THE CAMERA 
          CAN T FOCUS ON.  SO SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY JUST SAW.

                                            CLARK
                        You think it was the same thing 
                        that was in the panic room?                                                                                    34.

                                            TESS
                        What the hell was it?

                                            REESE
                                (unfazed)
                        Probably just a panther.  Must ve 
                        gone through a vent as a baby, grew 
                        too big to get out.  I ll look.

          Panther?  No one s buying it.  Lincoln looks to his mother, 
        not liking this.  The full measure of his patience spent.


        INT. PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

          Reese s FLASHLIGHT scans THE PANIC ROOM.  Gun cocked.  
          Emilio beside him, finding the nerve to step in.

          Jahel comes in behind him with none of his hesitation.

        They look at the blankets.

                                            REESE
                        No scat.  That was no animal.

          Something on the floor:  A GUN.  Distinct.  Ivory-handled.

        They step out.  Completely overlooking A WOODEN BOWL on the 
          floor (the one we saw under the blanket).  A CLASP with a 
        LID to seal it tight.

          Jahel sees it.  Picks it up.  Turns it in her hands.

        Sees it is stained on the inside with DRIED BLOOD.


        INT. GALLEY - NIGHT

          Reese puts that GUN on a table for the Team to see.

                                            REESE
                        That mean anything to anyone?

                                            EMILIO
                        It belong to one of the missing.  
                        Cam Travers, the field producer.  
                        Your job.
                              (off Clark, spits)
                        Was a son of a bitch.

        Lena registers the name.  She knows something.  Hesitates --

                                            LENA
                        Before they went missing, Emmet 
                        said Travers caught a fever.  They 
                        thought he wouldn t make it.                                                                                    35.

                                            TESS
                                (beat, surprised)
                        Emmet spoke to you.  From here?

                                            LENA
                                (making light of it)
                        Emailed.  He had some questions 
                        about how to back up files.  Always 
                        worried about a server crash.

          Camera HOLDS ON LENA.  If it s a lie, it s a good one.


        INT. CORRIDORS - VARIOUS - LATER THAT NIGHT

        Lena walks, limping.  Her leg freshly dressed.  MOUNTED 
          CAMERAS follow as she resumes her secret search, unaware 
          cameras can see.  CHYRON:  NIGHT 4.  10:15 PM.

        JUMP CUTS as she checks under benches, floorboards...


        INT. EMMET S ROOM - NIGHT

          Still with Lena.  She peels back an electrical panel and 
          finds... THE LOCKED FILE SAFE.  She tries that KEY again...

        IT OPENS.  Inside:  SHELVES PACKED WITH VIDEOS.  DVDS.  
        Like in the edit bay, but when we ZOOM IN -- 

        WE SEE THEY ARE ALL LABELED IN A STRANGE CODE.  Lena 
          checks, makes sure no one else has seen this.


        INT. CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

          Emilio CROWBARS open a chest.  CANNED GOODS spill out.  
          Water.  Food in bar form.  The boat s reserve.  Lincoln 
          knifes open a can of peaches on a marlinspike, hands it to 
          Jahel.  She doesn t take it.  Upset.  He sets the can down.

          Lincoln and Emilio collect the cans.

                                            LINCOLN
                        All that time you sailed with my 
                        father, you see anything like that?  
                        Any idea what it could be?

                                            EMILIO
                                (beat)
                        Before he fire me... your father 
                        started to spend nights off the 
                        boat.  All night.  By hisself.  No 
                        food, no gear.  I told Doc I worry 
                        about him.  He said I shouldn t 
                        worry.  He was protected.                                                                                    36.

                                            LINCOLN
                        By a gun?

                                            EMILIO
                        By magic.

          Lincoln gives a polite nod.  Ooookay.  Jahel speaks up -- 
          urgent.  SUBTITLED:

                                            JAHEL
                        He does not believe.  Tell him.

                                            EMILIO
                        Eat your peaches.

                                            JAHEL
                        I am no child to be silenced with 
                        treats --

        She shows Lincoln that WOODEN BOWL.  (NOT SUBTITLED).

                                            JAHEL
                        You need to see -- look!  It tasted 
                        blood, it will be stronger now --

          Emilio quiets her in Portuguese.  But she continues.

                                            LINCOLN
                        What s she saying?
                              (to Jahel)
                        You know what that thing was?  It s 
                        okay.  Tell me.

          Jahel locks eyes with her father.  She begins answering.

          Beat.  Then, reluctantly, Emilio TRANSLATES as she speaks, 
          talking over her.  So the legend is spoken in doublets.

                                            JAHEL / EMILIO
                         It was not an animal.  It was 
                        Corpo Seco.  The dry spirit...  A 
                        soul so bitter the ground would not 
                        take him.  And the Devil sent him 
                        back.  So it wanders the land where 
                        it died.  Looking for blood to make 
                        it whole.  More blood, more 
                        strength. 

                                            LINCOLN
                        You think it s some kind of ghost.

        She touches the bowl.  INTERCUT Jahel with NIGHT VISION 
          SHOTS from MOUNTED CAMERAS on the gunwhales, looking off 
        the boat into the wind-strewn night.  A place for ghosts.                                                                                    37.

                        This.  This is Kraho.  From chonta 
                        palm.  Full of tsarutama.  Holy.  
                        The shaman use this to catch the 
                        angry soul.  A soul trapped inside 
                        suffers worse than Hell s heart... 
                        but can hurt no one.
                                (Jahel looks inside)
                        Blood.  Your father trick Corpo 
                        Seco.  It come to drink the blood, 
                        they catch it... close him up 
                        inside...  But we open.  We feed it 
                        blood.  Now it is strong enough.

                                            LINCOLN
                        To what?

                                            JAHEL
                        To hunt us.

        Off Lincoln... fear rising...  SMASH CUT TO:


        INT. CORRIDOR - VARIOUS - MOMENTS LATER

          Lincoln storms through.  On a mission.


        INT. BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

          Lincoln finds Tess studying a map with Clark, Reese, Lena.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We re going.  Right now.  Pack what 
                        you need, everyone on the Zodiacs --

                            TESSCLARK
          What?  --Hang on a minute --

                                            LINCOLN
                        We re not safe.  Someone is out 
                        there -- I don t know if it s an 
                        animal or a guy on drugs -- or just 
                        the crew is on drugs.  But people 
                        died here -- and we could be next --

          Clark finds this ridiculous.  Lena looks uneasy.

                                            TESS
                        Whatever attacked us killed at 
                        least one man on The Magus and 
                        forced it afoul.  Any survivors 
                        would be on foot -- we re isolating 
                        places they might take shelter.  We 
                        are going to find them.  
                                            (MORE)                                                                                    38.

                                            TESS (CONT'D)
                        I am not leaving this close to 
                        finding your father --

                          LINCOLNTESS
        If he s still alive --Someone welded that thing in 
                                                    -- someone survived.

          Holding fast to faith.  Beat.  Reese speaks up.  To Tess.

                                            REESE
                        You re captain here, so this is 
                        your call --

                                            CLARK
                        Excuse me, she is not --

          Reese shuts him right the fuck up with a look that d make a 
        rock shitsquirt.  Turns to Tess.  Voice calm, compelling:

                                            REESE
                        Your son cares about you and that 
                        counts for something.  But you 
                        hired me for a bucket of money to 
                        keep you safe and find your 
                        husband.  I promise you, I can and 
                        will do both of those.  We are 
                        here.  We have a trail.  I intend 
                        to follow it and see your family -- 
                        your entire family -- home safe.  
                        It s your call.

        Tess looks from Reese to Lincoln.  For a rare moment, 
          Lincoln s guarded exterior goes soft.  Goes honest.

                                            LINCOLN
                        I lost my father to this place.  
                        I m not losing two of you.

        The one thing he could leverage to get through.  Love.  
          Under all his resentment.  As much as Tess wants to press 
        on, she can t fight that.  She nods.  Okay...  JUST THEN --

        THE SHIP ROCKS.  VIOLENTLY.  SHOUTS FROM THE MAIN DECK.

                                            LENA (O.S.)
                        Up here!  Something out here! --

        WITH LINCOLN, TESS, REESE, RACING OUT -- THE SHIP LURCHING.


        EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

          Emilio grips the rope from a cleat out to the water -- THE 
        LINE HOLDING ONE OF THE ZODIACS.  SOMETHING is pulling on 
        the boat.  Drawing the line taut.  Like a wild animal 
          caught on the other end --                                                                                    39.

                                            EMILIO
                          Something s stealing the Zodiacs --

                                            JAHEL
                                (SUBTITLED)
                        It doesn t want us to leave.  It 
                        has tasted blood.  It wants more.

          Whatever s on the other end is STRONG -- YANKS the rope 
        from their hands.  THE CLEAT BENDS -- THEN -- RIPS OUT -- 
          WHIPPING THROUGH THE AIR --

          Camera catches the Zodiac DRAG AWAY -- gone.

          REESE FIRES HIS GUN -- FOUR SHOTS -- each FLASH of fire 
          briefly lights up the night.

        THAT FEARSOME BELLOW ECHOES.  MOVEMENT.

                                            LINCOLN
                        It s coming around again...  It s 
                        going for the second boat!

        He races to the rear, where the Zodiac 2 is tied to the 
          anchor line.  The heavy chain YANKS!

          Lincoln reaches for it, leaning over the water, vulnerable.

        He grabs hold -- the chain JERKS --

          LINCOLN IS PULLED FORWARD -- OFF THE BOAT -- HANGING OVER -- 

                                            LINCOLN
                        Help me!

        He s looking to ADJAY S CAMERA -- BUT ADJAY KEEPS FILMING 
          RATHER THAN HELP --

          Sammy drops his camera -- grabbing hold -- he and Reese 
        PULL Lincoln back aboard.  A beat -- 

        THE CHAIN WRENCHES -- THE BOAT QUAKES --

        THE AWFUL SOUND OF METAL TWISTING AS --

        THE ANCHOR CHAIN TEARS OUT OF THE HULL --

        THE LAST ZODIAC DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

          Their only way out.  Gone.

                                                                        SNAP TO BLACK.

                                                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    40.

        ACT FOUR

        FADE IN:


        EXT. THE RIVER - VARIOUS - DAY

          SOARING LASERBEAK FOOTAGE.  The Amazon ROARS.  Volcanic 
          currents.  A reminder of how much power it can wield.


        EXT. S.S. HOPEWELL - FOUR DAYS AGO (PERSONAL INTERVIEW)

          Reese is uncomfortable in front of the camera.

                                            REESE
                        16 years DEVGRU, Blue.  Yeah, I was 
                        Navy.  Now I m not.  Guess I like 
                        my freedom.

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        You ever kill anyone?  How many?

                                            REESE
                                (beat, hard stare)
                        You ask a man how many girls he s 
                        had, what kinda drugs he s tried, 
                        and if he s drunk, what he really 
                        thinks about God.  You don t ask a 
                        man that.

        He walks off.  Interview over.


        INT. GALLEY - NIGHT (PERSONAL INTERVIEW)

        ON TESS, taking a break from her map work.

                                            TESS
                        People always tell me they loved 
                        Emmet s show growing up not because 
                        of the nature or the travel... but 
                        they wanted to be part of our 
                        perfect little family.  That was 
                        the secret sauce.  And it worked 
                        because it wasn t a TV lie.  On 
                        screen we were pretty damn perfect.  
                        Off screen... not too far from it.
                                (beat)
                        I mean we had our problems, sure...  
                        Our secrets...  Who doesn t?

                                                                        SMASH BACK TO:                                                                                    41.


          LINCOLN, COMING AT ADJAY, PISSED FOR LETTING HIM HANG --

                                            LINCOLN
                        Thanks for the help, asshole --


        EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT (RESUME)

        As we left them.  Scared.  Stuck.  Lincoln could kill.  
          Adjay backs up, filming Lincoln s assault on him.  

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        You think I m a fireman?  I don t 
                        save people.  Prime directive.

        BAM!  Lincoln PUNCHES Adjay.  Knocks him on his ass.  Walks 
        off.  Adjay picks himself up, thinks about going after him.  
          Sammy holds him back, shakes his head.  Don t.

                                            ADJAY
                        Fuck him.  I got the shot.

        WITH LINCOLN

          Joining Reese, Tess, Clark, Emilio -- argument already in 
          progress.  CHYRON:  NIGHT 4.  ABOARD THE MAGUS.  2:12 AM.

                                            REESE
                              (mind very changed)
                        We need to leave the Boi na.  Now.

                                            CLARK
                        There is no reason to turn around -- 
                        since when are you scared? --

                                            REESE
                        -- My concern is for this crew s 
                        safety -- and we are not safe here.  
                        Something killed this ship s crew, 
                        now it wants us.

          Reese looks to Tess.  She nods reluctant assent.

                                            CLARK
                        The lifeboats are gone -- best we 
                        can do is wait out the night and 
                        radio for help in the morning.

        As if to answer his point, they hear JUNGLE SOUNDS and 
          MOVEMENT IN THE TREES.  Possibly natural, possibly not.

                                            CLARK
                        We don t know what that is, and we 
                        don t even have any way to leave --                                                                                    42.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Yes we do.
                              (they silence)
                        This -- The Magus.  Emilio, how 
                        long to get her moving?

                                            EMILIO
                        I need to get one of the engines 
                        working, reattach the rudderline, 
                        seal the cracks in the hull...  Two 
                        days.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You have two and a half hours.  
                        Just work the engine, keep us alive 
                        long enough to fix the rest.  Can 
                        you do it?

                                            EMILIO
                        No.  But I will.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We need to be moving by 4:43 AM.

                                            CLARK
                        What happens then?

                                            TESS
                                (catching on)
                        High tide.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We get one chance to shove her out, 
                        be ready.  I ll clear the prop.  
                        Everyone else eyes open, signal if 
                        you so much as see a bug over the 
                        running lights.  Reese, I d like a 
                        gun.

          Reese hesitates, then hands him his sidearm.  Lincoln 
          moves.  All follow to their positions.

                                            CLARK
                              (to Tess)
                        Kid s starting to sound like him.

          Emilio and Jahel hard at work on the engine.  An unspoken 
          choreography from years together.  Father and daughter 
          might not connect in life, but over fuel pumps and exhaust 
          manifolds and oil coolers and sterndrives... they 
          articulate their every thought... wordlessly.                                                                                    43.


        EXT. SWAMP - SHOAL - NIGHT

        JUMP CUT THROUGH as Lincoln strips down -- wades into the 
          waist-high water/sludge at the ship s rear.  Camera 
          (Sammy s) follows him.  He stares right into it -- Really?

                                            LINCOLN
                        At least be useful.  Shoot anything 
                        that s not us.

        He hands Sammy the gun.  Lena comes, strips down to help.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Swamp can t be good for your wound.

                                            LENA
                        It s okay, I know a doctor.

        She wades up.  Together they begin the rather disgusting 
        work of pulling vines and scum out of the prop.  Romantic.    
        Yet these two seem to draw comfort from one another.

                                            LENA
                        Sad seeing The Magus like this.

                                            LINCOLN
                        She was always more of a home to 
                        you than me.  You were the only 
                        thing I ever liked about it.

                                            LENA
                        Not enough to stay.
                                (beat)
                        So Emilio works his hoodoo and we 
                        all get home safe...

        Lena allows some relief.  Lincoln isn t there yet.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This just gives us a chance.  That 
                        thing isn t going to let us just 
                        sail out of here.  And I don t think 
                        it cares if we shoot it.  If we 
                        don t figure out a way to hurt it...

        We won t make it.

          A FLUTTER in the distance makes them freeze.  Beat.  A BAT 
          flies overhead.  Relief.  They continue their sticky work.

                                            LENA
                        We live through this, I m telling 
                        everyone in your lab you believe in 
                        ghosts.  They ll throw you in 
                        science jail.                                                                                    44.

                                            LINCOLN
                                (smiles, beat)
                        Everything I ever studied tells me 
                        we re all caught up in group 
                        hysteria and it s probably just a...

                                            LENA
                        A panther.

                                            LINCOLN
                        But if it s anything... other... 
                        something unnatural... we need to 
                        know more.

        He dives under -- leaving Lena alone a moment with her 
          thoughts.  His words weighing heavily on her.

          After a moment he burst back to the surface, holding a 
          final clump of vine.  He wipes the swampshit from his face.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Nature is just disgusting.  We re 
                        good to go.

                                            LENA
                                (beat)
                        There s something you should see.


        INT. EMMET S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

        Lena has the locker opened.  Showing Lincoln, Tess and 
          Clark Cole s secret cache of VIDEOS, DVDS.

                                            LENA
                        Emmet... made me promise never to 
                        let anyone know these existed.  If 
                        anything happened to him I was 
                        supposed to destroy them.  There 
                        might be something on them that can 
                        help us.

        Tess is silent.  Lincoln checks the strange CODING SYSTEM.  
          OPENS A JOURNAL WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN THE SAME MADMAN S CODE.  
        The only recognizable word anywhere:  BOI NA.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This is his handwriting.

                                            LENA
                        These are the originals.  He sent me 
                        backups, all encoded.  I unscrambled 
                        a few -- and what I saw was...  You 
                        should see for yourself.

          Tess, uneasy, looks at the tapes.  So many.                                                                                    45.

                                            TESS
                        He hid these.  From me?

        Lena looks away, eyes saying she s sorry.  JUMP CUT TO:


        INT. EDITING BAY - NIGHT

          Adjay hits play.  The Team gathered round to watch.  The 
          HANDHELD images play QUICK, INTENSE, STARTLING.  ON SCREEN:

        -- CLOSE ON COLE S FACE.  SOAKED IN SWEAT.  SMOKE ALL 
          AROUND HIM.  EYES ROLLED BACK IN HIS HEAD.  HE S CHANTING 
        IN SOME UNKNOWN LANGUAGE.  WIDEN TO REVEAL HE IS BY A 
          CAMPFIRE, SURROUNDED BY PAINTED KAIAPO TRIBESMEN.  
          OVERTAKEN BY A TRANCE -- COLE BEGINS TO CONVULSE -- THEN 
          LEVITATE OFF THE GROUND -- VIDEO ENDS.  JUMP CUT TO:

        HE TWIRLS HIS FINGER IN A  W , THEY DO THE SAME.  AS IF 
            COMMUNICATING, SENTIENT.  WONDERFUL.  JUMP CUT TO:

        -- ON THE RIVER -- A RAGING HIGH TIDE CURRENT -- AND THE 
          ENTIRE LENGTH OF RIVER IS ON FIRE.  A MAN STANDS IN THE 
          MIDDLE OF THE FLAMING WATERS.  JUMP CUT TO:

        -- A MILITARY BASE ON A BRIGHT DAY.  CAMERA FOLLOWS COLE 
          THROUGH A QUAD WHERE... HUNDREDS OF U.S. SOLDIERS LIE DEAD 
        ON THE GROUND.  CRUMPLED WHERE THEY STOOD.  A BAFFLING MASS 
            EXTERMINATION.  COLE IS HORRIFIED.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE (ON SCREEN)
                        They re all dead.  The whole base.  
                        No gunshot wounds.  No blood -- no 
                        apparent cause of death.  How --

        Cole DUCKS.  Falls to the floor.  He holds the WOODEN BOWL.

        TAPE ENDS.  The results of their showdown unknown.

          Jahel catches Lincoln s eye.  As much as he can process 
          anything right now, he sees the clue to their survival.

        ON LENA, hearing her father s name, realizing:  HER FATHER 
        WAS ALIVE AT THE TIME OF THIS RECORDING.  HOPE.

          Clark slows the VIDEO down.  Looking for any indication of 
        FX.  He is floored.  They all are.

                                            CLARK
                        Is any of this faked?  Effects?

                                            SAMMY
                        Video doesn t show any signs of 
                        tampering.  This is raw footage.

                                            CLARK
                        He said he was out here working on 
                        his great discovery...  Real magic.  
                        He was looking for real magic.

                                            TESS
                        You knew about this?  He trusted... 
                        why you?

                                            LENA
                        I m sorry.

          There s a story here.  For another day.  Tess walks out.  
          Lincoln follows after her.  The VIDEOS continue to PLAY:

        DAY.  CLOSE ON COLE.  EXHAUSTED, EYES WILD, MAD, THRILLED --

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE (ON SCREEN)
                        We re so close to the Source.  We 
                        have to keep going... we have to.  
                        The River, it makes you make bad 
                        decisions.  But I know... the 
                        further we go up the Boi na... the 
                        more physics breaks down, and 
                        reality... is so much... bigger.

        The Team is stunned -- awed -- terrified -- at what they ve 
          seen.  Only Adjay curls a smile:

                                            ADJAY
                        We just got a second season.


        EXT. SHIP STERN - MOMENTS LATER

          Lincoln finds his mother.  Sees she s crying.  MOUNTED 
          CAMERAS follow, ZOOMING in.  Catching the subtle expression 
        on his face as he considers leaving her be.  Then --                                                                                    47.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You shouldn t be out in the open 
                        alone.
                                (beat, trying)
                        You re right, we don t know what 
                        happened after.  He could still be 
                        alive.

                                            TESS
                        All that time.  He was on some... 
                        quest.  How could he not tell me?

                                            LINCOLN
                        He never told me anything.  Lena 
                        was always more a daughter to him 
                        than I was a son.  Come on, you two 
                        had your secrets from each other.

                                            TESS
                        No.  We didn t.

          Something about that stops him.  Eroding his sympathy for 
        his mother.  Already strained.  He s tired of it.  From a 
          lifetime of playing a part.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Enough with the act already.  The 
                        show s over.  We weren t a perfect 
                        family, Mom.  He wasn t perfect.  I 
                        sure as hell wasn t.  And you...

        He stops.  But it hits a nerve with her.  All this time 
        he s been hard on her -- she begins to fear she knows why.

                                            TESS
                        Me what?  What about me?

                                            LINCOLN
                        Forget it, I don t want to do this.

                                            TESS
                        Do what?  Don t walk away from me -- 
                        how was I not perfect enough for 
                        you?

                                            LINCOLN
                        I m not a kid, and I m not an 
                        idiot.  All those years you re his 
                        partner, his captain, his muse, 
                        then all of a sudden he goes off 
                        without you?  And you let him?  Who 
                        was it anyway?  Always was curious.

        Tess goes cold.  The reason he s been so unsympathetic.  
        She had no idea he knew.                                                                                    48.

                                            TESS
                        That s none of your business.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Can t play that card, you made our 
                        lives the whole world s business.  
                        You cheated on Dad with someone else 
                        so he cheated on you with his work.

                                            TESS
                        That is not fair -- 

                                            LINCOLN
                        -- Maybe that s why he went off the 
                        deep end, looking for something to 
                        believe in.  Because he sure as 
                        hell couldn t believe in you.

        She slaps him.  He barely registers it.

                                            TESS
                        You have no idea what our lives 
                        were.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Sure I do.  I know why you re out 
                        here, in the middle of a jungle, 
                        refusing to let go, willing to get 
                        yourself killed.  No one goes this 
                        far for love.  But guilt?  Sure, 
                        that d get you to the Amazon.
                                (beat)
                        You should feel guilty -- you drove 
                        him to this. You were the magic in 
                        his life.  And when he lost you...

        He knows he s gone too far.  They stare in the silence 
          after regretted words spoken.  The silence broken as...

        The ship SHUDDERS.  THE ENGINE GIVES A BIG DIESEL COUGH... 
        THEN COMES TO LIFE.  Started.  Emilio did it.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Good.  Let s go home.

        HE LOOKS RIGHT INTO THE MOUNTED CAMERA AS HE PASSES.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You get all that?


        INT. EDITING BAY - THAT MOMENT

          OVERHEAD CAMERA SHOT OF CLARK.  Feeling like the shit he 
        can sometimes be.  Yeah, he caught all that.                                                                                    49.

        We CATCH the MONITOR covering THE ENGINE ROOM -- where --


        INT. ENGINE ROOM - THAT MOMENT

          Emilio does a proud little dance with his daughter.

                                            EMILIO
                                (SUBTITLED)
                        We are better at this than anyone 
                        is at anything!


        INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

        Tess opens up the throttle -- The Magus yawns awake.  She 
          grins, like greeting an old friend.  CHYRON:  4:46 AM.


        EXT. RIVER / AFT DECK - THAT MOMENT

        The tide has risen high enough to submerge the propellers.

        The engine GRINDS, straining, an out of shape athlete.  The 
          props WHIP the thick water into foam.  Going nowhere.


        INT. BRIDGE - THAT MOMENT

        Tess gives it everything it s got -- hoping -- come on...


        EXT. RIVER - THAT MOMENT

        The Magus CREEPS forward... an inch...  a foot... a yard... 
        INTO THE WATER.  The inclined deck finally straightens out.  
        THE MAGUS IS AFLOAT!


        EXT. THE MAGUS - VARIOUS - THAT MOMENT

          Cameras find each of the Team -- catching their expressions 
        -- varying degrees of relief and celebration.


        INT. BRIDGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

        The moon has set.  All quiet save the engine.  A time of 
          private prayers.  The Team indoors.  Alert... tired... and 
          irrevocably pissed at each other.  CHYRON:  5:15 AM.


        INT. KITCHEN GALLEY - THAT MOMENT

          Emilio prays quietly.  Jahel stares out the window.  Beside 
        her is the wooden bowl that held the dark spirit.                                                                                    50.


        INT. GALLEY - THAT MOMENT

          Reese has his RIFLE at the ready.  Resting on his Bible.

          Clark checks the time.

                                            CLARK
                        An hour to sunrise -- two to the 
                        Yutay.  We could make it.

                                            LENA
                              (to Reese; re: rifle)
                        You really think a gun ll help?

                                            REESE
                        A gun always helps.

        Then -- THAT BELLOW AGAIN.  Rustling through the trees.  
        It s coming back.  All eyes dart around.  Highest alert.

        The creature is stronger now -- its renewed strength can be 
          heard in the speed of its movements -- and in its raw power 
        as it HITS THE SIDE OF THE SHIP --

          WHAM!  The Magus quakes.  EVERYONE TAKES COVER.


        INT. EDITING BAY - THAT MOMENT

          WHAM!  The hit reverberates.  Sammy and Adjay feel it.

                                            SAMMY
                        It s on the starboard --
                              (off Adjay s look)
                        The right side.  Dammit --

        He checks the monitors, tries the controls.

                                            SAMMY
                        We lost cameras on that side.  We 
                        don t have any coverage.

          Adjay doesn t hesitate.  He grabs his camera, heading out.

                                            SAMMY
                        Where you going?

                                            ADJAY
                        Getting a shot of it.  Lead 
                        cameraman, there s a reason, pussy.


        EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT

          A MOUNTED CAMERA catches Adjay stepping outside.  Move to --                                                                                    51.

          ADJAY S CAMERA POV (NIGHT VISION):  Camera sweeps the 
          river.  Looking for any sign of movement.

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        Where you at, Slimer?  Let s see 
                        that face.

          Again -- WHAM!  HARDER this time.  The ship lists.  Adjay 
          thinks it s funny, unafraid.

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        That s it...  If you re solid 
                        enough to sink us, you re solid 
                        enough for hi-def.  Come on... come 
                        to Uncle Adjay...  I ll make you 
                        samosa just like Nani Ma.


        INT. KITCHEN GALLEY - THAT MOMENT

          WHAM!  AGAIN.  Jahel clutches her father.  He consoles her.  
          Tells her there s nothing to fear.  Not believing it.


        INT. GALLEY - THAT MOMENT

          Reese SCOPES out the window looking for something to shoot.

        On the floor, Tess grabs Lincoln s hand.  Still family.

          Lincoln eyes that wooden bowl.  New meaning to it now.


        INT. EDITING BAY - THAT MOMENT

          Sammy watches the MONITORS COVERING THE DECK.  ON SCREEN:

          A GUST OF INDISTINCT MOVEMENT -- EQUIPMENT GOES FLYING.

          Incredible.  On Sammy, deciding...  HE GRABS HIS CAMERA.


        EXT. MAIN DECK - MOMENTS LATER

          SAMMY S CAMERA POV:  Coming out to the deck, joining Adjay.

                                            ADJAY
                        Someone grew a pair.

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Suck it.  I m getting the shot.

          INTERCUT THE TWO CAMERA POVS.  They split up, cowboys in 
        the dark.  Adjay incapable of fear, Sammy hiding his.  
          CAMERAS JOSTLE, following the creature s chilling whirl.                                                                                    52.

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Watch out -- it s coming back! --

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        Stay on your side!

        STAY WITH SAMMY S POV FOR THE REST OF THE ACTION, AS --

          CAMERA WHIPS AROUND, TRYING TO CATCH A SHOT --

          SOMETHING CIRCLES ROUND THE SHIP -- SCREECHING -- THEN --

          BASHES A FIBERGLASS WALL, CRAZING IT WITH CRACKS --

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Motherfucker -- it s here! --

          SAMMY RUNS TOWARD THE EDGE -- CRANING OVER -- LOOKING OUT --

        ALL TOO QUICKLY -- WITH A HURRICANE SOUND -- LIKE AN ARROW 
          COMING RIGHT AT YOUR EYES -- IT COMES AT HIM --

        WE SEE NOTHING.  HEAR A WET SOUND.  A GURGLE.

          CAMERA DROPS.  IT LANDS AT AN ODD ANGLE ON THE DECK.

          SAMMY S BODY FALLS ACROSS FRAME.  INCHES FROM CAMERA.

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        Holy shit -- holy shit --

        WE HEAR ADJAY DROP HIS CAMERA AND RUN THE FUCK AWAY --

        NO MOVEMENT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLY LONG BEAT.

        THEN SAMMY S BODY IS YANKED OUT -- GRABBED --

          CAMERA FOLLOWS AFTER -- STRAPPED TO HIS WRIST --

          VIOLENTLY FLUNG -- SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR --

          CATCHING PITCHED FRAMES OF HIS ROTATING LIMP BODY -- THEN --

          SLAMS AGAINST THE BOAT S HULL!

          STATIC.

                                                                      CRASH TO BLACK.

                                                                      END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    53.

        ACT FIVE.

        FADE IN:


        EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT - RESUME

          Still dark.  But the stars are fading.  Morning is coming.  
        Just not fast enough.  CHYRON:  6:01 AM.  PRELAP FOOTSTEPS.


        INT. GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

          Adjay RUNS DOWN -- frantic -- NO CAMERA.  Tough exterior 
          finally crumbled.  He SLIPS down the stairs, falls.

                                            CLARK
                        What happened --

                                            ADJAY
                        Sammy -- I think -- he s dead.  
                        He s up there -- he s dead.  It s 
                        still out there! --

                                            REESE
                                (looking out)
                        It s coming back --

          WHAM!  The creature STRIKES the boat again.  Harder now.  
          Grown even STRONGER from having tasted more blood.

                                            TESS
                        We have to outrun it.

        Tess moves through the galley to --


        INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

        She throws the throttle forward -- full tilt.  THE ENGINE 
          ROARS -- the ship guns ahead.


        EXT. RIVER / THE MAGUS - CONTINUOUS

        The Magus strains with all its limited strength -- powering 
          through the river.


        INT. BRIDGE / GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

        They hear a SHRIEK -- or is it THE ENGINE SCREAMING?

          A BLUR OF MOVEMENT out the window -- then --                                                                                    54.

          WHAM!  They are rammed in the stern -- knocking them 
          forward.  They huddle on the floor.

        THE WOODEN BOWL FALLS TO THE GROUND.  Rolls by Lincoln.

                                            REESE
                        It s going for the engine.

          WHAM!  The sound of METAL TEARING.  Pipes and gears 
          CRACKING as... THE ENGINE GROANS -- CHUGS -- DIES.

        It is suddenly painfully QUIET.  The creature destroyed the 
          engine.

        The boat glides forward on its own inertia... then DRIFTS.

        No one knows what to do.  Tess and Lincoln catch eyes.

                                            TESS
                        You think it s really Cam Travers?

                                            LINCOLN
                        I don t know.

          A NOISE outside the ship.  Whatever it is...

                                            JAHEL
                        It is coming for us.  There is no 
                        more running.  We must catch it.

          Lincoln doesn t need translation to understand.  He rises.  
          HOLDING THE BOWL.  Someone has to save them.

                                            LINCOLN
                        It wants blood...

          Lincoln takes Reese s KNIFE.  CUTS ACROSS HIS HAND.

                                            LENA
                        What are you doing?

                                            LINCOLN
                        I m going to trap it.

        He drips HIS OWN BLOOD into the bowl.  STEPS OUT TO THE 
          DECK.

                                            TESS
                        No --

        Tess follows after him.  Reese after her --


        EXT. MAIN DECK - CONTINUOUS

        We see Lincoln, Tess, Reese run out, COVERED on --                                                                                    55.

          ADJAY S CAMERA POV:  From where he dropped it.  Meticulously 
          placed by chance to cover ONLY A FRACTION of the action.

          INTERCUT THE DROPPED HANDHELD WITH ONE MOUNTED OVERHEAD 
          CAMERA IN MUDDY NIGHT VISION VIEW.  Together we see SOME -- 
        BUT NOT ALL -- OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.  AND IT HAPPENS FAST:

          LINCOLN -- sees (we only hear) CIRCLING OVERHEAD.  The 
          creature moves with HURRICANE FORCE and SOUND.

                                            REESE
                        My God.  It s coming around!

          REESE -- raises his GUN.  FIRES.  A BELLOW in anger.  THE 
        BOAT LURCHES -- HIT -- REESE FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

          LINCOLN -- steps forward.  Tracks something overhead.  Hand 
          DRIPPING with BLOOD.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Here -- you want blood!  Take it!  
                        Come on -- take mine!

        O.S. -- something SWOOPS -- someone SCREAMS -- Tess SHOUTS:

                                            TESS (O.S.)
                        WAIT!

        TESS -- STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRAY.  RISKING 
          EVERYTHING.  FACING THE CREATURE ABOVE.  ADDRESSING IT!

                                            TESS
                        Wait!  Here!  Over here!  Cam 
                        Travers!  Your name is Cam Travers!

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom -- What are you -- !

          A BLUR OF MOVEMENT -- COMING AT HER.

          CLARK -- DIVES FORWARD, IN FRONT OF TESS, PROTECTING HER.

                                            CLARK
                        Get away from her!

          CLARK -- IS KNOCKED BACK INTO A WALL -- SLAMS -- crumples 
        like pajamas.

        TESS -- PRESSES AHEAD.  MAD DETERMINATION.

                                            TESS
                        Your name was Cam Travers...  You 
                        were married to Elise...  You were 
                        a man...  I know you remember --

          Beat.  The GROWLING STOPS.  As if she s getting through.                                                                                    56.

        TESS -- IS LOOKING UP IN ONE PLACE.  As if the creature has 
          STOPPED.  Lincoln at her side -- looking up with her.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom -- get out of here, now --

                                            TESS
                                (CALLING OUT TO IT)
                        You remember.  Tell me -- is Emmet 
                        alive?  Is he still alive?

        The creature WAILS.  Tess doesn t back down.  

                                            TESS
                        Did you kill him?  Tell me!  COME 
                        ON, SCREAM IT! -- ONCE FOR DEAD -- 
                        TWICE FOR ALIVE...  COME ON YOU SON 
                        OF A BITCH!  TELL ME! --

          A pause -- as if an answer is about to come -- then --

          SUDDEN MOVEMENT -- SOUND OF AN ATTACK!

        WE CATCH AN EIGHTH-SECOND GLIMMER OF A PHANTASMIC SHAPE, 
          VAGUELY HUMAN, MOVING TOO FAST TO TELL -- THEN --

        TESS FALLS OUT OF FRAME.  Sound of flesh tearing -- Tess 
          SCREAMING --

                                            LINCOLN
                        No! -- get the fuck off!

          LINCOLN -- RUNS AT HER -- AT IT -- DIVES!

        ALL AT ONCE ALL NOISE STOPS.  THE GHOST IS GONE.

        ALL IS QUIET.

        Only the soft whimper of Tess.  Hurt.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom!  Are you okay?  Let me look --

          There s no light.  Lincoln sets down the bowl -- NOW SEALED 
          TIGHT -- grabs the dropped handheld camera to use its light 
        to examine her wounds.

        SHE IS BLEEDING FROM HER ABDOMEN.  He lifts her shirt.

          THERE -- ACROSS HER STOMACH -- CLEAR IN THE LIGHT --

        TWO MOTTLED GASHES.  TWO.

           TWICE FOR ALIVE.                                                                                     57.

                                            TESS
                        Look.  Look.  Emmet s alive... I 
                        told you.  He s...

        And she passes out.

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

        FADE BACK UP ON:


        EXT. RIVER / THE MAGUS - VARIOUS - DAY

        The safety of daylight.  A new day the Team is lucky to see.

          Jahel steers The Magus.  It sails again.  Beaten up but 
          incapable of giving out...

          Emilio hangs over the port side railing, making repairs to 
        the hull on the move...

        Lena is on the helicopter pad, working on the helicopter...

          CHYRON:  THE AMAZON RIVER.  DAY 5.


        INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

          Clark and Adjay edit FOOTAGE of the ghost attacks -- of 
          Sammy s death.  REPLAYING the moment over and over for some 
          details, hints (much like anyone with a DVR will be).

                                            ADJAY
                        The hell is that?

                                            CLARK
                        No idea.
                                (beat)
                        You shouldn t ve let him up there.

        The only time Clark lets on he s effected by losing a man.  
          Adjay shares none of his remorse.

                                            ADJAY
                        He made his choice.

          Clark looks up...  LINCOLN has come to the edit bay.  
          Lincoln sees that CUT across Clark s temple.

                                            LINCOLN
                        That looks like it hurts.

                                            CLARK
                        Yep.                                                                                    58.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Good.
                                (beat, sincere thanks)
                        You tried to save my mom from that 
                        thing.  You protected her.

                                            CLARK
                        She s the star of my show.  Need 
                        her alive.

          Lincoln sees the SCREEN ON in front of Clark:  A MOUNTED 
          CAMERA shot of the BOW, ZOOMED IN ON TESS.  Hand across 
          BANDAGES on her stomach.  Hurt but alive.  As if Clark was 
          keeping an eye on her.  Clark s largely a shit... but 
          there s a nub of something there.  Maybe decency.  Or maybe 
        he just loves her.

          Lincoln lets it slide.  Nods his thanks.  He goes.

          A beat.  Adjay sees some activity on THE CLUSTER OF SCREENS 
          COVERING REESE S ROOM.  Shows Clark:

                                            ADJAY
                        Check this --

        PUSH IN ON THE SCREENS, AS WE -- INTERCUT:


        INT. REESE S QUARTERS - THAT MOMENT

          REESE IS DISMANTLING ALL THE MOUNTED CAMERAS/MICS IN HIS 
          ROOM.  JUMP CUT THROUGH, as he unscrews, yanks or just 
          BASHES them in.  ONE BY ONE THEY GO OUT.


        INT. EDITING BAY - THAT MOMENT

                                            CLARK
                        Fucker.

          Adjay checks.  ONE CAMERA IN REESE S ROOM IS STILL WORKING.  
        From the floor, looking up.  Adjay taps the SCREEN.

                                            ADJAY
                        He didn t see it.

        ON SCREEN:  The camera catches Reese as... he opens a CASE.  
          A SAT PHONE.  He DIALS.  WE HEAR A MURMUR on the other end.

                                            REESE (ON SCREEN)
                        He saw a hell of a lot more than we 
                        thought.  We re still in pursuit...  
                        Negative.  Cole may be alive.  If 
                        he is... and if he found it -- I ll 
                        put him down.                                                                                    59.

        ON ADJAY AND CLARK.  Hearing that.  Adjay REPLAYS that last 
          ominous piece over and over again.  Trying to comprehend.

                                            REESE (ON SCREEN)
                        And if he found it -- I ll put him 
                        down...  If he found it -- I ll put 
                        him down...  I ll put him down...

        ZOOM IN CLOSER EACH TIME, UNTIL PIXILATION OVERTAKES FRAME, 
        and we --


        EXT. RIVER / SHIP BOW - DAY

        Tess where we saw her, on the bow.  Private thoughts.  Glad 
        to see Lincoln come join her.  Followed by Adjay s CAMERA.

                                            LINCOLN
                              (off her cuts)
                        How re you feeling?

                                            TESS
                        Fine.

        Too tough to say otherwise.  Lincoln sees she s got the 
          WOODEN BOWL.  Tightly bound.  Holding it over the railing.

                                            LINCOLN
                        If it s actually in there, we re 
                        consigning it to a life of torment.

        She throws the thing into the river.  It sinks.  Fuck him.

                                            TESS
                        It tried to hurt you.

          Beat.  A DRAGONFLY whizzes by.  Its tail shines bright.

        Tess looks to camera, to Adjay.  Wanting privacy.

                                            TESS
                        Adjay, a minute.  Come on...

          Reluctantly, Adjay CLICKS his camera OFF.

          BLACK.  For a moment.  Then --

          A NEW ANGLE.  Them on the bow.  One of the MOUNTED CAMERAS.  
          Catching them at their backs, perfectly framed against the 
          water.  The coast.  The breeze.  The birds in the air.

                                            TESS
                        I thought I knew your father.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Me too.                                                                                    60.

                                            TESS
                        The last dated tape puts him headed 
                        East, toward the mountains.  We can 
                        turn around.  We can go home.

                                            LINCOLN
                        No.  Dad s alive.  He s somewhere 
                        on this river.  We re going to 
                        follow his every move.  Until we 
                        find him.

                                            TESS
                        You sure?  Give up everything to 
                        believe some ghost?

                                            LINCOLN
                        Dad was on to something.  
                        Something... big.

        For the first time in his life, he understands:

                                            LINCOLN
                        There s magic out there.
                                (beat)
                        Let s go see it.

        Tess smiles.  It s good to have her son back.

          A long beat.  Watching the water.  Peaceful.  Magical.

                                            TESS
                                (pointing to it)
                        You know there s a camera right 
                        there.

                                            LINCOLN
                        I know.

                                                                    CAMERA SNAPS OFF.

                                                                                      END.
