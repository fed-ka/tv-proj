      ...GRACE, walking outside her school on her cell beside 
      another girl on hercell talking with her mom.  SHANNON (13), 
      quirky, with flavored lip gloss and cheek sparkles.  

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah, everything s great.   So can 
                    Shannon come over? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Who s Shannon?

                                  GRACE
                    A girl in my class.  How old are 
                    you? 

                                  SHANNON
                    Thirteen.

                                  GRACE
                    She s thirteen too.  

                                  SHANNON
                    My mom said it s okay.  

                                  GRACE
                    Her mom says it s okay.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And it s alright with Jackie? 

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah, she said it s fine, but she 
                    wanted to ask you.  

      Alicia eyes Talia grooming Terrance s hair, and taking off 
    his glasses, preparing him for court.  Alicia frowns at that: 
      don t take off his glasses. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #109    "Lifeguard"    GREEN COLLATED    12/2/09    7.

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay, then, it s fine.  Help 
                    grandma with any clean up.

      Grace nods to Shannon who laughs, spirited, and runs on ahead.  

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah.  And guess what, Mom?  

                                  ALICIA
                    What?

                                  GRACE
                    Shannon s dad s in prison, too.  
                    I ll see you tonight.

    And Grace clicks off.  Alicia holds the phone to her ear for 
      a beat, unsure what to do with that.  She turns toward Talia 
    and Terrance, but they re already heading into court.  Shit.


      Late afternoon.  Alicia parks her car, gets out, hurries 
      toward the building.


      Alicia and Talia stand by Talia s car.  

                                  TALIA RAMSEY
                    I let him leave the lights on at 
                    home.  He s scared of the dark.  
                    You think they let him keep a light 
                    on in there?

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.

                                    TALIARAMSEY
                    I baby him.  Too much.  

                                  ALICIA
                    No matter how old, they re our 
                    babies. 

                                    TALIARAMSEY
                    I hoped he wouldn t face things 
                    like this.  Thought if I just 
                    watched him real close, I...

      It s hard.  Taliawipes her eyes.  Opens her car door.  As 
      Alicia watches her, moved.  Mother to mother.  


      Headlights cross a darkened townhouse-- a handsome, 3-story  
      Georgian.  It s Kalinda parking.  She and Cary get out, start 
      toward the house, passing a realtor s  For Sale  sign.   

                                  KALINDA
                    Don t talk, okay?  I used to work 
                    with this guy.   

                                  CARY
                    What s that supposed to mean?

    As they reach the front door, it opens suddenly.  A BEAM OF 
      LIGHT hits Cary in the face, blinding him as-- 


      Kalinda starts back toward her car, Cary catching up...

                    I don t believe it.  People aren t

                                  KALINDA

                    Before the assault, Baxter s 
                    sentencing is race neutral.  After,

                                  KALINDA
                    No.  People like to think they do 
                    things for a hundred reasons.  They 
                    do things for one reason.

                    What reason?  Come on, Yoda.  What

                    By the same logic, you re

      Kalinda gets in her car.  Cary watches, smiling broadly.  He 
      likes her.


      Knock-knock.  Jackie stands at the door of a suburban house, 
      waiting.  Frowning at a dripping spray nozzle on a garden 
      hose.  The door opens.  Margy Vargas.  Shannon s mom.  

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    Hello?

                                  JACKIE
                    Hello, we met yesterday.  Jackie.  
                    Grace s grandmother.  I m here to 
                    pick up Grace.

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    She s... not here.

      Shannon comes to the door behind Margy, peering past her.

                                  JACKIE
                    Really?  She said she was coming 
                    here after school.  Her best 
                    friend s house.

                                  SHANNON
                    Mom?

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    It s okay, Shannon.  

      Margy steps out on the stoop, closes the door.  Looks Jackie 
    in the eye.  A reflected coldness.

                                  MARGY VARGAS (CONT D)
                    What do you want?

                                  JACKIE
                    I want to know why you are doing 
                    this?    

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    I don t need to talk to you.

                    turn that off.  

    The dripping spray nozzle.  Margy ignores it.

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    Get off my property.

                    Your husband is in a worse prison.  
                    We should be worried about you, not 
                    you us.

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    Okay, you want to know why?  Because 
                    your son put my husband in prison.

                                  JACKIE
                    He did not.

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    He was the State s Attorney.  My 
                    husband never sold drugs in his 
                    life, and your son put him in 
                    prison for ten years.  For 
                    something he never did.

                                  JACKIE
                    You are a very gullible woman.

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    And you are a bitch.

      Jackie stares at her, appalled. 

                                  JACKIE
                    My son is honorable man.  If he put 
                    your husband in prison, he deserved 
                    it.

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    Go to hell.

      Jackie stares at her.  Reaches for the dripping nozzle, 
      starts to turn it off...

                                  MARGY VARGAS (CONT D)
                    Leave that alone.

                                  WILL
                    Whose idea was it, yours or his?

                                  SHAW*
                    Lieutenant Michaels, could you show *
                    these two out?*

      A guard approaching.  Will shoves past him.*

                                  WILL*
                    Come on!  Was it yours or his?!*

                                  SHAW*
                    Get him out!*

    The guard pushes Will toward the exit.  *

                                  WILL*
                    Hey, I d start looking for a good *
                    defense attorney, pal! *

    But Shaw is already around the corner.  Gone.  Will shakes *
    the guard off, allows himself to be escorted with Kalinda *
      toward the exit. *

                                  KALINDA*
                    You look good in action.*

                                  WILL*
                    He was a friend.  How does that *
                    happen? 

                                  KALINDA
                    It happens.*

                                  WILL
                    What s the solution: don t trust 
                    anybody?

                                  KALINDA

      Will.  He stands, waiting, jaw set, deep in thought when 
      Baxter approaches, sees him...   

                                  BAXTER
                    Okay.  What d I do now?

      Will looks toward him, tries to smile...

                                  WILL
                    Just give me an explanation.  Even 
                    a half-assed one will do.  

                                  BAXTER
                    Okay.  
                          (smiling)
                    I thought we were working a zone 
                    defense.

      Will doesn t smile, studying him...

                                  WILL
                    I just spent the morning with your 
                    ex.

                                  BAXTER
                          (hesitant)
                    Ellen.  Really?  How s she doing?

                                  WILL
                    I asked her about your gambling.

      Baxter.  The first sense there s something wrong.

                                  BAXTER
                    So what s this, an intervention?

                                  WILL
                    No.  I wish we had one a year ago.

                                  BAXTER
                          (studying him)
                    People are filling your head with 
                    nonsense, Will.

    And Baxter starts off.  Will follows.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #109    "Lifeguard"    GREEN COLLATED    12/2/09    51A.

      CONTINUED:4343


                                  WILL
                    What nonsense?  Like you being in 
                    debt?  Your sudden interest in 
                    sending kids to Palgrave Academy?

                                  BAXTER
                    You are in thrall to your Junior 
                    Associate.  She wandered out on 
                    some wild tangent and now you re 
                    following her out there--

                                  WILL
                    Palgrave Academy only gets money 
                    from the county if you send kids 
                    there.  How much did they pay you 
                    per kid?  How much--?

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Ellen doesn t know what she s 
                    talking about.  She s ill.  She--   

                                  WILL
                    Did you even just say the words to 
                    yourself to see how they sounded?  
                     I m sending kids to prison to make 
                    money.   It s not even about doing 
                    good.  No one here is helping 
                    orphans, but-- this.  How could you 
                    even live a day with this?

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Palgrave is a good place for 
                    rehabilitation.  These kids are 
                    better off there.  

      Will leans in toward him...

                                  WILL
                    How bad do you have to behave 
                    before you start acknowledging it?  

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Don t you dare judge me.  You, the 
                    litigator who whored himself out to 
                    the lowest scum.  Don t you dare 
                    judge me!

                                  WILL
                          (simple, quiet)
                    You re going to jail.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #109    "Lifeguard"    GREEN COLLATED    12/2/09    51B.

    And with that Will starts away.  Baxter stares after him, 
      stunned.  Starts to yell something.  No.  People staring.
