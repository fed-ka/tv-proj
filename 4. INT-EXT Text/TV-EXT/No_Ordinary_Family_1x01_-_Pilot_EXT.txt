      A WAVE rolls in.  Pristine and beautiful.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    I know.  It looks like an ad for 
                    hair-loss or Cialis.  It s not.

      We REVERSE onto COLLEGE STUDENTS at a beach party.  JIM 
      POWELL, 20s, laughs with friends until his eye catches 
      something.  Or more specifically SOMEONE.  Instantly smitten.

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Because our story began... the 
                    first time I saw Stephanie.

      STEPHANIE is introduced to the GROUP OF GUYS.  Jim, 
      gobsmacked, just stares at her.  Unable to speak or to shake 
      her outstretched hand.  Stephanie s a bit weirded out...

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Despite some initial missteps...

      Stephanie shakes her head, walks off.     


      Jim and Stephanie walk along.  Simple, easy.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    And so, having exhausted every 
                    other method, I settled on a last-
                    ditch approach...

      LATER... Jim sketches her.  

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    To be myself.

      Hands the drawing to her -- beautiful.  She s moved.

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And, somehow -- improbably -- I 
                    touched her.

      She kisses him.  MUSIC RISES.


      The family approaches a shaky-looking PROP PLANE. 

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    We d turned Stephanie s South 
                    American research trip last month 
                    into a family vacation.  A chance 
                    to fill that space.  

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                          (enthused)
                    This ll be great.  We ll take this 
                    puddle jumper straight to the resort. 
                    And then... a week of R and R. 
                          (to JJ)
                    You know what R and R means?

                                  JJ
                    Surfing and sailing?

                                  JIM
                          (forcing a smile)
                    Close enough.

      We SMASH TO...


      The family is wheeled out of the hospital.  Jim and Stephanie 
      embrace their kids -- then each other.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    We held each other close.  Vowing a 
                    new beginning to our lives.  


      Stephanie speeds into the drop-off lane.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    Racing to be there for my kids.

      Daphne and JJ get out the car.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Remember, JJ. I ll see you at your 
                    teacher conference.  And Daphne -- 
                    I ll be at your soccer game.

      Stephanie vrooms off, nearly clipping the CROSSING GUARD.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Racing to the office.


      The game s over.  Daphne, in her SOCCER UNIFORM, is in an 
      intense conversation with her boyfriend, LUCAS, 17, the 
      epitome of a cool high school boyfriend.

                                  DAPHNE
                    -- she was hitting on you.

                                  LUCAS
                    Daphne, c mon.  Lindsay was just 
                    making small-talk.

                                  DAPHNE
                    With her hand on your thigh.

                                  LUCAS
                    She saw a mosquito.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Riiight.  So I guess she just 
                    wanted to whack it off?

      Lucas smiles at her.  She softens.

                                  DAPHNE (CONT D)
                    I don t know what s cuter about 
                    you.  That you can t see when a 
                    girl is into you.  Or that you re 
                    too into me to see it.

      They KISS when... Stephanie arrives, OUT OF BREATH. 

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Daphne, sorry.  I got stuck in 
                    traffic.  -- Hi, Lucas.  -- But I 
                    got here as fast as I could.  I m 
                    sorry I m so late --

                                  DAPHNE
                          (snarky)
                    You re not late, Mom.  You re early 
                    for my next game.  Besides, it s 
                    not like Dad made it, either.

      Daphne walks, Stephanie follows.

                                  STEPHANIE
                            (continuing)
                    I tried to get here.  But I had 
                    JJ s conference -- they re talking 
                    Special Ed now or, God forbid, 
                    holding him back -- and my 
                      presentation ran long so --          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  19.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Guess what?  Your life...?  Not 
                    nearly as interesting to me as 
                    mine.  I ll see you at home.

      Daphne walks off, joining Lucas.  As Stephanie watches her, 
      hurt by her inability to connect, her PHONE RINGS --

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?

      INTERCUT DR. KING -- in the CONFERENCE ROOM.

                                  DR. KING
                    Good news.  The chairman wants to 
                    take us both to dinner.  You hooked 
                    him.  Wants to hear more about your 
                      research...

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (concerned)
                    Tonight? 

                                  DR. KING
                    Why?  Something as pressing as 
                    dinner with the Chairman?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    It s...  Date Night.   With Jim.  
                    And I know it sounds silly.  But 
                    things haven t been as smooth as 
                    they used to be and Date Night s a 
                    good way for us to-- 
                          (stopping herself)
                    I m over-sharing, right?

                                  DR. KING
                    Your devotion is admirable.  So 
                    I ll understand whatever choice you 
                    make.  But grant distribution 
                    hasn t been finalized.  And Francis 
                    will be at that dinner, as well...

      Stephanie exhales.  She knows she has no choice.


      Stephanie tries to HAIL a cab amidst the busy street.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    I found myself back in my familiar 
                      routine... racing.

      She spots a CAB at the next block.  It starts to pull away.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Not to my husband or children.  But 
                    now... racing to places I didn't 
                    even want to go.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Taxi!  Taxi!

      Stephanie races after the CAB.  Trying to catch it.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And that s when it happened...

      As she RUNS, Stephanie s BACKGROUND slows.  Stephanie MOVING 
      but TIME SLOWING --

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    In the world of science, we call it 
                    an unexplained phenomena.  An 
                      occurrence so random and bizarre 
                    that it defies explanation.

      Everything SLOWING.  But Stephanie.  Until, we WIDEN and --

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And in a life short on time...

      Resume NORMAL SPEED, as we suddenly FIND Stephanie IN FRONT 
      OF THE RESTAURANT.  Miles away.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      I suddenly found myself... fast.

      A stunned Stephanie tries to process what just happened, as a 
      CAB PULLS up.  King, Francis and the Chairman spill out. 

                                  KING
                    Oh... Stephanie.  This is a 
                    surprise.  We thought you d be 
                    late. 

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (still stunned)
                    Um.  Traffic was with me.

      Francis takes in her appearance -- disheveled from her  run.           No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  23.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Nice look, Powell.  Classy.

      Everyone enters.  Stephanie remains, thinks.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    I was an unexplained phenomena.  
                    And I ll tell you what -- it didn t 
                    feel half bad.

      As she smiles to herself, amazed, we... SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT TWO          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  24.

                                      ACT THREE


      Jim stands with George.  Dressed in track gear.  George holds 
      a Mac iTablet.

                                  GEORGE
                    Most of them can fly.

                                  JIM
                    I can t fly.

                                  GEORGE
                    You read comic books.  I don t know 
                    all their names.  But they can fly.  
                    Some of them.

                                  JIM
                    I can t fly.

                                  GEORGE
                    Two weeks ago, you couldn t catch 
                    bullets either.  Or jump through 
                    walls.

                                  JIM
                    I can t fly.

                                  GEORGE
                    Just take a running jump.  Get a 
                    head of steam.  Think like 
                    something that flies. 

      Jim shrugs.  Takes a running start across the roof and DIVES 
      OFF THE EDGE OF THE BUILDING!

      Instead of going up... he goes... DOWN.  Like a stone.  
      George blanches, runs to the edge of the roof.  Looks down to 
      see --

      Jim, amidst a small crater of rubble that his impact caused, 
      staring back up at him from the ALLEY below.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Okay.  You can t fly.  

      Then, Jim bends his knees and LEAPS BACK UP!  Next to George!  
      Lands with a roof-shaking thud.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                          (smiles)
                    But you can jump.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  26.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    I guess I d have given more thought 
                    to how strangely Jim was acting, but 
                    I had other things on my mind...


      George and Jim are in a parking lot outside of a college 
      stadium.  Jim starts to lift the SUV off the ground.  George 
      jots notes.

                                  GEORGE
                    Remember.  Lift with your legs. 
                    Last thing you want to do is throw 
                    out your lower back.
                          (then, as Jim lifts)
                     kay, no problem with the luxury 
                    SUV.  Tell me... how s it feel?

                                  JIM
                          (car in the air)
                    Good, I guess.  Though never 
                    thought I d be able to actually 
                    lift a --

                                  GEORGE
                    No, I was thinking of getting one 
                    when my lease is up... just 
                    wondering how it felt.

                                  JIM
                    Oh... you know.  Heavy.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  28.

      Jim sets down the car, as we SMASH TO --

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    And new discoveries.


      Katie stands alone on the deserted track.  A STOP WATCH in 
      hand.  Every second... a BLUR WHOOSHES past her.  Her HAIR 
      again BLOWING back.

                                  KATIE
                    Am I being too accepting of this?  
                    Should I be asking more questions?  
                    I don t know -- It s very 
                      unsettling trying to carry on a 
                      conversation like this.

      Suddenly, the BLUR stops -- it s Stephanie.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    How d I do?

                                  KATIE
                          (checks the stop watch)
                    Ten miles in just under five 
                    seconds.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Hmmm.  I thought I might be quicker 
                    than that.

                                  KATIE

                    Ohmygod -- the Olympics!  You 
                    should totally enter.  Where are 
                    they this year?  Korea?  They re 
                    always in Korea...

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Katie, I m not interested in the

      MUSIC UP... as our MONTAGE begins...


      George stands alone ON THE ROOFTOP.  Then Jim soars into 
      frame.  Lands next to George, who checks his GPS.

                                  GEORGE
                    Okay.  From Jefferson, right? 
                          (beat, realizing)
                    That s a quarter mile.

      Jim wipes a FEATHER off his shoulder.

                                  JIM
                    Think I hit a bird.

      SMASH TO --

      IN THE POWELL KITCHEN.  Stephanie finishes tutoring JJ.  He 
      smiles, stands and exits.  Then... he feels a WHOOSH of WIND 
      against him.  He TURNS... but Stephanie is GONE.  SMASH TO --

      DAPHNE S SOCCER GAME -- as Daphne looks up from the bleachers 
      to see Stephanie, waving at her.

      IN STEPHANIE S LAB... LATER, as she LOCKS the door.  Then... 
      she s a BLUR.  Papers FLY... then FLUTTER back to their 
      desks.  Stephanie STOPS... smiles to herself.  Checks her 
      watch... DONE.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Alright.  Not a bad day s work.


      George paces before Jim, reading off his iTablet.

                                  GEORGE
                    So here s what we know.  You can jump 
                    just over 1/4 mile in a single leap.

                                  JIM
                    Single what?

                                  GEORGE
                          (giving in)
                    Fine.  Single bound.  
                          (then)
                    No discernible increase in foot 
                    speed.  However, you can lift in 
                    the area of 11,000 pounds.  But 
                    like we talked about ---

                                  JIM
                    Less on an empty stomach.

                                  GEORGE
                    Even a granola bar helps.  Anything 
                    to stabilize the blood sugar. 
                    And... you can catch bullets.
                          (then)
                      Limitations -- no webs, no 
                    invisible plane and I m pretty sure 
                    you can t speak with fish.   

      A beat, then...

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    So.  Have you talked to Steph about 
                    this?  Told her what you can do?
                          (off Jim s look)
                    Jim!  She s your wife!  You gotta 
                    bring her into the cone of silence.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Stuff like this comes out -- this, 
                    strippers and unpaid taxes.  You 
                    need to get ahead of this one!

      That s when he hears the DISPATCHER coming from a POLICE 
      SCANNER sitting nearby.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    What s that?

                                  JIM
                    Police scanner.

                                  GEORGE
                    I know what it is.  I m asking what 
                    it s doing here.

                                  JIM
                    I have these abilities.  I should 
                    be doing something with them.  Like 
                    stopping that psycho in the Obama 
                    mask who s killing innocent people--

                                  GEORGE
                    Whoa, hold on!  All we ve learned 
                    is that we have a lot to learn.  
                    You re extraordinary.  But you re 
                    not invincible.  I m not even sure 
                    you re vincible.

      Jim looks at him.  

                                  JIM
                    Most of my adult life I ve been 
                    powerless to make a difference.  At 
                    work... in my marriage.  But I m 
                    not powerless anymore -- for the 
                    first time I can do something.  For 
                    the first time, I can help...

      As George looks at him, Jim s cell rings.  He notes the 
      number.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                          (to George)
                    It s Stephanie.

                                  GEORGE
                    Tell her!  Before it gets out of 
                    hand.  Now s your chance --

                                  JIM
                          (shooing George away)
                    Shhh...
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  32.

      IN HER LAB -- we INTERCUT Stephanie.  A large STACK of new 
      SHOE BOXES nearby.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Hi.  So I finished all my work...

                                  JIM
                    Already?  It s barely noon...

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Moving kinda fast today.  But 
                    remember what we d do sometimes 
                    when we both had a free afternoon?

                                  JIM
                    Yeah?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    It might be time to reinstate that 
                      tradition.

      As Jim smiles to himself, we re --


      Lucas talks with LINDSAY, hot, blonde, in her SOCCER UNIFORM.  

                                    LINDSAY
                    ...it starts at eight.  My folks 
                    are at their time-share in Aruba.

      Daphne, arrives also in UNIFORM.  Not happy.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Lindsay.  Coach wants to see you.   

                                    LINDSAY
                    Why?

                                  DAPHNE 
                    Something about a protective bra 
                    for implants.

      Daphne stares down an exiting Lindsay.  Lucas smiles.

                                  LUCAS
                    Be nice.  She was just inviting us 
                    to her party.

                                  DAPHNE
                          (skeptical)
                    Oh.   Us?   
                          (shakes her head)
                    God... how can you be so cute and 
                    so clueless at the same time?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  33.

                                  LUCAS
                    Fine.  She s hitting on me.  But 
                    that s all it is.
                          (then)
                    Look... just  cause you re not ready 
                    to sleep with me doesn t mean I m 
                    looking for it somewhere else.  I 
                    love you... so have some faith, okay?

      As Daphne nods, we re --


      George talks on the phone, the POLICE SCANNER blaring nearby.

                                  GEORGE
                          (excited)
                    Guess what?  You got your wish -- 
                    Obama mask!  Robbery in progress.  
                    You re on.
                          (as he listens to the 
                            scanner)
                    Okay.  Perp -- I like that -- perp 
                    heading north on 12th and Fig --

                                  JIM
                    Hold on, 12th and Fig?  That s 
                    cross town.  How do I get there 
                    from here?

      On that, we SMASH TO --


      Jim flies into frame, smashing down on the rooftop as pigeons 
      scatter.  A BLUETOOTH in his ear.

                                  JIM
                          (into Bluetooth)
                    Okay.  I m on the Exxon Building.  
                    Which way now?

      INTERCUT GEORGE -- back on the original rooftop, studying 
      Google Maps on his iPhone.

                                  GEORGE
                          (into phone)
                    Looks like -- it s a left.

                                  JIM (O.S.)
                    A left?

                                  GEORGE
                    You sure you don t want the freeway 
                    route?  Looks much faster.

                                  JIM
                    I m not worried about traffic, 
                    George. 

      And with that, Jim leaps into the distance...


        BLACK-AND-WHITES chase the SPEEDING CAR, which takes a 
      corner.  And another.  Then, a SHARP RIGHT DOWN AN ALLEY. 
      Losing the pursuing cruisers.            No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  36.

      TILT UP to FIND... JIM, high above the alley.  Car SPEEDS 
      down it; Jim stands ABOVE it.  It seems inevitable...

      Jim LEAPS.  Landing directly in the path of the ONCOMING CAR.  
      Neither man nor vehicle yield.  The car speeds closer; Jim 
      stands his ground, closes his eyes.  

      Then... the car PLOWS into Jim.  Like hitting cement.  
      Airbags deploy.  Tires burst.  After a moment, Jim pries the 
      grill off him, walks around rips open the driver s side door. 
      The DRIVER wears... 

      The OBAMA MASK.  It s the guy Jim s been trying to draw!  Jim 
      pulls him out.  Throws him against a wall.

                                  JIM
                    You.  You re gonna go away for a 
                    long time.

      Jim RIPS OFF the mask REVEALING THE SCARRED FACE of the 
      criminal, who stares back and... LAUGHS.  

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    What s so funny?

                                  CRIMINAL
                    What you don t know.

      Jim squints, unsure, when --

      BANG!  

      Jim FLINCHES!  Turns to find -- A SECOND CRIMINAL, also in an 
      Obama mask, pointing his freshly-fired HEAVY ARTILLERY gun at 
      him.

      In pain, JIM REACHES for the back of his head.  Pulls his 
      hand back to see -- it s covered in BLOOD.  POLICE SIRENS 
      approach.  The CRIMINALS flee.

      Jim, too woozy to pursue, drags himself up, pushes through an 
      alley door and collapses into a darkened hallway.

      INSIDE -- a fading Jim pulls out his Bluetooth, speaks into it.

                                  JIM
                    George.  Help. I ve been shot.

      And with that, Jim promptly passes out and we... SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT THREE          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  37.

      ON A FUZZY IMAGE that slowly sharpens to BECOME George.  

                                  GEORGE
                    You re awake.

      WIDEN to REVEAL we re --


      George stands over Jim, in bed.  Jim immediately reaches for 
      the WOUND at the base of his skull.  It s bandaged.

                                  GEORGE
                    You had some blood loss, but the 
                    bullet didn t penetrate too far.  
                    We pulled it out, sewed you up.  
                    Good as new.

                                  JIM
                     We? 
                          (realizing)
                    Wait.  My bedroom.  George.  Please 
                    don t tell me --

                                  GEORGE
                    She s a doctor.

                                  JIM
                    George!

                                  GEORGE
                    Where was I supposed to take you, a 
                    hospital?  So I could explain to 
                    the attending how a bullet from a 
                    heavy artillery gun only penetrated 
                    a 1/4  into your scalp?

                                  JIM
                    But Stephanie.  Of all people. 
                    She ll never understand what s 
                    happened to me.

      Then... REVEAL Stephanie, having been listening off-camera.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Actually, I think she will.

      Jim looks at her.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    You know that sketch of me out in 
                    the guest house?  The one you drew 
                    on our second date?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  38.



      Jim nods and SUDDENLY... she s GONE with a BLUR and a GUST OF 
      AIR... Jim and George squint from its jet-like force.  Then... 
      she s BACK.  Hands the FRAMED SKETCH to a stunned Jim.

                                  GEORGE
                    You two are freaky.


      Pre-game stretching.  Daphne waves to Lucas in the stands.  
      Lindsay steps in next to her.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  41.

                                    LINDSAY
                          (re:  Lucas)
                    I wasn t hitting on him.

                                  DAPHNE
                    And you re a natural blonde.

      Daphne looks at Lindsay.  Hears SOMETHING that sounds like -- 

                                    LINDSAY (V.O.)
                    He was hitting on me.

      But it s barely AUDIBLE.  Daphne just looks at her.  Trying 
      to determine if Lindsay actually said something.

      BACK TO THE CAR --

                                  STEPHANIE
                    This is a boyfriend problem?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Wait.

      BACK TO THE SOCCER GAME -- Daphne dribbles down the field. 

                                  DAPHNE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Like I said, it was normal enough.  
                    Until second quarter.  I take the 
                    pass, turn up field.  And I m all 
                    alone.  One-on-one with the 
                    goalie...

      The GOALIE stares at an approaching Daphne, and Daphne 
      CLEARLY hears:

                                  GOALIE (V.O.)
                    Sometimes I wish I was dead.  I 
                    don t think anyone would miss me.

      But the Goalie hasn t opened her mouth.  Startled, Daphne 
      shoots errantly.

      LATER -- Daphne sets down the ball, ready to kick it.  An 
      OPPOSING PLAYER staring at her.

                                  DAPHNE (V.O.)
                    And then... later, I m setting up 
                    the direct kick.

                                  OPPOSING PLAYER (V.O.)
                    But we used protection.  I don t 
                    want a kid... especially if he s 
                    the father.

                                  DAPHNE (V.O.)
                    Even the Ref.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  42.

      As Daphne catches the Ref s gaze.

                                    REFEREE (V.O.)
                    Vodka.  No, gin.  This game can t 
                    be over soon enough.

      BACK TO STEPHANIE S CAR --

                                  DAPHNE 
                    When they looked at me.  Directly 
                    into my eyes.  I heard them.  

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Their thoughts.

      Daphne nods, looks at her mother.  Then...

                                  DAPHNE
                    Am I a freak?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    No.  You re a Powell.


      THWACK.  Jim lands hard in the alley, another prodigious 
      leap.  A HOMELESS PERSON looks up in disbelief.  Jim drops a 
      TEN in his hat.  Shhh...


      Police barricade.  Assembling crowd.  Jim sees HIXON being 
      carried out on a stretcher, oxygen mask strapped to his face. 

                                  JIM
                    Yvonne?  Where s Yvonne?

      Before Hixon can answer, an EMT steps in, pushes him onto the 
      waiting AMBULANCE.  Jim thinks.


      Jim tries to open the heavy, back door.  Locked.  Looks 
      around, then YANKS the door HARD.  Hinges bust, handle breaks 
      off in his hand... the DOOR OPENS.  Jim sets down the handle, 
      goes in.


      BAM.  Jim lands on the ROOF, a FAST FOOD BAG in his hand.  
      George looks up from his iTablet, analyzing Jim-related data.

                                  GEORGE
                    You got cheese on mine, right?

      Jim exhales, LEAPS OFF again.  George turns back to his work.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                          (to himself)
                    Always forgets the cheese.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    I know it s quite a story...


      Pristine and tropical.  We should remember it as the sight of 
      the Powell s plan crash last month.

      Wind ripples the water, as we PUSH BENEATH THE SURFACE... 
      moving deeper, past sea life, past reedy vegetation -- 

      -- to the hazy depths where the PLANE WRECKAGE rests.

      Beneath the twisted plane lies... 

      The BODY of MITCH McCUTCHEON, our pilot.  Lifeless amidst the 
      salty water.  Until --

      His eyes BOLT open.  Suddenly ALIVE.  And we... SMASH TO 
      BLACK.


                                      END OF SHOW
