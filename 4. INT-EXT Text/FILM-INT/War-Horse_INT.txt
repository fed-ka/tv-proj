The auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes.
There is a sense of celebration and busyness about market
day.
We concentrate on two men - Ted Narracott (DAD), in his
forties, clearly both the cares of the world and alcohol have
worn him down before his time, and SI EASTON, his more solid
friend, both working farmers. Just behind Si is his 15 year
old son, ANDREW. Ted has a drink in his hand. They all look
at Joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him.
DAD
Now that's a beauty.
SI EASTON
Forget it, Ted. He's half
thoroughbred and not got a day's
work in him.
(points to a plow horse next to
JOEY)
Now, there... There's your ticket.
In contrast to Joey, the solid and bulky plow horse stands
like a rock. But Dad remains fixated on Joey.
DAD
But look at him, Si. Look at that creature.
4.
Indeed, Joey is magnificent, his power clearly emerging
because of his upset.
SI EASTON
Don't be daft. You need something
solid to plow a field.
DAD
(fixed on Joey)
Yeah, but he's something else, that one.
The AUCTIONEER announces the start of the auction...
AUCTIONEER
Alright gentlemen - settle down - settle
down - horses on my right - men with money
in their pockets on my left - it's the
perfect combination. Is Fred Goddard here?
FRED shouts his reply from the crowd.
FRED
YES! I's here.
AUCTIONEER
Good - more money than sense. Dave Hill?
DAVE
I'm here. Yes!
AUCTIONEER
Bugger off, you tight bastard - you've been
coming here for 20 years - never bought so
much as a pork scratching.
The crowd are loving all this.
Dad notices a figure across the ring, LYONS, clearly a man of
money. You can see something light up in Dad's eyes - a
combination of dislike and alcohol.
Joey is led into the auction pen.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
Okay - first up today - a gorgeous young
horse - prettiest thing I've seen since my
wife on our wedding day. Let's get going,
shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature.
But no-one bids.
DAD
One guinea.
5.
AUCTIONEER
One guinea, one guinea, one
guinea...
YOUNG ANDREW EASTON
I thought you needed a plow horse, Mister
Narracott.
AUCTIONEER
Any advance on one guinea? Any
advance on one guinea?
Joey is still trying to get back to his mother. A voice from
the crowd pipes up:
LYONS
Two guineas.
DAD
Three!
SI EASTON
Ted Narracott - it's completely the wrong
animal.
Lyons whispers to his son, DAVID, 15, next to him. David eyes
Joey skeptically.
DAD
Si Easton - I'm not gonna let that
bastard see me off.
LYONS
Five guineas.
DAD
Six!
SI EASTON
Oh for the love of...!
Joey is straining to get to his mother, the men are pulling
him back.
LYONS
Seven.
DAD
Greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody.
(BIDDING)
Eight.
6.
SI EASTON
Stop it - he's your landlord - you
can't be picking fights with him.
Lyons looks over. There is now tension in the crowd as they
sense a Battle Royal for the horse.
LYONS
Ten guineas.
He smirks at Dad.
SI EASTON
You haven't got the money. Let's go
home - let's have a pint.
DAD
Eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as
any in this town.
They all look at Lyons in his suit and bowler hat.
AUCTIONEER
Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas?
SI EASTON
That's top price for a workin'
animal. Ted! Save it for the shire!
DAD
There are big days and there are
small days. Which will it be?
AUCTIONEER
Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas?
All eyes are on Lyons and his son - David is 15, smartly
dressed.
DAVID LYONS
Just let him go, dad, I don't care
for him, he's too... jumpy.
Lyons isn't listening to David; he's looking hard at Ted.
LYONS
Shall we say - twenty five?
The crowd gasps. This is clearly personal.
SI EASTON
Well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted.
7.
ANDREW
You were great, Mr N. Gave him a run
for his money.
But when he looks at Ted, Ted's eyes are locked into the eyes
of his rival.
AUCTIONEER
Going, going...
DAD
Thirty. Thirty guineas!
Total silence. He stares hard at Lyons. Who simply smiles,
raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away. It dawns on
Dad that he's won the auction. He breaks into a sweat.
AUCTIONEER
Thirty guineas. Thirty guineas. Going
going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott.
He bangs his gavel. It's a done deal.
SI EASTON
What have you done, Ted? What have you done?
Dad doesn't acknowledge Si.
Moments later - Ted stands staring at Joey, who looks back.
Ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the
auction man in a kind of daze.
Suddenly, Lyons appears at Dad's shoulder.
LYONS
Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do
with him - on a working farm? I hope you
got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it
when it comes due.
Dad does not acknowledge Lyons. Lyons smiles and walks away
with son David, and his cronies. Si shakes his head at Dad.
SI EASTON
You're a fool, Ted. And our Rosie'll
never forgive you.
Lyons is there with his son, David, and his unlikable
cronies. He holds a meager handful of cash. Dad and Mum look
chastened. The mood is sombre.
LYONS
There's only fifteen here.
DAD
The rest will come.
LYONS
You know by rights I could take this farm
back today, don't you? And I'm a great
believer in my rights.
DAD
It will come.
LYONS
If you drank less beer and bought fewer
horses you might be able to look your
landlord in the eye, Narracott.
Lyons begins loading up his ledger into his bag.
14.
DAD
I said I'll pay you. We got to plant the
bottom field.
LYONS
Bottom field's rock hard. Only stones down
there.
DAD
No, we're going to plow it. Just give me
`til the autumn. I'll pay every penny I owe
you. With interest.
LYONS
How you going to plow it? Not with that
fancy animal of yours?
DAD
He'll do it.
LYONS
You'll not get that one in a harness, let
alone pulling a plow. Even drunk on a
Tuesday night, you know that. And I can't
wait for the money - there's a war coming.
Dad stands up from his chair, resolute.
DAD
I promise you that field will be plowed.
We'll plant it with turnips. And the money
will be yours when harvest comes.
Mrs. Narracott interjects, desperate.
MRS. NARRACOTT
Please, sir. Please.
Lyons takes his time. He looks at them both - Ted and Rosie,
almost beaten.
LYONS
Very well - if that fancy plows that field
I'll give you till October to set things
straight.
Lyons heads for the door, but Albert stands in his way.
ALBERT
What if he doesn't?
LYONS
I'll take the horse on the day he fails.
(BEAT)
(MORE)
15.
LYONS (CONT'D)
And I'll take your father's farm and give it
to working men who can hold their pints and
hold their heads high in decent company.
Lyons tries to move past, but Albert grabs his arm.
ALBERT
No, please. Sir, you can't do that.
LYONS
Now, now, now, lad. What - are you bladdered
as well?! Ted Narracott - I got you down in
my book!
Albert knows he has to back down. Lyons walks past him and
leaves with David and his cronies.
Albert walks towards the stables - enters. And talks to Joey
as he prepares the harness.
ALBERT
How are you today, Joey? I don't know much
about life, boy, but I do know that there
are big days and there are small days. And
most days are small days, and, well, they
don't matter much to anyone - but this -
well, this is a big one. This is our big
day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going
to take this off -
(he takes off his coat)
Well, if it's tough for you - it should be
tough for me, too...
18.
He is left in just a loose-fitting white shirt....
ALBERT (CONT'D)
Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow
and you're gonna learn. Is that
understood? And then we can be
together, which is how I believe
things are meant to be.
Joey instinctively balks, but Albert is stern with him.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
Boy. Steady, boy. Here we go. Here
we go.
As he approaches Joey with the harness, Harold the goose
enters the stable to watch.
Albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his
own neck and shoulders to demonstrate -
ALBERT (CONT'D)
Easy, easy... Look at me, Joey. See?
See? You've just gotta put your nose
through.
It is a moment between them. The horse looks Albert in the
eye, then yields. Albert comforts him and show there is
nothing to fear. Finally he gets the harness in place.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
That's it. See? You've got it.
You've got it. Good boy. There...
Harold honks his approval.
Albert leads Joey out across the yard, through the broken
gate.
Albert washes Joey and tends the wounds and sores on his
body. Rosie is putting antiseptic on Albert's wrists and
shoulders. Joey bristles but is soothed by Albert's care.
ROSIE
You're as battered and bloodied as he is.
ALBERT
And where's Dad?
ROSIE
Still in the bottom field.
ALBERT
Stumbling about, I suppose.
ROSIE
It's not the drink, Albert, that
makes him stumble -
26.
ALBERT
(ABRUPTLY)
He drinks, mum.
ROSIE
Well, so might you if you'd been
where he's been, seen what he's
seen!
ALBERT
Well, he don't talk to me about it.
ROSIE
He don't talk about it because he
can't. There aren't words for some
things. Come here...
Rosie stalks over to a pile of broken equipment in a corner
of the stables. She rummages until she finds a waterstained
brown paper parcel tied with yarn. She brushes away some
mouse turds.
ROSIE (CONT'D)
The mice've been at it. Sit down.
They sit together on a step. As she begins to untie the
yarn, a change comes over her: her irritated determination
gives way to sadness. Albert comes to her and kneels beside
her as she gently opens the paper.
Inside there's a red and tan pennant, knotted and fringed at
both ends.
MRS. NARRACOTT
Here. It's his campaign pennant. He were
Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial
Yeomanry.
Then with great care she unfolds the sash to reveal two
silver medals. The first, with the profile of Victoria, hangs
from a red, blue and orange ribbon.
ROSIE
And that is the Queen's South Africa
Medal. Every man who fought in the
Boer War got one of those. But
this...
She holds up the other medal, hanging from a red and black
ribbon.
ROSIE (CONT'D)
That's the Distinguished Conduct
Medal.
27.
She hands Albert the Distinguished Conduct Medal. He takes
it, astonished.
ALBERT
Not dad's?
ROSIE
Well it ain't mine, dear. He got
that after the fighting at
Transvaal. After he'd been hurt, and
he'd saved some other lads, and
well... I don't know what else, he
won't tell me either. But the first
day he got home he just... tossed
them out. First day he could walk,
he threw `em straight in the
dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word I
said not to.
Albert nods, looking at the medal and campaign pennant. She
takes the medal back, puts it in the sash, and begins to wrap
it again.
ROSIE (CONT'D)
See, what you done today, you and
Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so
you should be, my splendid boy. It's
good to be proud when you done
something good. But what he done, in
Africa, whatever it was, he takes no
pride in it. Hard as it surely was,
and however much pain it's cost him,
he refuses to be proud of killing, I
suppose.
She returns the things in the footlocker, closes it.
ALBERT
(CONFUSED:)
I'd be proud. If I'd gone off to
war. If I'd gone and saved my
mates, and -
ROSIE
Well, whether or not you think you'd
do the same thing as him... Think
how brave he is for refusing to be
proud.
She heads back to Albert, pennant in hand.
28.
ROSIE (CONT'D)
Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he
drinks to forget the mistakes that
he's made - but he never gave up and
he does that for us. And today, you
showed the world it's all been worth
it.
As she leaves, she drapes the pennant over Albert's shoulder.
ROSIE (CONT'D)
You keep looking after Joey and
he'll always be looking after you.
Albert looks again at the pennant.
ALBERT
(SOFTLY:)
Sergeant, Seventh Battalion,
Imperial Yeomanry.
(amazed, to Joey:)
You see this, Joey? It's been
through an entire war.
Albert holds the pennant in wonder.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
I'm not stealing it. I'll give it
back to him, someday.
Another crack of thunder - and a piece of wood in the roof
gives way - water gushes in - Dad rushes to support the roof
as the wind forces a window open.
At that moment, the door suddenly swings open with the
violence of the storm, smashing against the wall - Dad and
Rosie turn - and there is Harold the goose, who scuttles in
without his usual arrogance and hides himself in a corner.
MRS. NARRACOTT
Shoo, Harold. Shoo, shoo, shoo!
The thunder cracks again and...
Mrs. Narracott makes some coffee. Ted sits alone on a chair.
MRS. NARRACOTT
What we gonna do?
DAD
I used to believe that God gave each man his
fair portion of bad luck. I don't feel that
any more. I've had more than my share.
(PAUSE)
You'll stop loving me, Rose. And I won't
blame you when you do.
ROSE
Well, I might hate you more - but I'll never
love you less.
Then somewhere in the distance, an unfamiliar sound...
As Albert enters the stables, he calls out:
ALBERT
Look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock
Fair!
Albert opens the doors and stops dead. He looks at the empty
stables.
Albert runs out.
He rushes into the kitchen. His mother stares out the window.
She has been crying.
ALBERT
What has he done with him?
She says nothing, but her face gives everything away. Albert
in a panic turns and runs out into the lane. Mrs. Narracott
tears up again.
Joey is handed off to a groom. Joey is amazed by the scale
of the building. Each horse has a large stall and is being
tended to assiduously. Joey looks around at the hundreds of
men and horses around him and panics.
GROOM
Whoa whoa whoa. Easy easy...
He bucks, throwing the groom to the ground, and gallops away.
But Perkins cuts him off, grabs his halter, and jerks him
back to attention.
SAM PERKINS
Whoa whoa whoa, Joey! Stop muckin'
about, you hear? Yer in the army
now, son.
He pushes him into his stall, next to Major Stewart's horse,
a magnificent black stallion, TOPTHORN.
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
Good boy, good boy. Steady
steady... Easy. Relax. Easy easy,
back up.
Joey rears up in his stall.
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
Joey - meet Topthorn. Topthorn - this is
Joey. Sort out who's in charge between the
two of you, you hear? If you want to fight,
you get it over with - `cause once we're
over there, you're gonna need everything
you've got for Fritz!
This is the first time that Joey has had to deal with another
horse since his mother - the beginning of one of the most
important relationships in his life.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
Gently, Perkins. I don't want to sour him.
38.
Nicholls passes his gloves and crop to his bat boy who is
there to assist him.
SAM PERKINS
There'll be nothing gentle about the war,
sir. And there'll be nothing gentle about
this one either!
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
I understand that, Sergeant, but I
want him fit and shining. He's my
horse.
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
Sir.
Nicholls is joined by his friend LIEUTENANT CHARLIE WAVERLY.
He is sweet and friendly - upper class but completely benign.
CHARLIE WAVERLY
Scares the living daylights out of me.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
Who?
CHARLIE WAVERLY
Perkins. Glad he's on our side.
They're both joined by a tall, confident officer, MAJOR JAMIE
STEWART. He sizes up Joey.
MAJOR STEWART
Not bad. Not bad at all. Still not
a patch on my Topthorn.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
I wouldn't be so sure. I think he's got
potential. He's certainly got the bit
between his teeth.
CHARLIE WAVERLY
I actually think my Blenheim is faster than
the pair of them.
MAJOR STEWART
Clear off!
He suddenly turns from the joking into the efficient senior
officer he is.
39.
MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)
All right, gentlemen, listen here.
Everything tells us the same story, from
Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge
to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first
attack can and should be the decisive one.
Perkins...
SAM PERKINS
Yes, sir!
MAJOR STEWART
No excuses, no mistakes - every
horse groomed and fit for
presentation! I want a full practice
charge tomorrow.
SAM PERKINS
Sir.
They leave.
Stewart enters. A phonograph plays "Roses of Picardy." The
walls are decorated with etchings of famous battles, and a
large map of Western Europe that depicts how the English
troops are crossing the channel to confront the Germans near
Belgium. Nicholls is writing a letter - though actually at
this moment, he is making a little pencil drawing of Joey to
enclose with it.
MAJOR STEWART
What are you up to?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
I'm writing a letter.
MAJOR STEWART
With a picture in it?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
It's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to
show him how wonderful he's looking.
MAJOR STEWART
Before we take him away across the Channel
to face a million Germans guns.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
Yes. Before that...
MAJOR STEWART
4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the
Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport
detachment - they'll need to be at the docks
at 5 am. Check all kit. Battle orders: no
polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup
irons - let `em all go dull. I want nothing
to flash in the sun and give us away.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
Of course.
As Stewart leaves, he passes Charlie. He casually
acknowledges him.
MAJOR STEWART
Charlie...
CHARLIE WAVERLY
Jamie.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
Charlie.
43.
Charlie checks his new cap in the mirror.
CHARLIE WAVERLY
What do you think of the cap?
He shows the bright red lining to Nicholls.
CHARLIE WAVERLY (CONT'D)
Silk lining. I quite like it.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of
difference to the Germans.
CHARLIE WAVERLY
Oh, I don't know about that. Think about it -
you're a Boche, just working out which of
two chaps to shoot - and you thought - "Good
Lord - one of them really is wearing a very
stylish cap indeed!" You might shoot the
other one instead.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
Or, alternatively, think - "I fancy that
cap" and kill you first of all.
Pause. Charlie removes the cap.
CHARLIE WAVERLY
Hadn't thought of that.
Nicholls returns to his sketch.
They reach the windmill. It feels very unused. The machinery
of the windmill creaks in the dawn. The brothers untether the
horses, careful now that it is light outside.
MICHAEL
I'm hungry. Did you bring food?
GUNTHER
I'm sorry.
Michael fingers the pennant on Joey's reins. Then...
MICHAEL
Will Father be ashamed?
GUNTHER
He will pretend to be. Maybe at
first he will be. But in the end, he
will be glad.
MICHAEL
And us? What about us?
Gunther looks at him - but doesn't reply. As Michael removes
JOEY'S SADDLE:
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
I was ready to go. I was proud to
go.
(after a beat, in a very
SMALL VOICE)
I wanted to go.
Later - They sit in silence, waiting for sleep.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
The food in Italy is good.
GUNTHER
Yes.
MICHAEL
What about the women?
57.
GUNTHER
Not as good as the food.
MICHAEL
Because...they've eaten too much of
the food?
GUNTHER
You are too young for war. And
you're too young for women!
Gunther laughingly pushes him over.
MICHAEL
I don't feel so young. Not anymore.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Michael.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
What?
GUNTHER
Go to sleep - we have a big night of
riding ahead. Goodnight, Michael.
He jokingly strokes Michael's cheek. Michael swats him away,
but as he settles in the hay:
MICHAEL
Night night, Gunther.
Through the turning arms of the windmill, we glimpse the
double execution. Four rifles fire - flashes of the soldiers
shooting - the bodies on the ground.
There are Joey and Topthorn, still waiting.
And then suddenly - the doors of the windmill creak. The two
horses turn, immensely aware of the break in the silence. The
door opens a little - and we see, reflected in Joey's eye, a
very delicate, beautiful, thirteen-year-old country girl
(EMILIE).
She stares at the horses. They stare straight back at her.
And she walks straight out again, closing the big door behind
her. Joey and Topthorn settle for a moment.
59.
Time transition - Joey and Topthorn are in a slightly
different place - and the door opens again. It is the same
little girl - but this time she comes in carrying two buckets
full of water.
A small humble farmhouse - and round it, small fields,
planted with different fruit crops. We see an old man
(GRANDFATHER), burdened with a basket of berries heading back
towards the farmhouse.
A SOUND CAUSES HIM TO LOOK OUT ACROSS THE FARM -- far in the
distance the STORM OF WAR is in the sky.
He enters the kitchen - which is rough, but full of the
paraphernalia of jam-making - jars, sieves, pectin, sugar.
Emilie is at the sink, washing berries.
EMILIE
Grandpre.
He heads towards the side-board, dumps the two bags and lifts
the first handful of fruits on to the counter.
She empties her clean berries into a bowl. Notes the
explosions outside.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
It's closer today.
GRANDFATHER
The wind plays tricks with the noise
- it's moving away from us.
EMILIE
I can hear it, Grandpre, and there
is no wind. You shouldn't lie to me.
GRANDFATHER
Here. There is no wind here. But
over there - a wind so strong it
will lift you off the ground...
EMILIE
You lie about everything. You say
you aren't worried but it's clear
you are. I know the war is
approaching but you say, "Oh, it's
just a trick of the wind."
He retrieves a bottle of medicine from the mantle.
60.
GRANDFATHER
(SMILING)
Did I say that?
EMILIE
You started lying when Mama and Papa
went away.
She pours a load of sugar into a bowl with the fruit.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
They're dead. But you won't say so.
Do you think I'll die if you tell me
the truth?
GRANDFATHER
The truth is -
He feeds her a spoonful of the medicine.
GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
- you should speak to your elders
with respect.
She sticks her wet finger in the sugar and sucks it to help
with the taste of the medicine.
EMILIE
If you tell me the truth about the
war, I will tell you the truth about
the big horses I've been keeping in
the windmill.
GRANDFATHER
(standing, putting his
hands on his hips)
Now - who is the one telling lies!
Grandfather watches Emilie from inside the house as he makes
jam.
EMILIE (O.S.)
Eyes on me. No talking.
Outside, Emilie has fashioned two jumps. The big one for Joey
and a little demonstration obstacle for herself. She leads
Joey to a starting point about 30 yards in front of some
crates supporting a stick about four feet off the ground.
The red pennant hangs from the stick. Joey stands quietly as
Emilie hobbles to the big jump, making a jumping gesture with
her hand.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
Today we learn to jump. Did you know
the French cleared one meter eighty-
five at the Paris Olympics to win
the gold medal? Today we will beat
that record.
Grandfather chuckles. Emilie indicates the larger barrier.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
This is your jump. When I call
you....be very brave and leap over
it.
She claps, but Joey doesn't move.
63.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
Leap over it! Watch me.
She turns to her demonstration jump and easily steps over her
six-inch high barrier.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
And now it's your --
She turns to find Joey already stepping over her mini-jump,
stopping in front of her. He's only interested in the apple
in her hand. She takes a bite herself.
JUMP TO:
Emilie returns Joey to the starting line and runs back behind
the big jump. From behind her back she produces three big
carrots dripping soil. Joey's ears perk and he takes off
quickly but at the last moment veers right and passes between
the two jumps.
Grandfather is watching through the window as he prepares his
strawberry jams. He laughs and goes back to work.
BACK TO FIELD
Aware she's being watched, she slings the carrots over her
shoulder, frustrated.
JUMP TO:
The sound of shells exploding. A huge bombardment somewhere
in the deep distance. But much closer than before. The
distant, malicious giants of war growl.
It is like a lightning storm on the horizon.
The kitchen has been emptied. The war has finally come to
them - and we can see it on Emilie's face.
EMILIE
Tell me what happened to them. To my
mother and father.
Grandfather doesn't respond.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
You said you would tell me how they
died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's
my birthday! They died fighting,
didn't they? But when the soldiers
COME -
She finally turns to face him.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
- you do nothing. You are a coward,
aren't you?
GRANDFATHER
Yes. Yes. It was your parents who
were brave. I make jams.
EMILIE
And you've never done a brave thing
in your life?
He eases himself into a chair and shrugs.
GRANDFATHER
Maybe there are different ways to be
brave. Did you know the French have
the best carrier pigeons? And this
could be the difference in the war -
our messages getting through.
68.
EMILIE
I don't want to hear about the
birds.
GRANDFATHER
They are released at the front and
told to go home - this is all they
know. But to get there they must
fly over a war. Can you imagine
such a thing? Here you are flying
over so much pain and terror - and
you know you can never look down.
You have to look forward or you'll
never get home. I ask you - what
could be braver than that?
Emilie sheds a single tear.
Grandfather enters the barn, strokes Topthorn's nose as he
passes. He sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor, to reveal
a trap door. Then, he opens it.
Now from out of the trap door, he lifts a big ungainly
object, covered in another rug.
Emilie comes down the stairs as Grandfather waits proudly by
the stove. She stops when she sees the OBJECT COVERED BY THE
RUG.
EMILIE
What is that?
GRANDFATHER
A present.
Emilie moves toward the object that is covered.
EMILIE
I hope you have not bought me a
disgusting dress that I then have to
wear like last year.
GRANDFATHER
(LAUGHING)
It was disgusting?
EMILIE
Yes. I looked like an ugly nun.
69.
Then she stops herself and turns to Grandfather with a
parental rebuke.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
Give me your hand.
(she takes it in hers)
Grandpre, we have no money. When
the war is over, then you can buy me
jewels and carriages.
The grandfather smiles and gives Emily a hug.
GRANDFATHER
Anything you say, my sweet one.
Anything-you-say! You are, of
course, the boss. It's just an old
thing I found - don't worry yourself
- leave it, I'll put it back.
He leaves the room. Now Emilie is alone and she can't help it
when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the
rug. She looks back over her shoulder to make sure she's not
being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug. Her face
explodes with a gorgeous smile. She pulls off the rug that
is covering the big thing and...it is a gorgeous old saddle.
She runs her hand along the saddle -- can hardly believe it.
DAY.
Grandfather helps to swing Emilie up and into the saddle.
All at once, the Grandfather's charity evaporates.
GRANDFATHER
It was your mother's. I hid it, so
as not to encourage you. Emilie, I
want you to ride very slowly, very
carefully. And promise me you won't
go far --
EMILIE
Of course. Okay, I promise.
GRANDFATHER
To the top of the hill and straight
back again.
EMILIE
I promise.
Emilie unties her hair and tosses the red pennant to
Grandfather, releasing her hair to spill down her back and
shoulder.
70.
EMILIE (CONT'D)
My hero.
She sets off on Joey - and quickly spurs him to a gallop.
GRANDFATHER
Slowly...slowly...
She rides - past the windmill - and then over the top of a
nearby hill - she speeds over it and out of sight.
Back to the hill - a sudden change of mood. An empty shot. No
movement, no returning girl.
GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
Emilie!
Cut again to the top of the hill, then back to the
Grandfather, very worried.
GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
Emilie!
Topthorn suddenly rears up - and charges off following,
sensing danger. Grandfather starts to run in the direction of
the hill.
Topthorn charging over the brow of the hill.
The Grandfather running - out of breath.
He hears an indistinct scream from Emilie!
He reaches the top of the hill - comes over the brow - and
there is not the fallen body of Emilie, which he has been
fearing, but a brutal line of German soldiers - and
motorbikes. It is like a line of Indians in a Western -
total, alien fear.
And there amongst them is Emilie, astride a panicked Joey,
surrounded by soldiers. Another one holds Topthorn, who bucks
and rears, but to no avail. Grandfather starts down the hill
towards his granddaughter.
Elsewhere, a line of soldiers waiting for medical assistance
are curious about what is going on. Blinded by gas, eyes
bandaged, one of them turns toward the commotion. It is
Albert.
ALBERT
What is it?
98.
AN ORDERLY
It's a horse they found, wandering about in
No Man's Land.
(easing him back onto a
COT)
Down you go.
ALBERT
What kind of an horse?
AN ORDERLY
Bloody miraculous kind of an horse,
be my guess. Nothing makes it out
of No Man's Land.
Albert lies there, but can't let go of the thought:
ALBERT
Miraculous horse...
Joey stands tall, eating some hay, now healed.
Complete change of atmosphere. Silence. Tension. Albert
stands at attention with Sergeant Fry. A severe Major is
behind his desk.
ALBERT
I don't understand, sir.
MAJOR TOMPKINS
Officers' horses only. All other
horses are to be auctioned
immediately.
SERGEANT FRY
That is a complete and bloody outrage. It's
the lad's horse, sir, from Devon. He raised
him up from a pup, he did. Trained him
right up to the day when the army came to
town.
MAJOR TOMPKINS
These aren't my orders, sergeant.
(TO ALBERT)
You'll have to take him to market. That's
all.
Albert puts on a brave face as he collects Joey and leads him
out of the stables in silence.
Albert waits anxiously, the Geordie lad by his side, as Joey
is led into the pen.
104.
GEORDIE
You're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than
fifteen for a thoroughbred. They want work
horses.
The auctioneer starts the bidding on Joey.
AUCTIONEER
Next one. We start at four pounds.
Four pounds.
The farmers seem disinterested, shaking of heads. The bidding
starts. Five pounds, six, seven, now it goes slowly, eight,
nine, ten. Albert looks pleased at how it's going. He feels
the cash in his hand. It seems to stick on ten, then a new
hand comes up at the back of the auction - it is a nasty
looking moustached man.
THE BUTCHER
Eleven.
Sergeant Fry scowls.
SERGEANT FRY
It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's
been bidding for the best all
morning.
AUCTIONEER
Eleven. Eleven pounds. Eleven pounds.
SERGEANT FRY
Let me handle this, private.
(he calls out) )
Fifteen, and let that be an end to it.
He looks daggers at the Butcher.
AUCTIONEER
Fifteen pounds.
BUTCHER
Sixteen.
AUCTIONEER
Sixteen pounds.
SERGEANT FRY
Seventeen.
BUTCHER
Twenty of your English pounds. And let THAT
be the end of it, my friend.
105.
AUCTIONEER
Twenty pounds.
SERGEANT FRY
Twenty Five.
AUCTIONEER
Twenty five pounds.
BUTCHER
Twenty Six.
AUCTIONEER
Twenty six pounds.
The men are all looking very worried... There's not much
left.
SERGEANT FRY
Twenty seven.
BUTCHER
Twenty eight.
AUCTIONEER
Twenty eight pounds.
SERGEANT FRY
Twenty nine.
BUTCHER
And thirty.
AUCTIONEER
Any advance at thirty pounds?
Then, from the back, another, new French voice...
FINAL BIDDER
One hundred pounds.
He steps to the front of the crowd, and suddenly we see who
it is. It is Emilie's Grandfather.
GRANDFATHER
And sir, if you bid against me, I will sell
the coat on my back and bid to one hundred
and ten. And if you bid against me again, I
will sell my farm and bid to a thousand.
Everyone looks at Albert who is devastated. Albert is
reeling. He hears the auctioneer repeat the final amount and
brings down his gavel.
106.
AUCTIONEER
One hundred pounds. Going, going,
gone.
The soldiers slowly disperse, leaving Albert to stare at
Joey. It really is all over.
