      FX: DMP WIDE SHOT, an ancient hallway, once beautiful,
      high vaults of stone & metal.  But the roof is now broken,
      open to the dark orange sky, the edges burning.  Bottom of
      frame, a walkway, along which walk THE NARRATOR, with staff,
      and 2 TIME LORDS, the latter pair in ceremonial collars.

      FX: NEW ANGLE, LONG SHOT, the WALKWAY curves round, Narrator
      & Time Lords now following the curve, heading towards TWO
      HUGE, CARVED DOORS, already open.  A Black Void beyond.

      FX: OTHER SIDE OF THE HUGE DOORS, NARRATOR & 2 TIME LORDS
      striding through.  The Time Lords stay by the doors, on
      guard; lose them, and the doors, as the Narrator walks on.

      FX: WIDE SHOT of the Black Void - like Superman's Krypton,
      the courtroom/Phantom Zone scenes - deep black, starkly
      lit from above.  Centre of the Void: a long table, with 5
                                  Writer's 
      TIME LORDS in robes (no collars) seated.

      The Narrator - now designated THE LORD PRESIDENT - reaches
      the table.  He puts down his staff, loosens his robes -
      underneath, a battered, black flack-jacket; this man is a
                  The 
      warrior.  One hand is sheathed in a BLUE-METAL GAUNTLET. 

      Amongst those seated; THE CHANCELLOR, male, 45, thin,
      worried; THE PARTISAN, female, 50, calm, shrewd.

                                    LORD PRESIDENT
                    What news of the Doctor?

                                      CHANCELLOR
                      Disappeared, my Lord President. 

                                      PARTISAN
                    But we know his intention.  He
                    still possesses the Moment.  And
                    he'll use it, to destroy Daleks
                    and Time Lords alike.

                    The Visionary confirms it...

      At the far end of the table; THE VISIONARY.  Female, 50,
      insane, swathed in more witch-like robes.  Her face covered
      with henna tattoos.  She scribbles constantly on old
      parchments with a quill-like pen, muttering (her voice
      muttering always, a constant undercurrent throughout):

                                      VISIONARY
                      ...ending, burning, falling, all
                    of it falling, the black and pitch
                    and screaming fire, so burning...

                                      CHANCELLOR
                    All her prophecies say the same. 
                    That this is the final hour.  That
                    Gallifrey falls; that we die, today.

                                      VISIONARY

                    Perhaps it's time.  This is only
                    the furthest edge of the Time War. 
                    But at its heart, millions die
                    every second.  Lost in bloodlust
                    and insanity.  With Time itself
                    then resurrecting them, to find
                    new ways of dying, over and over
                    again.  We have become a travesty
                    of life.  Isn't it better to end
                    it?  At last?

      FX: PARTISAN convulses, in pain, swirls away, into nothing.

                                    LORD PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                    Now.  You were saying?

      Silence.  All too scared.  Then, suddenly furious:

                                    LORD PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                    I will not die.  Do you hear me?! 
                    A billion years of Time Lord history
                    riding on our backs, I will not
                    let this perish, I will not! 

      The Chancellor's panicky, goes to the Visionary, takes a
      scroll - she keeps scribbling - takes it to the President.

                                    WILF
                    Just get away, sweetheart!  Run,
                    Donna, run for your life!

                                                                            CUT TO:


                                    WILF
                    - don't!  Don't think about it! 
                    Oh Donna my love, don't - !

                                                                            CUT TO:


                                    WILF
                    Donna?  What was that?!  Donna,
                    are you there?  Donna?!

      But THE MASTER looks at the DOCTOR.

      Who's now smiling.  And he winks.

      The Master furious, strides over, pulls off mouth-strap -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    That's better!  Hello!  But really,
                    did you think I'd leave my best
                    friend without a defence mechanism?

                    Doctor, what happened?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    She's all right, she's fine, I
                    promise, she'll just sleep.

                                    THE MASTER
                    Ohh, it's such a very great mistake
                    to let you talk...

      He's got the mouth-strap ready, but...  Close, intimate:

                                    THE MASTER (CONT'D)
                    But tell me.  Where's your Tardis?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You could be so wonderful.

                                    THE MASTER
                    Where is it?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You're a genius, you're stone-cold
                      brilliant, you are, I swear, you
                                                          Tale
                    really are.  But you could be so
                    much more.  You could be beautiful. 
                    With a mind like that, we could
                    travel the stars.  It would be my
                    honour.  Because you don't need to
                    own the universe.  Just see it. 
                    To have the privilege of seeing
                    the whole of time and space...
                    that's ownership enough.

                                    THE MASTER
                                  Writer's 
                    ...would it stop, then?  The noise
                    in my head?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I can help.
                  The 
                                    THE MASTER
                          (scared)
                    I don't know what I'd be.  Without
                    that noise.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I wonder what I'd be, without you.

                                    THE MASTER
                          (small smile)
                    Yeah.

      Wilf quiet, fascinated by these two:

                                    WILF
                    What does he mean?  What noise..?

                                    THE MASTER
                    It's beyond you, old man.

      And he walks away from the Doctor.  But the moment isn't
      broken; he's still quiet.  Bitter.  Wants to talk.  Hasn't
      said this aloud for hundreds of years.

                                    THE MASTER (CONT'D)
                    It began on Gallifrey.  As children. 
                          (pause)
                    Not that you'd call it childhood. 
                    Just a life of duty.  Eight years
                    old, I was taken for initiation. 
                    To stare into the Untempered Schism.

                                    WILF
                    ...what does that mean?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's a gap in the fabric of reality. 
                    You can see into the Time Vortex
                    itself.  And it hurts.

                                    THE MASTER
                    They took me there.  In the dark.

                    On the Eve of Cold Lamentation.  I
                    looked into Time, old man.  And I
                    heard it.  Calling to me.  The
                    drumbeat.  The never-ending drums...

      suspended above the table, TIME LORDS at the table watching.

                    History says that the Master heard
                    a rhythm.  A torment that stayed
                    with him for the rest of his life.

                                    LORD PRESIDENT
                      A drumbeat.  A warrior's march...

                    I wonder.

      He looks across the table, at THE VISIONARY.

      She's muttering, but staring right at him.  And with one
      black-painted fingernail, she's tapping on the table.

        One-two-three-four.  One-two-three-four.

      And the Lord President smiles.  Everything making sense.

                                    LORD PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                    A rhythm of four.  The heartbeat
                    of a Time Lord.

      On the tapping, one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four...

                    Partners in time. 

                                    THE MASTER

                    Ohh but that's clever.  No, wait a

                    That noise exists within my head...

                    Every person on Earth can hear it. 
                      Imagine... ohhh yes!

                    1948, I was over there.  End of
                    the Mandate in Palestine.  Private
                    Mott!  Skinny little idiot, I was. 
                    Stood on this rooftop, middle of a
                    skirmish, like a blizzard, all
                    these bullets in the air.  World
                    gone mad.  
                          (smiles)
                    Ah, you don't want to listen to an
                    old man's tales.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm older than you.

                                    WILF
                    Get away.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm nine hundred and six.

                                    WILF
                    Really, though?

                    Nine hundred years.  We must look

      And Wilf gets out the service revolver.

                                    WILF
                    I want you to have this.  Kept it
                    all this time.  I thought...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No.

                    But if you take it, you could -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No.

                    You had that gun.  Back in the
                    mansion.  You could have shot the
                    Master, there and then.

                                    WILF
                    Too scared, I s'pose.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'd be proud.

                                    WILF
                    Of what?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    If you were my dad.

                    Oh now, don't start.

      The Doctor laughs, a little.  But Wilfred's struggling,
      still holding the gun.

                    will knock four times.  And then
                    you die.  That's him, isn't it,
                    the Master?  The noise in his head? 
                    The Master is going to kill you.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Ohh yeah.  Isn't that the truth? 
                    Got it in one!  I deserve it,
                      absolutely!  I so deserve to live.

                    where is it, then?  Just once.

                                    WILF
                    Then take it.

                    I can't.  I just can't.

                    They'll be alive?  And Human? 
                    Then don't you dare, sir.  Don't

      Both staring.  Both tearful.  Wilf takes the Doctor's hand. 
                  The 
      Lifts it to the gun.  The Doctor's hand, and Wilf's, on
      the cold metal, together.  Like an act of faith.

      And then:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Never.

      He gently pushes the gun back to Wilf.  And lets go.

      And then, all silky and sinister:

                    Inside the Time War, and the whole
                    War was Timelocked, like, sealed
                    inside a bubble, it's not a bubble

                    That's how I choose to remember
                    them.  The Time Lords of old.  But
                    then they went to war, an endless
                    war, and it changed them.  Right
                    to the core.  You've seen my
                    enemies, Wilf; the Time Lords are
                    more dangerous than any of them.

      He holds his arms out, in supplication.

      The Gate-end of the room - empty of people - beginning to
      FLARE WITH PRAC BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT.

      REVERSE: TWO TIME LORDS in ceremonial collars, one male,
      one female, stand unmoving, with heads bowed, their hands
      covering their faces, a ritual gesture of shame.  Behind
      them, in a line, two other TIME LORDS from the table (but
      not the Visionary) the CHANCELLOR just joining the back
      line, to make three, all now in ceremonial collars.

                                    LORD PRESIDENT
                    The vote is taken.  Only two stand

      Now he walks to stand in front of the two Weeping Time
      Lords, facing front, so he's the apex of the triangle.

      PRAC WHITE LIGHT backlights the triangle, a powerful white
      light in the dark.  Growing in strength.

      The Time Lords stand tall and proud; begin to DEFOCUS...

      some computer banks, and say, any free-standing busts-on-
      plinths - remain, surreally standing in the white.

      And inside the light...

      DEFOCUSED TRIANGLE blurs into view.  THE LORD PRESIDENT
      and his TIME LORDS, swimming into existence.

      The Master can't stay ceremonial.  He starts to laugh. 
      Can't help it, wild with joy!

      Lifts himself up, dazed.  Cuts and bruises on his face;
      his suit torn.

      He tries to hold up the gun.

      But failing.

      The gun drops.

      He remains on the floor, propped up on one arm.  Breathing

      The Doctor's eyes just flick a fraction to the left.

      The FEMALE WEEPING TIME LORD lowers her hands.

      She looks up.

      It's the WOMAN.

      On the Doctor. 

      Recognising her.  After all this time.

      On Wilf, behind glass.

      The Woman stares at the Doctor.  But then, her eyes flicker
      just a fraction to the right.  Meaning, behind the Doctor.

      Meaning the Master.

      And the Doctor pivots round, one last time, switches the
      gun to his other hand, now aiming it right at the Master.

      The Master terrified.

      About to die.

        Tap-tap-tap-tap.

      Pause.  Then again.

        Tap-tap-tap-tap.

      And all the joy drains out of the Doctor.  All the hope. 
      His entire future, gone.  As he realises.  Slowly, he turns
      round.  Knowing already what he'll see.

      WILF.

      Still in the glass booth.  It was him; one more time, he
      taps lightly on the glass, one-two-three-four.

      now, slowly, bring up the sound of an ALARM, a red alert;
      it's been there from the top of the scene, but only now
      filtering into the Doctor's consciousness.

      Wilf tries a little smile.

      That magical sound.

      Filling the air, stronger than ever before.  Bringing life
      and strength and hope.

      ...and Donna's eyes flicker open.

      Sylvia smiling.  Shaun overjoyed!

                    Donna, it's me, I'm here, you're

                    ...but... what happened?  I was... 
                    Did I miss something? Again?!

      And Sylvia hurries out, so happy -

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CAPTAIN JACK HARKNESS sits all alone, at the bar.  Deep in
      thought.  He's lost so much, and found nothing.

      Around him, incredible life, in a dark, downtown drinking
      hole in Zaggit Zagoo, capital of Zog.  Aliens galore!  TWO
                                                          Tale
      SLITHEEN.  Some HATH.  A masked SYCORAX.  A GRASKE.  JUDOON. 
      Unnameable THINGS.  The rest filled with MONK & NUN extras.         
      FX: an ADIPOSE waddles past Jack, on the counter, mewling.

      Then the barman slides a piece of paper over to Jack.

                                      BARMAN
                    From the man over there.

      Jack's puzzled.  Looks up. 
                                  Writer's 
      Far across the bar, THE DOCTOR.  Just standing there.

      Jack smiles, a little, but stays where he is.  Knows
      something's different.  Holds up the paper, what's this?

                  The 
      The Doctor just nods, open it.

      Jack does so.

      A handwritten note, saying:

      His name is Alonso.

      Jack looks up again.

      The Doctor nods, to his left.

      The man sitting next to Jack, also on his own, turns around. 
      It's MIDSHIPMAN FRAME.

      Jack smiles at the Doctor.  Gives him a salute.  Farewell.

      The Doctor gives that little salute back.  Then turns away,
      into the shadows, gone.

      As the sound of the Tardis echoes away in the distance,
      Jack turns to Midshipman Frame.

                                      CAPTAIN JACK
                    So, Alonso.  Going my way?

                                      MIDSHIPMAN FRAME
                    How d'you know my name?

                                      CAPTAIN JACK
                    I'm kinda psychic.

                                      MIDSHIPMAN FRAME
                    Really?  D'you know what I'm
                    thinking right now?

                                      CAPTAIN JACK
                    Oh yeah.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                                          Tale

        A Waterstone's-type shop.  A queue of PEOPLE, for a book-
      signing.  Advertising for the book on display, a blown-up
      cover: A Journal of Impossible Things, by Verity Newman.

      The queue leading to VERITY, sitting at a table, a stack
      of books next to her.  She is the image of Joan Redfern
      (eps 3.8 & 9).  Chatting to a customer, as she signs.

                                      VERITY
                    ...it's not just a story, every
                                  Writer's 
                    word of it is true.  I found my
                    great grandmother's diary in the
                    loft.  And she was a nurse, in
                    1913, and she fell in love with
                    this man, called John Smith.  Except
                  The 
                    he was a visitor.  From another
                    world.  She fell in love with a
                    man from the stars.  And she wrote
                    it all down.

      Customer moves off, next one moves in foreground - she
      automatically takes the book, doesn't look up.

                                      VERITY (CONT'D)
                    And who's it for?

                                    MAN
                    The Doctor.

                                      VERITY
                    To... the Doctor...
                          (adds her name)
                    Funny, that was the name he used.

      And as she hands the book back, she looks up.

      THE DOCTOR standing here.

      And she's breathless.

      She knows.  She just knows.

      The Doctor so grave.  So kind.

      Hold the stare, the silence.  She can't help it, she starts
      to cry, just a little.  And then:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Was she happy?  In the end?

                                      VERITY
                    Yes.  Yes she was.

      Hold the silence.

                                      VERITY (CONT'D)
                    Were you?

      He gives a small smile.  Takes the book.  Walks away.

      THE DOCTOR steps inside, exhausted. 

      He stops by the doors, rests against them, lifts his hand.

      FX: the faint GOLDEN GLOW.

      Then he walks up the ramp.  Still surrounded by Ood-song,
      the unearthly choir swelling all around him. 

      He reaches the console.  Clicks a few switches. 

      Watches the Time Rotor rise and fall...

      More pain.  Fights it off.  But it's time.

      He stands back.  Closer to the ramp. 

                  The 
      Ready, but never ready for this. 

      Then, quietly:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I don't want to go.

      And then, slowly...

      FX: CU THE DOCTOR, as gently, a shroud of calm GOLDEN GLOW
      rises up around his head, his features still visible.

      FX: MID-SHOT DOCTOR, lifting his GLOWING HANDS, in
      amazement, his face still visible within its glow.

      And then, a sudden acceleration, wham - !
