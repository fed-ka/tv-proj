    The office.  Crowded.  Active.  People rushing this way, 
      that.  We slalom through them, toward...


      ...Diane s office where three officials, oozing authority, 
      power, sit.  Two women, one man.  Staring straight at us, like 
      pashas.  

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    We ve been watching you.

      DIANE, the person being watched, laughs, leaning against her 
      desk.

                                  DIANE
                    Now that sounds sinister. 

    The three smile.  The middle one, VICTORIA ADLER (40), is a 
      pleasant Chief Justice who carries herself like a queen.  

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    I know how much you hate praise, 
                    Diane, so please, forgive us.  What 
                    you have done for women-- through 
                    example, encouragement, and 
                    perseverance is truly unparalleled.  
                    Your work on Emily s List, your 
                    mentoring of young lawyers, your 
                    shattering of the glass ceiling... 

                                  DIANE
                    I have a feeling we re coming to a 
                    very significant  but. 

                                  WALLACE GIBBS
                    No, a small one.  -- But you now 
                    have a hard decision to make.  

      A Democratic macher, WALLACE GIBBS.  Meticulous metrosexual. 

                                  DIANE
                    And that is?  

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    We want you to be a judge.

      Diane stares at them.  Laughs, surprised:

                    No.

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    Yes.  

      Victoria, playing emissary, nods to Wallace.

                                  WALLACE GIBBS
                    We re here as representatives of

                    chairs.  We would like to slate you 
                    on the upcoming ballot.

                                  DIANE
                    I... I m startled. 

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    We need more women judges, Diane.  
                    We need better judges.  Right now 
                    we have two lifeguards for every 
                    swimmer...
                          (off Diane s look)
                    Two judges who understand the law 
                    to every one who doesn t.  And we 
                    need to maintain that ratio.  

                                  DIANE
                    I hope I m a lifeguard.

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    That s the reason we re here.

      Diane looks out toward Will talking with a ring of Associates.

                                  DIANE
                    And my firm?   

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    You ll have to divest, of course. 

      Diane takes a moment: oh.

                                  WALLACE GIBBS
                    We don t do smoke-filled rooms 
                    anymore, Diane, but we do manage 
                    the primary ballot.  So if you 
                    agree, you ll be the only woman 
                    slated, and thus a shoo-in.

                    That s how I became Chief Justice.  
                    But it means leaving all this

                                  DIANE

      football scholarship to a good advantage.

                                  MARK RICHARDSON
                    You know it s called  bargaining,  
                    right?  Why am I the only one 
                    making concessions?

      Alicia smiles: enough of pro now to appreciate the game of law.

                                  ALICIA
                    I just gave you an extra year on

                    You want Terrance to plead guilty? 

      Alicia talks with TALIARAMSEY (30s), the middle class African-
      American mother of her client, a concerned and delicate mom 
    who has made her one obsession the protection of her son.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I want him to go home.  The plea is 
                    a formality, Talia, that s all, and 
                    it s a minor misdemeanor.

                    Six months probation.  100 hours 
                    community service.

      JUDGE HENRY BAXTER (40) renders judgement on a 16-year-old.  
      Baxter is lean, shaggy, liberal, the life of the party.  
      Bailiffs and court reporters love him.  He keeps things 
      moving and fun.

                    You re lucky it s Christmas time,

      Taliareaches into her purse for them as Baxter reviews the 
      file, glancing up intermittently to assess Terrance.  Looking 
      a little bigger without his glasses.

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Where s your counsel, young man?

                    Oh good, shall we all gather around 
                    the campfire here, counselor?  And 
                    I understand you ve reached a plea 
                    agreement, Mr. Richardson?

      Alicia finally grabs the glasses, and rushes up the aisle to 
      join Terrance as Richardson at the prosecution table:

                                  MARK RICHARDSON
                    Yes, your honor, Mr. Ramsey has 
                    agreed to plead guilty to Simple 
                    Assault.  

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Is that correct, Mr. Ramsey, you re 
                    ready to plead guilty?

                                  TERRANCE
                    Yes, Sir. 

      Alicia slips the glasses into Terrance s hand.  Oh, he nods, 
      puts them on... 

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    You understand, Mr. Ramsey, you 
                    have the right--

    But Baxter stares at Terrance now with glasses-- 

                                  JUDGE BAXTER (CONT D)
                    Is there a problem, counselor?

      Baxter leans back, smiles, shoots a look toward the grinning 
      Bailiff...

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Well, we re in for a treat today, 
                    aren t we Danny?  Some good old 
                    Florrick magic.  

      Alicia frowns: just the usual judicial pound of flesh.

                    Why don t you take off those 
                    glasses and put them in your 
                    pocket, son? 

      Terrance nods, does so, as...

                    To the charge of Simple Assault, 
                    how do you plead, Mr. Ramsey? 

    He looks at Alicia who nods.

                    Guilty, Your Honor.  

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    And, in your own words, what happened? 

                                  TERRANCE
                    At lunch Reggie said he was going 
                    to beat me up after school.  He 
                    called me a little bitch and said 
                    he was going to break my glasses.  
                    He scared me and I threw my book at 
                    him.

      Taliawatches, concerned for her son.

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    And the state s recommendation?

                    The agreement you have is between

                    As such, I am not party to that 
                    agreement and may impose a harsher 
                    sentence.  Do you understand that? 

      Terrance blinks as Alicia looks on, frustratingly impotent.  
    She shoots a look toward Richardson.

                                  JUDGE BAXTER (CONT D)
                    Mr. Ramsey, I am sentencing you to 9

                    understand that actions have

                          (softer)
                    This will be the best thing for you.

    The guards start to lead Terrance out: everything moving 
      fast, as Alicia turns to Richardson:

                                  ALICIA
                    What s the hell s going on? 

      Richardson shrugs - not sarcastic, just: what do you want me 
    to do?  Taliarushes up from the gallery.  Richardson puts 
      himself between Taliaand the judge.  It is an act of 
      compassion, under the circumstances.  

                                  TERRANCE
                    Mom. 

      It s a last lost syllable as Terrance is led out of court.  


      Alicia approaches a stunned Talia...   

                                  ALICIA
                    He s downstairs in a holding area.  
                    A bus is taking him to the 
                    detention center.

                                    TALIARAMSEY
                    He s never been away from home 
                    before.  Not even for a night. 

      A woman barely holding on.  Hard for Alicia:

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry.

      Alicia rushes down a passageway in the bowels of the criminal 
      courts building.  Her cell phone rings: the  Twilight Zone  
      jingle that indicates Jackie. 

    She digs out her phone, silences it, reaches the end of the 
      hall.  The guard glances at her badge and lets her into...


      ...a passage looking out onto a large interior courtyard 
      where YOUNG DELINQUENTS (11 - 16 years old, tough) are being 
      loaded on buses.  Alicia is stopped at a fence, seeing 
      Terrance, just about to board, the other kids towering over 
      him, goofing around.  Terrance quiet and terrified.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Terrance!  Over here!

      Terrance turns, cheeks tear-streamed.  It breaks Alicia s 
      heart.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Your mom-- she wanted you to know...

    But the kids around him laugh, yell  What s his mom say?   
      Mimicking her voice:  I love you, Terrance.   Smooching.  
      Alicia frowns: shit.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    I m working to get you out.

                                  TERRANCE
                    I m sorry.

      It s heartbreaking.  A kid blaming himself.  As a guard 
      pushes him up onto the bus.  And... 

      ...Alicia can only watch as Terrance is pushed toward his 
      seat.  He struggles to put on his glasses, looks toward 
      Alicia.  Alicia has to brace herself to keep from crying.

                    Your boss wanted six months.  You 
                    got nine.  

      Richardson starts off, Alicia follows him...

                                  MARK RICHARDSON
                    Look, Florrick is not the most 
                    popular name around here.

                                  ALICIA
                    That s not what this was about.  
                    This was a bait and switch.

      Richardson stops, turns to her.

                                  MARK RICHARDSON
                    Oh, come on.  A judge has 
                    indigestion, you get six months.  
                    He has a good meal, someone goes 
                    free.  It balances itself out. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Not for Terrance Ramsey.

                                  MARK RICHARDSON
                    Then what do you wanna do?  You act 
                    like this isn t the water we re 
                    both swimming in.  

      Alicia starts away.  Richardson considers it, looks after 
      her.

      bone.  Okay, she walks back to Richardson.

      hears laughter inside.  She leans in toward the door to hear:

                                  SHANNON (O.S.)
                    She s the one who took you there?

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    Yeah, to see my dad?  She thinks 
                    he s staying at a country club.

    The two laugh.  As...


      ...HOWARD BRIGHTMAN (35), a man with a box, crosses with 
      Alicia through the bullpen.  Brightman is an anachronism-- a 
      hippie in hippie s clothing.  He keeps looking behind him.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thanks for agreeing to meet, Mr. 
                    Brightman.

                                  HOWARD BRIGHTMAN
                    Howie.  So do you always have a 
                    buffet like that?

      Alicia looks back, didn t even think of it.

                                  ALICIA
                    Did you want something?  A muffin 
                    or something?

                                  HOWARD BRIGHTMAN
                    No.  No, I m fine.  So, yeah, you 
                    were interested in my client, 
                    Damian Harken?  Kid stole a chicken 
                    from Costco.  Richardson agreed to 
                    a plea of simple theft and 
                    supervised release.  But Judge 
                    Baxter gave him nine months.


                                  ALICIA
                    You filed a motion to reconsider?

                                  HOWARD BRIGHTMAN
                    Yep, Baxter denied it. 

                                  ALICIA
                    On what grounds? 

    But Brightman pauses, sees another bagel tray on a side 
      table.  A lot of food.  Staring at it...

                                  HOWARD BRIGHTMAN
                    Um, he sentenced within the 
                      guidelines.  Judicial discretion.  
                    So every day they just put out all 
                    this food?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Every day.  Why don t you...

                                  HOWARD BRIGHTMAN
                    No, no, I had lunch.  Baxter is a 
                    bipolar sentencer.  No one wants to 
                    confront him because we all have to 
                    go back there.  You looking to file 
                    a motion to reconsider?

                                  ALICIA
                    I am.

      Howard sets the box on the conference table... 

                                  HOWARD BRIGHTMAN
                    A year ago we started segregating 
                    cases by judge.  So these are all 
                    the Baxter cases.   Maybe I ll just 
                    grab one.
                          (the bagels)

                                  ALICIA
                    Please.

    As Brightman crosses to the bagels, Alicia opens the box, 
      packed with files. 


      Alicia s finger runs down a filing motion, comes to 
       Sentence...  Her finger runs over to the written in 
      sentence:  3 mnths probation. She flips the sheet to the 
      mugshot: a hunted looking 15-year-old Caucasian.  She places 
    the photo down on the small conference table, Brightman gone 
      now.  Turns to...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #109    "Lifeguard"    GREEN COLLATED    12/2/09    18.

      CONTINUED:1515


      ...another filing motion.  Again  Sentence: Again her 
      finger runs over to the scrawled sentence:  1 yr Detention.  
    She flips to the mugshot: a 16-year-old African American 
      girl. 

      Alicia pauses, considers it.  Takes the photo, places it 
      carefully on the other side of the desk.  Looks at the two 
      mugshots.  One white.  One black.  She turns to the new file, 
      more determined.  And...


      ... 8 mnths Detention reads a new sentence.  A determined 
      Alicia flips over to the mugshot, knows exactly what she ll 
      find.  Yep, an African-American kid.  She places it on...

      ...the desk.  And we see she has a large display of mugshots.  
      Eight on one side of the desk.  Six on the other.  No denying 
    one side is predominately black (with one stray white kid), 
    and the other side is white.

      Alicia sits back, stares at it.  Anger growing in her belly.  
      Meanwhile...


      ...Diane stands in front of WILL.  Silence for a second.

                                  WILL

                    When Illinois still had the death

                    American than a white one.  I

                    You won t.  Don t make your 
                    arguments specific to Baxter.  
                    Throw in some other judges too.  If 
                    Baxter is smart, he ll read between 
                    the lines, and reconsider.  

                                  ALICIA
                    You know Judge Baxter is a friend 
                    of Will s?  

                                  DIANE
                    I don t see the relevance.  This 
                    isn t personal.  A judge s job is 
                    to be an impartial arbiter.   Two 
                    lifeguards to every swimmer.
                          (of Alicia s look)
                    Nothing.  If Baxter fails, it s in 
                      everybody s interest to make that 
                    known.

                    No problem.  You should knock on my 
                    door more often, Alicia.

    But Diane pauses, almost forgot her own future turn.

      Rows and rows of stats on a computer screen.  Dry as 
      driftwood.  Alicia studies it on her laptop, in the kitchen, 
      Jackie preparing dinner in the background.

                    Her name is Shannon.  She rode her 
                    bike here.  She didn t want me to 
                    phone her mother.

                    She just seemed a little... mature 
                    for Grace. 
                          (Alicia turns to Jackie)
                    Her father s in prison, you know.

      Alicia smiles...

                                  ALICIA
                    Jackie.  Yourson s in prison.

                                  JACKIE
                    Yes, but not in Stateville.

      Alicia chuckles, turns back to the computer.

                                  JACKIE (CONT D)
                    What?  I wish I could laugh about it.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m not laughing about  it.   I m 
                    laughing about you.

                                  JACKIE
                    I guess that s me: a figure of fun.

      Alicia sighs, peers out toward the living room.  The kids not 
    in earshot.

                    I like that Grace has a friend, 
                    Jackie, that s all.  She s been slow 
                    to make friends at school.

                                  JACKIE

                    What?  It s not the way it used to 
                    be.  There are black cotillions.  
                    Mexican cotillions.  The girls work 
                    in soup kitchens.

      ...we re back in Baxter s court.  Alicia and Richardson wait 
    at the motion bar as Baxter reads Alicia s motion to

      leans toward Alicia, whispers:

    out their cells, drop them in, as they lace up their sneakers 
    for a mid-day pick-up game.  Mid-conversation: 

                                  WILL
                    I didn t even know Alicia had a 
                    case before you.

                                  JUDGE BAXTER 
                          (playfully)
                    Pretty sure she doesn t anymore.  

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                          (to Baxter, re: Will)
                    He s back already for another 
                    lesson, huh?

                                  WILL
                          (shaking hands with Parks)
                    How s hizzoner today? 

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    Hizzoner s getting ready to sky 
                    walk your ass.  
                          (to Baxter)
                    How s life in kiddie court?  Little 
                    tots treating you alright?

      A laughing Parks jogs onto the court.  

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    How long s she been at your firm? 

                                  WILL 
                    A few months.  What s the case? 

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Run of the mill.  Of course, she 
                    treated it like a matter for the 
                    Supreme Court.  Precedents from 
                    death row appeals.

                    page.  Rookie mistakes.

                    She has her heart in the right 
                    place.  She ll get there. 

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                          (laughs)
                    Heart in the right place?  That 
                    used to be the quickest way to get 
                    fired at your firm.  You sleeping 
                    with her?  

      Will grabs a ball, throws it at Baxter who laughs:

                                  JUDGE BAXTER (CONT D)
                    Keeping your fingers crossed 
                    Florrick loses his appeal?

                                  WILL
                    Nope.  

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Wow, you look serious.

                                  WILL
                    Just not sleeping with her.  

                                  JUDGE BAXTER
                    Not even a little?  Not even in 
                    your head?

      Will jogs out onto the court.  Baxter considers it-- hmmm.  
      Interesting.  Will can t even joke about it.  Baxter jogs out 
      onto the court too:

                                  JUDGE BAXTER (CONT D)
                    Hey, about this case.  Do your 
                    girlfriend a favor and tell her to 
                    move on.


    New carpets.  Clean windows.  Except for the receptionist 
      behind a thick security window, it looks like the waiting 
      room of a hospital, not a jail.  Talia Ramsey sits, anxiously 
      waiting for Alicia.

                    They called.  They said Terrance got 
                    hurt.  Now they won t let me see 
                    him. 

      Alicia crosses to the receptionist, taps the glass.

                    Sure.  He ll be in at 9 tomorrow. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Would you at least tell me her son s 
                    condition?  

                                  RECEPTIONIST

      Alicia starts to argue when she turns, sees a SECURITY GUARD 
      behind her.  Unyielding.

      ...the doorbell rings.  Jackie goes to the door, opens it, 
      meets MARGY VARGAS (33), Shannon s mother.  A wide awake 
      woman, always watchful, wary for life s next buffeting.

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    Hi, I m Shannon s mother.

                    I just-- I m sorry, I have to take 
                    Shannon home.

      Something distracted, even rushed about her attitude.

                                  JACKIE
                    I m so glad you came.  I was 
                    worried about Shannon riding home 
                    on her bike.  I m Jackie, Grace s 
                    grandmother.  Please, come in.

                    have to-- we re in a bit of a rush.

      Jackie stares at her, not thrilled about that.  Always 
      attuned to the subtext.  And she s not liking this subtext.

                                  JACKIE

                    I m sure.

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah, what?

      Grace and Shannon starting toward the door.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #109    "Lifeguard"    GREEN COLLATED    12/2/09    39.

                                  JACKIE
                          (correcting her)
                     Yes, what?   Shannon s mother is 
                    here.

                                  SHANNON
                    Oh, hey, mom.  This is Grace.

                                  MARGY VARGAS
                    Hi.  I m sorry, we have to go.  Do 
                    you have your homework?

      Shannon nods.  And Margy barely smiles as Shannon looks back 
      toward Grace, embarrassed:

                                  SHANNON
                    See you tomorrow.

    And that s it.  They rush toward the arriving  dinging  
      elevator, a neighbor getting on.  They get on too.  Gone.  
      Grace turns to Jackie, sensing something went sour...

                                  GRACE
                    What did you say to her?

                                  JACKIE
                          (truly innocent)
                    Nothing.

      Grace stares at her, disbelieving, then leaves the room.


      Alicia, Kalinda, Julian across from a standing Diane...  

                                  JULIAN CAIN
                    Baxter should have disclosed this.  

                                  KALINDA
                    They arrested a guy who fit the 
                      description Mrs. Baxter gave them, 
                    but then she wouldn t come in to 
                    ID.  Wasn t up to it.  Baxter asked 
                    them to let it go.  A few months 
                    later, the suspect was murdered in 
                      a drive-by.

                                  ALICIA
                    What can I do with this?

      Diane pauses.  That s the big question, isn t it?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #109    "Lifeguard"    GREEN COLLATED    12/2/09    40.

                    Not much.  Judges are human.  

    But clearly she s troubled, looking out. 

                                  JULIAN CAIN
                    It s like Alan Dershowitz.  Before 
                    9/11, he believed police coercion 
                    was unconstitutional.  After 9/11, 
                    he argued for torture.

                    He goes back into the general

                    The way I see it, it doesn t make 
                    sense to go back to Baxter with the 
                    same motion.  We should try to take 
                    the cases away from him, file a 
                    Motion to Substitute for Cause.

      Diane.  Still with the same distracted look on her face.  The 
      three powerful visitors are back, going over memos, legal 
      pads: Victoria Adler, Wallace Gibbs, and a third: 

                                  WALLACE GIBBS
                    And Sheffrin-Marks?  Your client or 
                    Will s?  

                                  DIANE
                    Both of ours.

      Victoria trades a look with her two cohorts.  

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    But he brought it in?

                                  DIANE
                    Yes.  Why?

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    We would rather it not be you.  It 
                    doesn t look good, representing a 
                      pharmaceutical company against 300 
                    working class plaintiffs.  

      Diane nods: gets it.  Doesn t like it, but gets it.

                                  WALLACE GIBBS
                    And your name,  Lockhart ?  That s 
                    an English name?

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    We don t need to go into that now.  

                                  DIANE
                    What s wrong with my name?

                                  WALLACE GIBBS
                    The electorate is 19% Irish.  They 
                    go for an Irish name.

      Diane chuckles.  

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    I know.  The things we have to 
                    think about.  I think a speech to 
                    the Irish-American Heritage Center 
                    handles that problem.

      Diane gets up.  Uncomfortable.   Victoria notices this, 
      mentions to the other two:

                                  VICTORIA ADLER (CONT'D)
                    Could you give us a minute?  

      Gibbs and the other one nod, get up, exit.  Leaving Victoria 
    and Diane.  

                                  VICTORIA ADLER (CONT'D)
                    What s wrong? 

                                  DIANE
                    Do you know Henry Baxter?

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    Yes.

                                  DIANE

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    Yes, I know.  You have a Junior 
                    Associate accusing him of racism.

      Diane looks toward Victoria, for the first time realizing she 
    may not have a friend here.

                                  DIANE
                    No, biased sentencing.

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    I m glad you brought it up, Diane.  
                    That s what I like about you.  Very 
                    direct.  I was going to talk to you 
                    about it.  You need to talk to her.

                    I want to know that you re serious 
                    about running, Diane.  That you re 
                    serious about being a judge.

                                  DIANE
                    I thought I told you I was.

                                  VICTORIA ADLER
                    Yes, now you have to act like you

    And with that Victoria leaves. Diane stares after her, 
      stunned.

      Will at the defense table looks up surprised:

                                  JUDGE PARKS
                    I said: no continuance.  We re 
                    going to trial.

      Will looks toward his second chair, stunned too.  Something 
      routine being rejected.  The case isn t important.  What s 
      important is Will s stunned look.

                                  WILL
                    Your honor, I-- the plaintiff has

                    Yes, and the bench has not.
                          (Will still stunned)
                    What is so hard to understand here,

      Will whispers to his second chair...

                                  WILL
                    And that, young sir, is called a

                    So, what, is this some last parting 
                    gift to the firm?

                                  DIANE
                    Baxter s wife was assaulted.  And 
                    he s been sentencing from his bias 
                    ever since.

                                  WILL
                    You don t know that.  You don t 
                    know why anybody decides anything.

                                  DIANE
                    I have eyes.  And you d have them 
                    too if he wasn t a friend.

                                  WILL
                    And what?  Seriously, what?  You re 
                    going to recall a judge?  Let s 
                    figure out how that works, because 
                    I d love to see the plan.  Because 
                    anybody can fight city hall; what 
                    you can t fight are judges.

                                  DIANE
                    There s a kid in prison right now--

                    Oh, come on, you don t even know 
                    his name.  This stopped being about 
                    a kid awhile ago.  

    And Will shoves out of her office.    


      Grace returns home, unhappy, dumps her book bag on the couch.

                                  JACKIE
                    Grace.  Where s Shannon?

                    I didn t tell her mom--

      Startled.  What s going on?


      More stats on a computer screen.  Cary, not Alicia, looking 
    at them this time.  Engaged. He has an insight, grabs the 
      mugshots from Baxter s sentencing, starts out toward... 


      ...Alicia and Kalinda, talking.

                    Really?  Stat Boy says we have a 
                    problem.  

      Cary starts laying out the mugshots from Baxter s cases - 
      black kids on one side, white kids on the other... 

                                  CARY
                    Black kids go to detention.  White

                    out harsher sentences to blacks.  
                    But, look.  I analyzed his 
                    sentences using two non-racial 
                    factors.  First, family structure.   

    He rearranges the mugshots, moving a couple of the white kids 
    to the black side and vice versa.  The overall balance of 
      white vs. black doesn t change.  Pointing to the two sides:

                                  ALICIA
                    So are you--?  There was no change 
                    in sentencing in June of 2008?

                                  CARY
                    No, there was.  A radical change.  
                    But it wasn t race.

                                  KALINDA
                    So the assault of Baxter s wife is 
                    irrelevant to his change in 
                      sentencing?

                    No.  We know it s relevant.  
                    Because in June in 2008, he started 
                    handing out harsher sentences.  But 
                    we just don t know why.

      Below it are two buttons.   Receive  or  reject.   Grace

                    Always liked that about you.

                                  DIANE
                          (before he can leave)
                    His name was Terrance.

                                  WILL
                    Who?

                                  DIANE
                    The kid.  Terrance Ramsey.  He s 
                    home with his mother now.

                                  WILL
                    And happiness rules.

      Will leaves.  And Diane pauses there a second.  Looks at her 
      desk, her office.  She actually likes it here.  And, yeah, 
      happiness I guess does rule.
