      The place is closed.  JOHNNY CROWDER, edgy, smokes a 
      cigarette, while HESTLER reads a porno mag.  Two of BO S 
      THUGS (call them HECKLE and JECKLE) sit passing a joint back 
      and forth.  A third thug (call him RUFUS) practices flipping 
      a knife into a dart board.

                    Son of a bitch.

                    Should a been here by now.  

      Johnny puts out his smoke, pulls on his jacket.

                    Call Bo.

                    Where the hell you going?

                                  JOHNNY
                    See if they got lost.

      Johnny s out the door.  Hestler shoots Bo s thugs a look.

                    He can be a real old lady 
                      sometimes, can t he?

      He takes out his cell phone, dials Bo.


      Raylan is asleep when his cell phone starts to ring.  He 
      rolls over, snags the phone, squints at the number, then 
      picks up.

                    like any truck fire they d ever

                    Just stay put.  I ll come get you 
                    when the time comes.

      Raylan comes up the stairs, returning from his motel, when he 
      crosses with WINONA.  

                                  WINONA
                    Hey.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Glad I ran into you.  

                                  WINONA
                          (smiles)
                    Well, I m glad you re glad.

      Raylan smiles, but:

                                  RAYLAN
                    No.  I mean yes... we need to talk 
                    about the other night.

      Before she can respond, Art approaches.  

                                  ART
                    How are you, Winona?  

                                  WINONA
                    Fine, Chief.  You?

                    Never better.  Raylan, let s take a 
                    ride upstairs.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    There a problem?

                                  ART
                    Vasquez is on break.  We can brief 
                    him, make arrangements to sit him

                          (to Art)
                    Can I catch up with you? 

      Art pushes the UP button.

                    elevator comes. 

      Raylan turns to Winona - their conversation now coded.

                                  WINONA
                    Anytime is good.  For us to talk.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I mean just talk.   

                                  WINONA
                    Oh.  Well, I m open.  Gary s at the 
                    Athletic Club.

                    Living at.  Maybe we could just 
                    talk about that.

      As Raylan realizes what she s saying, the elevator doors 
      open.  Art steps inside.

                                  ART
                          (holds the door)
                    Raylan...

                                  WINONA
                    You should go.  

                                  ART 
                    Right now.  

      Raylan crosses into the elevator.  Art clocks Raylan and 
      Winona holding a look, as the doors close.  


      Arlo s sitting on the bed, drinking Raylan s booze.  There s 
      a KNOCK on the door.  He pulls himself off the bed, shuffles 
      across the room, pulls open the door to REVEAL Bo Crowder.

                                  ARLO
                    Are you outta your mind?

                    So?

                                  BO
                    Raylan s not home.

      Long pause as Arlo considers this.

                                  ARLO
                    You ve got a shadow on me?

      Bo shrugs.  Without saying anything, he pats Arlo down for a 
      wire, doesn t find one.

                                  ARLO (CONT D)
                    How do you know there s not a mic 
                    in the ceiling?

                    Fair enough.  Why re you here?

                                  ARLO
                    Things have changed.  They know 
                    about Boyd blowing up your 
                    shipment; that he s not working for 
                    you.

                                  BO
                    They got that right.

                                  ARLO
                    They re gonna give me new handlers.

                    I have to bow to you on that score: 
                    mine s worse.  That shipment he

      Raylan enters, and surveys Arlo s squatter mess, including 
      the nearly empty bottle of whiskey, on the table.  Arlo makes 
      a half-hearted attempt to straighten up, tossing his take out 
      food wrappers in the trash.

                    Knowing that you will anyway.

      Arlo goes to the table, refills his empty glass.  Raylan 
      takes off his jacket, gets comfortable.

                                  ARLO
                    I m just making small talk.

                                  RAYLAN 
                    I don t know.  Maybe.  Never showed 
                    much aptitude for it.

      Arlo drinks, checks his watch.  

                                  ARLO
                    Guess if the girls chased me like 
                    they chase you, I d stay single 
                    too.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    What re you talking about?

                                  ARLO
                      I remember the girls always chased 
                    you, since you were twelve.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Like hell. 

                                  ARLO
                    Ava Crowder.  You gonna tell me she 
                    didn t chase you?  

                                  RAYLAN
                    She didn t have to.  

      Arlo drinks, glances out the window.  Then:

                                  ARLO
                    You remember your mama s laugh?   

                                  RAYLAN
                    She had a good one.  

                                  ARLO
                    She always hoped you and me would 
                    get closer.  Maybe things would be 
                    different now, if we had. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Guess that wasn t our way.    

                                  ARLO
                    You should get married again.  Not 
                    living like this.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What s going on, Arlo?  You keep 
                    checking your watch.  

                                  ARLO
                    Just wondered how long I ve been a 
                    prisoner here.  

      Arlo turns again, refills his glass.  His back to Raylan, he 
      slips his hand under a jacket on the table. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    That all?  

                                  ARLO
                    We never had much in common, you 
                    and me.  But that doesn t mean I 
                    don t have regrets.  

      Arlo slips his hand out, now holding a gun.  He turns to face 
      Raylan - and to his surprise (and ours) Raylan now has his 
      gun levelled back at Arlo.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Put the gun down.  

      Arlo sets the gun down, slowly.  

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    When are they coming?

                                  ARLO
                    They re waiting outside.  
                          (then)
                    How long you known?

      Raylan looks at him sadly.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Well, Arlo.  Truth is, I guess I ve 
                    always known.  

                                  ARLO 
                    This isn t something I wanted to 
                    do.  Bo didn t give me any choice. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    What s the plan?







                                                                              (CONTINUED)  EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    28-29.

                    For me to shoot you in the leg.  Bo 
                    wants to take you alive, turn you 
                    over to some fella down in Miami.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    He tell you why?  
                          (off Arlo s silence)
                    So they can torture me to death.  

                                  ARLO
                    He didn t give me details.

                                  RAYLAN
                    They waiting for a signal?

                                  ARLO
                    Gunshot.  Look, son...

                                  RAYLAN
                          (cuts him off)
                    Don t ever call me that again.  

      Then Raylan FIRES, wings Arlo s arm.  Arlo looks at his arm 
      in disbelief, as the blood starts.  

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    Just creased you.  Better sit down.  

      Arlo slumps onto the bed.  Raylan moves to the front window.

      The motel room door swings open, reveals Heckle and Jeckle.  
      They see Arlo on the bed, holding his bleeding arm.  

                                  ARLO
                    He went out the back.  

      Guns out, they come into the room.  The motel room door 
      suddenly swings closed, reveals Raylan behind it, his gun 
      leveled at the thugs  backs. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    30.

                    hands where I can see  em.

      Heckle and Jeckle hesitate, then spin, guns coming up.  
      Raylan shoots Jeckle.  Jeckle s shot goes sideways.  Raylan 
      shoots again, gets Heckle in the throat.  Heckle goes down. 

      Raylan crosses to the thugs, kicks their guns free - they re 
      both dead.  Without a word to Arlo, Raylan takes out his 
      phone, dials.  

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)

                                  RAYLAN
                    Boyd.

      Boyd looks around: two dead thugs, and Arlo, bloodied.

                    would.  Seeing as you re still

                                  RAYLAN
                    Any of them good with a gun?

                                  BOYD
                    Not as good as you.

      They drive in silence for a moment.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You were telling the truth -- your 
                      conversion and all.

                                  BOYD
                    Was I?  
                          (beat)
                    I don t know.  
                          (beat)
                    Do you believe in God, Raylan?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I do.

                                  BOYD
                    Tell me about your God.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I think that s about the most 
                    private thing in a man s life.

      Another beat of silence.

                                  BOYD
                    I set this in motion, didn t I?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Actually, me shooting Tommy Bucks 
                    had a lot to do with it, too.   


      Ava wraps a strip of cloth around Boyd s wound.

                                  BOYD
                    Where s Johnny?  

                                  AVA
                    Bo shot him at my house.  Said 
                    Johnny d betrayed him.  To you.

                                  BOYD
                    Oh, no...

                                  AVA
                    Said everyone d think I shot 
                    another Crowder and ran.

                                  BOYD
                    Is he dead?

                                  AVA
                    I don t know.  He was gut-shot.

      ANGLE ON GUN THUG at the window.  BOOM DOWN to reveal Raylan, 
      hiding below the window.

      The gun thug quietly leans his rifle against the woodpile at 
      the back of the cabin, then ever-so-silently starts to lift 
      up the window.

      Raylan looks up, sees the hands sliding up the window.  
      Raylan puts his pistol up and fires twice.

      The gun thug flops back, dead.


      Raylan crouch-runs back to his spot by the front window, 
      calls out.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Pilar and Ernesto)
                    Whoever s out there, I got your man 
                    coming around back.  That leaves 
                    three of us and two of you.


      Raylan loads the clip of his gun with his last six bullets.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Pilar)
                    Any chance you d flip on Gio?
