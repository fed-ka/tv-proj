MATT (V.O.)
My missionary ancestors came to the
islands and told the Hawaiians to put
on clothes, work hard, believe in
Christ, and stop surfing and hula
dancing. They made business deals
along the way -- buying an island, or
marrying a princess and inheriting her
land. Now their descendants wear
bikinis and running shorts, play beach
volleyball and surf, and take up hula
dancing. Hawai'i has always been a
place of contradiction.

VARIOUS SHOTS of Honolulu begin a pattern of montages to be
interspersed throughout the film.
MATT (V.O.)
My friends on the mainland think just
because I live in Hawai'i, I live in
paradise. Like a permanent vacation --
we're all just out here drinking mai-
tais, shaking our hips, and catching
waves. Are they nuts? How can they
possibly think our families are less
screwed up, our heart attacks and
cancers less fatal, our grief less
devastating? Hell, I haven't been on a
surfboard in fifteen years.

Matt leads Scottie to the car.
MATT
What's the matter with you? Showing
those pictures of Mom for your art
project?
SCOTTIE
I'm a photographer, Dad, a real
photographer.
MATT
No, you're not. You're overdoing it is
what you're doing.
SCOTTIE
I saw it in a book. Some famous
photographer lady took pictures of her
mom in the hospital while she was
dying, and they're considered art.
That's what I'm doing.
MATT
First of all, your mother's very sick,
but she's not dying. Second, you don't
share personal stuff like that with
strangers. What's going on with Mom is
private.
SCOTTIE
I'm hungry. Can we get burgers?
MATT
No.
SCOTTIE
Can we get smoothies?
MATT
No.
As Scottie continues --
MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The last time I took care of Scottie by
myself was when she was one. Now she's
ten, and I have no idea what goes on
inside her head. She's insane. And
with Elizabeth in the hospital, I think
she's testing me. I'm the backup
parent. The understudy.

BARB HIGGINS (CONT'D)
They say your decision will have a

MATT
No idea. You ask good questions.
You're getting too smart for me,
Scottie.
SCOTTIE
I'm going to find out. Then I'm going
to ask Mom when she wakes up and see if
she knows. Do you think she's going to
know everything she used to know?
Matt notices a BUFF GUY and some FRIENDS headed to a nearby
table, and his mood sours. Scottie follows his gaze.
The guy notices the Kings and feels obliged to mosey over.
This is TROY COOK -- athletic and rich.
TROY
Hi, Matt.
Hi, Scottie.
MATT

TROY
I don't know, I just wanted to know the

you guys. Really hard. Seriously. So
what I was saying was, when I was
there, I talked to her, and her hand
moved, so I was pretty encouraged. I
thought that was an encouraging sign.
Scottie looks up hopefully.
Matt notices.
MATT
That's enough.
TROY
I really think she heard me.
MATT
Look, Troy, go to your friends. No
hard feelings. Let's just leave it
alone.
Troy walks away, stops, turns back.
TROY
I told you, Matt, there were lots of
chops and holes that day. I told you a
hundred times. Ask anybody. What
happened to her could have happened to
me. It was a super-hard day on the
water.
MATT
You weren't supposed to be driving,
Troy. She was supposed to be driving.
TROY
She wanted me to drive. And she's the
one who told me to pass the other boat
right before the turn. And just your
whole attitude toward me, Matt -- I
mean, I feel terrible. I wish it were
me and not her. Plus I almost drowned
myself when we capsized. And my
rotator cuff is never going to be the
same, and I'm going to miss Moloka'i.
SCOTTIE
Just because her hand moved, it doesn't
mean anything, Troy. Mom twitches at
weird times.

SCOTTIE
I didn't mean to say dead chicken.
I don't want Mom to die.
MATT
I know, I know. Hey, let's get out of
here. Let's go do something crazy.
Like let's drive to the airport and hop
over to the Big Island and surprise
your sister. What do you say?
SCOTTIE
Right now?
MATT
It'll be fun. She's not expecting us
or anything. And we bring her home. I

you? Don't you miss her? I miss her.

Girls! What do you think you're doing

EMILY

Hi, Alex!
It's me, Scottie!
Emily takes off but doesn't get far -- she falls flat on her

MATT
You know, I pay $25,000 year for this
crap not to happen. Alex!
ALEXANDRA

My fucking dad is here!
This cracks her up even more.
Scottie laughs too, though
she's unsure why.

ALEXANDRA

Alexandra slides into the water, swims to the other side and
props herself on the edge, floating her lower body. Matt
lowers himself into the water too.
ALEXANDRA
Maybe if you spent more time with her,
she wouldn't act like such a complete
spaz. Get her out of town -- go camp
on Kaua'i. That's what mom did with me
whenever I was losing it.
MATT
Listen, Alex, your mother isn't well.
ALEXANDRA
Obviously.
MATT
They just told me she isn't going to
wake up. It's for sure now. The
doctors are going to stop caring for
her. Do you understand what I'm
saying? Your mom wanted it this way.
Alex remains silent.
MATT (CONT'D)
She has a will, see, saying we have to
do it like this. We both do. That's
why I got you. We're letting her go.
Alex looks at him, takes a couple quick, loud inhalations,
then slips --
UNDERWATER --
-- where she SWIMS, FACE CONTORTED, hoping to stay down there
forever. Finally she emerges --

Must be pretty handy for a dude having
an affair to have some empty houses at
his fingertips.

Alexandra climbs out of the car to grab a FLYER and take a

Matt waves goodbye to the last guests as they drive off, then
turns back toward his house. Halfway there, his exhaustion
forces him to COLLAPSE onto the moist lawn.
Sitting there, he comes to a REALIZATION -- not one he wants,

COUSIN RALPH (O.S.)
Yo, Matt King!
Matt turns to see COUSIN RALPH loping over, briefcase in
hand. Like Matt, he wears the island businessman's uniform --
Khakis and a Reyn's Spooner shirt.
Grinning and nodding, Cousin Ralph gives Matt a back-slap hug
and greets Scottie and Alexandra, whose names he clearly
forgets.
COUSIN RALPH (CONT'D)
Whatcha doing here?
MATT
Just came over for a day or two.
COUSIN RALPH
Yeah, I just got back from Kahului.
A
little business over there.
MATT
Yeah.
COUSIN RALPH
All right. So you here to talk to some
of the cousins? Make sure everybody's
happy with your choice? Pay your
respects to Cousin Hugh?
Matt's smiles to cover the fact that he hasn't actually been
thinking about this stuff.
MATT
No, no, nothing like that. Just a
little holoholo. Get the kids out of
town.
COUSIN RALPH
But it is Holitzer, right? We all know
it's Holitzer. Cousin Hugh wants him,
they go way back. I got my misgivings,

Are you shitting me?
You guys own all
this land?
MATT
Not personally. It belongs to a trust.
But yeah, it's ours for a few more
days.
RALPH
The other side of that ridge too. You
can't see it from here. It's like
this, but a little flatter and doesn't
have as nice a bay.
SID
This is outrageous.
COUSIN RALPH

Yep. Big resort there on that point.

Of course, part of me agrees with the

They're going to make a pretty big
stink at the meeting.
MATT
I know, but we have to sell. The trust
has to dissolve in seven years, and if
we haven't sold, it'll be a huge mess.
Selling now and distributing the cash
is the only clean way to do it.
RALPH
But it's a shame, yeah? On the other
hand, hey, it's just sitting there. No
one's using it. At least this way the
whole world will be able to enjoy it.
MATT
(to his daughters)
Take a good look, girls. In the old
days, this was part of your great-great
grandmother's inheritance going all the
way back to Kamehameha I.
With them, we look across this land, vivid and verdant.
ALEXANDRA
Down there is where Mom and I would
camp.
MATT
We all did, all our lives.
A lot of

SCOTTIE
What about me? I want to camp.
I wish
we lived in the old days.
ALEXANDRA
We do. We still do.

Doing anything else would get extremely

ALEXANDRA
I could.

No, I mean other than that. In

ALEXANDRA
No, Jesus, I'm not using.
MATT
Not at all? I smell pot all the time

ALEXANDRA
That's Sid.
MATT
So you just stopped?
Really?
ALEXANDRA
Look, Dad, it's no big deal. Kids do
drugs and they stop. Unless they're

boarding school, remember? I couldn't
get anything anymore. So no, I'm not
doing any drugs. But I still think
they're fun. Okay, maybe a little pot

You want to know what really pisses me
off? That she wouldn't end it. Not
even when she knew she was busted. How
are we supposed to feel about that?
MATT
I guess she really liked him.
ALEXANDRA
So how are we going to find this guy,
Sherlock?
MATT
Right. Well, why don't you two take
Scottie to the beach? I'm going to

Everything's just one degree of

her suit as she stomps toward the water.
ALEXANDRA
Any luck?
MATT
The hotels were a dead end, but I took
another shot with his office. He's
definitely in Hanalei renting a house
somewhere -- probably one of those
cottages around the bay. Who wants to
go for a walk?
SID
Sounds good.
Matt grimaces -- not whom he was hoping for.
Alex ties the
straps of her bikini and flips over.
ALEXANDRA
Yeah, let's go. Scottie!

Our friends weave their way among BEACH-GOERS. Matt has
thought to bring along a print-out of Brian Speer's PHOTO,
which he and Alex glance at discreetly. Sid trails behind.
SCOTTIE
(catching up to Matt)
Can we swim with the sharks? I read in
the hotel magazine how they put you in
a cage in the ocean and throw shark
feed in the water and sharks swim right
up to you. Can we do that?

SCOTTIE
How'd you and Mom meet?
MATT
I was with a law school buddy from the
mainland, and I took him to the club.
We were just coming in from paddling,
and your mom was on her way out, and
she looked at me and said, "Do you
think it's going to snow today?" We
all got beers when she came back in. I
had already seen her around. That was
it. I got her number.
SCOTTIE
Did you think she was pretty?
MATT
She knocked me out.
SCOTTIE
What do you love about her?
MATT
I love... I don't know. The way we are
with each other, most of the time,
anyway. I love how she's more capable
of feeling joy than anyone I've ever
known. I just like being with her,
just riding bikes or going out to
dinner, even if it's just a plate lunch
at Rainbow's. Years ago we used to do
a lot of paddling together.
ALEXANDRA
Can we drop this? Jesus.

"What do you love about Mom, Daddy?"
Shut up, already.

Your mom got chased by a shark once.
Very close call.
ALEXANDRA
When was that?
MATT
We were on Moloka'i with Mark and Kai,
and your mom was out surfing and saw a
shark right beneath her on a wave.
Like right beneath her. She got down
on her stomach and started paddling
like crazy, and this big fin kept
following her. She even paddled up
onto the nearest rocks instead of all
the way to shore. Got cuts all over
her legs and hands. Only time I ever
saw your mother scared, and she was
really scared. She even threw up.
Crying and shaking. I had to hold her
for a long time.
She really thought
she was going to die. Of course she
hid all that from the Mitchells, turned
it into a funny "Me-versus-a-shark"
story. I told her...
ALEXANDRA
Yeah?
MATT
I told her it wasn't her time yet.
They continue in silence a few moments.
SCOTTIE
I wish Mom was here.

The sun is now very low on the horizon as our friends make

but makes a good effort.
ANOTHER GUY jogs toward Matt wearing a "Stanford Lacrosse" T-

stops short -- the door opens again, and out comes a
beautiful WOMAN in a white bathing suit and white sun hat.
Then two LITTLE BOYS.
Fucker's got a family.

you can think of an excuse to leave.
ALEXANDRA
You must be good at that.
MATT
You can be alone with her to say
goodbye or whatever you want. Do you
hear what I'm saying?

Brian seems deeply lost in his own thoughts.
Then --
BRIAN SPEER
Okay, look, I can't have you here.
You
understand.
Julie returns with wine for Matt and a soda for Alex.
JULIE
Here we go.
(noticing)
Everyone's so serious. Please don't
tell me you're talking about business.
ALEXANDRA
We're talking about love.
JULIE
That's nice. Brian, call the boys in
for dinner.
BRIAN SPEER
They're fine. Let them play a while
longer.
They all stand there a moment. Matt's unsure how to play
this out. He shoots a quick panicked look at Alex, who
scrambles to keep the ball rolling.
ALEXANDRA
Awesome cottage you're renting.
MATT
Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location. I
used to come here as a kid before it
was a vacation rental. Alex, your
great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian
built it back in the 20s. Haven't been
inside in years.
JULIE
Come on.
We'll give you a tour.
ALEXANDRA
Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad
a little walk down memory lane, and
Julie and I can chat out here.
MATT
Yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind.
Just a quick look.

it for him.

Matt swings the screen door open. Alex sits with Julie.
Skylar and Colt are still running around the yard.
MATT
Yeah, great, all remodeled, new
appliances. Nice. Alex, we should be
getting back.
JULIE
Well, hey, thanks for stopping by.
Really nice to meet you both. Maybe
we'll see you at the beach tomorrow.

Yeah, maybe.
After Alex and Julie share a quick kiss goodbye -- a common
custom in Hawaii -- Julie turns to Matt.
Matt leans in, but instead of going for her cheek, he kisses
her FULLY ON THE LIPS.
He pulls away, and they exchange a brief, vaguely erotic
look. Then he turns away and into the night.

Matt and the kids sit in a sort of vigil. Alex and Scottie
read books, Matt has brought some paperwork, Sid reads a
magazine.
Elizabeth emits a SIGH.
All look up a moment before looking
back down.

Matt's PHONE VIBRATES.
Checking the caller ID -- HUGH KING --
he opts not to answer.
The door opens, and Elizabeth's brother BARRY THORSON
accompanies his parents Scott and Alice into the room.
SCOTT THORSON
Here we are.
(to Scottie)
Hi, Bingo. Alex.
Cheerful Alice doesn't really get what's going on.
An
emotional Barry hugs Matt and the girls.
SCOTT THORSON (CONT'D)
(eyeing Sid)
There you are again.
Matt and Alex maneuver seats for the Thorsons to sit near the
bed. Barry gets his mother situated, then takes a seat
himself.
Remaining on his feet, old Scott surveys his daughter from a
distance.
SCOTT THORSON (CONT'D)
So what did you decide?
MATT
There's not much left to decide. We're
just sort of playing it by ear and
making sure she's comfortable.
SCOTT THORSON
I mean what did you decide about the
buyer? Who's your buyer?
Even Sid and his daughters perk up at this question.
Matt is
taken aback.
SCOTT THORSON (CONT'D)
How much are you getting?
BARRY THORSON
Dad, I'm sure you'll be able to read
about it in the paper.
SCOTT THORSON
I don't need to read about it.
I can
hear about it right now.

MATT
Scott, let's not talk about that here.
It's not the time for that.
SCOTT THORSON
All the same to you, I guess. A
million here, a million there. Just
ironic, that's all -- Elizabeth coming
into this misfortune just as you're
coming into a fortune. She gave you
everything, Matt. A good, happy home,
two beautiful daughters.
Matt looks to Barry for help, but Barry's silence and
sheepish look imply he buys into his father's propaganda.
MATT
Scott, what's your point?
SCOTT THORSON
She wanted her own boat. She should
have had her own boat, one she would
have been familiar with.
MATT
She wasn't even driving! Her boat,
someone else's boat -- it wouldn't have
made any difference. You're not going
to blame me for this.
SCOTT THORSON
Sure, sure, quibble about the details.
She was a faithful, devoted wife. She
deserved more.
Why fight it?
MATT
You're right. She deserved more.
SID
For Christ's sake, take it easy on the
man.
Scott turns to Sid like he's about to pop him again.
ALEXANDRA
My father has been doing a really
amazing job under the circumstances.
His point made, Scott looks at Matt and the girls and
shuffles to Elizabeth's bedside, puts his hands on Alice's
shoulder.

Matt turns off the highway and into a long driveway.

Matt walks around the property alone, taking it in and
thinking. Like everywhere in Hawai'i, the nature here is

Matt plops heavily into a chair on the lanai.

It's the same angle but now with FORTY KING COUSINS gathered
for the poll. We recognize some faces.
CLOSER --
Amid drinks held aloft, a CALABASH is passed among the
cousins into which the each places a folded BALLOT.
Matt sits watching the proceedings with Cousin Hugh, Cousin
Six and another ELDERLY COUSIN at a table piled with papers
and contracts.
MATT
Elizabeth's not doing well.

She'll be okay. She's a fighter.

Matt, Hugh and Six FINISH THE COUNT while others mill about,

group of DISSENTERS off to one side.
COUSIN HUGH
Well, no surprise. Other than the
holdouts who don't want to sell at all,
it's Don Holitzer. Chicago group a
distant second. Feels good.
We're doing the right thing, Mattie.
At least there ain't going to be any
Wal-Mart. Now it's your call, and
we're all behind you, most of us
anyway.
(handing him a pen)
Go ahead, Captain. Make it official.
MATT
It's strange, that's all.
COUSIN HUGH
What's strange?
MATT
We didn't do anything to own that land.
It was entrusted to us. And now we're
just...
Hugh and Six exchange a concerned look.
For a moment we go
VERY CLOSE on Matt's eyes. Then --
MATT (CONT'D)
I can't do it. I won't do it.
I'm not
going to sign.
COUSIN HUGH
What're you doing, Matt? I mean, we
know you have a lot on your plate right
now, but you're not going to fuck this
up for us. It's over. If we don't
sell now, it'll be a mess when the
trust dissolves. Just sign, go to your
wife, done.

I don't want it to go to Holitzer. I

COUSIN SIX
For Christ's sake. We can't move
without your approval. And we don't
want to.
Hugh tries forcing Matt's hand.
Matt resists.
COUSIN HUGH
Your head's not right, Mattie. Your
head's not right. You want a couple
days to think it over? Take a couple
days.
MATT
I don't need a couple days. I have the
authority, and this is what I want. I
haven't wanted something in a long
time. We have other businesses we're
converting to corporations. We can
figure it out.
COUSIN SIX
But it's utterly unproductive land. It
doesn't generate enough income to pay
the goddamn taxes.
COUSIN HUGH
You're the trustee. You know better
than anyone we only have seven years
left.
MATT
Then I have seven years to figure out
how to keep it.
Cousin Hugh draws a long breath, looks up at the sky, then
back at Matt.
COUSIN HUGH
We'll come after you. Just because
you're a lawyer doesn't mean the rest
of us would be afraid to come after
you. But nobody wants to do that.
We're family.

People will be relieved, Hugh, the
whole state. I sign that document,
it's over. End of the line. Something
that was ours to protect will be gone.
Even though we're haole as shit and go
to private schools and clubs and can't
even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian,
we still carry Hawaiian blood, and
we're still tied to this land. And our
children are tied to this land. It's a
miracle that for whatever bullshit
reason 150 years ago, we own this much
of... paradise, but we do. And for
whatever bullshit reason now, I'm the
trustee. And I'm not signing. And if
you sue me, it'll only make us closer.
Cousin Hugh releases a long breath more like a belch, quickly
picks his nose, exchanges a look with Cousin Six. Then he
brings his fingers to his mouth to WHISTLE.
COUSIN HUGH
All right, everybody, listen up.
Cousin Mattie has an announcement.
Get

Scottie does so. Alexandra takes the box reverently -- she

up.

She opens the box and pulls out a scoop of ashes, which

Scottie looks at unblinking. Alex looks to Matt, who gives

her the go-ahead, and without further ceremony pours them

into the sea.

THE ASHES
