      Flight Attendant ROSE locks the service cart and checks on 
      her First Class passengers.

                                    CAPTAIN REDFERN (V.O.)
                    We want to thank you for flying 
                    Regis Air and encourage that you 
                    ask us about any connecting gate 
                      information you may need.

      The service area phone RINGS.  Rose picks it up.  A panicked 
      voice.






                                                                              (CONTINUED)              THE STRAIN #101 8th rev. 09/14/13 (Full 2nd Yellow)   2.

                          (from phone)
                    Rose, get back here.  Now.  I need 
                    your help.

                    -- Now.  Come now!!

      She hangs up and moves through.

      GABRIEL BOLIVAR (30) -- long-haired and speed-thin, a 
      brooding yet charismatic rock star -- working on his TABLET.

                                  ROSE
                    Sir?  We are about to land.  Sir?

      He barely acknowledges her -- hands over three empty Vodka 
      nips, then finishes a fourth.

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                    Would you... power down your 
                    device?

                                    BOLIVAR
                     Device ? You people call this a 
                       device ... 

                                  ROSE
                    You have to turn it off...

      Rose locks eyes with him.  She knows the type, she s dealt 
      with it before.  She picks up his drinks.  Takes them away.  
      She notices that the top buttons on his pants are undone for 
      comfort. 

                                    BOLIVAR
                    ...And you call a drink a 
                       beverage ?  That s like when a cop 
                    calls a car a  vehicle  or when he 
                    calls you  sir  when he means 
                       asshole. 

      Hands Rose the TABLET: A POSTER.

      Rose looks at the graphics: SERENADE FOR THE ECLIPSE.  
      BOLIVAR.  An illustration depicts Bolivar with full on WHITE 
      MAKE-UP and WHITE BRIGHT CONTACT LENSES.

      He lowers his glasses: ta-da!

      Bolivar grins and buttons up.


      MAIN CABIN1616

      Rose emerges into the cramped cabin.  Most PASSENGERS are 
      rising from slumber.  Lights start TURNING ON.

      Rose spots male Flight Attendant PETER at the very end of the 
      cabin.  He looks at her and motions for her to approach.

      As she heads there...

                                  ROSE
                    Ma am...  Ma am?  Seat backs in the 
                    upright position.

      JOAN LUSS (40) is a seasoned air traveler, miffed at having 
      to fly  cattle.  

                                  JOAN
                    Finally.  Longest flight in 
                    history.

      She hands Rose her coffee CUP, NAPKINS, water BOTTLE and *
      PEANUTS.  She is fastidious and standoffish.*

                                  JOAN (CONT D)*
                    It s the last time I fly your *

                    Are we landing now?

      EMMA ARNOT (8) is travelling alone with an  UNACCOMPANIED 
      MINOR  sticker on her chest.  Earphones in.  Listening to 
      music.  In her hands a bright RED RUBBER BALL.*

      Rose secures a small winged PIN on the girl s dress and moves 
      on.

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                    Sir, please turn all electronics

                      Absolutely.

      ANSEL BARBOUR (35), wiry and bespectacled, awakes tangled in 
      headphone and power wires.  He has a SLIDE RULER and 
      schematics in his iPad. He tosses away an empty chip bag, 
      ready for landing...

      Rose looks up at Peter --

      -- who is gesturing for her to hurry up.  Something s really 
      wrong.

      Emma straightens her pin and smiles, several teeth missing.

      Peter pulls Rose further into the galley, away from the 
      passengers.

                                  PETER
                    There s something in the plane.

                                  PETER
                    Inside the plane.  Something alive, 
                    in the cargo hold.  

                                  ROSE
                    What the hell do you mean?  Like a

                                  PETER
                    No.  Something really, really big.

                    moving.

      Peter pulls her down, to her knees.  Forces her to put her 
      palms flat on the flat surface of a trapdoor on the floor.

      Rose opens the trapdoor and --*

      He goes to embrace Kelly, who deftly avoids his kiss.  She 
      shows him her Blackberry.

                                  KELLY
                    I texted you.  Five times.

      Eph sits in his chair, setting his mobile phone face down on 
      the table -- ready to go.

                    I was driving...
                          (for Therapist s benefit)

                                  THERAPIST 
                    Dr. Goodweather, this is the last 
                    of six court-appointed custody 
                      counselling sessions.  You ve been

                                  EPH
                    Five minutes is not late, not in

                    You re going to tell me I m late 
                    because I don t want to be here -- 
                    and I think you may be on to 
                    something -- but I have a really 
                    good reason.

                    come in, you try to take over the

                                  EPH
                    Because I have control issues, I 
                    know that.  But the fact is -- I 
                    need to defend myself because this 
                    is my last chance -- and I ve 
                    thought long and hard.  And I know 
                    I m the bad guy here -- but why?  
                    Because I don t want out of my 
                    marriage.  Because I want things 
                    back the way they were.

      Kelly wrestles her hand free.

                                  KELLY
                    This isn t just about you.  What 
                    you want.  Not anymore.

      Eph takes notice of a strange, new assertiveness from Kelly.

                                  EPH
                    I am an epidemiologist.  I take the *

      In silence, the Therapist writes a note or two.

      At the same time, a HUMMING noise interrupts.  Eph s mobile 
      phone VIBRATES on the table.  Eph ignores it, sitting back, 
      exaggeratedly giving Kelly his full and undivided attention.

                                  KELLY
                    You have an important job, Ephraim.  
                    You are great at your job.  You get

      The Therapist scribbles.

                    present.  And in heart and mind -- 
                    absent.  Most of the time.

      Eph starts to argue... then closes his mouth.  What he s 
      doing obviously isn t working, so he tries a different tack.

                                  THERAPIST 
                    I think what Kelly is saying is 
                    that you still are unwilling to put 
                    your family and their needs first.

                                  EPH
                    I gave up drinking.  I kicked it -- 
                    with one slip-up -- and that was 
                    over a year ago...  You wanted time 
                    apart 
                    -- so I moved out.  Against my own 
                    wishes.  I ve jumped through every 
                    hoop.  Tell me what you need.

      After a long pause -- Kelly looks straight into his eyes.

                                  KELLY
                    You say you want our marriage to 
                    work.  But really you only want us 
                    together for Zack.  And so do I...*
                          (on Eph s excitement)
                    ...but that s not enough anymore.  
                    Our time apart has only clarified 
                    things for me... allowing me to 
                    make room in my life for Matt.  
                    We re going to be living together 
                    now, and--

      Kelly stares at him until... he gets it.

                                  EPH
                    Matt?  The Sears guy...?  My house?

                    And you know what?  He gets 
                    straight  A  s at his job, too.  
                    But at home he is present.  Unlike 
                    you, he is always here.  For both 
                    of us.

    Eph is growing enraged.  Trying hard not to explode.  
      Realizing...

      ABRAHAM SETRAKIAN is older than 80, but his extraordinary 
      life -- one of unimaginable trauma and occasional magic -- 
      has left him with the vigor of a man ten years younger.  He 
      eats a BOWL of soup.  SLICES a piece of BREAD.

      Near him, the local NY1 news plays on a small portable TV.

                                    CRISPIN
                    Hey, man, we hear you buy silver.  
                    Without a receipt.  S that right? 

                                  SETRAKIAN
                    I always have a need for good 
                    silver, yes...

                    I want to get fifty on this.

      Crispin hands him an expensive WRISTWATCH, band broken.  
      Setrakian studies it with gnarled, arthritic hands -- 
      examining the underside, shaking it, holding it to his ear.

                                  SETRAKIAN
                    A very nice timepiece, indeed.  I 
                    see that the band links snapped.  
                    You must have been in a hurry, 
                    taking it off.

      Crispin stares at the old man.

                                    CRISPIN
                    Something like that.  So, can you 
                    give me fifty, man?

                                  SETRAKIAN
                    I can offer you maybe twenty-five.  
                    If the test is good.

      Setrakian reaches for an eye-dropper next to THREE $20 BILLS 
      near the TV inside the cage.  The Homies exchange glances.

      Setrakian drips a bit of nitric acid on the back of the 
      watch.  The surface SIZZLES and turns BLUE-GREEN.  He pushes 
      the watch back to them, not surprised.

                      Unfortunately, this is merely 
                      silver-plated brass.  A cheap 
                    Eastern Europe knock-off.

      He chews on his bread.  Crispin reaches inside the cage for 
      the three $20 bills.

                    bone of your wrist, it s called the 
                    Lunate.  Not that you care, but one 
                    needs to learn something every day.  
                    Now the important thing is I can 
                    control your entire body weight 
                    from that pressure point.  And this 
                    knife is pointed straight at your 
                    radial artery.  By the time he 
                    clears his coat pocket, your artery 
                    will be punctured and sliced wide 
                    open, top to bottom.  You fall 
                    down, bleeding, I go under the 
                    counter and your friend starts 
                    shooting at an empty space, I can 
                    guarantee you this: you will bleed 
                    out before the 911 operator answers 
                    the phone.  That is option one.  
                    Option two is you release these 
                    bills, you partner gives me the *
                    gun, he can keep the bullets, and *
                    you leave this store.  Now, son, *
                    you have a choice.  What is it 
                    going to be?

      Short Homie s hand is deep in his coat pocket.  Crispin s 
      face is wracked with pain, eyes bulging.  A TENSE MOMENT... *

      Crispin RELEASES the bills.  Homie releases the loader, puts *
      the gun in the counter.*

                                  SETRAKIAN (CONT D)
                    Is there anything else I can do for 
                    you gentleman this evening?

      Setrakian nods to Short Homie to back off, which he does.  
      Then he releases Crispin s arm... and they QUICKLY EXIT.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    THE STRAIN #101 15th rev. 10/30/13 (3rd Gold)   23.

      Setrakian turns his attention to the bills, which landed next 
      to the small TV screen.  A MALE NY1 NEWS ANCHOR speaks at a 
      desk before an angled, open laptop.  The familiar NY1 chyron 
      in the lower left corner gives the time -- 9:22 -- and the 
      temp -- 25 degrees.  Crawl:  JFK ON ALERT AS BERLIN AIRPLANE 
      GOES DARK AFTER LANDING. 

      He sets down the dagger and turns up the volume.

      INSERT footage of the darkened Regis Air jet on the taxiway.

                                  NY1 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    ...We have more news on this 
                      developing story out of JFK Airport 
                    tonight.  You are looking at live 
                    footage of the airplane -- 
                      identified as a Regis Air wide body 
                    jet originating out of Berlin -- 
                    that shut down just moments after 
                    landing.  We are told there has 
                    been no communication from the 
                    pilot, and all attempts to contact 
                    the flight crew inside the aircraft 
                    have been unsuccessful.  Federal *
                    and location agencies are on the *
                    scene, including officials from the *
                    Port Authority and the *
                      Transportation Security 
                      Administration.  The airport has 
                    not been evacuated at this time, 
                    and no word yet what sort of impact 
                    this incident will have on air 
                    travel into and out of New York...

      Setrakian is transfixed by this bizarre image.  It speaks to 
      him.  He sees something beyond a mysterious landing.

      His sure hands begin to TREMBLE SLIGHTLY as the look in his 
      eyes tells us: he knows something.  Something evil.

                                  SETRAKIAN
                    No.  No.

      He slides a mirror on the wall and opens a steel door.

      One flight down from his shop, Setrakian enters breathlessly, 
      alone -- 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    THE STRAIN #101 15th rev. 10/30/13 (3rd Gold)   24.

      ARTIFACTS and WEAPONS everywhere.  Shelves groan under 
      leather-bound BOOKS, which also rise from STACKS on the 
      floor.  Ancient MIRRORS of all shapes and sizes reflect the 
      old man many times as he moves to his parlor.

      He dismantles the gun even without looking -- like a soldier.  
      Tosses the pieces on a metal SCRAP PILE full of gun parts.  *
      He s stymied more than a few attempted robberies.*

      On a pedestal table stands an object under a DRAPE of black 
      silk.  Setrakian unveils a large GLASS SPECIMEN JAR.  Inside 
      the jar, suspended in a dusky fluid, is a HUMAN HEART.  The 
      heart is FAINTLY THROBBING -- as though agitated.  Setrakian 
      recognizes this.  A terrible confirmation.  He understands.

                                  SETRAKIAN
                    He is here.

      Setrakian sits down.  He is agitated.  He grimaces for a *
      moment, feels his chest.  He fishes a PILL BOTTLE out of his *
      jacket with his heart medication.  He takes a pill.  Puts it *
      away.*

      Then Setrakian looks over at the beating heart.  He removes *
      the jar s cover.  With a PENKNIFE, he slices open a small 
      scar in his fingertip -- feeding a few drops of blood into 
      the fluid...  A worm-like TENTACLE shoots out of the heart, 
      DEVOURING the blood... the lonely muscle PALPITATING with new 
      strength...

                    This time, dear... I will not

      Eph and Nora inside a cramped HAZMAT tent erected on the

      Nora s reaction is first shock... then, briefly, happiness... 
      then, dutifully censoring herself, concern.

      They pull their astronaut-like contact suits from a rack and 
      begin to climb into them.

      Through the open door the team enters the plane.

      Eph and Nora look at the passengers...

      All of whom are seated...

      All of whom appear peaceful and still...

      All of whom... are DEAD.

      Staring eyes GLOW unblinkingly, reflecting light sources.

      Nora leans over the console between the two seats.  CAPTAIN 
      REDFERN (50), whose folksy voice we heard earlier, is slumped 
      forward, his hat in his lap.

      Nora eases the Captain s head back.  She examines his open

      SUPER: STONEHEART GROUP, 156 WEST 57th STREET, MANHATTAN

      Employees vacate the buidling as MR. FITZWILLIAM (30), an 
      armoire of a man, wearing a heavy, full-length coat guides a 
      thin, Aryan man, THOMAS EICHHORST (perpetually 40), through 
      the lobby and into an elevator.



      Eichhorst s gaunt cheeks are rouged, his hair a wig.  His 
      accent is German, though his voice emerges strangely from his 
      too-red lips.  His appearance is due less to vanity than 
      perversity.  (Note: Eichhorst s lips don t always sync up 
      perfectly with his German voice.)

      This is ELDRITCH PALMER (70), the world s third-richest-man.  
      He lies in a hospital bed in a hermetically-sealed room.

      It s so cold in here, his FAINT BREATH is visible.  His naked 
      chest is criss-crossed by a pattern of surgical scars.

      FOOTSTEPS approach: Mr. Fitzwilliam and Eichhorst.

                                  MR. FITZWILLIAM
                    Mr. Palmer, Herr Eichhorst wishes 
                    to pay his respects.

      The door opens.  FOOTSTEPS approach: lighter than before.

                                  PALMER
                    You may notice how chilly it has 
                    gotten in here, Eichhorst.  Twenty 
                    full degrees cooler than the rest 
                    of the building.
                          (beat)
                    But not too cold for you, I trust?

      Eichhorst doesn t answer.  His icy blue eyes and white-blond 
      hair confer him an Aryan superiority.

                                  PALMER (CONT D)
                    Of course not.  It can t be too 
                    cold for you -- can it?

      Palmer pushes buttons which elevate his bed and open the 
      curtains behind it -- REVEALING A SPECTACULAR VIEW OF 
      MANHATTAN.

                                  PALMER (CONT D)
                    But to me this is vital.  The cold 
                    slows tissue death.  That is all we 
                    are, you know, no matter how rich, 
                    no matter how powerful --
                          (he smiles)
                    -- from the moment we are born, we *
                    are dying. *

      He points at some JARS on a shelf.  His own organs rest 
      inside them, preserved in formaldehyde.

                                  PALMER (CONT D)*
                    We are only human...*

                    The cargo has arrived safely.  And 
                    the four survivors have been found.  
                    As planned.

      Palmer grins icily yet with some regret.

                                  PALMER
                      Throughout my life I have learned 
                    what it feels to cross a line -- to 
                    do things -- things that cannot be 
                    undone.

      He looks at Eichhorst.

                                  PALMER (CONT D)
                    That line -- it has been crossed *
                    now, hasn t it?

      Eichhorst nods and looks out at the nighttime city.

                                  EICHHORST
                    I look out upon this island and I 
                    savor what is to come.  Purity.

                                  PALMER
                    I find it somewhat comforting that 
                    something as powerful as Him needs 
                    our help in doing something so 
                    simple: crossing the river.

                                  EICHHORST
                    Even he is bound by rules...

      Hold on Palmer and Eichhorst... long enough for us to notice 
      that breath steams out of Palmers mouth...

      ...but none emerges from Eichhorst s.

                                  PALMER
                    Your breath.  I ll never get used 
                    to...

      He points at Eichhorst s mouth.

                                  EICHHORST
                    Yes, even I miss breathing

      The HAZMAT guys finish wrapping and sealing the coffin.  
      Bishop s on the phone nearby.

      Bishop comes close to the coffin, studying its carvings, 
      and...

      ...listening.

      We hear it now, too... a THRUMMING sound... but faint... and 
      not coming from the coffin --

      Bishop stops a passing HAZMAT Worker.

      He moves on.  Bishop tries to make out the sound s source...

      It s not the coffin.  At once, he starts across the hangar.

      Rows and rows of STORAGE BINS.  As Bishop explores -- the 
      noise GROWS MORE DISTINCT, like a basso chorus of voices, 
      churning.

      Here, the noise is its LOUDEST... but still no visible 
      source.  As Bishop stands still, filled with the droning 
      noise...

      ...he notices a MOUND OF RAGS in the corner.

      The mound is TWITCHING.

      Bishop edges closer to the corner, trying to make out the 
      movement among the rags, when...

      ...the pile ARTICULATES, and A GREAT FORM RISES UP, taking 
      shape... vague... horrible...

      Seven feet in height... broad, cloaked... or winged???

      We never fully see THE MASTER -- but we sense his strength, 
      his speed, his power... as from deep within the Master s 
      throat, A VEINOUS, MUSCULAR STINGER STRIKES AT BISHOP S NECK.

      Just a flash of it.  The shock is: no fangs.  Something far, 
      far worse...

      Barely a CROAK escapes Bishop s obstructed throat.

                                  BISHOP
                      URRGH...!!!

      As he is taken... his ARM VEINS SHRIVEL AND COLLAPSE like an 
      emptied Capri Sun juice pouch....  Blood accumulates around 
      the stinger, which filters it, engorged and pulsating.

      ...until his head is ROTATED WITH A SICKENING CRACK.

      Bishop hits the ground, head facing south, body facing north.

      Then the Master slams his massive, open palm against the 
      head, repeatedly, crushing it, flattening it with a sickening 
      crunch!!

      And the cloaked figure withdraws... CRAWLING BACKWARDS LIKE  
      A SPIDER into the dark!!!

      REPORTERS and CAMERAS.  The press.  They see Eph and

                    This is my daughter.  My daughter.  
                    And I just want to see her again.  
                    Dead, alive.  Don t you have kids 
                    of your own?  Don t you have a 
                    heart?

      Eph takes this all in.  He sees the hurt in this father.  It 
      moves him.

                    can do.  But you have my word.

      Eph ignores the Reporters  questions, making his way past 
      Barnes to the exit...



      Setrakian sits on a gurney, watching the press conference 
      break up on TV...  He reviews the list of passengers nearby 
      at a REGIS TABLE.  He takes one of the copies, folds it in 
      two and pockets it. 

      Jim talks to the PARAMEDICS, then to Setrakian.

                                  JIM
                    Okay, all right.  So... your 
                    condition is real.  You have a well-

      SUPER: OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER
       EAST 30TH STREET, MANHATTAN

      HAZMAT Workers move about in the background, still setting up 
      tables and equipment, loading in bodies.

      DR. BENNETT (35), a medically obese man wearing a plastic 
      safety shield mask, works over the FEMALE CORPSE laid out 
      upon a table of stainless steel, neck arched over a metal 
      block.  His iPad FaceTime RINGS.  It s Eph and Nora ON 
      SCREEN.

      Bennett uncovers a couple of corpses, still dressed,  
      including that of Emma Arnot.  He covers her again.

                                  DR. BENNETT
                    Jesus.  Goodweather, what are you 
                    doing to me?

                                  EPH (SCREEN)
                    Tell me what you know.

                                  DR. BENNETT
                    I m just getting into it here, 
                    haven t started cutting them yet.

                                  EPH (SCREEN)
                    Give me anything you have.

      Dr. Bennett stands his iPad on a wheeled tray in order to 
      demonstrate to Eph and Nora what he has found.  He connects 
      it to a pair of laparoscopic cameras.

                                  DR. BENNETT
                    Okay, top of the charts -- can you 
                    see this here?

      He parts the flesh of her neck with gloved fingers -- 
      revealing A NEAT INCISION just a few centimeters long.

                                  EPH (SCREEN)
                    Yes.  What is that?*

                                  DR. BENNETT
                    It s an incision.  Deep enough to *
                    puncture one wall of the carotid 
                    artery without rupturing it.  *

                    thing.*



      Eph and Nora standing still now, absolutely riveted by the 
      visual on the screen in Eph s hand.

                                  EPH
                    You re saying other passengers have

                    Or puncture, yes.  All the ones 
                    I ve looked at so far.

      Eph and Nora look at each other -- then resume walking, fast.

                                  DR. BENNETT (SCREEN) (CONT D)
                    There is one other intriguing 
                      abnormality...  



      Dr. Bennett selects a big #6 blade scalpel.  He sets a steel 
      pan beneath the corpse s hand, turns its wrist -- and SLICES.

      What spills out of the vein and into the pan is NOT BLOOD -- 
      at least, not as we know it.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  THE STRAIN #101 11th rev. 09/22/13 (3rd Blue)   55A.

      As they arrive back at the Quarantine Station, Eph ends the 
      call.  Nora shares his disbelief.  Jim approaches with 
      Setrakian.

                                  JIM

      Eph stops.  Setrakian has his attention... but not his belief.

      Eph and Nora inspect the now-empty CARGO AREA in Hazmat 1

                    How did that old man know about the

      They look at it through the box.  Nora moves her hand up *
      against the box.  The worm lunges for her hand, struggling to *
      get to it, undaunted by the Plexiglass box.  She pulls her *

      Eph and Nora hurry into the warehouse.  NTSB INVESTIGATORS 
      are SARAN WRAP-SEALING the luggage and cargo.

      Eph and Nora see the same items as before -- the luggage, 
      kayak and golf clubs, plasma TVs, crates...

      ...but the floor space where the cabinet was is EMPTY.

      Eph goes to a nearby NTSB INVESTIGATOR.

                                  EPH
                    Where d you take that cabinet?

      He does.  The timecode passes more slowly... but the cabinet 
      still vanishes.

                    There must be a gap.  A cut.

      He runs it again.  Same thing.  But this time, Eph sees 
      something else.

      The Site Foreman stops playback.  Just missed it.  He goes 
      back a few frames...

      There it is: a dark figure -- a BLUR -- just on the right 
      edge of the screen.

                    pounds.  What can lift it up like 
                    that?

      He plays it again.  A few frames after the dark blur appears, 
      the cabinet vanishes.  Nora straightens.

      He puts on a pair of SURGICAL GLOVES.  He feels something *

      It is HUMMING.

      Nearby is ripped BIOHAZARD plastic and seals.  Gus opens the

      Dr. Bennett moves to a MALE CORPSE with a  Y  forensic 
      incision sewed up.  He pulls over a UV light unit and turns 
      it on.

      The black light reveals a substructure made of glowing 
      capillary worms.  A fleshy, obscenely animated map of 
      wriggling patterns.

      Then, on the standing tray, a soft, squishy sound.

      Plip.

                    What the...?

      The heart beats in the tray with the fluid, the surface 
      RIPPLES.  Dr. Bennett turns for a closer look.

      Plip.

      SOMETHING MOVED inside the heart, below the fluid.

      He pulls down another specimen jar, pouring half the oily 
       blood  into it, then setting down both jars side-by-side.

      After a moment -- twin ripples.  Plip.  Plip.

      Fascinated, he looks even closer...

      Behind him, just out of focus, one of the corpses SLOWLY SITS 
      ERECT.

      The heart explodes with worm activity, festooned by them.  
      Hungry, searching.  They twist their way into the fat 
      doctor s arm.

      One of them wiggles under his skin, through the glove, 
      drawing blood.  He screams and rips off the glove. 

      Three more CORPSES -- all in different stages of autopsy -- 
      stand up and advance, slowly coming into focus...

      Dr. Bennett catches the worm by its tail, yanking it off.  It 
      wiggles into his finger.  Overturning a tray of instruments, 
      he grabs a pair of pliers and yanks it loose.  Bleeding 
      through the perforation, he throws the worm in a jar...

      Panting, he bends to pick up the fallen surgical instruments.*

                    At one time...

      The cop opens a cell.  Setrakian enters.  TWO DRUNKEN GUYS 
      are there.

                                  SETRAKIAN (CONT D)
                    How soon may I leave?

                                  ROOKIE COP
                    Well... nothing happens until 
                    morning, when charges are filed.  
                    It s almost dawn now.

      Hot and sweaty in here.  Setrakian unbuttons his sleeve, *
      rolling back the cuff to reveal, on his left forearm, an old 
      tattoo.

      Six black numbers: 230385.

                                  DRUNK GUY #1
                    That s some ancient ink you got 
                    there, old man.  What s that?  
                    Numbers?

                                  SETRAKIAN
                    Yes.  Numbers.

                                  DRUNK GUY #1
                    Mean anything?

      Setrakian looks past the man.

                                  SETRAKIAN
                    Only to me.

      Gus pulls out his phone while driving and dials.

                    just checking in...  Crispin 
                    home...?



      SUPER: EAST 115TH STREET, HARLEM, MANHATTAN

      Gus s mother, GUADALUPE, a kind, old Mexican woman, speaks 
      quietly on the phone.  In the background, Crispin blobs out 
      on the sofa, channel surfing blindly.

                                  GUADALUPE
                    He is.  Bendito Dios.  At least 
                    he s here, where I can watch him.

                                    CRISPIN
                    Is that Gus, mama?*

                                  GUADALUPE
                    Si.*
                          (to Gus)*
                    I m making him breakfast.*

      Gus frowns at that answer.  On the seat next to him are the 
      copies of his, his mother s, and his brother s IDs.

                                  GUS
                          (into phone)
                    I m crossing the bridge now...  
                    I ll be home in an hour -- Mama?  
                    Te quiero.

                                  GUADALUPE
                          (into phone)
                    I love you, too, m ijito.

      He hangs up, tucks the phone in his jacket, lights a 
      cigarette and smiles.

                                  GUS
                          (to himself)
                    Damn.  Life is good.
                          (looks back)
                    Hey, whatever you are, you re 
                    bringing me good luck!!

      SUPER: TUDOR ROAD, JAMAICA ESTATES, QUEENS*

      Gary Arnot returns to his home.  Exhausted, emotionally *
      drained, he sets Emma s framed portrait on the kitchen table, *
      along with some bullshit  Regis Air  paperwork.*

      The house is silent.  His only daughter is gone forever.*

      Then a BREEZE stirs the paperwork on the table.  Gary looks *
      up, chilled suddenly.  Is there a window open?*

      A RED RUBBER BALL rolls along the floor to his shoe.*

      Gary picks up the ball.  Recognizes it.  Is he going crazy?*

                                  EMMA ARNOT (O.S.)*
                          (in French, subtitled)*
                    Daddy...*

      Gary RUSHES to the back door -- which is OPEN.*

      Emma stands in the shadows, just outside the door.  Wearing *
      the same dress, dirty now.  Her eyes stare vacantly, as *
      though in deep shock...*

                                  EMMA ARNOT (CONT D)*
                          (in French, subtitled)*
                    Daddy... I m so cold.*
